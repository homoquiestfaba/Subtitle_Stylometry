1
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,517
I was set down from the carrier's cart,

2
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:02,003
and there,
with a sense of bewilderment and terror,

3
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,356
my life in the village began.

4
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,557
For the first time in my life,

5
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:08,996
I was out of the sight of humans.

6
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,958
For the first time in my life,

7
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:15,398
I was alone in a world whose behaviour
I could neither predict nor fathom.

8
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:19,486
I was lost
and I did not expect to be found again.

9
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,158
Come on, little Lol.

10
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,357
There's redcurrants,
right from the bushes.

11
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,967
Come down now
and we'll stuff you with currants.

12
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,485
One, two...

13
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,802
Our house and our life in it,

14
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,645
is something of which
I still constantly dream.

15
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:47,320
Hopelessly bidden, night after night,
to return to its tranquility and nightmares,

16
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,927
to the heavy shadows
of its stone-walled ruins,

17
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,003
crevassed between bank and yew trees,

18
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,278
its chaos and rule of women.

19
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,836
Slide it straight, that's it.

20
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,086
Let Lol through.
Come on, then, Lol.

21
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,723
- You all right, Sid?
- Course I'm all right.

22
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:39,157
If I can drive a bus,
I can steer a little piano.

23
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,845
Watch where you're going, Tom!

24
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,723
Mother? Mother?
Where do you want me to put the bread?

25
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,962
Oh-ho! Over there will be fine.

26
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,995
Don't know why you ever wanted
to move over from Stroud.

27
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,801
All this stuff to cart
and it's only a few miles.

28
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,601
- Ohh!
- Cheaper. He thinks it'll be cheaper.

29
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:13,083
Need a drop of cider to do a job like that,
do you, Uncle Sid?

30
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,244
Our mother says you drive better
with a drop of drink inside you.

31
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,721
You girls show a bit
of respect for your uncle!

32
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,598
Ah, Sid, easy!

33
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,480
Go easy with my precious piano!

34
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,400
No, no, over here, Sid.
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,837
Ooh, gently does it.
Against the wall.

36
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,559
Careful!

37
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,162
Just moved in, have you, missus?

38
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:13,119
Try this, then. Last year's cowslip.

39
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,727
Ohh, I don't know,

40
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,406
- Mrs?
- Granny Wallon they calls me.

41
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,359
I live at the front down the bottom.

42
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:25,605
You wanna watch out for her up the top.
Oh, the varmint.

43
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,285
- Some says a witch...
- Ooh!

44
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,716
and I wouldn't be surprised.

45
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,520
Try it then, missus.

46
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,398
Cowslip and parsley.

47
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,358
- Mm.
- It's well fermented.

48
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,398
- Oo-hoo!
- Fermented, is it?

49
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,961
I don't say I won't try a taste of that.

50
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,239
Go easy, Uncle Sid.

51
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,879
The girl's right, Sid.

52
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:50,078
You wanna watch out that old bus inspector
don't catch you

53
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,322
full of whatever it is you're guzzling.

54
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,835
Leave some for missus, don't you sup it all.

55
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,479
That's good.

56
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:13,683
My father was a knowing, brisk, elusive man.

57
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:19,799
By the age of 20, he had married
the beautiful daughter of a local merchant,

58
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,886
and she bore him children
before dying herself still young.

59
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,925
One day, Mother read in a local paper

60
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:42,755
"Widower, four children,
seeks housekeeper."

61
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,720
She fell in love with him immediately,

62
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,440
and remained in love forever.

63
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:59,796
And herself being comely,
sensitive and adoring,

64
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,760
she attracted my father also
and so he married her.

65
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,445
Ohh!

66
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:21,685
You look that handsome! Oh!

67
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:23,319
It's the Pay Corps uniform,

68
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,722
and the Pay Corps is the way up
to what I'm aiming for.

69
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,235
I know. Oh!

70
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,881
The civil service.

71
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,599
It's all I want in the world.

72
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:34,842
Hey! Is that all?

73
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,639
I've been studying nights for it.

74
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,326
I know, you've been working hard.

75
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,005
So...

76
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,083
when I get up to London...
- Woolwich, isn't it?

77
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,687
- Woolwich is London, dear.
- Oh.

78
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,446
So, that'll be my step up
towards the civil service.

79
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,081
So, what I mean to say, well,
I'll be busy up there.

80
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,197
Busy studying to advance myself.

81
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,841
But you'll still come back here?

82
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,479
You'll still visit us?

83
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,087
When I can, dear.
I'm not sure when I'll be able.

84
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:05,765
Sundays.

85
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:09,083
Oh, surely you can come Sundays?

86
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,924
Sundays?

87
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,764
I'll have to see.

88
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:24,999
So...

89
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,119
anyway, it's goodbye for now.

90
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,078
Goodbye?

91
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,118
Oh, my darling!

92
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,919
Oh!

93
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,242
Shh.

94
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,118
I'll come when I can.

95
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,998
And so, he left her,

96
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:53,084
with his children,
and some more of her own,

97
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:56,563
thus enabling my mother
to raise both his families,

98
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:59,519
which she did out of love and pity,

99
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,603
out of unreasoned loyalty,

100
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:05,640
and a fixed belief
that he would one day return to her.

101
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:09,600
Our mother, he's here.

102
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:13,242
- He is?
- He's here and waiting for you.

103
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,164
He's come!

104
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,675
Oh, I knew he would! I knew it!

105
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,319
It's Sunday, isn't it?

106
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,759
Now, erm...

107
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,157
Oh, no. That doesn't look right.

108
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,962
Oh, my hair's a mess.

109
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,603
What to do, what to do, what to do?

110
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,079
Now, where's my...

111
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:47,119
Damn and cuss!
Where's my shoes?

112
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,202
Tell him I'm just coming.

113
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,125
All right, where you put him?

114
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,603
- In the scullery.
- In the scullery?

115
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,877
Why didn't you bring him in here?

116
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,839
All the time we've waited to see him.

117
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,679
It's him?

118
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,924
I told you, our mother,
he's turned up again.

119
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,679
You poor man.

120
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,516
Must've been cruel in the wood.

121
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:49,037
I got some sacks, ma'am,
they keep out the wet.

122
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:53,399
You oughtn't to live like that,
you ought to go back to your home.

123
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:57,520
No, ma'am, that wouldn't do. They'd jump
on me before you could say "knife".

124
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,039
Well, you'll have some breakfast?

125
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:07,956
Least we can do. Come on, girls,
porridge with a spot of honey for our visitor.

126
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:12,239
A little bit of porridge...
to increase his knowledge.

127
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,006
Hurry up now, come on,
the poor man's starving!

128
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,837
I did right until I...
I tumbled to what they wanted.

129
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,162
I did my duty...

130
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,163
and they gave me medals for it.

131
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,199
Look you here.

132
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:48,719
My medals.

133
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,238
I keeps them shining
in all the damp of the wood.

134
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:04,716
That were a bright morning
I got that one.

135
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,279
Very bright.

136
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,926
Sky... full of birds...

137
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,765
and aeroplanes.

138
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:21,926
I was first jumping in the trench,
bayonet fixed.

139
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:27,245
They said I was brave that time.

140
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,879
Very brave.

141
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,998
Eat up now. I'm sure you were.

142
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,558
I knew what we were there for.

143
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,404
We were there to be dead.

144
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,119
That was the idea behind it.

145
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,556
Why was that, then?

146
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,246
So they could walk over us.

147
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,960
So we'd fill up the trenches
and smother them,

148
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,441
then more chaps could walk over us.

149
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:01,557
I wouldn't go back there,
so I ran to the woods.

150
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,081
They got war in the woods, then,
have they?

151
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,805
Bang-bang, I'm a soldier.

152
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:12,725
Aye.

153
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:16,123
You'd make a better one than me, son...
any day.

154
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,764
Good morning, Mrs. Lee.

155
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,718
Oh, my goodness.

156
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,157
Doth.
Good morning, squire.

157
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,604
So glad we caught you.

158
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,559
I don't know if you've met my son, Richard.

159
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,917
Oh, no, not had the pleasure.
Hope you're keeping well.

160
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,844
As well as can be expected.

161
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:48,679
It's his birthday.
His 21 st, you know,

162
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,718
but he can't stay for it.

163
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:54,396
Got to get back to France, I'm afraid.
Got a bit of a job to finish.

164
00:13:55,807 --> 00:14:02,724
So, we're distributing presents among
the cottages to mark the day, don't you know.

165
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:06,043
George, a pound of tea for Mrs. Lee.

166
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:11,081
A pound of tea for Mrs. Lee! You're a poet,
squire, and you do not know it.

167
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,163
And the biscuits, Father.

168
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,846
Oh, yes, of course,
we mustn't forget the biscuits.

169
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,524
Take 'em, Doth, will you?

170
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,242
And, um...

171
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:32,723
how is Mr. Lee keeping these days?

172
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,486
I haven't had the pleasure
of meeting him yet.

173
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh... he's fine, yes, yes. Keeps busy,
of course. The war keeps him busy.

174
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,438
He'll be home soon.

175
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,726
Oh, yes,
yes, we're expecting him home soon.

176
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:59,721
I was still young enough then
to be sleeping with my mother,

177
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,600
which to me
seemed life's whole purpose.

178
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:09,443
Alone at that time, of all the family,

179
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,957
I was her chosen dream companion.

180
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:16,158
Chosen from all, for her extra love.

181
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,198
My right, so it seemed to me.

182
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:29,005
So, in the ample night
and the thickness of her hair,

183
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,641
I consumed my fattened sleep,

184
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:34,645
blessed by her bed and safety.

185
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,959
Nasty old cough.

186
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,840
Look after him, won't you, Doth, mm?

187
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,117
Here, give us a push.

188
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:52,922
Oh, and, Lol, he's gotta stay in bed
with that chest of his. Mm?

189
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:57,324
If his fever gets any worse,
just fetch Mrs. Moore over to take a look.

190
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,959
Yes, Mam.

191
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:03,517
Just popping over to the Delacorts' place.

192
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,398
They're selling up, you know.

193
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,756
Very cultivated they were.

194
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,399
Well, she was, at least.

195
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,360
Should be some lovely china things going.

196
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:18,037
I shall only be looking.
Shan't buy, of course.

197
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:20,203
- Cheerio, then.
- Cheerio, Mam.

198
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,642
All done,
seventeen and six pence with the lady.

199
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,723
Going, going...

200
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:41,077
gone, to the lady.

201
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:45,564
Now, lot 217, this handsome teapot.

202
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,804
Genuine Spode china,
it's a collector's piece.

203
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:52,203
Only slightly damaged,
property of the lady of the house.

204
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,681
Used to entertain the aristocracy.

205
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:58,117
I'll start it at thirteen shillings
and six pence.

206
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:02,285
Ah, the lady.
Do I hear fourteen?

207
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,318
Fourteen shillings.

208
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:09,487
Going at fourteen shillings?
Who will offer me fourteen and six pence?

209
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:13,998
No? All going at fourteen shillings
to the gentleman with the spectacles.

210
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:16,242
Going, going...

211
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,600
Ah, madam,
do I hear fourteen and six pence?

212
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:24,161
I've got...

213
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,118
twelve shillings and eight pence.

214
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,079
Gone, to the gentlemen.
Sorry, madam.

215
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,236
Ah, lot 218.

216
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,158
Your father liked this one.

217
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,125
I used to play it to him.

218
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,602
Oh, and I'd tell him stories.

219
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,519
I could make him laugh.

220
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:37,561
"Annie, you are a killer," he used to say.

221
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:45,916
He used to get quite helpless with giggles
at all the stories I told him.

222
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:53,639
He really loved my hair, you know.

223
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,167
It had gold lights in it then.

224
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:05,157
And he'd twist it, so it caught the sun,
and then... he'd just sit and gaze.

225
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,639
Gaze.

226
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:14,155
Why doesn't he come and see us, then?

227
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,486
Lol... come in for your tea!

228
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,083
Lol!

229
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,799
Sit down, Lol.

230
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:16,042
The soldier lost the war in the woods.

231
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:19,204
- What you mean, Lol?
- Men in caps, they come for him.

232
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,317
What did they do then?

233
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,198
Chained him up and took him away.

234
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:27,525
Oh... poor man.

235
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,355
Eat up.

236
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,477
You can have some tart later.

237
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,519
Give you some tart? Of course.

238
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,637
Give me your heart.

239
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:42,076
# Give me your heart to keep

240
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,561
# I'll guard it well

241
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,883
# My pretty Nell

242
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:52,557
# As a shepherd will guard his sheep... #

243
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,964
- It's over.
- What?

244
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,645
- The war.
- What?

245
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,598
They was telling me down at the stores,

246
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:04,117
and they was giving away prunes.
Have some.

247
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:08,717
It's really true?

248
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,005
It's really ended?

249
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:15,676
Oh, yeah, and there's all sorts going on
down at the village.

250
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,446
We wants to get down there,
so we can go look around.

251
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,205
What?!

252
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:24,001
- Oh, look after the children, Marge.
- What do you mean, our mother?

253
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:28,438
Well... if it's over, really and truly...

254
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:31,001
then I got to get to Woolwich.

255
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,323
Wonderful news, isn't it?

256
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,403
I expect your father will be home soon.

257
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,484
- And Mr. Richard.
- Oh, yes, of course.

258
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:26,681
Now that it's over,
we expect to hear from him any day now.

259
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,399
Shouldn't you children be in bed?

260
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:30,802
Oh, no, sir, Ma lets us.

261
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:33,077
Peace at last,

262
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,597
and the children can stay up
as long as they like.

263
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:15,765
Rose-coloured men
through the rain-wet windows

264
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,037
seemed to bulge and break into flame.

265
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,925
They breathed out smoke,
drank fire from golden jars,

266
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:26,640
and I heard their great din with awe.

267
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,685
Marge, Doth, come quick,
the school chimney's afire.

268
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:40,443
It's the end of the world.

269
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,398
No, it's not, stupid.

270
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,039
It's the end of the war.

271
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:52,243
At any moment, I'd look for a spectacular end
to my already long life.

272
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, the end of the war and the world,
I never expected to see another day.

273
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,525
Yes?

274
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,081
Oh, erm, I've come to see Mr. Lee.

275
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,039
I'm Mrs. Lee.

276
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,845
Mrs. Lee?

277
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:08,197
Is he in, by any chance?

278
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,283
Wait there, I'll see for you.

279
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,805
Ann.

280
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:19,156
I didn't expect you.

281
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:20,799
Yes, dear, I'm here.

282
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,767
Well, the war being over and that.

283
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,278
What you trying to tell me?

284
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:52,080
- The war's over.
- I know that.

285
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:57,403
So, I've enquired about the civil service, Ann.

286
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:00,757
That's a... real possibility.

287
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,399
Good.

288
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:04,483
For them who live in London.

289
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,877
- Our home's in the village now.
- Not my home, Ann.

290
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:12,519
Your home, maybe.

291
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:18,563
- And our children's home.
- Our children's home, of course.

292
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,677
They're better off there.

293
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,319
I know they are.

294
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,043
So... what about you?

295
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:31,679
Country life, that's...

296
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:35,239
not suitable,

297
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:39,599
not for a fellow that's going to work
in the civil service.

298
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,005
And, well...

299
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:50,841
let's be honest, Ann...
you know what you are, don't you?

300
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,479
What?

301
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,919
What am I?

302
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,364
You're a country girl, aren't you?

303
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,638
Always... have been.

304
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:14,002
I don't see you... fitting in... exactly,

305
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:18,279
not with the life
that I'm expecting to lead up in London.

306
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:20,716
Oh, I can fit in.

307
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,998
Well, I can... I can fit in most places.

308
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,924
All the same...

309
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:29,960
I think it's... better for all of us if...

310
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,357
We're a long way apart now, aren't we?

311
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:55,765
Best leave things as they be.

312
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:59,243
Eh, Annie?

313
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:20,319
Thank you.

314
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,519
Did you see our father?

315
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,083
When I was in service,

316
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:51,244
I got to learn how the gentry did it.

317
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:54,802
Everything... had to be done just so.

318
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:59,875
Personal cruets for every guest.

319
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:06,560
The napery... and the silver...
had to be arranged in order.

320
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:12,842
A set for each separate dish.

321
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,401
One, two, three, four, five.

322
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:18,837
One, two, three, four... five.

323
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:24,205
So, first of all,
the butler brings in the soup.

324
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:26,442
Scoop, scoop.

325
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,921
And begins by serving the ladies.

326
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:37,285
Then there'd be...
river trout, or fresh salmon,

327
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:43,641
and then, ooh, woodcock, perhaps,
or guinea fowl.

328
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,121
Oh, yeah, and a joint as well.

329
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,842
Oh, cuss and dash,
the porridge is boiling over!

330
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:52,845
Ow! Ah-sha-shash!

331
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:54,684
When's Father coming to visit?

332
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:59,278
Then there was the night
of Miss Emily's betrothal.

333
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,966
- Who was Miss Emily?
- Daughter of the house.

334
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:07,877
A man came from Paris
just to do her hair.

335
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,636
There were these fiddlers in black,
perched up in the gallery,

336
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:14,679
and the gentlemen all wore uniform,

337
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:17,036
and they danced.

338
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:19,362
And a one, a two, a three, a four.

339
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,003
One, two, three four!

340
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,603
three, four!

341
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:29,877
Spin and one and two and three and four!

342
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,997
One, two, three...

343
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:35,198
Oh, dear.

344
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,683
A schottische.

345
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:42,799
Oh, I got that carried away.

346
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,521
He's not coming home, is he?

347
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,482
Yoo-hoo, Miss Flynn!

348
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:11,597
Are you home?

349
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,203
Such cheeky children.

350
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,238
I wish I had apples for them.

351
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,005
Oh, don't you bother, Miss Flynn.

352
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:31,799
The thought's kind enough.

353
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,239
How are you...

354
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:37,403
how you keeping...

355
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:40,525
Miss Flynn?

356
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:46,397
I been bad, missus.

357
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:53,041
Oh, there now.
Not so bad as some, I'm sure.

358
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,363
Anyway, it's this west wind,
bad for your nerves.

359
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:58,398
I have been bad, missus...

360
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,636
for things I must do.

361
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:08,679
It's my mother again, you know.

362
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,083
I've been trying
to keep her sick spirit from me.

363
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:19,605
She don't leave me alone at nights.

364
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,440
Her mother's been dead these four years.

365
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:30,160
Poor Miss Flynn.

366
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:32,038
Such a shame.

367
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,681
And her half-gentry too.

368
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,844
I'm tired. Carry me.

369
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:40,242
- Nonsense, Lol.
- You're grown up now.

370
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,879
You're a big grown man.

371
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:45,476
You'll sleep with Harold and Jack in the
big boys' room. What do you think about that?

372
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:49,281
- I don't want to.
- It's time Tony moved into our mother's bed.

373
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:51,966
Tony's too big to stop
all night in his little cot.

374
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,840
It's time for you to grow up, Lol.
It really is.

375
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,436
I'm not moving out of your bed,
am I, our mother?

376
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:03,402
Oh, it'll only be for a few nights.

377
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,284
It was my first betrayal.

378
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:09,524
My first dose of ageing hardness.

379
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:14,004
My first lesson in the gentle,
merciless rejection of women.

380
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:19,237
Nothing more was said, and I accepted it.

381
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:22,836
I grew a little tougher, a little colder,

382
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:27,005
and turned my attention more towards
the outside world,

383
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:30,244
which by now
was emerging visibly through the mist.

384
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:53,124
You're Laurie Lee, aren't you?

385
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:56,637
- I suppose so.
- Well, come and sit here for the present.

386
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,325
Silence, children.

387
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:06,963
Now, let's see how we can count.

388
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:11,797
Three beads and one makes four.

389
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:15,203
And another one makes five.

390
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:18,125
And another one makes what, children?

391
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:21,239
- Six, teacher.
- Very good, Poppy Green.

392
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:24,723
My desk companions
were those two blonde girls,

393
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,042
already puppyishly pretty,

394
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:32,241
whose names and bodies were to distract
and haunt me for the next 15 years of my life.

395
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,562
- Six, teacher.
- Very good.

396
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:46,356
- Please, miss.
- Yes, Laurie Lee.

397
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:48,125
Can I have my present now?

398
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,044
Your present? What present?

399
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:53,636
You said this morning,
"Just sit here for the present."

400
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:59,807
You funny child, I didn't mean a present,
not a gift. Of course not.

401
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,803
Good heavens, what are you staring at?

402
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,678
You're wearing a wig.

403
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:08,639
I certainly am not!

404
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,396
- You are. I've seen it.
- Come up here.

405
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,164
Now, look very close.

406
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:20,767
Is that really a wig?

407
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:22,604
Yes.

408
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:25,320
Well, really, I assure you, it's not a wig.

409
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:28,040
And if you could watch me getting dressed
in the morning,

410
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,045
you'd know it wasn't one either.

411
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,679
Now, get along with you.

412
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,880
To suggest I might watch her getting dressed
in the morning

413
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:41,637
seemed to me
both outrageous and wonderful.

414
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:51,076
In a long hot summer,
a serious drought hit the country.

415
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:54,756
Springs dried up, the wells filled with frogs

416
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:57,719
and the usually sweet water
from our scullery pump,

417
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,076
turned brown and tasted of nails.

418
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,285
As the drought continued,

419
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,445
prayer was abandoned
and more devilish steps adopted.

420
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:15,036
Finally, soldiers with rifles
marched to the tops of the hills

421
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,157
and began shooting at passing clouds.

422
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:25,284
The drought broke soon after,

423
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:29,559
and it began to rain
as it had never rained before.

424
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:40,117
The first big festival that I can remember
was Peace Day in 1919.

425
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:43,921
It was a day of magical transformations -

426
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,037
of tears and dusty sunlight,

427
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:50,126
and bands, processions
and buns by the cartload.

428
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,886
And I was so young I thought it normal.

429
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:51,395
Ladies and gentlemen...

430
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,597
friends...

431
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,326
neighbours...

432
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,959
children...

433
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,079
we are here to celebrate.

434
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:10,115
To celebrate what... exactly?

435
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:14,079
Peace!

436
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,163
After war...

437
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,759
peace.

438
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:21,399
I suppose that's about it.

439
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:25,159
I'll ask my mother to say a few words.

440
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,801
In our joy and happiness today,

441
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:34,635
we remember those
who have not come back.

442
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:39,523
I gave my beloved grandson, Richard.

443
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:45,596
He gave up his life
in the service of almighty God,

444
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,605
and for the sake of the British Empire.

445
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:53,437
They will all receive promotion in heaven.

446
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:59,926
Meanwhile, my son and I hope you will all
enjoy yourselves in these lovely gardens.

447
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:02,879
Please don't touch the flowers.

448
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,281
Oh, yes, I am reminded,

449
00:41:10,327 --> 00:41:14,081
the first prize
in the children's fancy dress parade

450
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:21,522
is awarded most appropriately to John Bull
in the person of young Laurie Lee.

451
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:31,037
Half a crown for you, my boy.

452
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,965
Save it up until you're married.

453
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:36,521
Aye, and he can buy us all a gallon of cider.

454
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,723
What you doing down there,
young varmints?

455
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,723
We come to pay you a visit, Granny Trill.

456
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:20,156
Oh.

457
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:23,518
Good morning, boys.

458
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:28,516
Now, you boys don't want anything to do
with her up the top.

459
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:31,684
You come inside and taste my turnip wine.

460
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:35,276
That'll put hairs on your chest, that will,
my turnip wine.

461
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:37,397
You boys coming up, then?

462
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:40,644
You be quiet, you up the top.

463
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,405
You old witch!

464
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:45,997
Give a body a bit of peace.

465
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:52,080
Come on in, then, and mind my parts
or they'll cut you to pieces.

466
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,277
What you doing, Gran?

467
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,763
Just biding still,
combing me bits.

468
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,479
You're going bald, Gran.

469
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:02,087
I still got my bits.

470
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:04,197
It's coming out.

471
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,839
No, it ain't!

472
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,358
I got more than her down there.

473
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:17,116
Her's as bald as a tater root,
wicked old lump.

474
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:26,877
Oh, I'll see her gone.

475
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:29,043
Her's failing.

476
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,123
You mark my words.

477
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,159
You a hundred yet, Gran?

478
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:39,076
Going on. Going on.

479
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:46,643
You get your hands out
from my drawers!

480
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:49,440
Go on, go, go! Go, go, go!

481
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:55,800
Hurry up, we'll miss the chara.

482
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,758
Morning, all.

483
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:05,155
- You're never gonna drink all that, Sid.
- Oh, you just leave me be, Alice.

484
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:09,758
You know this bus goes a whole lot better
when I've got a drink or two inside of me.

485
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,079
Come on, our mother.

486
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:18,518
Our mother, you're washing slow as a duck
with all the summer to do it.

487
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:22,321
Well, go on and get on the bus, then,
if you're so keen on it.

488
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:27,917
Now, tell me, are we all present and correct?

489
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,639
Yes, Vicar.

490
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:31,439
- Ah, good.
- What about Mother?

491
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:37,721
Now, there's a very nice church
by the promenade.

492
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:41,282
I trust you will all spare a moment...

493
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,925
Yoo-hoo!

494
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,679
Come on!

495
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:55,079
Ohh!

496
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,843
Nearly went without you.

497
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:03,003
Go on, Sid. What you waiting for?

498
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,439
Let's go have a wet.

499
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,557
- Come on, Sid.
- Not too much, Sid.

500
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:43,158
Of course not, dear. Now why don't you go
and find a nice clean place to sit on the pier?

501
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,198
- Come on, boys.
- Right, come on, Sid.

502
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:56,843
I found the sea.

503
00:46:56,887 --> 00:46:59,242
Ah, well done, squire.

504
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:00,879
I've got some of it here.

505
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,127
Reckon there's plenty of it left.

506
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,759
What you digging for?

507
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:09,559
Sea hedgehogs.

508
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,484
What they look like, then?

509
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,765
Dunno.

510
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:16,399
Ain't never seed 'em.

511
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,362
Oh!

512
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:32,320
- Sid!
- Hush, woman, I know exactly what I'm doing.

513
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,405
Let me in!

514
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:13,278
- Are you there?
- Come in.

515
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,919
Who's that?

516
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:17,640
Sid's done it this time, that's what.

517
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:21,606
- I know he has.
- What do you mean, Alice?

518
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:23,603
- Topped hisself again?
- That's it.

519
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,239
Oh.

520
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:29,439
Well, you know our Sid, dear,
he's always threatening suicide.

521
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:32,604
Only when he can't do it.

522
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:35,764
Remember that time he went up
Deadcombe Wood to hang hisself?

523
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:37,843
Only by his braces.

524
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,242
And when he drank that disinfectant,

525
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:44,280
well, he marked the antidote clearly,
he put it on the shelf all ready,

526
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:47,683
- just to save us all the trouble.
- Reckon he means it this time though.

527
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:49,319
He never come home.

528
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,835
They must've given him the sack,
cos of the drink.

529
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,605
Now, he's gone off to end it all.

530
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:56,320
Oh, there, now, I'm sure he hasn't.

531
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,358
Oh, come on in, Alice.

532
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:02,639
Sit yourself down by the fire,
come on.

533
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:05,724
Oh dear, oh dear.

534
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:11,079
You've gotta help me.
He's gone down the canal, I reckon.

535
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:16,485
Annie... he always said he'd do himself in
if it came to the sack.

536
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:20,361
Your boys, they've just got to find him,
before it's too late.

537
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:26,718
All right, boys.

538
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:38,686
Uncle Sid?

539
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:41,287
Uncle Sid, where are you?

540
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:44,757
Uncle Sid?

541
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:49,243
Uncle Sid?

542
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:55,157
Uncle Sid, where are you?

543
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:58,603
Don't do it, Uncle Sid.

544
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,842
Uncle Sid, where are you?

545
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:03,242
Uncle Sid?

546
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:04,879
Look!

547
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:17,359
"Goodbye."

548
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:29,836
You've been a long time coming.

549
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:41,519
Joseph and Hannah Brown
appeared to be indestructible.

550
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:45,355
They had lived together in the same house
for 50 years.

551
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:48,524
And to me,
they resembled two tawny insects -

552
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,797
slow but deft in their movements,

553
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:57,366
a little foraging, some frugal feeding
and any amount of stillness.

554
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,125
Sid's eggs.

555
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:02,716
His chicken's gone mad.

556
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,962
He gave us more than we could manage,

557
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:07,362
so, I brought you over a dozen.

558
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,957
That's kind, Mrs. Lee.

559
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:12,725
That thoughtful.

560
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:19,398
When we pass your door, we always say

561
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:22,484
you're snug as a pair of chestnuts
in here, aren't you.

562
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:26,838
We takes you for granted.

563
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:28,605
Like the weather.

564
00:51:28,647 --> 00:51:34,279
So, just thought I'd pop over...
with a few eggs.

565
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:37,080
And, if you're needing any chores done

566
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,722
or a bit of company or anything,
I'll send the boys round.

567
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:44,680
Oh, no, we're fine. We gets on, you see.

568
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,525
Oh, yes, we gets on.

569
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:53,358
There's nothing like an husband,
is there, Mrs. Lee, to keep you contented?

570
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:55,284
Mm.

571
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:58,483
Well, hope you enjoy the...

572
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,885
eggs.

573
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,485
Crabby's coming.

574
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:26,002
Shuffling your feet,
playing with the desk,

575
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:29,642
and smirking
at that miserable Rosie Burdock!

576
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:32,724
I will not have it!
I will not, I say.

577
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,758
I repeat, I will not!

578
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:38,483
Wake up, Laurie Lee.

579
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,563
Wake up, slow and lazy.

580
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:51,996
Good morning, children.

581
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,197
Morning, teacher.

582
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:02,602
Our Father,

583
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,717
which art in heaven,

584
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:08,203
hallowed be Thy name.

585
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:10,317
Thy kingdom come,

586
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:14,724
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.

587
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:18,726
Give us this day our daily bread,

588
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:21,725
and forgive us our trespasses,

589
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:26,238
as they forgive us who trespass against them.

590
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,199
Lead us not into temptation...

591
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:34,919
Sam?

592
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:38,966
You look tired, my dear.

593
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,567
Why don't you come in?

594
00:53:41,607 --> 00:53:43,404
Warm yourselves.

595
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:48,040
Is that her? Is that the one?

596
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:50,760
You be quiet.
Now, just shut up.

597
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:55,358
Our king is George.

598
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:59,685
Stop sniffling,
slow and lazy!

599
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:01,399
Yes, miss.

600
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,007
One George is fifth.

601
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:07,403
I will not have it! I will not!

602
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:09,961
Get out of my classroom, go on, get out!

603
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:14,478
Don't you dare come back,
not until you've a-blowed your nose a-proper.

604
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:31,078
Ain't you blown your nose yet?

605
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:33,721
No, and I ain't going to neither.

606
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:37,157
- What's Crabby gonna say?
- I don't care what she says.

607
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,118
I don't belong to that place.

608
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:41,237
- Why not?
- Cos I'm royal.

609
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:44,438
Go on, that's rubbish!

610
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:46,796
It's not rubbish neither, Rosie Burdock.

611
00:54:46,847 --> 00:54:50,078
One day there'll be a coach arrive back home
to take me away.

612
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:51,765
A coach with footmen.

613
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:55,243
And they'll stand up
very solemn and respectful.

614
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,755
Although our mother will cry about it I expect.

615
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:00,275
I'm not gonna put
our brothers in dungeons neither,

616
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:02,318
much as they deserves it.

617
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,085
I'll feed them on cakes and jellies.

618
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:36,720
You're no good, Spadge Hopkins.

619
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:42,040
You're an 'opeless, aren't you just?

620
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,117
Hurry up, Laurie Lee.

621
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,317
A little less beastly now, are we?

622
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,597
Maybe you'd like to bring an 'ankie tomorrow.

623
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,797
I'm sure we'd all be grateful.

624
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:59,879
You're a blockhead, Spadge Hopkins.

625
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:05,524
Not to put too fine a point upon it -
a blockhead,

626
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:10,118
who doesn't even know his three times seven.

627
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:13,079
He does.

628
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:20,641
What you say, Spadge Hopkins?

629
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:28,925
Did I hear you mutter some reply
in which you included the word "miss"?

630
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:30,559
I don't doubt it.

631
00:56:30,607 --> 00:56:32,359
I does, miss.

632
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:36,605
Oh, you does, does you?

633
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:45,957
Well, perhaps you'll let the class
have the privilege of sharing

634
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:54,278
what your idea
of your three times seven might be.

635
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:04,166
Nineteen.

636
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,483
Hopeless!

637
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:19,158
What did they do with your head,
Spadge Hopkins?

638
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:23,325
Carve it out of dead wood, did they,

639
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,358
then cover it with lead,

640
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:29,320
so not a single multiplication
can penetrate in?

641
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:30,925
Sod it all!

642
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:34,642
And where do you think you are going,
Spadge Hopkins, may I ask?

643
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,359
If it's any business of yours.

644
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:39,524
Sit down at once!
I will not have it!

645
00:57:39,567 --> 00:57:41,159
Ta-ta, Crabby.

646
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:51,119
Come and help me, someone.

647
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,759
Help me.

648
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:57,717
Help me, someone, help!
Help!

649
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,038
Stop!

650
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:49,439
Hello, Miss Flynn.

651
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:53,162
Such cheeky children.

652
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:56,643
You coming to entertainment later,
Miss Flynn?

653
00:58:56,687 --> 00:58:59,440
I'm sorry, boys, I can't leave home.

654
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:01,637
It's my mother, you know.

655
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,558
She keeps coming to visit me.

656
00:59:19,327 --> 00:59:23,878
# Snow had fallen, snow on snow

657
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:28,159
# Snow on snow

658
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:36,922
# In the bleak midwinter, long ago #

659
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:46,036
What was that God-awful noise?

660
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:48,157
Boney - he can't sing a note.

661
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:49,925
I got a sweet voice.

662
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:53,480
You ain't, Boney.
Not to be honest.

663
00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:55,119
You're a 'horrible disgrace.

664
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,965
You clear off, Boney,
you're ruining our carol barkin'.

665
00:59:58,007 --> 01:00:00,282
- I ain't.
- Oh, yes, you are.

666
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,717
Come on, everyone, we're ditching Boney.

667
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:08,564
Bye, Boney.

668
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:32,316
I'll take a large whisky from you, landlord.

669
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:38,835
And I believe all the gentlemen present
will be pleased to join me...

670
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:42,642
in the tipple of their choice.

671
01:00:45,327 --> 01:00:48,637
Fill 'em up high, now.
No short measures.

672
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:52,798
And if the service is satisfactory...

673
01:00:54,887 --> 01:00:56,639
draw one for yourself.

674
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:10,319
Excuse me.

675
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,959
Where have you been?

676
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:13,645
I've been carol singing.

677
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:25,842
Remember me, do you?
Little Vincent Thorne,

678
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,606
so poor and peaky
that the village scraped together

679
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,320
to ship him off to New Zealand
to start a new life.

680
01:01:32,487 --> 01:01:34,637
Squire was very generous.

681
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:37,076
You all paid your whack.

682
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,960
And now little Vincent Thorne
could buy you all up,

683
01:01:40,007 --> 01:01:44,523
including squire and all his manor
and still have a fortune nestling in the bank.

684
01:01:47,127 --> 01:01:49,436
Fill 'em up proper again, landlord,

685
01:01:49,487 --> 01:01:52,524
there's plenty more where that came from.

686
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:54,523
Another year,

687
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,683
another year comes round.

688
01:01:56,727 --> 01:02:03,405
When I see you all gathered together here,
once more, well, I think...

689
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:10,242
Well, it's most difficult to find words
to express... what I think.

690
01:02:10,287 --> 01:02:12,243
But...

691
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:14,482
the time of year has come around again

692
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,883
when I can announce... an entertainment.

693
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,365
You chaps have got no idea, have you?

694
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:29,921
You've all wasted your lives, I reckon.

695
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:32,083
I mean, what's a life here?

696
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:36,200
Slaving for the squire and the tenant farmers
for a miserable twelve bob a week.

697
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,520
Living on potatoes and touching your caps.

698
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:43,445
Nothing to look at
except muck and each other.

699
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:51,483
Which of you humble peasants can tell the time
on a watch to match this one?

700
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:55,119
Eh?

701
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,839
# Grow, grow, grow, little mushroom, grow

702
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:09,563
# Grow, grow, somebody wants you so

703
01:03:09,607 --> 01:03:13,316
# I will come again tomorrow morning, see

704
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:17,155
# And if you've grown bigger,
you will just suit me

705
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:23,885
# So, grow, grow, grow,
little mushroom, grow #

706
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:31,639
You never guessed, did you?

707
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:36,360
Not when you'd sent me
once across the ocean.

708
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,999
It's not just the money and the watch,
like I told you.

709
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:47,686
You oughta see the size of my farm
in New Zealand.

710
01:03:48,967 --> 01:03:51,276
You ought just to take a look at my horses.

711
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,835
You know what I got?

712
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:57,526
Carriages...

713
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,445
fine linen sheets to sleep in,

714
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:02,796
and I never say sir to no one.

715
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:10,281
You want a lantern to light your way?

716
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:13,000
I were born here, wasn't I?

717
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:15,197
I should be able to find my way home.

718
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,677
When is a door not a door?

719
01:04:22,727 --> 01:04:24,319
When it's ajar.

720
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,884
And now, a little ditty.

721
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:35,637
# Oh, I cannot love you

722
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:38,963
# The pain of salt will go...

723
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:42,519
Ahh!

724
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:48,038
# Some pain in my soul

725
01:04:48,087 --> 01:04:50,362
# I think I'll be there soon... #

726
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:52,079
Well, then, Vincent.

727
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:08,126
And now we have Miss Jo Jenkins
and Master Laurie Lee to perform a duet.

728
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:20,843
- I better help him.
- Mother, don't. Sit down.

729
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:25,919
- Ah!
- Aargh!

730
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,800
Aargh!

731
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:34,642
Pick him up.
Grab a leg.

732
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:37,724
Over here, over here, come on.

733
01:06:19,527 --> 01:06:28,117
# But come ye back
when summer's in the meadow

734
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:36,723
# Or when the valley's hushed
and white with snow

735
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:45,641
# It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow

736
01:06:45,687 --> 01:06:53,879
# Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy,
I love you so #

737
01:07:21,447 --> 01:07:24,007
The police came, of course,
but discovered nothing.

738
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:29,076
Their enquiries were met by stares.

739
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:31,880
The detail, spread quickly
from mouth to mouth,

740
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:33,997
was deliberately spread among us,

741
01:07:34,047 --> 01:07:36,800
was given to everyone, man and child,

742
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:40,237
that we might learn each detail and hide it.

743
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:22,484
The police left at last
with the case unsolved.

744
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:25,166
But neither we nor they forgot it.

745
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:57,719
He's awake.

746
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,756
Mm, mm, angels.

747
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:07,604
Uncle Ray, my boy, you've gone and died
and went to heaven.

748
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:16,203
You're no angel though.

749
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:25,406
Who are these visions of paradise?

750
01:09:25,447 --> 01:09:28,245
Them's my sisters.

751
01:09:28,287 --> 01:09:29,925
Then you're a lucky man.

752
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:33,755
Come on, sit on the bed, girls,
and warm your uncle's heart,

753
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:36,719
or any part of him
that happens to be in your neighbourhood.

754
01:09:36,767 --> 01:09:38,564
What've you got all over you?

755
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,404
Friends, my young beauty.

756
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:44,326
Images of delight to keep me company
on lonely nights under the stars.

757
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,642
Let me introduce you. Erm...

758
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:50,805
Ah, I call this one Bella the belly dancer.

759
01:09:50,847 --> 01:09:53,077
Do you want her to dance for you?
Yeah.

760
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,843
Oo-er, snakes.

761
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:05,677
Girls, you shouldn't have woken up
your Uncle Ray.

762
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:08,321
He's traveled ever so far.

763
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:10,835
Where you traveled from, Uncle Ray?

764
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:13,560
The ends of the earth.

765
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:15,518
The North Pole.

766
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,239
The mountains of the moon.

767
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:21,918
- I come down on a shooting star.
- Canada.

768
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,527
Well, yes, Canada.

769
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:31,163
My little sister, Annie, I might've known
you'd produce a basketful of beauties.

770
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:33,357
Oh, not me, I'm afraid.

771
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:36,444
Anyway,
got to get this basketful off to work first.

772
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:39,001
Come on, girls, downstairs.

773
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:57,596
So quiet was Jo always -

774
01:10:57,647 --> 01:11:00,719
so timorous, yet eager to please,

775
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:02,837
that she was the one I chose first.

776
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:06,318
Where you going, then, Jo?

777
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:09,484
- Nowhere special.
- Oh.

778
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:11,119
Let's go down the bank then, eh?

779
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,479
How about it, Jo?

780
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:17,166
Down the bank - like before.

781
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,198
What shall we do then, Jo?

782
01:11:45,487 --> 01:11:47,159
What do you say, Jo?

783
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:48,925
I don't mind.

784
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:50,559
Come on, you tell.

785
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,245
No, you.

786
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:04,802
Good morning, Mrs. Jenkins.
What seems to be the trouble?

787
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:47,724
Well, that'll be all, Mrs. Jenkins.

788
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:49,758
I'll be back again tomorrow.

789
01:12:53,527 --> 01:12:59,477
That early exploration of Jo's spread body
was a solitary studying of maps.

790
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:02,758
The signs upon her
showed the way I should go,

791
01:13:02,807 --> 01:13:04,718
then she was folded and put away.

792
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:12,478
Very soon, I caught up with other travelers,
all going in the same direction,

793
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:15,087
and together we entered that tricky wood.

794
01:13:21,047 --> 01:13:24,596
All right, all right, all right. Patience!

795
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:28,843
- Does anyone want tea?
- Yeah.

796
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:30,559
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

797
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:36,202
Did you hear him in the night?

798
01:13:36,247 --> 01:13:38,238
Did you hear him screeching?

799
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:39,879
Hear who screeching?

800
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:43,124
The death bird.

801
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,919
She's been took.

802
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,720
Her up the top. Her's gone.

803
01:13:49,687 --> 01:13:56,718
I knew it. I knew I'd outlast her.

804
01:13:56,767 --> 01:14:00,396
# Abide with me

805
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:07,319
# Fast falls the eventide

806
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:12,680
# The darkness deepens

807
01:14:12,727 --> 01:14:17,596
# Lord with me abide

808
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:27,402
# When other helpers fail
and comforts flee

809
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:33,404
# Help of the helpless

810
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:38,282
# O, abide with me #

811
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:40,079
That's a lie!

812
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:44,643
Her up the top's a varmint. It's a lie.

813
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:46,598
The baggage were younger than me.

814
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:48,717
Ninety-five she says?

815
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:52,077
Isnt no more than ninety,
and I gone on ninety-two.

816
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:58,566
It's a crime... you letting her go to her maker
in such a brazen lie.

817
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:02,205
Dig her up, you.

818
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:05,444
Get that brass plate off.

819
01:15:05,487 --> 01:15:08,524
It's an insult to the living church.

820
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,478
She's a liar!

821
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:12,643
A mortal liar.

822
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:20,002
The clump of clay falling on Gran Trill's
coffin sealed her with her inscription forever.

823
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:25,758
You dig her up
and bury her at the crossroads!

824
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:27,525
Granny Wallon had triumphed.

825
01:15:27,567 --> 01:15:33,199
She had buried her rival
and now there was no more to do.

826
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:36,842
About two weeks later,
of no special disease,

827
01:15:36,887 --> 01:15:38,957
Granny Wallon gave up in her sleep.

828
01:15:40,767 --> 01:15:42,883
Thy kingdom come,

829
01:15:42,927 --> 01:15:44,724
Thy will be done

830
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,919
on earth as it is in heaven.

831
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:52,755
Give us this day our daily bread,

832
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:56,322
and forgive us our trespasses

833
01:15:56,367 --> 01:16:01,964
as we forgive those who trespass against us,

834
01:16:02,007 --> 01:16:06,205
and lead us not into temptation...

835
01:16:06,247 --> 01:16:10,445
Our village was clearly no pagan paradise.

836
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,796
Neither were we conscious
of showing tolerance.

837
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:17,477
We certainly committed our share
of statutory crime.

838
01:16:17,527 --> 01:16:20,803
Manslaughter, arson, robbery, rape,

839
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:23,281
cropped up regularly throughout the years.

840
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:27,003
She won't be no trouble.

841
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:30,318
Ain't never done nothing like this before.

842
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:32,039
There's nothing to it.

843
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,521
Have you done it before?

844
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:37,286
Sort of, so I goes first.

845
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:40,285
- Why's that?
- It was my idea, I goes first.

846
01:16:43,127 --> 01:16:44,719
What's it like, then?

847
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,359
You won't be disappointed.

848
01:17:20,007 --> 01:17:24,478
We emerged culpable, it's true,
but unclassified in criminal record.

849
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:31,397
As for our leaders,
those red-fanged ravishers of innocence,

850
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:34,280
what happened to them in the end?

851
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:39,845
Boney was raped himself soon afterwards
and married his attacker, a rich farm widow,

852
01:17:39,887 --> 01:17:43,243
who worked him to death in her bed
and barnyard.

853
01:17:43,287 --> 01:17:46,643
The others married too,
raised large families

854
01:17:46,687 --> 01:17:50,726
and became members
of the parish church council.

855
01:17:52,287 --> 01:17:53,925
Look out! Oh!

856
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:56,481
Oh, God!

857
01:17:56,527 --> 01:17:58,119
Ow!

858
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:03,839
- Oh!
- Down we go.

859
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,924
# Pretty bubbles in the... # Oh!

860
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:11,518
Dear me, what a state he's in.

861
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,398
He smells funny.

862
01:18:13,447 --> 01:18:15,039
Smells sort of oily.

863
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:16,725
Stinks of whisky.

864
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:18,803
Fancy him crashing into the lavvy, Mother.

865
01:18:20,607 --> 01:18:23,041
- Let me in!
- Who is it?

866
01:18:23,087 --> 01:18:24,759
Beattie Burroughs.

867
01:18:24,807 --> 01:18:26,798
Is your brother Ray in there with you?

868
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:28,963
- Ye...
- Don't. Shh.

869
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:31,077
Ray!

870
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,766
Ah! Oh!

871
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:35,399
Ray!

872
01:18:41,327 --> 01:18:43,079
What's the matter, Beattie?

873
01:18:43,127 --> 01:18:47,279
- I want your Ray.
- Oh, erm... do you?

874
01:18:47,327 --> 01:18:50,399
Erm... what do you want him for?

875
01:18:50,447 --> 01:18:52,881
He promised to marry me!

876
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,122
- Oh.
- What you been doing here?

877
01:18:56,487 --> 01:18:59,843
Oh... just washing a few old clothes.

878
01:19:01,727 --> 01:19:03,524
So, he promised to marry you, did he?

879
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,285
Three times.

880
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:07,477
Under the Stroud Brewery arches.

881
01:19:07,527 --> 01:19:09,199
I come to settle the arrangements.

882
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:12,199
Right.

883
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:14,925
Well...

884
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,117
I'll see if he's in for you, Beattie.

885
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,556
You do that, Mrs. Lee.

886
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:43,243
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, sir, come quick now!

887
01:19:46,927 --> 01:19:48,121
Damn it!

888
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:50,601
What's up, then, Fred?

889
01:19:50,647 --> 01:19:52,444
Ain't nobody told you?

890
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:55,764
Who'd have thought it?

891
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:57,684
Thought what, Fred?

892
01:19:58,967 --> 01:20:01,765
- Tell us, Fred.
- Go on, tell us.

893
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:08,525
I was just coming from milking, see?

894
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:10,205
Yes.

895
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:13,478
- Passing Jones's pond.
- Was you?

896
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:16,360
I stopped for a minute
to chuck a stone at a rat.

897
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:19,604
I gets tuppence a tail.

898
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:21,285
We know that, Fred.

899
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:22,919
Oi.

900
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:28,485
Down by the lily weeds,
there was something floating.

901
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:34,963
All spread out, white, in the water.

902
01:20:37,447 --> 01:20:40,598
Well, I thought of a dead swan,

903
01:20:40,647 --> 01:20:43,844
or at least one of Jones's goats
fell in and drowned.

904
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:48,239
When I got closer...

905
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,119
there she was.

906
01:20:55,327 --> 01:20:57,045
You could've knocked me down.

907
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:01,840
Miss Flynn.

908
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:05,727
She didn't have a stitch on.

909
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:09,843
Her eyes was wide open.

910
01:21:11,927 --> 01:21:14,999
She was staring up through the water like...

911
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:21,637
like someone was gazing though a window.

912
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:27,687
Oh, poor woman.

913
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:35,995
She had a bit of a handicap, you know.

914
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:37,719
Poor lady.

915
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:40,998
- You mean about those fellows?
- Well...

916
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:44,884
more than that.

917
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:18,320
I've been bad, missus.

918
01:22:20,367 --> 01:22:22,005
It's my mother again, you know.

919
01:22:22,047 --> 01:22:25,403
I've been trying to keep
her sick spirit from me.

920
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:30,444
She don't leave me alone at nights.

921
01:22:48,007 --> 01:22:49,725
The pond was empty.

922
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:54,682
She'd been carried home on a hurdle
and the women had seen to her body,

923
01:22:54,727 --> 01:22:58,640
but for me, as long as I can remember,

924
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,326
Miss Flynn remained drowned in that pond.

925
01:23:09,927 --> 01:23:13,237
The wet winter days
seemed, at times, unending,

926
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:16,484
and quite often,
they led to self-slaughter.

927
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:19,599
Indeed, during one particularly
gloomy season,

928
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:21,922
even the coroner did himself in.

929
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:24,561
Mr. and Mrs. Brown?

930
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:32,001
Joseph?

931
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:33,685
Hannah?

932
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:55,077
There's nothing for it,
they'll have to be moved.

933
01:23:55,127 --> 01:24:01,157
Oh, I could come in and tidy up,
help out a bit. Light that fire for them.

934
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:04,756
No, Mrs. Lee, you've got your own family.

935
01:24:29,687 --> 01:24:32,724
Mrs. Brown will be in the women's wing,
naturally.

936
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,758
Mr. Brown will be with the men.

937
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:37,836
They want to be together.

938
01:24:38,447 --> 01:24:40,039
They always have.

939
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:44,478
Well, they can meet each other,
every second Thursday.

940
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:51,195
So that same afternoon,
white and speechless,

941
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:53,283
they were taken away to the workhouse.

942
01:25:25,407 --> 01:25:28,285
The workhouse could not give them
the mercy they needed.

943
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:30,397
It could only divide them in charity.

944
01:25:32,367 --> 01:25:38,124
It was the first time in all their 50 years
that they had been separated.

945
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:41,045
They did not see each other again,

946
01:25:41,087 --> 01:25:43,442
for in a week they both were dead.

947
01:25:45,727 --> 01:25:48,719
I was haunted by their end as by no other,

948
01:25:48,767 --> 01:25:51,998
and by the kind killing authority
that arranged it.

949
01:25:53,807 --> 01:25:56,480
Divided, their life went out of them,

950
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:59,405
so that they ceased
as by mutual agreement.

951
01:26:00,807 --> 01:26:04,004
Their cottage stood empty
on the edge of the common,

952
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:06,845
its front door locked and soundless.

953
01:26:06,887 --> 01:26:13,599
Its stones grew rapidly cold and repellent
with its life so suddenly withdrawn.

954
01:26:13,647 --> 01:26:15,797
In a year it fell down.

955
01:26:15,847 --> 01:26:17,963
First the roof, then the walls,

956
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:21,363
and lay scattered in a tangle of briars.

957
01:26:21,407 --> 01:26:24,001
Its decay was so violent and overwhelming,

958
01:26:24,047 --> 01:26:28,279
it was as though the old couple
had wrecked it themselves.

959
01:26:28,327 --> 01:26:31,558
Soon all that remained
of Joe and Hannah Brown

960
01:26:31,607 --> 01:26:34,326
and of their long, close life together,

961
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:38,599
was some grass-grown stumps,
a garden gone wild,

962
01:26:38,647 --> 01:26:42,037
some rusty pots and a dog rose.

963
01:26:54,607 --> 01:27:00,682
The last days of my childhood
were also the last days of the village.

964
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:04,003
I belong to that generation
which saw, by chance,

965
01:27:04,047 --> 01:27:06,277
the end of a thousand years life.

966
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:16,646
Myself, my family, my generation,
were born in a world of silence,

967
01:27:16,687 --> 01:27:20,965
of white narrow roads,
rutted with hooves and cartwheels,

968
01:27:21,007 --> 01:27:23,475
innocent of oil or petrol,

969
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:27,964
down which people passed rarely,
and almost never for pleasure,

970
01:27:28,007 --> 01:27:30,999
and the horse was the fastest thing moving.

971
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,439
A bit late, aren't you, you two?

972
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:50,717
We've finished our supper.

973
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,758
We don't need no supper, Ma.

974
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:57,881
Oh, don't you? What's he gonna do
with you, then - starve you to death?

975
01:27:57,927 --> 01:28:00,487
Listen, Harold,
I said you could take our Phyllis out,

976
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:02,722
I did not say you could keep her out all hours,

977
01:28:02,767 --> 01:28:09,206
piano playing and singing round the pub
or whatever it is you get up to.

978
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:15,604
Harold's got something to tell you, Ma.

979
01:28:17,407 --> 01:28:19,045
Oh, spit it out, then...

980
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:20,998
even if it's only a bucketful.

981
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,356
Don't just stand there as stiff as can be.

982
01:28:25,407 --> 01:28:27,875
I'm all right, Mrs. Lee, I assure you.

983
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:34,556
Ma... we've been thinking...

984
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:37,201
Oh, have you? Makes a change.
What you been thinking about?

985
01:28:37,247 --> 01:28:39,317
Phyllis has just about had enough, Mrs. Lee.

986
01:28:39,367 --> 01:28:42,120
It's time I took her out of here altogether.

987
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:45,564
What's that?

988
01:28:45,607 --> 01:28:48,519
What's that - double Dutch?
What's that supposed to mean?

989
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:52,845
It means I'm leaving home, Mother.
I'm going to live in with Harold.

990
01:28:52,887 --> 01:28:55,162
- Our Phyl!
- You're never?

991
01:28:55,207 --> 01:28:57,880
You'd do the same
if you had a proper fella to go to.

992
01:28:57,927 --> 01:29:01,476
- Don't talk so daft.
- We're not daft.

993
01:29:01,527 --> 01:29:03,358
We means it, Mother.

994
01:29:03,407 --> 01:29:05,204
No, you can't.

995
01:29:05,247 --> 01:29:08,364
Oh, Phyllis, Phyllis, you can't leave me.

996
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:10,045
We can.

997
01:29:10,087 --> 01:29:11,679
And we're gonna too.

998
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:14,002
Me?

999
01:29:14,047 --> 01:29:17,722
Me, what am I expected to feel? Don't
suppose you've thought about that, have you?

1000
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:19,359
- I'm sorry, Mrs Lee.
- Sorry?

1001
01:29:19,407 --> 01:29:21,796
You're not sorry,
you haven't the brains to be sorry.

1002
01:29:21,847 --> 01:29:24,839
It's cruel, that's what it is, it's cruelty!

1003
01:29:24,887 --> 01:29:27,526
Me? I never got a chance!

1004
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:30,877
I was put into service. Five pound a year.

1005
01:29:30,927 --> 01:29:33,043
What's your father gonna say
when he gets home?

1006
01:29:33,087 --> 01:29:36,238
- He don't say nothing.
- He's never coming back.

1007
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:39,479
You!

1008
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,599
You!

1009
01:29:41,647 --> 01:29:44,400
- You!
- Aargh! Oh!

1010
01:29:44,447 --> 01:29:46,085
Get off! Get off.

1011
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:48,925
- Don't you hit our mother!
- I ain't, she's hitting me.

1012
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:51,435
Ow!

1013
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:53,079
Who do you think you are?

1014
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:55,243
You're nothing!

1015
01:29:55,287 --> 01:29:59,997
You walk in here, bold as brass, and think
you can walk out of here, bold as brass.

1016
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:02,163
Ah! I think you're all mad.

1017
01:30:02,207 --> 01:30:04,801
- I'll show you how mad we are.
- Aargh!

1018
01:30:04,847 --> 01:30:08,476
- Oh! Aargh!
- Ah!

1019
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:10,324
We gotta save our mother's life.

1020
01:30:14,087 --> 01:30:15,679
Oh!

1021
01:30:16,927 --> 01:30:19,077
Ah!

1022
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:25,159
Oh.

1023
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:27,919
Ohh!

1024
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:44,205
It's all right...
we're all friends now.

1025
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:47,685
Aren't we, Harold?

1026
01:30:47,727 --> 01:30:49,558
- Mm?
- I suppose so, Mrs. Lee.

1027
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:51,723
Yeah, dear boy.

1028
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:57,597
Oh, Mother... I'm so sorry.

1029
01:30:57,647 --> 01:30:59,478
Oh, it's nothing.

1030
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:01,802
I'm sure it's nothing.

1031
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:03,439
Hm?

1032
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:07,397
- We won't go.
- Mm.

1033
01:31:07,447 --> 01:31:09,836
Not yet anyway.

1034
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:13,357
Oh, our Phyllis,
we love you, don't we, Doth?

1035
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:16,479
Course we do. And Harold.

1036
01:31:16,527 --> 01:31:20,361
- Ohh!
- Who sings so beautifully.

1037
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:23,479
Now, you won't say no to a cup of cocoa?

1038
01:31:23,527 --> 01:31:25,324
Very kind of you, Mrs. Lee.

1039
01:31:25,367 --> 01:31:26,959
Kind?

1040
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:29,237
Course I'm kind.

1041
01:31:29,287 --> 01:31:32,199
We're all kind, aren't we, darlings?

1042
01:31:35,287 --> 01:31:38,245
Come on, then. Cocoa.

1043
01:31:38,287 --> 01:31:41,563
He had tried to carry off our willing sister,

1044
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:43,996
and we had all of us very near killed him.

1045
01:31:46,447 --> 01:31:49,405
A moment before I'd been blind with anger,

1046
01:31:49,447 --> 01:31:52,439
ready to slay for the family.

1047
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:55,479
Now the rage was over,
cancelled, let down.

1048
01:31:56,887 --> 01:32:00,277
I turned in disgust
from their billing and cooing,

1049
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:06,880
went up to the fire, lifted my nightshirt
and warmed my bare legs on the fireguard.

1050
01:32:43,847 --> 01:32:46,122
What are you doing here, Rosie Burdock?

1051
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:49,000
I like it here. I likes the smell of it.

1052
01:32:49,047 --> 01:32:50,844
You likes watching others working.

1053
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:52,798
Oh, yeah, I likes that too.

1054
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:56,476
Will you get out of it?
Unless you want to shift a bit of hay.

1055
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:58,245
We don't need no watchers. Go on.

1056
01:32:58,287 --> 01:33:00,881
Not yet.

1057
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:03,999
- Why not yet?
- Cos I got something to show you.

1058
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:06,197
What is it, then?

1059
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,522
You'll know when you sees it.

1060
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:13,759
You thirsty?

1061
01:33:15,247 --> 01:33:16,839
I ain't, so there.

1062
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:18,559
That's a lie.

1063
01:33:18,607 --> 01:33:20,438
No, it's not.

1064
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:24,685
You know you be thirsty.
So come on, you follow me.

1065
01:33:50,847 --> 01:33:52,439
What's that, then?

1066
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:54,079
It's cider.

1067
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:55,765
You ain't to drink it though.

1068
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:58,162
Well, not much of it, at any rate.

1069
01:34:04,287 --> 01:34:06,926
Go on, then, drink it. Don't act about.

1070
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:13,599
Never to be forgotten,

1071
01:34:13,647 --> 01:34:17,720
that first long secret drink of golden fire.

1072
01:34:17,767 --> 01:34:20,520
Juice of those valleys and of that time,

1073
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:25,925
wine of wild orchards, of russet summer,
of plump red apples

1074
01:34:25,967 --> 01:34:28,162
and Rosie's burning cheeks.

1075
01:34:29,767 --> 01:34:33,555
Never to be forgotten or ever tasted again.

1076
01:34:39,527 --> 01:34:41,165
What you doing?

1077
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,482
Decorating our room.

1078
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:45,677
What you talking about?

1079
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:49,879
You told me, don't you remember,
how you was really royal?

1080
01:34:49,927 --> 01:34:52,725
Well, this is our room in the palace.

1081
01:34:52,767 --> 01:34:56,237
Stop talking rubbish, Rosie Burdock.

1082
01:34:56,287 --> 01:34:57,925
Am I?

1083
01:35:10,047 --> 01:35:16,725
Rosie was close-up, salty, an invisible touch
too near to be seen or measured.

1084
01:35:16,767 --> 01:35:22,319
And it seemed that the wagon under which
we lay went floating away like a barge

1085
01:35:22,367 --> 01:35:27,999
out over the valley where we worked unseen,
swinging on motionless tides.

1086
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:33,203
You are the king's son
and I'm the princess.

1087
01:35:34,407 --> 01:35:37,240
All we'd have to do is pull the bell

1088
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:41,166
and servants would come up
with bowls of milk.

1089
01:35:41,207 --> 01:35:42,879
For us to drink?

1090
01:35:42,927 --> 01:35:47,364
No, stupid, for me to wash my feet in.

1091
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:49,204
Then there's breakfast.

1092
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:52,245
Bacon rashers.

1093
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:54,039
Of course.

1094
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:58,683
Fried potatoes, strawberries and eggs.

1095
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,123
What kind of eggs?

1096
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:05,398
Oh, peacock's, I suppose.

1097
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:11,484
I don't think I ever had a peacock's egg.

1098
01:36:11,527 --> 01:36:13,324
Me neither.

1099
01:36:23,287 --> 01:36:24,925
Laurie!

1100
01:36:26,567 --> 01:36:28,717
Where are you, Laurie?

1101
01:36:28,767 --> 01:36:30,962
Laurie Lee?

1102
01:36:31,007 --> 01:36:32,759
Answer me, Laurie!

1103
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:37,363
Right, damn you, I'm going home!

1104
01:36:37,407 --> 01:36:39,204
Laurie?

1105
01:36:40,367 --> 01:36:41,959
Let him go.

1106
01:37:04,607 --> 01:37:06,518
I liked you better than Bill Trimble.

1107
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:08,285
And Boney.

1108
01:37:08,327 --> 01:37:10,761
And the curate.

1109
01:37:10,807 --> 01:37:12,798
You're even prettier than Jo.

1110
01:37:14,007 --> 01:37:15,645
What was Bill like?

1111
01:37:15,687 --> 01:37:17,279
Hopeless.

1112
01:37:21,367 --> 01:37:22,959
How you feeling now?

1113
01:37:23,007 --> 01:37:24,599
Like a giant!

1114
01:37:40,407 --> 01:37:42,045
You're mad, Laurie Lee.

1115
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:44,396
Mad as can be.

1116
01:37:44,447 --> 01:37:47,644
I'm king. I'm king of the world and more.

1117
01:37:47,687 --> 01:37:49,678
I told you.

1118
01:37:51,327 --> 01:37:56,162
I felt magnificent, fateful,
and for the first time in my life,

1119
01:37:56,207 --> 01:37:59,085
invulnerable to the perils of the night.

1120
01:38:00,567 --> 01:38:02,762
But here I lost Rosie for good.

1121
01:38:35,727 --> 01:38:37,922
It was then that I began to sit on my bed

1122
01:38:37,967 --> 01:38:41,676
and to make up poems
from intense abstraction.

1123
01:38:46,767 --> 01:38:50,077
Time squared itself and the village shrank

1124
01:38:50,127 --> 01:38:53,005
and distances crept nearer.

1125
01:38:53,047 --> 01:38:56,756
The sun and moon,
which once rose from our hill,

1126
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:59,719
rose from London now, in the east.

1127
01:39:11,607 --> 01:39:14,326
Now, mind you write, now. Mm?

1128
01:39:16,487 --> 01:39:18,079
Mind you write.

1129
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:30,639
While sisters called me,

1130
01:39:30,687 --> 01:39:34,202
suns rose and fell

1131
01:39:34,247 --> 01:39:38,035
and the poems I made,
which I never remembered,

1132
01:39:38,087 --> 01:39:41,079
were the first and last of that time.
