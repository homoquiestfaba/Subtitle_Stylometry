Happy Thanksgiving.

183
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,329
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

184
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,697
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye!

185
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:08,168
La, la, la...
So should we get a cab?

186
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,302
No, let's take
the shuttle.

187
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,004
A cab will be faster.

188
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,908
I'm not exactly
in a hurry...sis.

189
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,343
[Laughs]

190
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,012
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Come on, sweetie.

191
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,248
We gotta go upstairs.

192
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,217
We are so late.

193
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,253
Oh, God! There's
your grandmama.

194
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,420
Hi, grandma!

195
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:31,124
Come over here, girl, and
give your grandmama some sugar.

196
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,061
You've gotten so big!

197
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,196
Hi, Grace.

198
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,900
You're so skinny.
Ain't you been eating?

199
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:40,934
I eat.

200
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,035
Is Ronnie in the car?

201
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,472
Well, no. He's so sorry, but
he got caught up at work.

202
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,841
Oh...And Michael?

203
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,109
Michael is so busy
at college,

204
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,978
he probably won't be able
to come this weekend.

205
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,481
What do you mean he may not
be able to come this weekend?

206
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,248
It's Thanksgiving!

207
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,017
What do you have
in here? Goodness!

208
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,385
Well, I wanted to make sure
I had enough clothes.

209
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,823
Tony: Wait till you see this,
mom. Come check this out!

210
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,958
Sofia: My feet
are killing me.

211
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,860
Tony: Sorry.

212
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,396
Hey, Gordito.

213
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:15,869
23 pounds. I'm talking about
some fat sandwiches for me.

214
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,238
Hey, Gordo, come here.

215
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,376
Are you sure one will
be big enough?

216
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,179
Yeah, definitely.

217
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,385
I suppose so without
your father here.

218
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,087
Actually, without
your father here,

219
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,889
we'll probably
have leftovers

220
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,891
for the first time.

221
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,253
Hey, Joey!

222
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,288
Hi, Mrs. Avila!

223
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,557
Dad, this is
my teacher.

224
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,524
Hi.

225
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,425
Hello.

226
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,193
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

227
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,063
How do you like
the neighborhood?

228
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,878
Your signal's still on.

229
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:31,511
Huh?

230
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,480
[Loudly]
Your signal's on!

231
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,316
I know.

232
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,087
And why am I not going
to get to see Michael?

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,489
Well, maybe we'll come
out over Christmas.

234
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:47,060
Yeah! Can we, mommy? Can we
go see grandma in Chicago?

235
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,196
If I had a dollar for
every time Ronald said

236
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,265
y'all was comin',
I'd be as rich as Oprah.

237
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,012
Ah...

238
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

239
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,316
Hi, mom.

240
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,353
Come here.
Oh, look at you!

241
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,256
Let me look at you.

242
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:17,925
Good to see you.

243
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,060
Hi, nice to see you again.

244
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:20,994
Hi.

245
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,997
We could have picked you up
at the airport.

246
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,900
Hi, really good
to see you.

247
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,135
Say hello to Marty.

248
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:28,701
Hi, Marty.

249
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,003
So Michael couldn't come

250
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,405
for just a little while
tomorrow?

251
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,578
You want something
to drink?

252
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,612
Oh, sure.

253
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,514
Your brother got me a
brand-new cappuccino maker,

254
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,252
and it makes, it makes
the puffy...The foam

255
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,688
is really great. The milk
foam's really great.

256
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,323
Do you want some cookies?

257
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,525
How about a mallomar?

258
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,296
Herb: It's Rachel's
room.

259
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,470
All right.

260
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,353
[Speaking Vietnamese]

261
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:35,268
It would be so nice
to see you tomorrow.

262
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,716
Hi.
Hey.

263
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,665
I am so tired.

264
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,100
Jenny.

265
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,735
Come in here.

266
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,309
Jenny: What?

267
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,580
What's wrong?

268
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,216
Where have you been?

269
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,418
Studying.

270
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,423
[Laughs]

271
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,092
Why do you have this?

272
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,460
They gave them
out at school.

273
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,228
At school?

274
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,130
Why do schools
give my daughter this?

275
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,465
The nurses give
them to everybody.

276
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,367
I don't have any
use for them.

277
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,434
Look at yourself.

278
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,370
All right, Jenny,
go to your room.

279
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,671
No sense of modesty.

280
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,306
Well, look,
ask the school

281
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,407
if you don't
believe me!

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,109
Go to your room! Now!

283
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,444
I swear, you never
listen to me.

284
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,113
Did I really raise this?

285
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,014
Fine.

286
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,550
Is it a drug?

287
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,753
No! No! No!

288
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,325
Listen, listen to me.

289
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:10,497
Listen to me, and really
hear me this time.

290
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,365
He left.

291
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,534
And as hard
as it is for you,

292
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,237
it's better this way.

293
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,572
I like it like this.

294
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,677
Well, it's too late,
because I've asked him now.

295
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,545
No. No.

296
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,747
You're just going
to have to un-ask him.

297
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,350
Un-ask him. That's it!

298
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,356
How--

299
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,657
Don't!

300
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,293
Did you enjoy
it, Carla?

301
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,596
Oh, it was wonderful.
Thank you very much.

302
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,564
You're welcome.

303
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,366
Do you cook much?

304
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,268
You know, I...I don't
have much time to cook,

305
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,338
and besides, Rachel never
lets me in the kitchen.

306
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,843
Oh, now Art's
wife, Sarah...

307
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,811
She's a really
great cook.

308
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,613
But, you know, she,
with the twins

309
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,582
and everything, she
doesn't get to cook much.

310
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,451
Oh, they must be
getting so big.

311
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,187
Aw, they're great.
They're great.

312
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,423
Hannah, she eats two 
mashed bananas at a time.

313
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,459
And Jessie,
I swear to God,

314
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,894
yesterday she said,
"I love you, grandpa.

315
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,429
"I love you." She
doesn't say "grandpa,"

316
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,331
she says "brandpa."
"I love you, brandpa."

317
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,832
She's too young
to talk.

318
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,203
But he buys them
toys wherever we go.

319
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,171
Oh.

320
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,638
I mean, art's afraid
he's going to spoil them.

321
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,473
It's nice.

322
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,674
It's nice the way
you fuss over them.

323
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,642
They come, every
Tuesday they come,

324
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,378
and by the time
they leave,

325
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,579
I'm completely
exhausted.

326
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,613
I'm on my back.

327
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,317
You should see your father
in the garden with them.

328
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,420
Oh, he's 20 years younger.

329
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,455
Rachel, you should

330
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,191
spend some more time
with the twins.

331
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,458
You're going to miss
them growing up.

332
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,828
Aw, it's the best time,
it's the best time.

333
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,331
Here, let me take that.

334
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,500
We'll go in
the living room.

335
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,535
Oh, by the way,
Sarah gave me

336
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,370
a recipe from her
brother Jerry.

337
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,806
Yeah, Marty, boy.
It's my Marty!

338
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,674
You know, the tall
vegetarian one.

339
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,876
I'm making
roast polenta.

340
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,379
You want some
cake, girls?

341
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,482
Coffee, Herb?

342
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,284
I'll have a coffee.

343
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:11,951
Oh, my God. That dog

344
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,521
is going to get
so fat.

345
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,926
Is that my baby boy?

346
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,727
Is that my mama?

347
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,364
Oh, honey! It's
so good to see you.

348
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,498
How you doing?

349
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,466
Great.

350
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,468
Oh! Oh!

351
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,670
I come all this way,
and you can't even

352
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,872
pick up your own
mama at the airport.

353
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,606
I'm sorry, mama.

354
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,442
I've just been
swamped with work.

355
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,310
Well, I see you
living all right.

356
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,878
You got your
daddy's belly on you.

357
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,249
Oh, boy. I got no time
to work it off.

358
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:46,486
Um, listen. Is everything
all right with Audrey?

359
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,954
She's been putting
all those labels

360
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,357
on all those bowls
for tomorrow.

361
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,392
Now, I may be wrong,
but something

362
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,428
just don't seem
quite right, son.

363
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,896
Everything's
all right, mama.

364
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,398
We've just been
working hard.

365
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,500
We need a break.

366
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,502
And why isn't
Michael coming?

367
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,371
Now, his grandma
ain't gonna be around

368
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,572
too much longer.

369
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,275
And I don't know
how many trips to L.A.

370
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,442
I got in me.

371
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,643
Don't be crazy, mama.

372
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,245
You're just
getting started.

373
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,313
You should get
some sleep.

374
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,248
You've got
to be tired.

375
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,115
Go ahead
and get some rest.

376
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,584
Then good night,
Ronald.

377
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,486
Good night, mama.

378
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,886
I can't believe we
still have to do this

379
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,422
every time we come.

380
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,390
I like it.
It makes me feel like

381
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,959
I'm doing
something naughty.

382
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,962
Oh, God.

383
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,065
Hey, honey-pie...

384
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,434
Oh, my God.

385
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,602
Can we talk about
what this "disco sucks"

386
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,503
T-shirt means?

387
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,505
Oh, my gosh,
do I look awful?

388
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,442
No, you look gorgeous,
but who's the slut?

389
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,876
That's Amy.

390
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,511
I was 12.

391
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,647
She was a little whore.

392
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,015
We must have done
something wrong.

393
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,985
Oh, don't be
ridiculous, Herb.

394
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,755
[Sniffle]

395
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,526
Maybe it was that
kibbutz we sent her to.

396
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,728
With all the girls...

397
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,468
Is anything
wrong, honey?

398
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,869
Oh, sweetie.

399
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,442
They're doing their
best, you know?

400
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,745
Maybe they don't even
think about it anymore.

401
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,549
Both: Yeah, they do.

402
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,420
They think about it
all the time.

403
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,371
Now, honey, what
if they separate?

404
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,542
I think the house
is in Carla's name.

405
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:26,078
Why doesn't Jimmy want
to come home anymore?

406
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,847
For what?

407
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,416
What's happening
to my children

408
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,884
in this country?

409
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,589
Jimmy doesn't want
to come home.

410
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,492
Gary gets thrown
out of school.

411
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,162
My daughter
is disrespectful.

412
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,499
And Joey will grow up
just the same.

413
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,162
Why do you want
to make the turkey

414
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,032
taste like everything
else we eat?

415
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,233
Why do you want
everything

416
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,035
to taste
like McDonald's?

417
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,671
Get the door, Jenny.
Get the oven door.

418
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,205
OK, OK.

419
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,508
Whoa.

420
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,955
Oy. Turkey,
turkey, turkey.

421
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,957
Get that dog
away from here.

422
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,559
Go, go, go.

423
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,964
Oh, it's beautiful.

424
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,903
Take the vegetables
and you put them

425
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,772
right into roast.

426
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:06,873
Mm-hmm.

427
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,140
And you use your
hands like that?

428
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,209
Use your hands.
Get your hands dirty.

429
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,178
Why not? That's
half the fun of it.

430
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,245
Because this--

431
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,614
My nails.

432
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,650
This makes the
gravy incredible.

433
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,919
Tony? Come here
and help me

434
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,287
get this turkey
in the oven

435
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,723
before Abuela
gets here.

436
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,297
Good morning,
Grace.

437
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,231
Good morning.

438
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,566
Did you sleep OK?

439
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,735
Oh! Oh, yes,
I slept fine.

440
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:40,306
Well, that's it.
It's ready to go in.

441
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,044
You sure that's
big enough?

442
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,313
Mm-hmm.

443
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,281
When the kids
were growing up,

444
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,918
we used to get
three turkeys.

445
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,253
'Cause they'd
all be fighting

446
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,022
over the white meat.

447
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,790
How did you
ever manage?

448
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:00,760
Thanksgiving is the
easiest meal to make.

449
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,128
Just take that turkey,

450
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,162
throw it in the oven,

451
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,698
and the rest
will cook itself.

452
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,234
Excuse me.

453
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,902
Where's Ronnie?

454
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,238
He's where
he always is.

455
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,006
He's at work.

456
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,910
That's terrible!
It's Thanksgiving!

457
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,246
The governor
had a photo op

458
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,381
at the Hollywood
Presbyterian,

459
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,985
passing out turkey
dinners to the homeless.

460
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,087
He's at church?

461
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,256
Well, that's
all right then.

462
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,659
All right.

463
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,260
That's all right.

464
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,629
Got any whipped
cream for my coffee?

465
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,665
TV Commentator:
Right behind him,

466
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,299
it's Garfield!

467
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,601
Yeah.

468
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,271
Oh, Gary!
What a pig!

469
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,340
This is so disgusting.

470
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,044
Let's get this stuff.

471
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,048
Eww!

472
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,184
[Grandmother
speaking Vietnamese]

473
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,952
It's a cat.

474
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,075
Duc: Oh, Jenny.
Can you, uh...

475
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,276
Open up the store?

476
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,912
I'll be along in
a little while.

477
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,646
It won't be busy.

478
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,948
TV Commentator:
Oh! Oh!

479
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,350
Here we have our big
caterpillar coming up.

480
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,186
I believe he's about
55 feet long.

481
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,321
That's one of the
biggest balloon

482
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,223
in the parade,
I understand.

483
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,692
What's with you?
Where the hell--

484
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,292
Ruth: Shhh!

485
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,294
Where the hell
you going?

486
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,263
Ruth! Ruth!

487
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,132
They can come out
for breakfast!

488
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,333
Herbie, please.

489
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,035
Shhh.

490

Ruth: Rachel, honey.

491

492
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,076
Rachel,
it's your mom.

493

Oh, forget it.
Get back.

494
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,148

Um, I--I brought you
some cappuccinos.

500
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,002
Thanks.

501
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,404
And, um, the turkey's
almost ready

502
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,940
to go in the oven.
OK?

503
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,209
OK.

00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,020
I can't believe that.

507
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,255
I know.

508
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,356
I'm in the crack again.

509
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,759
All night I was
in the crack.

511
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,897
Well, what--
what do you expect?

00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,100
Please, Herbie,
please.

513
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,267

They could've had

514

That's a nice
looking tree.

I know.

into gardening.

Hello, hello.
Welcome.

finally meet you.

How's my little sister?

Damn. What are you
eating at Berkeley?

534
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:03,469
You're getting
heavy.

535
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,437
Shut up, Tony.
Tony, Jimmy.

536

came in the door

right to the kitchen.

Hey, is that
Gina's boyfriend?

542
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,919
Yeah, why?

543
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,621
I didn't know he was
gonna be Chinese and shit.

544
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,622
Neither did I.

545
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,992
Now shut up
and watch the game.

546
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,827
Gina:
Come, here, baby!

547
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,397
You know you have to

548
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,399
bring her back
though, right?

549
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,434
Bye, Maria!

550
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,141
And then I put
the pepper...

551
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,575
Heh heh heh!

552
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,112
Jimmy, can I get you
something to drink?

553
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,246
Water would be great.

554
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,947
Oh, mama,
sit down.

555
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,448
I'll get it.
Here, take her.

556
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,517
Oh, don't worry,
don't worry.

557
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,419
[Crying]

558
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,355
[Women cooing]

559
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,957
So where are
you from, Jimmy?

560
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,359
Uh, I was born
in Vietnam.

561
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,896
Oh, no, that's
not what I mean.

562
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,664
I mean, Gina told me

563
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,366
that your family
lives in L.A.

564
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,603
Oh, yeah. They live
in Westminster.

565
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,572
Ah.

566
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,547
Hey, would you two
like to take a nap

567
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,018
or a shower or something?
Freshen up?

568
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,421
Oh, bring the baby back.

569
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,157
Ok, and then get Jimmy

570
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,658
a couple of towels,
all right?

571
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:33,926
Get the nice ones!

572
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,662
Thank you,
Mrs. Avila.

573
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:41,100
Hi, I need
to talk to you.

574
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,369
No, no, no, no.

575
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,570
No, I'm not,
I'm not.

576
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:48,374
Um, just--
just come soon, OK?

577
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,060
[Giggling]

578
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,162
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

579
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,031
Your cousins
and mom are outside.

580
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:12,631
They're busy.

581
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,567
Listen,
listen to me.

582
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,703
[Knock at door]

583
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,406
Gina?

584
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,476
I knew it.
I trusted you.

585
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,212
Would either of you

586
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,380
like something
to eat?

587
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,349
Jimmy: Uh, that's--

588
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,217
That's OK, Mrs. Avila.

589
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,020
We had some bagels
on the way down here.

590
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,321
Ok, well,

591
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,422
just let me know

592
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,489
if you need
anything.

593
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:40,726
[Whispers] Shit!

594
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,395
That was funny.

595
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,399
Not as funny
as this!

596
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,402
You know, they haven't
spoken in over a year?

597
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,205
It's terrible.
That's it, Carla.

598
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,240
Just make sure
it goes

599
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,207
all the way
in the back.

600
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,743
Mmm, that's
my favorite part.

601
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,611
I mean, our
only grandson

602
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,380
not circumcised yet.

603
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,614
It's a shanda.

604
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,284
A-and they spoke
to that moyel

605
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,752
in Beverly Hills
about the bris

606
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,419
and everything.

607
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,321
But it's up
to his parents.

608
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,157
No, no, it's tradition.

609
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,258
Yeah, you
invited them

610
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,293
because you feel
sorry for them.

611
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,361
I invited them

612
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,163
because everyone
who lives

613
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,430
in that
retirement home

614
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,367
has no place to go
during the holidays,

615
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,536
and so we couldn't
do that to them.

616
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,372
Still,
you should not

617
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,273
be talking
to their kids.

618
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,708
Oh, well, your father's
side of the family

619
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,346
have never ever been
good listeners.

620
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,414
All right, Carla?

621
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,183
Could you please
get the oven?

622
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,117
Sure.

623
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,419
All right,
let's put it in.

624
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,420
Here we go.

625
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,356
All right,
on 1, 2, 3.

626
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,424
Ok, I got it.

627
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,759
Oh, my God,
it's heavy.

628
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,662
It's very hot.

629
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,698
Easy!

630
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,733
Oy, oy, oy.

631
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,268
There we go.

632
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:58,770
Looks pretty,
huh?

633
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:17,356
It's about, uh...

634
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,492
It's about
100 degrees now.

635
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:21,860
I like to usually
keep it

636
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,197
around 104, 105.

637
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,266
We have a jacuzzi
at my gym, but I never--

638
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,468
I go in
every night. I--

639
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,437
It's good
for the circulation,

640
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,472
but you can't
stay in too long

641
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,141
because
it's not good

642
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,476
for the kidneys.

643
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,312
You know
Michael Landon

644
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,681
from, uh,
from Bonanza?

645
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,250
Uh-huh?

646
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,083
He was Jewish.

647
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:48,254
The whole Cartwright
family was Jewish.

648
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,557
Oyster and shiitake
mushroom dressing?

649
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,726
Hmm. Never heard
of that before.

650
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,463
These friends
of yours...

651
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:58,630
Don't they
have families

652
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,167
to be with today?

653
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,303
James' parents
are passed on, OK?

654
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,639
Paula's family
is in Montana.

655
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,342
Well, isn't Michael
gonna at least call?

656
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:11,777
Or do you just
talk to each other

657
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,413
on the e-mail now?

658
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,647
We'll call him
in a while.

659
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,816
Mommy, when the Turkey
gonna be ready?

660
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,686
It's almost done.
What are you doing?

661
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,322
You know, I could
whip up a batch

662
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,556
of macaroni
and cheese.

663
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,425
You know,
every once in a while

664
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,429
it's good to try
something brand new.

665
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,832
Well...

666
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,434
I hope you put
enough cinnamon

667
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,203
on that
apple pie.

That's it, ladies.
You got me

674

of the weekend.

peel the potatoes.

to get ready.

679

I gotta go.

680
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:04,663
Well, I hope

681
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:05,697
you're not
expecting

and cheese.

you ladies come up with

685
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,237
will be fine with me.

Yeah, shiitake
mushroom dressing

687
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,341
or something
like that.

688
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,676
I cannot
do this.

689
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,644
What's wrong, honey?

690
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,246
I cannot do this
all alone.

691
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:24,250
Look, I'm sorry.
The photo shoot went over.

692

She keeps going on
and on about Michael.

693

of things to say to her.

694
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:30,422
Well, what do you
want me to do, Audrey?

695
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:34,993
Well, it's your fault
he's not coming, Ronald.

696
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,428
What can I do?

697

you shit ice cream.

698
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,366

No.

Look, baby--

701
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,903
What?

702
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,274
I resent you putting
me in this position.

703
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,007
I resent it,

704
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,842
and today I'm really
feeling it.

705
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,745
Look, I will
take care of my mother

706
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,447
from here on out, OK?

707
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:58,984
I will tell her
something.

708
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,321
Come on, come on,
this is Thanksgiving.

709
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,356
We'll get through this.

710
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,658
OK?

711
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,728
Look,
just hang in there.

712
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:13,832
I'm gonna go get changed.
I'll be right back.

714
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,479
There we go.

Audrey: Watch this.
Look at this.

716
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,454
No, Gordo!

when you were

I'll tell you.

Ow!

Jimmy: Mrs. Avila,
do you mean up here?

721
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,657
Yeah, the ones
in the back.

722
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,461
Uh, those.
Thank you, sweetheart.

723
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,971
[Women laughing]

724
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,824
It's true.
It's true.

725
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,359
Thank you,
Jimmy.

726
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,866
Oh, you!

727
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,036
Get out
of my kitchen!

728
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,583
You guys
want a beer?

729
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,556
You better not
be a 49ers fan.

730
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,492
No, no, no!
He was out.

731
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:03,562
It's incomplete.
He was out!

732
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,664
Watch! It was
incomplete.

733
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,566
Come here
for sec.

734
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,634
No, no, no, no.

735
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,770
Watch, right now,
right now.

736
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,872
See? Yes, told you!

737
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,106
Yes, yes, look it!

738
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,508
No, no, no no!

739
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,844
Ha ha ha!

740
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:19,778
What's up?

741
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,813
Tell me
the truth, Tony.

742
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,082
How's mom been?

743
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,817
She seems fine.

744
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,253
Yeah, but do you
think she's OK?

745
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,120
Well, she looks

746
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,288
a lot better
than dad.

747
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,557
You saw dad?

748
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,859
Yesterday
at the supermarket.

749
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,595
He looks like shit.

750
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:40,165
It's over
with auntie Rosa.

751
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,668
He knows
he screwed up,

752
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:43,501
all right, Gina?

753
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,537
Yeah, well, screwing up
is one thing,

754
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:46,738
but not with
your wife's cousin.

755
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,576
I mean, that shit's
beyond screwed up, Tony.

756
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,211
Well, I kind of
invited him

757
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,913
over today.

758
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,748
What?!

759
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:57,883
You know, it's over,

760
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,250
and he has
no place to go,

761
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,218
so I thought--

762
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,320
How could you be
so stupid, Tony?

763
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,189
Hey, mom's already
freaked out

764
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,625
and yelled
at me, OK?

765
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,327
Well, did you tell him
not to come?

766
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,129
Yeah.

767
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,165
I left a message
on his machine.

768
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,735
OK? Happy?

769
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,840
[Men arguing]

770
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:25,043
Carla:
Good. Good!

771
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,178
Yeah, Rachel
sends her love.

772
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,849
No, it's beautiful
and sunny here.

773
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,686
What? It's
already snowing?

774
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,221
How's the leg, mom?

775
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,891
Ok, just don't
overdo it.

776
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:42,260
It's nice she gets on
so well with her mother.

777
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,195
Oh, she's lovely.

778
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,330
We don't get
to see her enough,

779
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,698
but I'd really
like you

780
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,567
to meet her someday.

781
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,370
You know...

782
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,072
All my life

783
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:58,076
all I ever wanted
for you was...

784
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,846
To be happy.

785
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,848
To meet somebody special

786
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:06,985
and--and just
have a family.

787
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,320
Oh, mom, I am happy.

788
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:14,192
Carla makes me
very, very happy.

789
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,230
James:
Wait a minute.

790
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,365
Come on, Monica.

791
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,066
I am coming!

792
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,034
Don't talk to Paula
like that.

793
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:26,204
Hi, Audrey,
happy Thanksgiving.

794
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,106
You remember
Monica, don't you?

795
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,274
Yes, hi, Monica.

796
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:29,941
Sorry, Audrey.

797
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,142
We would've
told you sooner,

798
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,077
but Monica
just arrived.

799
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,411
Oh, nonsense!
Monica, welcome.

800
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,213
Your father
doesn't bring you

801
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,381
often enough.

802
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,416
He mother dropped her
off this morning.

803
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,417
They had another
falling out.

804
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,319
She has been
a pain in the ass.

805
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:45,123
She can sit next to
my mother-in-law.

806
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,927
Presenting
señor turkey!

807
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,296
All: Ooh!

808
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:55,967
Is it cooked?

809
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:56,634
Looks good
to me.

810
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:59,337
Eh, could go
back in, maybe.

811
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,305
Let's be on
the safe side.

812
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,340
Let me baste it again.
We'll put it back in

813
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,910
just for
a few minutes.

814
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,377
Anthony: You want
another beer?

815
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,980
Jimmy: No,
that's it.

816
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,786
So, do you have
a big family?

817
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,922
I have, you know,
two little brothers

818
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:18,256
and a sister.

819
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,291
My grandparents
live with us, too.

820
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,760
Yeah?

821
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,795
Are you guys tight?

822
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,731
Yeah.

823
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,933
Should we go inside
and give 'em a hand?

824
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,001
Yeah.

825
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,174
Do you like
Jackie Chan?

826
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,308
Yeah, sure.

827
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,978
That boy
is hell of a crazy,

828
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,448
jumping off
of helicopters, buses,

829
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,351
hanging from poles.

830
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,219
Yeah,
he's pretty bad.

831
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:51,389
Yeah, but he's
not as bad as Bruce.

832
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,325
Bruce Lee
is the baddest.

833
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,394
Right?

834
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,196
Yeah?

835
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,430
No one
can touch Bruce.

836
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,799
Uh-uh.

837
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:01,800
Sophie!

838
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,401
Sweetie, can I
have another beer?

839
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:06,772
Sophie: Why don't you
get it yourself?

840
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,311
You tell Audrey
about Michael?

841
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,512
No.

842
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,415
She worries about
him enough as it is.

843
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,350
She's still mad,
then?

844
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,385
It's gettin' better.

845
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,220
Yeah?

846
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,223
Just wish Michael
would grow up, though.

847
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,893
[Sighs] Good luck.

848
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,895
[Chuckles]

849
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:33,198
You know Michael's
not coming?

850
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,767
I was afraid to ask.

851
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,936
They're still
not speaking, huh?

852
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:38,904
No.

853
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:42,340
Well, I guess you can't
call yourself a family

854
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,542
if someone isn't
speaking to someone else.

855
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,912
Ha.

856
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:58,289
Do you want to play
Thanksgiving with us?

857
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,793
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do less.

858
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:05,363
Now you be the mommy,
and I'll be the daddy.

859
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,966
Wow. This is sick.

860
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:11,536

twisted, you know that?

Grace: Kristen.

862
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,175
What are y'all
playin', honey?

863
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,243
Play with us,
grandma.

864
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,078
We're playing
Thanksgiving.

865
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,013
Oh, how nice.

866
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24,349
Yeah.
She's the mommy,

867
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,216
she's the daddy,

868
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,453
and I'm the alcoholic,
cult-worshipping,

870
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:33,324
Oh.

Mmm. Hi.

00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:47,939
Hi.

874
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,340
Are you OK?

875
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,042
Well, I made it
through your dad's

876

dissertation
on hot tubs.

877
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:53,879
Oh.

Ha ha ha.

00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,347
Mom sends her best.
How are you doing?

880
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,517
[Sighs]
I almost told her.

881
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,318
What happened?

882
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,321
She burst into tears
about something.

883
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:07,258
She doesn't want my aunt
and uncle to know about us.

884
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:09,928
The uncle who's
having the affair

885
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:11,162
with the mistress.

886
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:13,464
Yes.

887
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:15,566
Oh, God.

888
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,267
Mmm.

889
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:18,403
Please, don't--
don't let them

890
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:19,237
pull you
into an argument

891
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,308
and don't sit
next to my Uncle David,

892
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,310
because he doesn't
chew his food properly,

893
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:29,414
and it drips all down his...
It's disgusting.

Show time.

896
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,320
You'll be fine.

897
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,321
We'll have fun.

898
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,924
OK.
Come on.

01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:57,954
Michael: You know that.

1436
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,456
[Talking]

1437
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,392
Michael, you remember
Paula, James.

1438
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:04,494
Audrey: This is Monica,
James' daughter.

1439
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:06,363
How you doing?

1440
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:12,402
Here you are, sweetie.

1441
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:13,337
Thank you, mom.

1442
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,339
Give him plenty
of turkey.

1443
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:16,673
This boy looks
like he needs

1444
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,074
a little
home cooking.

1445
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,509
You're crazy.

1446
01:11:19,543 --> 01:11:20,744
Dark meat.

1447
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,312
So you changed your mind?

1448
01:11:22,346 --> 01:11:24,414
You should've called.
Let us know you were coming.

1449
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:28,918
Nonsense. Ronald, he doesn't
need to call to come home.

1450
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,721
[Chuckles quietly]

1451
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,326
Would you like some
macaroni and cheese?

1452
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,396
Grandma, you made
the macaroni and cheese?

1453
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,997
Yeah, baby.
Yeah.

1454
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,031
Michael: Looks good.

1455
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:48,472
This is Moroccan fruit
compote, sweetie. Oops. Ha!

1456
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:49,406
Thanks, ma.

1457
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:50,874
Ah, it is good.

1458
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,885
I knew you made it,
grandma.

1459
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,853
Yeah.

1460
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:07,891
[Javier speaking Spanish]

1461
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,460
Javier: Jimmy.

1462
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,995
[Imitates Bruce Lee]

1463
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:56,506
Hey, Julio Lee.

1464
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,173
[Laughter]

1465
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,141
You know who
that was, right?

1466
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,976
You know who
I'm doing, right?

1467
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,412
That's pretty good.

1468
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:03,146
Yeah.

1469
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,981
[Laughter]

1470
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:07,484
Here's to Bruce.

1471
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:08,552
Yeah.

1472
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:11,120
[Talking]

1473
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:17,427
Sarah, can I help you
with the baby?

1474
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,327
We're fine.

1475
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,430
All right, everybody.
Here. Take seconds.

1476
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:21,498
Ruth: Don't be shy.

1477
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:24,133
I want to know
everything about you.

1478
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,034
Where were you born?

1479
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,504
And then, where were
you living after that?

1480
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,574
And don't you just
love Los Angeles?

1481
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,909
Um, is this
your first time?

1482
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,811
No. Actually, I've
been here once before.

1483
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:37,981
I like it. I just don't
think I could live here.

1484
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,015
Everything's
so spread out.

1485
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,451
It used to be
in L.A.,

1486
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:42,552
everything was
20 minutes away.

1487
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,954
Now it's 24-hours-
a-day traffic.

1488
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:45,922
Must be really hard
to meet people.

1489
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:49,693
People don't even know
who their neighbors are.

1490
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:55,231
Well, how did you and
Rachel become roommates?

1491
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,166
Are you school friends?

1492
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,635
Carla: Uh, no.
We met at work.

1493
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,470
Yeah. Carla started
with the company

1494
01:14:00,504 --> 01:14:01,404
3 weeks before I did.

1495
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:06,476
She actually owns
the house that we live in.

1496
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,177
Oh.

1497
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:09,112
Jerry--

1498
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:13,249
So you also work in
the San Francisco area?

1499
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,151
Mm-hmm.

1500
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,955
Jerry, did you
enjoy the polenta?

1501
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:19,656
It's delicious.
Thanks.

1502
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:20,456
Why don't you
have some more?

1503
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,826
I'll take some more.
That'd be great.

1504
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:28,064
Is that what that is?
I thought it was jell-o.

1505
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:30,033
Ruth: Bea.

1506
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,035
[Laughter]

1507
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,771
It kind of looks
like Jell-o.

1508
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:38,207
Herb: Bea...
Ha ha ha.

1509
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:25,188
And, Paula,
now it's your turn.

1510
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:29,993
Oh, well, I guess
I'm most thankful

1511
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,961
that we're all healthy--

1512
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:32,962
Hear, hear.

1513
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,799
That nothing terrible
has happened to any of us,

1514
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:39,302
and that we have good
friends who invited us over,

1515
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:43,006
so I didn't have to spend
the last three days cooking.

1516
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,141
[All laugh]

1517
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,343
Ronnie?

1518
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:52,181
Well, I'm thankful

1519
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,318
for having the best
mother and wife

1520
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:58,822
and children
in the world.

1521
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,594
Grace: Michael?

1522
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:07,697
I'm just glad to be home.

1523
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,803
Grace: And--

1524
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:15,104
Monica: Monica.

1525
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:17,306
You're last.

1526
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:24,347
I'd like to thank
our fellow Native Americans

1527
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,385
who gave us this land
in exchange for measles,

1528
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,254
reservations, and casinos,

1529
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:34,223
so we could have all this
food to celebrate it with.

1530
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,358
Monica, please.

1531
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:38,294
More like thanks-taking,
don't you think?

1532
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:41,164
OK. Very good.

1533
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,232
Paula: OK.

1534
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:47,236
So, Michael, what have
you been up to lately?

1535
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,271
I'm keeping busy.

1536
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:52,608
He's my first grandson
to go to college, you know.

1537
01:16:55,812 --> 01:16:59,916
Uh, grandma. Um,
I'm taking some time off.

1538
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,251
Grace: What? You quit?

1539
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:03,653
No. I didn't quit.

1540
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,321
Why didn't somebody
tell me?

1541
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,157
Grace, a lot of kids
take the semester off

1542
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:10,126
to decide
what they want to do.

1543
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,161
Well, I thought you
were doing so well.

1544
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:12,862
I am.

1545
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:13,562
Ronald: Well,
you did register

1546
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,364
for the spring
semester, right?

1547
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,900
Dad, you know
I'm not going back.

1548
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,803
Honey, you're taking
time off, and that's OK.

1549
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:21,838
Ronald: You know,
UC Santa Barbara

1550
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,439
has a well-respected
business school.

1551
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,341
Dad, there's
no black people there.

1552
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,744
You tell me what you're
gonna do with a degree

1553
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:32,048
in African-American
studies, young man. Hmm?

1554
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:32,949
Ronald.

1555
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:33,616
Ronald: What?

1556
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,085
Can we talk
about it later?

1557
01:17:39,923 --> 01:17:42,992
So, Ronald, did you watch
the news last night?

1558
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,361
All three stations led
with the paint thing.

1559
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,763
I have strict
orders from my wife

1560
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:48,364
not to talk
about work.

1561
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,433
He deserves it.

1562
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,236
Thank you, Monica.

1563
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,704
So, Michael,

1564
01:17:54,738 --> 01:17:58,341
how do you feel about
the whole ebonics thing?

1565
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:01,044
[Laughs]

1566
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:07,316
I like you.

1567
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:11,220
I mean, why did they throw
paint on his nice suit?

1568
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:14,190
Didn't Rhodes
grow up around here?

1569
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:16,359
Sure he did. His father
used to own a store

1570
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,461
around the corner
from us.

1571
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,830
You know
what I like about him?

1572
01:18:20,864 --> 01:18:23,299
He says what he thinks,

1573
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:26,770
and he doesn't care
what anybody else says.

1574
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:27,603
Oh, come on, dad.

1575
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:31,274
Bea: I was born
and raised in Fairfax,

1576
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,809
and now, I'm afraid
to come home.

1577
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:35,344
It was never
like that before.

1578
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,247
His entire campaign was
playing on people's fears.

1579
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:39,983
David: You know
what I think?

1580
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,051
I think someone
should speak up

1581
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:43,086
for the ordinary
people.

1582
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,120
I mean,
there's a limit

1583
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:45,021
to how many
foreigners

1584
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,522
this country
can accommodate.

1585
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,490
Um--

1586
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:48,291
Don't.

1587
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:51,227
Well, you know
what I like about him?

1588
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,061
He's an honest man.

1589
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:54,898
He's not like every
other politician.

1590
01:18:54,931 --> 01:18:56,332
They're all
exactly the same.

1591
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:57,767
Some are just
a little more

1592
01:18:57,801 --> 01:18:58,701
dangerous
than others.

1593
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,037
Now, if we don't have
some strong leadership

1594
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:01,737
in this state,

1595
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:02,638
it's gonna
collapse on itself.

1596
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,408
You know what makes me mad?
The graffiti.

1597
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:09,212
It makes everything
look so ugly. I just--

1598
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,314
Dad, don't you think
he's a little extreme?

1599
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,850
Herb: Well, he should
do whatever it takes

1600
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:15,351
to stop what's going on.

1601
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:20,556
I mean, there's so many
people on welfare now.

1602
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,392
There's drugs, the gangs,
come on!

1603
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:24,160
It's got to be stopped.

1604
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:30,299
But he's a racist,
anti-gay bigot.

1605
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:44,848
I didn't even ask Jimmy
what he was eating today.

1606
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:48,885
I wonder if the cafeteria
would be open?

1607
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:51,554
Elizabeth:
Thank you, sweetie.

1608
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:54,924
So, Jimmy,
what's your family do?

1609
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,293
They own a video store.

1610
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:59,595
Oh. Have they met Gina yet?

1611
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,298
I'm gonna meet
them at Christmas.

1612
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:06,035
I remember when I met
your mother's family.

1613
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,003
Remember, grandma?

1614
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:12,408
I was so afraid of grandpa
that I couldn't eat,

1615
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:13,409
and Lizzy,

1616
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,879
she fixed me a little
care package to take home

1617
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:17,480
so I wouldn't go to bed
without eating.

1618
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:19,115
Remember that?

1619
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,884
Mm-hmm.

1620
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,853
[Grandma Avila
speaks Spanish]

1621
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:26,355
If grandpa
were alive...

1622
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:53,950
Lizzy, look.
That's over now, all right?

1623
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:57,486
I made a big mistake.
That's all.

1624
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,556
You're glad
I've come, right?

1625
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:02,191
Javier,

1626
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:07,130
it was Anthony who
invited you, not I.

1627
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:08,231
He did it for us.

1628
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:13,102
They want us
to be together now.

1629
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:16,305
I miss you so much.

1630
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:23,980
Could you take these out
before they get cold?

1631
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:25,181
Sure.

1632
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:28,985
You still take
my breath away.

1633
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:33,522
[Doorbell rings]

1634
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:36,159
Anthony: I'll get it.

1635
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:40,229
Anthony: Hi.
Can I help you?

1636
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:42,398
Daniel: Yeah.
Is Elizabeth here?

1637
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:44,167
Anthony: Mom.

1638
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,469
Hey.

1639
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:50,273
Pies.

1640
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:51,207
Thank you.

1641
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,344
Would you take these
in the kitchen, please?

1642
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:58,381
Feeling strong?

1643
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,348
Yeah.

1644
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:01,617
Good.

1645
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:08,657
Elizabeth: Everyone,

1646
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:11,427
I'd like you to meet Daniel.

1647
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,262
Hi, everyone.

1648
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:16,465
Elizabeth: Come.
Sit over here by me.

1649
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:19,302
Daniel: Hi.

1650
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:22,171
Elizabeth:
Come on over here.

1651
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:24,540
Anthony, would you
bring a chair?

1652
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:25,341
I need another cushion

1653
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,177
for that awful,
awful orange chair.

1654
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:29,645
Daniel: Thanks.

1655
01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:31,480
Elizabeth:
Will that be all right?

1656
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:32,648
Daniel: Oh, it'll be fine.

1657
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,450
Elizabeth: Oh! All right.

1658
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:36,352
Is there any more wine
on the table?

1659
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:40,389
No. Anthony, would you go
in and get some more wine

1660
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:44,994
and also a glass
for Daniel? Thank you.

1661
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,132
This is my son
Anthony.

1662
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:50,066
Hey. How you doing, man?

1663
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:53,302
And this is my
daughter Gina.

1664
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,270
Hi, Gina.

1665
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,371
And this is

1666
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,440
my daughter's
boyfriend Jimmy.

1667
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:02,578
And I'm Javier,
her husband. Who are you?

1668
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:07,183
I'm a teacher at
Elizabeth's school.

1669
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,324
Michael.
Hmm?

1670
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:18,194
Please do not push
your father's buttons today.

1671
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:19,762
No politics, all right?

1672
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,364
All right.

1673
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:23,432
So what are you
doing now, Michael?

1674
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:26,735
I'm working as a teacher's
aide in Inglewood,

1675
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:29,272
saving up to go to Howard.

1676
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:32,308
Isn't that all
the way in D.C.?

1677
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,343
Yep.

1678
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,779
You think Howard's
gonna accept someone

1679
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,447
who doesn't finish
what they start?

1680
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:39,382
Why do you want to go

1681
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:41,350
clear across the country
to isolate yourself

1682
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:42,385
at an all-black school,
anyway?

1683
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,820
Why are you always so
critical of anything black?

1684
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,391
You're working for a man who
sold out affirmative action.

1685
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:51,227
He is saying the same
thing that I am saying.

1686
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,128
Do for yourself.

1687
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:54,430
Don't expect anybody
else to do it for you.

1688
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:55,364
Oh, come on, dad.

1689
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,300
There's always been
preferential treatment.

1690
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:00,136
It just depends on who you
know and where you come from.

1691
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:02,505
See, what I'm talking
about here is access.

1692
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,273
But you don't think
your mother and I

1693
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:05,541
worked for all this?

1694
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,443
I'll tell you this.

1695
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:09,612
If it wasn't for
"affirmative action,"

1696
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:12,281
you wouldn't have
your boy Colin Powell now,

1697
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:14,083
now would you?

1698
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:15,451
Michael, what
Mr. Rhodes is saying

1699
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,553
has nothing to do
with being a black

1700
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,422
or white or democrat
or republican.

1701
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:20,055
It has to do

1702
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:21,290
with taking
responsibility

1703
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:22,057
for your own action.

1704
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,593
Like the way
you walked out on mom?

1705
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:25,228
Paula: Monica.

1706
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,662
Well, it's true,
isn't it?

1707
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:27,430
Monica, please.

1708
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:30,333
This is not the time
or the place.

1709
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:33,169
How could you be
such a hypocrite, dad?

1710
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,738
Michael, don't talk to
your father like that.

1711
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:38,107
No, no, no, no.
That's all right.

1712
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:40,276
He's just got
no respect anymore.

1713
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:41,244
Why don't you tell

1714
01:24:41,277 --> 01:24:45,281
everybody what you did
yesterday, Michael? Hmm?

1715
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:49,318
If I wasn't there, you'd
be in jail right now.

1716
01:24:49,352 --> 01:24:50,653
Michael.

1717
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:51,854
What did he do?

1718
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:55,291
Oh, he was the one that threw
the paint on Governor Rhodes.

1719
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:56,024
All right!

1720
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:58,361
Monica, for
God's sake, please!

1721
01:24:58,394 --> 01:25:01,830
Michael, that's
not right, honey.

1722
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:04,467
Your daddy works so hard
for all of you all.

1723
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,170
Yeah? Well, ask him
why he's always working.

1724
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:09,272
Michael,
that is enough.

1725
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:11,240
Yeah.
Ask him who Lisa is.

1726
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:17,280
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

1727
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:22,585
Excuse me.

1728
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,920
Michael:
Mom, I'm sorry.

1729
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,755
Ronald:
You happy now?

1730
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,457
Mom, I am so sorry.

1731
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:29,292
It's time
for dessert.

1732
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:32,495
I shouldn't have
said that. I'm sorry.

1733
01:25:33,496 --> 01:25:37,800
Somebody,
please tell me.

1734
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:42,805
Mom found out that dad had
been seeing a woman at work.

1735
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:47,276
Oh, I knew you were keeping
something from me, honey.

1736
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,344
It's over.

1737
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:51,414
I just--oh, my Lord, honey.
You can't get a divorce.

1738
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:53,416
The affair
is over.

1739
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:54,483
Yeah, right.

1740
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:57,320
Ron! Boy!

1741
01:25:57,353 --> 01:26:00,889
Mom, you don't
have to stay with him.

1742
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:02,525
What is wrong with you?

1743
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:05,561
Why you acting like this?
You're acting so weak.

1744
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:11,267
Weak? Trying to hold this
family together is weak?

1745
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,637
Sometimes I think it's
never the fucking shit

1746
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,604
I have to put up with,

1747
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:17,973
but you and Kristen mean
more to me than that.

1748
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,377
Tell me how I'm weak.

1749
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,381
Grace: Shame on you!

1750
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,616
You're leaving.

1751
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:34,857
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm sorry.

1752
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,873
I'm sorry, mom.

1753
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,781
Just gonna eat?

1754
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:01,517
[Crying]

1755
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:14,397
Mrs. Williams.

1756
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:21,870
Ronald Williams, how could
you have done this, son?

1757
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:23,972
Mama, God knows

1758
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,574
how sorry I am
for betraying them.

1759
01:27:25,608 --> 01:27:29,512
Sorry is one thing. How
you planning on fixing it?

1760
01:27:29,545 --> 01:27:31,980
I don't know.

1761
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:34,683
I've been trying.

1762
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:37,486
I know I've hurt
them very badly.

1763
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,321
I mean, Michael's

1764
01:27:38,354 --> 01:27:39,355
already given up on
me, and I'm scared

1765
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:40,856
Audrey's
gonna go next.

1766
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:43,459
Think about why
she's still here.

1767
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:47,396
Give her
that much respect.

1768
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:54,570
Well, I must say,

1769
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:58,341
Hannah and Jessica are
absolutely beautiful.

1770
01:27:58,374 --> 01:27:59,007
Thank you.

1771
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:00,609
When is
the next one coming?

1772
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:03,412
Well, we have
our hands full

1773
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:04,513
till these two
are 18,

1774
01:28:04,547 --> 01:28:06,048
and then, it
doesn't even

1775
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:07,516
stop there
with daughters,

1776
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,150
does it, dad?

1777
01:28:08,183 --> 01:28:09,885
Yeah. Pass me
a toothpick,

1778
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:11,086
will you, Artie?

1779
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,087
Rachel, honey,

1780
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,725
I can hear the clock
going tick-tock, tick-tock.

1781
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:17,560
Meaning?

1782
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,328
Bea: Meaning we're

to come along.

1784
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:23,799
Well, stranger
things have happened.

1785
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:27,570
Bea, please stop
pestering her, please.

1786
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:30,906
Bea: Rachel, honey, you look
a lot slimmer this year.

1787
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:33,709
Is there someone
new in your life

1788
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:35,010
that you're keeping from us?

1789
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,144
Nope. Nobody new.

1790
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:40,583
Well, maybe it would help if
you changed your hairstyle.

1791
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:41,417
I got a little
turkey here.

1792
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,051
I got a
little turkey.

1793
01:28:43,085 --> 01:28:44,953
Will you
stop interrupting me

1794
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,355
so I can
give your daughter

1795
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:47,556
some wonderful advice?

1796
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,892
You've been wearing it
this way for years,

1797
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:50,993
and it looks lovely,

1798
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:52,861
but I think that you ought
to try something different,

1799
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:55,030
maybe a little
more glamorous.

1800
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:57,132
I really like it
like this.

1801
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,135
Bea: You do? Oh.

1802
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,504
Ruth: Oh, Bea.

1803
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:02,538
Some more wine?

1804
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:05,574
Sure. Why not?

1805
01:29:05,608 --> 01:29:07,676
Just keep pouring.

1806
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,512
Artie: Here.
Take the bottle.

1807
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:10,646

Mom, you didn't tell me
you invited someone.

1814
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:32,568
Well, I did, and
I didn't want to

1815
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:33,869
make a big deal
of it.

1816
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:35,003
Well,
you should have--

1817
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,740
It's OK. I'll leave.

1818
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:40,476
Obviously,
I'm in the way here.

1819
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,044
If this is too hard,
I don't mind--

1820

No, no, no, no.

Please stay.

1825
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:56,158
Jimmy, what would you
like for dessert?

1826
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,461
Would you like
some flan, some pie,

1827
01:29:58,494 --> 01:30:00,563
or some arroz con leche?

1828
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:01,730
Flan, please.

1829
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:04,166
Flan. Very good.

1830

Doesn't that
look delicious?

1831
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:06,535

would you like?

1833
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:09,204
Uh, some pumpkin
would be great.

have the pumpkin

known my wife?
