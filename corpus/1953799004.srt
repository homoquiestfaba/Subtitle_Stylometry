IT'S NOT JUST
AN ELECTRIC HEATER.

533
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:27,591
- UM, INSTEAD OF THE USUAL
ELECTRIC COILS,

534
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,161
IT USES INFRARED BULBS
TO HEAT UP COPPER ELEMENTS.

535
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:34,365
UH, THE NUMBER ONE
SELLING POINT

536
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,669
IS THAT IT'S NOT DRY HEAT.

537
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,037
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT
ON THE MARKET.

538
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,072

539
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,807
- MY WIFE SAYS
IT'S THE BEST THING

540
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,043

WAS YOUR WIFE?

542

AS WELL.

543
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:54,652

LESS ELECTRICITY.

00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,487
LET ME SHOW YOU.

545
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,927

OF FIRES IN THE HOME,

551
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,875
AND INFRARED IS
SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER.

552
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,910
- HOW MUCH WOULD WE HAVE
TO SELL THIS FOR?

553
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:24,481
- THE INITIAL PRICE POINT
WOULD BE ABOUT $500.

554
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,986
- $500 FOR A SPACE HEATER?

555
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,055
REALLY?

556
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,658

THAT COSTS $60.

557

00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:42,972
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

1031
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:45,207
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S

1035
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,887
- YEAH?
- ARE YOU READY?

1036
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:00,756
I THINK THE MOVIE
STARTS AT 7:10.

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY KIDS

1052
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:50,306

IN YOUR SHOES RIGHT NOW?

1053
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:52,508
- YOU KNOW...

1054
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,879
MY FATHER WORKED AS HARD
AS ANYONE EVER COULD.

1055
00:51:56,881 --> 00:52:00,816
AND RIGHT WHEN HE WAS
ON THE VERGE OF SUCCESS,

1056
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:03,919
SOME LAWYER SHOWS UP
AND CRUSHES HIS DREAMS.

1057
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,921
JUST LIKE THAT,
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK.

1058
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:09,725
JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER,
AND CRUSHED EVERYTHING.

1059
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:13,028
SO WHAT'S IT WORTH?

1060
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,730
I MEAN, ALL OF OUR DREAMS

1061
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:17,733

CRASHING DOWN.

1064
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:35,017
THOSE KIDS ARE AMAZING.

1065
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:39,021
THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA BE DOCTORS

1066
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:41,624
OR LAWYERS.

1067
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:45,027
THAT DOESN'T STOP THEM
FROM DOING WHAT THEY LOVE.

1068
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,896
THEY ALWAYS REMIND ME

1069
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:49,064
THAT EVERYONE
HAS THEIR SPECIAL TALENT.

00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:52,368

00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,337
THE MATTER BEFORE THE COURT

THE PLAINTIFF, WILL GO FIRST,

AND THEN MR. BURKETT
WILL HAVE HIS SAY.

- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT IS CLEARLY SPELLED OUT

1141
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:56,618
IN THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRACT,

1142
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,254
AS YOU CAN SEE
IN PARAGRAPH 27.

1143
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:03,625
THIS IS OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAUSE.

IT COVERS ANY INVENTIONS
OR IDEAS DEVELOPED

WHILE UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT
OF THE HANDON CORPORATION.

1146
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,100
- CAN YOU PLEASE
TELL THE JUDGE

1147
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,635
HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
FOR THE EDENPURE HEATER?

1148
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:18,107
- WELL, MY WIFE NANCY

1149
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:22,611
ALWAYS GETS COLD FEET
IN WINTER.

1150
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:23,979
WEARS SOCKS TO BED.

1151
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:27,950
I WAS FIXING PLUMBING
IN OUR HOUSE,

1152
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:31,653
AND HAD LEFT A STACK
OF COPPER PIPING

1153
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:34,857
NEAR THE HEATER
IN THE WORKSHOP.

1154
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:38,093
THE NEXT DAY I REALIZED
THEY WERE RADIATING HEAT,

1155
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:41,697
AND I KNEW THAT COPPER
WOULD BE A KEY COMPONENT.

1156
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,402
FOR A HEAT SOURCE
I USED FAR-INFRARED.

1157
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,737
[microphone feedback]

1158
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,674
IT HAS A WAVELENGTH
OF LONGER THAN 15 MICRONS.

1159
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:56,078
SO I BUILT
A CRUDE PROTOTYPE,

1160
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,781
AND IT WORKED

1161
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:02,351
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

1162
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:05,821
THE ENTIRE ROOM WAS HEATED

1163
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:08,791
FROM CEILING TO FLOOR.

1164
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:11,193
WE USED THIS HEATER
ALL WINTER,

1165
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,163
AND IT WAS GREAT.

1166
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:15,764
MOST IMPORTANTLY,

1167
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:20,035
MY WIFE'S FEET
WEREN'T COLD ANYMORE.

1168
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,239
- THAT WAS A CHARMING STORY,
MR. BURKETT,

1169
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,741
BUT I NEED EVIDENCE.

1170
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:26,942
- JUDGE, I DON'T THINK...

1171
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:30,846
- MR. BURKETT,
YOU CAN STEP DOWN.

1172
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,848
NOW THAT I'VE HEARD
ALL THE TESTIMONY,

1173
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,018
YOU WILL RECEIVE MY FORMALIZED
OPINION BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

ANY DOUBT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY.

EVER GIVE UP.

- COACH DEANTONIO DID
A FANTASTIC JOB THIS SEASON,

QUARTERBACK, JOHN HANDON III.

JUST TO PROVE
THAT THEY EVEN BELONG

1645
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:20,901
ON THE SAME FIELD
WITH THESE VIKINGS, SAM.

1646
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:22,303
- WELL, WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT

1647
01:22:22,305 --> 01:22:24,004
JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM KICKOFF

1648
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:27,441
AS THE TEAMS TAKE THE FIELD
FOR TONIGHT'S COIN TOSS.

1649
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,943
- LITTLE BOBBY BURKETT.

1650
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:31,312
YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET.

1651
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,549
- WE'LL SEE.

1652
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:39,653
- DON'T EVEN LOOK AT HER,
FARM BOY.

1653
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,789
- YOU KNOW,
YOU ALREADY LOST HER.

1654
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:44,792
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.

1655
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:45,294
HEADS.

1656
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:50,597
- DEFER.

1657
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:51,699
- HOOVER WINS THE TOSS,

1658
01:22:51,701 --> 01:22:53,500
AND THEY HAVE ELECTED
TO KICK.

1659
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:55,903
- WELL, THE WINNING
HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

1660
01:22:55,905 --> 01:22:58,339
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT
WE WORKED FOR.

1661
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,506
All: YEAH!

1662
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,742
- THIS IS WHAT WE WANT.
All: YEAH!

1663
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,011
- SO LET'S GET IT DONE, HUH!

1664
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:06,613
[all cheering]

1665
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,549
[whistle blows]

1666
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:11,085
- AND THE BALL IS IN THE AIR,
AND WE ARE UNDERWAY.

1667
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:12,619
FINLEY FIELDS THE BALL
AT THE 4,

1668
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:15,089
LOOKS FOR A LANE,
MAKES A CUT,

1669
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:16,957
AND IS BROUGHT DOWN
AT THE 18 YARD LINE.

1670
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:20,361
- THAT LANE TURNED INTO A WALL
AWFULLY FAST, SAM.

1671
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,397
- NUMBER 12, BOBBY BURKETT,
LEADS HIS OFFENSE ONTO THE FIELD

1672
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,332
FOR THEIR FIRST POSSESSION.

1673
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,701
NUMBER 84, STAR RECEIVER
BEN NAPIER,

1674
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:29,336
LINES UP WIDE TO THE LEFT.

1675
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,404
- I THINK BURKETT'S
GONNA HAVE TO

1676
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:32,106
TOSS THAT POTATO TONIGHT, SAM,

1677
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:34,641
OR HE'S GONNA GET MASHED
BY THIS HOOVER DEFENSE.

1678
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:39,480
- RED 18.
- NAPIER GOES INTO MOTION.

1679
01:23:39,482 --> 01:23:41,048
- RED 18. HUT!

1680
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,851
- AND IT'S A PITCH-OUT.

1681
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,819
NAPIER BLASTED
BY A HOOVER DEFENDER.

1682
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:48,889
THE BALL IS LOOSE, AND HOOVER
RECOVERS AT THE 9 YARD LINE.

1683
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:50,891
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
NAPIER LOOKS NERVOUS.

1684
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:53,093
I MEAN, THAT LINEBACKER
WAS IN THE BACKFIELD

1685
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:55,763
LIKE SOMEONE WAITING
AT A BAGGAGE CLAIM.

1686
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,167
- BREAK.
- HANDON BRINGS HIS TEAM

1687
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:01,535
TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

1688
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,737
BEHIND HIS MASSIVE
OFFENSIVE LINE.

1689
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:06,140
- I DON'T THINK ONE OF THESE
OFFENSIVE ROAD GRADERS

1690
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:08,675
IS UNDER 260 POUNDS.

1691
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:09,943
- SINGLE BACK! SINGLE BACK!

1692
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:11,211
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A WHOLE LOT EASIER

1693
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,847
THAN I THOUGHT.

1694
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:17,785
SET. HUT!
HUT, HUT, HUT!

1695
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:20,020
- HANDON TAKES THE SNAP.
- HE DROPS BACK

1696
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,056
AND HITS HIS TIGHT END
FOR ABOUT FIVE YARDS

1697
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,757
RIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE.

1698
01:24:23,759 --> 01:24:25,492
- THAT'S HIS COUSIN,
BART HANDON.

1699
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:27,127
AND YOU KNOW, THESE TWO
HAVE HOOKED UP

1700
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:30,597
FOR 14 TOUCHDOWNS
THIS SEASON.

1701
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:34,435
GREEN OPPOSITE.
GREEN OPPOSITE.

1702
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:36,737
SET. HUT.

1703
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:40,507
- HANDON FAKES A HAND-OFF,
ROLLS OUT THE THE LEFT,

1704
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,576
AND WALKS INTO THE END ZONE
UNTOUCHED.

1705
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,778
[all cheering]
- YES!

1706
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,914
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

1707
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,649
THEY NEED BOBBY BURKETT TO PLAY
BOTH SIDES OF THE FIELD HERE.

1708
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:49,883
- OH, IS THAT IT?
- YEAH.

1709
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:51,385
- LAST WEEK YOU WERE
ANTI-BURKETT.

1710
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:52,619
- HE'S THE BEST PLAYER
OUT THERE.

1711
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,687
I WISH HE WOULD MARRY
MY DAUGHTER.

1712
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:54,822
- OH, IF HE MARRIED YOUR DAU...

1713
01:24:54,824 --> 01:24:55,956
- PLEASE.
- GUYS.

1714
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:56,958
- MAKE ROOM FOR MICHELLE.

1715
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:58,025
- PLAY SMART.

1716
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:59,159
- PLAY TOUGH.
- YES, SIR.

1717
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,694
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

1718
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:01,895
- GOOD.
- HOW ARE THEY DOING?

1719
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:05,632
- NOT SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1720
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,267
- AFTER A SHORT PASS
TO NAPIER,

1721
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,770
AQUINAS IS LOOKING
AT THIRD AND 7.

1722
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:13,006
NUMBER 24, DAMIEN TAYLOR,
IS LINED UP TO THE LEFT.

1723
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:14,975
- HUT!
- BURKETT TAKES THE SNAP.

1724
01:25:14,977 --> 01:25:16,543
TAYLOR RUNS
A DOWN-AND-IN.

1725
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:19,213
BURKETT THROWS IT.
INCOMPLETE.

1726
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:22,616
[crowd groans]
WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DOWN.

1727
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:25,119
- WELL, IT HIT HIM IN A BAD
SPOT... RIGHT IN THE HANDS.

1728
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,488
- DAMIEN TAYLOR,
A TRANSFER THIS YEAR

1729
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,790
TO SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS, SHOULD
HAVE REALLY MADE THAT CATCH.

1730
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,024
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE'S SHOWN FLASHES

1731
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,659
OF BIG-PLAY POTENTIAL
ALL SEASON,

1732
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:35,596
BUT IT'S DROPS LIKE THIS
THAT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE.

1733
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:37,097
All: BREAK.

1734
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,166
- IF AQUINAS DOESN'T
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT,

1735
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,468
THIS COULD GET VERY UGLY
VERY FAST.

1736
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,137
- HUT!

1737
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:51,078
- YES!
- [fans cheer]

1738
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,582
- HOOVER'S DEFENSE
HAS BEEN SUFFOCATING.

1739
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,651
- COME ON, REF!
- REGGIE STREETER HAS BEEN

1740
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,620
- ALL OVER THE FIELD.
- I MEAN, HE'S GOING THROUGH 'EM

1741
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,321
LIKE THEY'RE PARTICLE BOARD.

1742
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,891
- THAT'S WHY THEY CALL HIM
"BUZZSAW."

1743
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,798
HANDON IS FEELING IT NOW.
HE HITS HIS TIGHT END

1744
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,267
FOR THEIR THIRD TOUCHDOWN
OF THE GAME.

1745
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:14,835
- THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE
SEEING THE DIFFERENCE

1746
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,570
IN SIZE AND SPEED

1747
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:20,073
BETWEEN DMSION I
AND DMSION IV TEAMS.

1748
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:21,708
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY
FOR THIS GAME,

1749
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,878
BUT THIS IS
A COMPLETE MISMATCH.

1750
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:30,551
OOH, ANOTHER DROPPED PASS
BY DAMIEN TAYLOR.

1751
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:33,787
BURKETT'S GOTTA
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

1752
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:35,956
- BEN... BEN, COME ON, MAN,
YOU GOTTA GET OPEN.

1753
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:37,758
- I KNOW, MAN, I'M TRYING.
- I GOT NO ROOM.

1754
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,693
- LOOK, I KNOW THEY'RE
DOUBLE-TEAMING YOU OUT THERE.

1755
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,228
JUST FIND A SPOT, OKAY?

1756
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,796
- JUST THROW IT LONG.
- I'LL BE THERE, ALL RIGHT?

1757
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:45,966
- AQUINAS IS LOOKING AT
A SECOND AND 3,

1758
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:49,169
AND DOWN 21-0.

1759
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:51,104
- SET.

1760
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,743
YELLOW 89.
SET, HUT!

1761
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,179
- BURKETT TAKES THE SNAP...

1762
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:01,982
LOOKS TO HIS LEFT AT NAPIER,
WHO MAKES A GREAT CUT,

1763
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:05,018
AND HITS HIM ON THE SLANT.

1764
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,853
NAPIER TAKES IT IN
FOR A TOUCHDOWN.

1765
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:08,388
[all cheering]
- YEAH!

1766
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:16,129
- ALL RIGHT, SAINT THOMAS IS
LINING UP FOR THE EXTRA POINT.

1767
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:21,368
THE BALL IS SNAPPED...
AND HOOVER BLOCKS THE KICK.

1768
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,004
[crowd groans]

1769

HANDON IS IN NO HURRY

1910
01:32:50,566 --> 01:32:52,332
AS THE CLOCK CONTINUES
TO WIND DOWN.

1911
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:54,301
- YOU KNOW, IF THE HOOVER
VIKINGS GET THIS FIRST DOWN,

1912
01:32:54,303 --> 01:32:56,236
THE HOT DOG

1920
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,721
HANDON WOULD HAVE RUN
RIGHT THROUGH THOSE GUYS.

1921
01:33:14,723 --> 01:33:16,590
MY, MY, MY,
HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

1922
01:33:16,592 --> 01:33:18,625

TO STOP THE CLOCK,

1923
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:22,929
AND THE KNIGHTS HAVE
A LONG FIELD TO GO.

1924
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,098
THE BALL WAS SNAPPED
AND THE PUNT IS AWAY.

1925
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,299
FINLEY CALLS

1928
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:33,640
- WOW, HOOVER ALMOST PINNED

1929
01:33:33,642 --> 01:33:35,408
THEN THE CHEESE WOULD HAVE
BEEN OFF THE PIZZA.

1930
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:38,178

01:33:55,464 --> 01:34:00,066

01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:15,315
IT'S A DRAW PLAY TO FINLEY.

1948
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,751
- FROM THE 20 TO THE 30.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

1949
01:34:17,753 --> 01:34:20,286
NO, NO, TO THE 40 NOW,

1950
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,822
OUT OF BOUNDS
AT THE HOOVER 43.

1951
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,592
THAT'S A VERY GUTSY CALL
BY DEANTONIO.

1952
01:34:25,594 --> 01:34:27,360

THEIR BIGGEST ENEMY RIGHT NOW
