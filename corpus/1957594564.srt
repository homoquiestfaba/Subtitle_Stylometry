11
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:04,423
Good evening,

12
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:07,350
and welcome to Movie Corner.

13
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:09,252
The Halloween special.

14
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:10,788
I'm Cort Tomlinson,

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,891
and we've got a whopper of a
spook show for you tonight,

16
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,526
but that's not how
it's pronounced.

17
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,994
I'm talking about
the cult classic

18
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,697
in the horror movie genre,

19
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,334
and holy Quasimodo, does
it have a back story.

20
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,381
1975, GlassGirl Magazine
puts out an article

21
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:34,144
about a young Pennsylvania
mother named Dorothy Schepp.

22
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,448
In this piece, she claims
that her and her four children

23
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,718
are being tormented by
something Meemaw would call

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,453
"The heebie-geebies."

25
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:46,156
We're talking spooky
sounds, paranoia,

26
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,124
things being in a way
they ought not be.

27
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,963
And so this terrifying story
goes out into the world,

28
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,130
and who of all people reads it,

29
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:58,669
but the wife of film
producer Daniel Gerby.

30
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,304
Gerby ends up buying
Dorothy's story

31
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,273
for a mere $17,000.

32
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,208
I have more than
that in late fees

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,978
at Movie Gallery right now.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,311
The film starts rolling.

35
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,748
They hire director
George L. Schmidt,

36
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,617
who's credited with the decision

37
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,052
to shoot the film in the
actually Schepp family home.

38
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,222
Right where all the terrorizing
took place to begin with.

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,826
Fast forward, 1979.

40
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:24,361
The film premieres to
disappointing reviews,

41
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:26,430
and is a box office bomb.

42
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:30,100
But, things turned around
in the video rental market,

43
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:33,136
as it became a cult classic.

44
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:34,739
Ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,115
starring Wanda Best
and Duncan Lund,

46
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:43,022
it's-

[ominous music]

48
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,114
Look at that.

[man laughing]

55
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,095
Even the mold in this
hotel ain't safe from ya.

56
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:12,897
What are you doing?

57
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,533
[Woman] Was just trying
to get a feel for the place.

58
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,435
It is something, isn't it?
[eerie music]

59
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:18,502
What, the cellar?

60
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,336
Well, the whole thing.

61
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:21,906
Needs a little work.

62
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,542
Haul this crud out, first thing.

63
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,811
[Woman] Oh, I kinda like it.

64
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:29,046
[Man] It gives me the creeps.

65
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,148
But, school's a
stone's throw away,

66
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,659
and store's not much further.

67
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,589
How are my odds?

68
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,223
Well, if they were any worse,

69
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:41,701
I'd probably still be Kareck.

70
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:49,274
[doors shut]
[music resumes]

71
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,257
Welcome home, Pete.

72
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,134
Clint, is that you?

73
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,528
- You look good.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,497
17 pounds since August.

75
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:21,132
Took your advice on the Paleo.

76
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,767
Right on, right on.

77
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,001
What are you doing, Pete?

78
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:25,469
Whole thing's a disaster.

79
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,538
Had to crosscheck the
wiring by the South wall.

80
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,773
Set me back a little,

81
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,273
but we should be
in the green now.

82
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:32,676
Sure you want to blow
up your mom's house?

83
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,545
Maybe we should talk about this.

84
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:35,780
Teri's here.

85
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,380
Love to talk, Clint,
but there's no time.

86
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,649
Got an early flight.

87
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,818
Don't suppose you ran
it by the fire marshal.

88
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,795
Does he have a
Chem E Doctorate?

89
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,957
Pete! Let's go in the house.

90
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,225
Hey, Ter.

91
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,226
Wow, I didn't think
you two were still-

92
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,427
- We're not.

93
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,263
I brought Clint
here to arrest you.

94
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,297
Oh, I didn't realize
he had the authority.

95
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a citizen's arrest.

96
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,268
I know it's none
of my business,

97
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,471
but I always thought you
two were good together.

98
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,439
Remember your engagement
party by the lake.

99
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,674
Aside from arson,

100
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,308
this is a crime against
your mother's memory.

101
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,377
Wow, where were you
for the eulogy, Clint?

102
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:08,779
Cut the crap, Pete.

103
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,080
What a weekend.

104
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,382
Tequila volleyball, jet skis.

105
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:14,317
What was the name of that song

106
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,719
you two were
singing all weekend?

107
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:16,954
Was it Cyndi Lauper?

108
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,321
Think about what
your brothers would say

109
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:19,790
if they found out about this.

110
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:20,925
Pat Benatar.

111
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,860
"Like A Prayer."

112
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,061
Oh yeah.

113
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:25,563
Can you believe
that was 15 years ago?

114
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:28,599
Since then, the lake
house has been bulldozed,

115
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,934
you two got divorced,

116
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,936
but we'll always
have the memory.

117
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:33,604
Isn't that what matters?

118
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:36,473
I don't want to sell the house
any more than you do, Pete.

119
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,818
But this? This is crazy!

120
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,980
I've got a half pound of C4
by the central foundations,

121
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,915
and then another
by the South wall,

122
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,283
and another by the North.

123
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,818
It'll be like the
fourth of July.

124
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,328
I got sandbags to protect us.

125
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,524
I'll get more sandbags.

126
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,426
Well what are you gonna
do about your nephew?

127
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,194
- Vincent?
- He's living here.

128
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:58,796
Been here for weeks.

129
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,464
- Why?
- I don't know, Pete!

130
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:02,233
Why don't you go talk to him?

131
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:04,168
Or are you just gonna
blow him up, too?

132
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,070
Theo can take care of it.

133
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,713
Is that supposed to be a joke?

134
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,866

Grief works in funny ways.

144
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,311
I see his point, though.

145
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,205
It's the honorable thing to do.

146
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,873
Blowing her into smithereens.

147
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:50,941
Noted.

148
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,142
Thanks for the lift.

149
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,085
You are welcome.

150
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,450
Maybe I should stay until
this thing diffuses itself.

151
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,516
I got this.

152
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,985
Take it easy on him, Ter.

153
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,653
Been through a lot, all of you.

154
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,121
Last thing Dorothy would want

155
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,457
is to have you fighting
with each other.

156
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,157
Happy trails, Clint.

157
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:12,204
[engine revving]
[door slams]

158
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,472
What are you doing?

159
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,271
I don't have time for this.

160
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,407
The kid's a space cadet.

161
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,307
Don't tell me you're calling-

162
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:24,308
- Yeah I am.

163
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,542
Pete!
[phone ringing]

164
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,177
For all that is
holy, do not call-

165
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,880
- I told him what I
tell all my customers.

166
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,515
I said, I mean, sure,

167
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:32,683
there's all sorts of variety.

168
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:35,352
There's spring, there's
foam, there's gel,

169
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,820
there's the hybrids.

170
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,156
And yeah, a waterbed
might be a little heavier,

171
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,591
maybe not as stylish,

172
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,760
but a mattress is
probably is as important

173
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,828
as a mortgage or a car payment.

174
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,730
You gotta be able to
trust your mattress

175
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,332
the way you trust your wife.

176
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,901
He comes home from work,
stretches himself out

177
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,903
on a heated Schepp waterbed,

178
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,339
and he knows he's
made the right choice.

179
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,775
And then I say, "It's
like my dad used to say.

180
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,544
Anybody can get a good
night's sleep anywhere,

181
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,813
as long as they've got
a clean conscience."

182
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,883
But in this day in age,
who's got one of those?

183
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,685
That's where your Schepp
waterbed will come in.

184
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,087
So did he buy?

185
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,021
No, not yet.

186
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,189
He said he wanted to look online

187
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:14,291
at some of these
NASA space beds.

188
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,359
But he'll be back.

189
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,727
You ever try memory foam?

190
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,204
Who am I, Kurt Cobain?

191
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:20,498
Only asking.

192
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,100
Nothing but premium Schepp
waterbeds in my house.

193
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,802
You in the market?

194
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:28,672
I'm happy with a waterless
situation at the moment.

195
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,007
Well then what are
you still doing here?

196
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,809
I figured you'd be the
first one at the airport

197
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,377
after the funeral.

198
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,413
Just wanted to give the
house one final goodbye.

199
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:38,015
He's helping Franky and
I get this place settled.

200
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:40,017
It's a lot of work
for two people.

201
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,453
A lot.

202
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:42,420
A lot.

203
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:43,555
You want to help, Theo?

204
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:44,888
I gotta be at the shop.

205
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,491
I mean, now that
Franky's retired.

206
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,192
You know, the
business dad started.

207
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:51,061
All I meant was there's
nothing around here

208
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:54,231
you think you can take with you?

209
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:55,866
While we're on the subject,

210
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,268
who took Senior's arm
chair out of the den?

211
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,037
- Beats me.
- Come on.

212
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,805
I know one of you has
been swiping dad's stuff.

213
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,273
Like I don't have enough

214
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,842
of Senior's old junk already.

215
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:07,010
So Vincent, have you
decided on your major yet?

216
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,879
Oh, don't get me started.

217
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,747
Don't get him started.

218
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,216
Go ahead, Vincent.

219
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,293
Tell your Uncle Pete what
you're gonna major in.

220
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:16,987
Viking Culture.

221
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,491
Viking Culture.

222
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,526
Can you believe
that's even a major?

223
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,394
It's no wonder a
secondary education

224
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:24,661
isn't worth shit anymore.

225
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,196
Kinda like this house.

226
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,232
Especially this house.

227
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:30,934
Franky, are you
gonna eat anything?

228
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,369
Don't eat.

229
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,904
He's right, shouldn't
eat this stuff.

230
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:34,938
This stuff?

231
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,773
This is pizza.

232
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:40,344
That is gluten,
dairy, and tomato paste.

233
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,712
Will you please give it up

234
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,714
with this gluten free bullshit?

235
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,682
I'm sure there's a couple
of newlyweds out there

236
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,917
that would find this house to be

237
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,219
a perfect place
to start a family.

238
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:50,455
Like mom and dad.

239
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:52,823
I would rather go
down to the gas station,

240
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,659
put my lips around
the pump, suck it dry,

241
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,095
and then try to light
matches with my butt cheeks

242
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,497
than have this place turned over

243
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,198
to some bunch of bums.

244
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,467
[Teri] What bums?

245
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,934
Do you guys even
get that this place

246
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,278
is like a big deal
to some people?

247
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:08,672
Right.

248
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:09,907
No, seriously.

249
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,909
There's so many forums
online about this place.

250
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,677
Oh, here we go.

251
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,554
Forums?

252
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,681
Like, about The Whooper?

253
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:21,486
Forums, fan fictions,
cos-plays, you name it.

254
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:23,655
Wait, you're
telling me somebody

255
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,689
has actually seen that
movie in the past 20 years.

256
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:28,325
Well, they show it at
Halloween in theaters.

257
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,894
Kind of like a retro revival.

258
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,896
Yeah, well, dad had
another word for that.

259
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,299
Maybe so, but everyone knows

260
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:36,800
that the story is fiction.

261
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:37,868
Fiction?

262
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,102
Made up.

263
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,838
This house isn't
really haunted.

264
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,575
Some might debate that.

265
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:46,586
- Who, exactly?
- Well, grandma, for one.

266
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,815
Vincent, grandma liked
to tell stories. Loved it.

267
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,351
When she would go down to
the salon on the weekends,

268
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,019
that's all those ladies did.

269
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,755
Once, somebody took
something she said as fact,

270
00:13:58,797 --> 00:13:59,990
and the next thing you know,

271
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,358
a movie studio was
knocking on the door,

272
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,093
promising us this and that.

273
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,063
Ruined my sophomore
year in high school.

274
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:08,732
None of us were ever
haunted by our toys,

275
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:11,335
or had exorcisms performed
on our stuffed animals.

276
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:12,903
All I remember from that time

277
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:16,173
was bouncing checks
and waterbeds.

278
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,709
Well you can
believe what you want.

279
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,611
And you can go on
those chat rooms,

280
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:21,412
and tell everyone
that Peter Schepp says

281
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:24,181
that there's no such
thing as a Whooper.

282
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,349
What does that prove?

283
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:27,084
Aren't I a character
in the story?

284
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,319
That doesn't make it yours.

285
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:32,457
The Whooper belongs
to the fans now.

286
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:34,024
Pete, let it go.

287
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,360
Ticket sales, box
office revenue.

288
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,061
That doesn't make any
sense to this kid.

289
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,607

any sense to this kid.

this kid, alright?

00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,196
Something he had
never seen before.

361
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:01,632
A creature that
resembled the folklore

362
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,935
of the Iroquois tribes.

363
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:07,070
Unknowingly, the hunter
brought his strange kill

364
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:08,673
back to this cellar.

365
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,741
He disappeared sometime later,

366
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,752
but the mark of the
creature remained.

367
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,446
The Whooper?

368
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:16,814
Everybody's seen that movie.

369
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:19,049
My babies and I
watch it all the time.

370
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:20,551
It's not for babies.

371
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,552
Are these yours?

372
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:22,787
My grandma's.

373
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,054
Once they weren't
worth anything,

374
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,297
she just boxed them up.

375
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:27,734
Well, what's it worth to you?

376
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,496
I would sell everything
to get her back.

377
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:32,930
Oh, there you are.

378
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,398
I've got something to show you.

379
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,834
My favorite bathroom
is down here.

380
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:37,835
Boy, I hope that lady

381
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:38,669
doesn't find all
that lead paint.

382
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:39,770
That'd be a disaster.

383
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,572
Oh, hey guys.

384
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:43,039
Didn't mean to
interrupt the tour.

385
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,408
Did they say lead paint?

386
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,676
I don't think so.

387
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,979
There's no lead paint
down here, Miss Shingle.

388
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,379
Same as these pipes.

389
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,147
This house has its quirks,

390
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,450
but we were all raised here,

391
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,150
and look how we turned out.

392
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,219
Wait, maybe that's
not the best example.

393
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,488
What he's trying
to say is that

394
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,256
we wouldn't put you or
your family in danger

395
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:00,525
just to make some money.

396
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,627
They're just jacking
around, Miss Shingle.

397
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:04,929
Your kids could probably
eat the paint chips

398
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,464
right off the wall.

399
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:09,165
See? Latex, non-toxic.

400
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:12,035
My father repainted this
house back in the 80s.

401
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,236
Franky.

402
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,639
Do you want to see
me eat a chip of paint?

403
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,007
Don't eat paint, Franky.

404
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,141
It's that safe.

405
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,652
- Let me try.
- Vincent!

406
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:23,246
[ominous music]

407
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,017
I wanted to thank you all
so much for your hospitality.

408
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,260
I could not be more in
love with this house.

409
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,599
Now, will you take
a personal check?

410
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,158
Is it from a local bank?

411
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,060
Thanks, we'll consider it.

412
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,128
Look, just give my brother

413
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,463
a couple days to think about it.

414
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,231
If there's a problem
with the amount,

415
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,034
I'd be happy to increase it.

416
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,535
I've thought about it.

417
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:45,870
We'll give you a
call. You got a card?

418
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,805
No, I'm afraid I
can't leave this house

419
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,272
until there's a deal.

420
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,141
See? She can't wait.

421
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,978
Miss, my brother
isn't thinking straight.

422
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,278
We've been through a lot

423
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,881
with the death of
my mother and all.

424
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:57,915
You'll understand.

425
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:58,849
Of course.

426
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,052
That's exactly why I'm here.

427
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:03,020
Your mother meant so much to me.

428
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,855
Please, I have to
have this house.

429
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,323
- Please!
- Alright really?

430
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:07,491
The house is not for sale.

431
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,693
That's impossible.

432
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:09,760
We're keeping it.

433
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:12,162
That's not what she wanted.

434
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,798
Dorothy, your mother,

435
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,499
could not leave
the house to you,

436
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,601
- I'm sorry.
- Frank,

437
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:17,835
where did you get this lunatic?

438
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,604
No matter what they
say, no matter what,

439
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:21,338
she made me promise
right before she died,

440
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,707
she made me promise.

441
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,050
That's it, I'm out.

442
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:27,210
This has been
very interesting,

443
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,448
but I'm really sure
that you need to go.

444
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,850
Grandma, a note from grandma.

445
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:35,686
Whatever it takes, no
matter what my family says,

446
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,456
get this house from them
by any means necessary.

447
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,690
You see?

448
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,493
She wanted us to have the house.

449
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,471
I'm sorry, she loved
you, but she was hurt.

450
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:49,467
You know, I think I'll
go and take a walk,

451
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,502
and let you guys think
of a suitable amount.

452
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:53,169
But please, don't
make this harder

453
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,514
than it already is.

454
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,243
What are you talking
about, Dorothy?

455
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:01,679
It's the kids.

456
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,913
They think that their
critters are coming to life.

457
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,247
Do you know how
you sound right now?

458
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,516
I know, I know
it sounds crazy,

459
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,684
but what if it's not
the stuffed animals?

460
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:07,918
What if it's something
inside of them?

461
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,520
They're kids, they
have imaginations.

462
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:11,789
We need to leave this house.

463
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:12,723
I don't feel safe.

464
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:13,991
Why don't we just go home?

465
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,860
- Isn't this home?
- No.

466
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:18,396
There is something
in that house.

467
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:19,730
You don't know it because
you're never there,

468
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,499
but I feel it, and
I am telling you.

469
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,734
Don't you remember
living in the city?

470
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,803
Having the night
shifts, the mill.

471
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,780
I know, but this
is different, Frank.

472
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:34,352
I won't go back
to that, Dorothy.

473
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:37,490
I worked too damn hard,
and I won't do it.

474
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,259
[ominous music]

475
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,860
The Schepp family
has never escaped

476
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:52,129
the shadow of The Whooper.

477
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:54,330
Despite its home video success,

478
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,067
they never received a dime.

479
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:57,200
In more recent news,

480
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:59,103
they've even sued the studio

481
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:00,805
for their lost royalties.

482
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,506
Rumor has it that Frank Schepp

483
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:04,875
has even declared bankruptcy.

484
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:05,843
After this break,

485
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:08,079
we'll be reading viewer emails.

486
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:08,955
Stay with us.

487
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,920
[lock clicks]

488
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,320
Who am I talking to?

489
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,924
Something's a fact
because you saw it online?

490
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,692
It could have been
Photoshopped or something.

491
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:22,860
Right, Vince?

492
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:24,128
Well if it was real,

493
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,130
it's gotta be the only
fan mail she ever got.

494
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,698
I'm surprised she
didn't adopt her.

495
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,100
She never told me
about any of this.

496
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:30,434
Oh, you asked?

497
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:32,603
Look, none of this
is legal material.

498
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,337
It'll never hold up in court.

499
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,140
We can blow her off
as long as it takes.

500
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,742
But if it's what
grandma really wanted.

501
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,375
Vincent, stay out of this.

502
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,012
If mom didn't want
Franky to have the house,

503
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,814
she wouldn't have left
it to him in her will.

504
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,049
Right, Franky?

505
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,617
Senior left her the
house when he died.

506
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,720
And she couldn't amend
it in her last will.

507
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,021
That's 'cause he didn't
trust her with anything,

508
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,656
not even in death.

509
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:53,657
Don't tell me you're thinking

510
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,159
about selling it to this woman.

511
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:57,561
It's my think to think.

512
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:58,796
Christ!

513
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,397
Mom didn't actually
know this Cathy.

514
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:03,067
Did Cathy ever visit
mom when she was alive?

515
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,635
Did she ever change the sheets?

516
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:05,703
Or a bed pan?

517
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:07,738
The market's bad right now.

518
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,573
Why does it have
to be a price point?

519
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,709
Why can't we just let it go?

520
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:12,910
Let it be a memory.

521
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,245
What, are you
afraid of something?

522
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:15,679
Of what, of Whooper?

523
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,215
I don't believe
in it as paranormal.

524
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:20,684
More of a supernatural abstract.

525
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:24,455
Maybe it's not something
that we can touch or measure,

526
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:27,057
but it's something
we experience.

527
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,492
Like a thought.

528
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,727
Or a memory.

529
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,462
He's always been afraid.

530
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:33,164
We used to lock
him in this cellar

531
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:36,133
until he'd kick and
scream to high heaven.

532
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:38,135
Well, I was four.

533
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:40,471
We did it when
you were 16, too.

534
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:43,240
That was before he
became Dr. Peter.

535
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:44,909
Don't change the subject.

536
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,110
Want to do it again?

537
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:48,245
What, stay down in the cellar?

538
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:49,413
I'll go down in the cellar.

539
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,115
- In your dreams.
- Guys.

540
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,217
- Piece of cake.
- Your funeral.

541
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,252
- Want to make a bet?
- Sure.

542
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:57,588
If you can stay
down in the cellar

543
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,966
long enough to
finish a six pack,

544
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,367
I'll give you 50 bucks.

545
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:08,808
You're on.

548
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,609
Well, unless you want
to open the shop tomorrow.

549
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,044
Be my guest.

550
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,377
What about the crazy
lady in the yard?

551
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,780
I wouldn't worry about her.

552
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,082
If she gets out of
hand, call Clint.

553
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:26,817
He'll know what to do.

554
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,686
Oh hey, if you find
that Beef-a-roni recipe,

555
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,329
send me a text, alright?

Remember that problem we had?

566
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:43,827
Yeah, well I think I fixed it.

567
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:45,095
What are you talking about?

568
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,872

- You think she's-
- I don't know!

571
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:58,575
She was just standing there
in the middle of the road.

572
00:25:58,617 --> 00:25:59,677
You didn't see
her in the mirror?

573
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,011
We gotta call Clint.

574
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:02,079
- Clint?
- Yeah.

575
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,514
He'll know what to do.

00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,549
- Yeah, call an ambulance.
- No, no ambulance.

577
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,051
I'm sorry, what
are you suggesting

578
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:08,052
Clint knows how to do?

579
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,787
Well you know, clean it up.

580
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,222
You think Clint knows
how to dispose a body?

581
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:14,558
The man would open a vein
for you, you know that.

582
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,760
Besides, who's gonna
help us with all this?

583
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,228
- Us?
- Yes, us.

584

You! You, not us!

585
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:21,433
Look at the big picture.

586
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,700
This could destroy
the whole family.

587
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,068

588
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,770

to help me, don't.

But he's not so bad.

612
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:13,270

only ones to see it,

- Come on, get him out.
- Come on.

720

Get him.

It's Vincent's phone!

Must be some kind
of fetish thing.

724
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:28,712
Well, they came
to the wrong house.

725
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:31,314
Where's my son? Where's my boy?

726
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,583
Where's Vincent?

727
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,951
Is this a joke to you,
is that what this is?

728
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:34,919
Is this some kind of joke?

729
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,487
I'll show you a joke.

730
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:38,923
I will put this ball
bearing right up your ass.

731
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:41,058
You're gonna waddle out of
here instead of walking.

732
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,325
Now where is my son?

733
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,294
Theo, that's
not gonna help us.

734
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:44,762
When I walked in this room,

735
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,530
one of these things
was about to kill you.

736
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,732
But we've gotta keep our cool.

737
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:50,366
I am cool!

738
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,468

- I'm cool.

00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,770
Now what is your plan?

740
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:55,172
We need to find
Teri and Vincent,

741
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:57,007
and get the hell out of here.

742
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,176

Teri was talking about,

743

dad's stuff.

744
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,012
I found it out in the woods,

745
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:03,280

was some sort of nest.

I don't know what
these people are up to,

748
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,220
but I don't think they
planned on us holding out.

749
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:12,523
Yeah, well, this,

750
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,233
this is gonna complicate things.

- What?
- Insurance.

00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:26,804
They've got Vincent.

757
00:41:26,846 --> 00:41:27,771

you have to know.

In the emails from your
mother, I found something.

772

One of your brothers, they knew.

773
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:58,629
They signed off on this deal

Oh, this is all a setup.

777
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,502
You gotta get out of here.

778
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:06,637
Not without you.

779
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,905
I'm gonna slow you down.

780
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:09,673
You gotta run.

00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,526
Someone set us up.

902
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:03,561
I'm sure there's
another explanation.

903
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,862
Really? I would love one.

904
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,198
Teri, listen to
what you're saying!

905
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,734
I mean, look, they're just
trying to get into your head.

906
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:11,310
This is all part of their plan.

907
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:13,671
You were always good

908
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:16,474
at making other people
look guilty, Theo.

909
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:18,241
You know what,
I'm gonna forget

910
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:19,444
that you even said that.

911
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:22,447
And then again,
like father like son.

912
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:25,048
Maybe the fan boy was
in on it all along.

913
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,718
He's been here all this time.

914
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,086
Got along with Cathy so well.

915
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,287
Vincent?

916
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:31,689
Or is it possible

917
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,558
that the only one
of us who wanted to

918
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,326
give the house to
her is behind this.

919
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:38,730
He'd sell that place
out in a heartbeat,

920
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:40,832
as long as it lined his wallet.

921
00:49:40,874 --> 00:49:41,766
Wait a minute, here.

922
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:44,201
And then there's the psycho,

923
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:48,171
who rigged our mom's basement
with plastic explosives.

924
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:49,774
Could it have been him?

925
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:51,609
Hey Pete, how do I
know this thing works?

926
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:53,444
Is there a button I press?

927
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:56,380
Or maybe, it was all of you.

928
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:59,684
The prodigal sons return
to take back what's theirs.

929
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:03,153
You four were like leaves in
the breeze while I stayed.

930
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:05,390
I stayed by her side.

931
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:07,290
I watched her wither away.

932
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:10,495
You think you're the
only one that sacrificed?

933
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:12,028
Franky and I tied ourselves

934
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,464
to that sinking
ship of a business

935
00:50:13,506 --> 00:50:15,500
the day Senior passed away.

936
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:17,367
You don't think I wanted
to just disappear?

937
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,936
Move out West, to some
suburb or something,

938
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:21,806
and forgot about everything?

939
00:50:21,848 --> 00:50:23,441
Maybe it's you.

940
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:24,675
Maybe you wanted someone

941
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:25,942
to take the pressure
off of your shoulders.

942
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,879
Maybe you're looking
for a scapegoat.

943
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:29,447
You said it yourself.

944
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:30,681
You were there all by yourself.

945
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:31,616
No one was around.

946
00:50:31,658 --> 00:50:33,551
You had access to her accounts.

947
00:50:33,593 --> 00:50:34,661
Maybe you're right.

948
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:38,689
Maybe I am ready to
give this place up.

949
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,991
After all, it was her last wish.

950
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:43,026
The only difference is

951
00:50:43,068 --> 00:50:46,431
I don't want a
number or a price.

952
00:50:46,473 --> 00:50:48,373
I just want a name.

953
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,068
Give it to me.

954
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,471
I have nothing to
hide from you, Teri.

955
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:55,582
Give it to me!

956
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,385
Show her.

Come on, now, come on.

Teri!

961
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:22,265
Teri, he is not moving.

962
00:51:22,307 --> 00:51:23,501
He's not reactive.

963
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:24,902
We've got to get
him to a hospital!

964
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:27,270
Why did you have
to make this so hard?

965
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:28,806
Teri, help us!

966
00:51:28,848 --> 00:51:30,040
I don't care what
you think happened,

967
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:31,551
we've got to get
him to a hospital!

It's a syncopic episode.

973
00:51:57,744 --> 00:51:59,437
He's stable, but
he needs a doctor.

974
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:00,638
Teri, get in the truck.

975
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,873
Come on, nobody stays behind.

976
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:02,840
I'm staying.

977
00:52:02,882 --> 00:52:04,140
I'm rigging those charges.

978
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:05,476
What? Why?

979
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:07,612
Because fuck them, that's why.

980
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,814
Teri, you said it yourself.

981
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:11,314
If this is what mom wanted,

982
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:12,450
then let 'em have it.

983
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:14,685
That was our home, Theo!

984
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:16,754
We slept in those rooms.

985
00:52:16,796 --> 00:52:19,790
She died in those rooms.

986
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:20,892
I'm not gonna stand by

987
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:22,894
and let some freaks turn it in

988
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:25,328
to some kind of fantasy.

989
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,473
That place is our memories.

990
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:31,702
And now that's all it will be.

991
00:52:31,744 --> 00:52:34,037
I'm only sorry not all my
brothers felt the same.

this was gonna happen.

Franky.

I just wish...

It's too late.

1016

Cathy was all she
had in the end.

1017
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:39,597
So it's no wonder
any of this happened.

1018
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,599
We helped her invent this.

We were kids!

It doesn't make
it any less true.

You want to sit
here and talk about

1022

how this could've
been different, fine.

1023

running from this place.

From Senior, from
mom and her bullshit.

You're not thinking
about going back in there.

Maybe it's not too late.

give us more time.
