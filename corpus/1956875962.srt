[Amy]
I didn't know you very well.

00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,343
We only knew each other
for a short time,

4
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,345
but it was a really nice time.

5
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,084
That period of time
we spent together,

6
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:58,625

Oh, my God. It's fucking over.

You don't get it.
You don't understand!

I'm not fucking crazy.
I'm not crazy!

15
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:46,805
Please understand,
I'm not crazy.

16
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,343
We had a time.

17
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,748
We had a time,
but it's over now.

something? 'Cause I can't...</i>

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,449
<i>I can barely hear you.
Are you okay?</i>

45
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:25,850

<i>Go for a walk or why don't you
try watching a movie?</i>

even want to go to this party.</i>

at making salads.</i>

Come on down from there.

105
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,485
I was thinking...

106
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,690
I could be made
into a leather jacket.

This used to be alive.

becomes useful, you know?

because I want you

116
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,723
to make sure it happens
when I die.

117
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,694
You are going to die
if you keep relapsing.

That's not what's happening.

119

Tell me you'll take care of it.

125

Nobody is turning you
into a leather jacket.

126
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,693
You're not making sense.

127
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,364
You're not thinking straight
because you are loaded.

128
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:28,567

I can't sit here and
watch you get wasted.

I won't be held hostage.

147

So, I am going to leave

148
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,022
and you're going to
call me tomorrow.

149
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,490
There is no tomorrow for me.

150

No. Stop.

00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:18,990
[Craig]
Good to have.

183
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,592
[Amy]
And this is the bedroom...

184
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,630
[Craig]
That's a big TV.

185
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:30,634
- What, about 50 inches?
- [laughs]

186
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,636
I don't know, it was
the previous owners.

187
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,072
[Craig]
They just left that TV?

188
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,507
Yeah.

189
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,974
[Craig]
You wanna watch something?

190
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,675
I don't know if it works.

191
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,812
[Craig laughs] You
haven't tried to turn it on?

192
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,180
[laughs] No.

193
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:43,714
I don't really watch TV.

194
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,718
[Craig]
Fair enough.

195
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:50,087
That's a big bed.

196
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,259
You know, I actually
do really regret

197
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,026
not going to Majorca
one summer

198
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,028
because I was trying to
win over an ex-girlfriend.

199
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,296
Oh, that's sad.

200
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,698
I had the whole thing
planned out.

201
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:03,768
That's actually a tragedy.

202
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,903
- That's a true regret,
- [Amy laughs]

203
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,237
if we're being honest.

204
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,673
That's bad.

205
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:10,073
What about you?

206
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,876
How you doing
in the regret department?

207
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,779
- Truth only.
- Okay.

208
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,916
Um...

209
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,884
[Craig]
Go.

210
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:24,822
I regret not knowing
how to make an omelet.

211
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,226
I wouldn't say that's a regret.

212
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,127
I mean, I've tried really hard

213
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,931
- and failed really hard.
- [laughs]

214
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:35,232
Okay, fine. Next.

215
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,602
- [laughs]
- Skip.

216
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,904
It just takes a very tiny
amount of my brain space,

217
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,107
- but it's something.
- [Craig laughs]

218
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,011
I terminated a pregnancy
when I was 22.

219
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:53,284
Terminated?

220
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:56,220
I mean, I had an abortion.

221
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:58,655
I know, just the term.

222
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,758
I didn't really...
I hadn't thought about it

223
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,126
until I bought this house.

224
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,765
You hadn't thought about...
what, the kid?

225
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:10,367
Well, it's not a kid.

226
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,638
It's a bunch of cells
in my uterus, but...

227
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,273
Um...

228
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,110
Yeah, I hadn't
thought about the kid

229
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:21,813
until I bought the house.

230
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:29,020
Do you regret it?

231
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:37,996
Don't answer that.

232
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:41,665
No, I don't.

233
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,004
I don't regret it. I mean,
I probably wouldn't have

234
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,039
been able to buy this house
if I'd had it.

235
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,376
[takes deep breath]

236
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:57,115
I don't know why
I'm reacting like this.

237
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,949
No, I don't regret it.

238
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,326
What do you say we
figure out that TV, now?

239
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,295
- [Amy laughs]
- Sorry.

240
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,806
[gasps]

241
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,312

00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:00,278
<i>you were gonna
bring the salad?</i>

245
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,846
[Jane]
I know, but if I come,

246
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm just gonna be distracted

247
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,415
and I just want to sit
and play with these ideas.

248
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:08,052
You know I can't control
when inspiration strikes.

249
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:09,886
I'm just gonna annoy Susan,
anyway.

250
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,457
Look, I'll take you guys
to dinner tomorrow,

251
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,192
- or whenever.
- [opens door]

252
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,795
Tell Susan I said
happy birthday, okay?

253
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:19,062
[Jason]
<i>Of course, I will.</i>

254
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,330
<i>Will you call me tomorrow?</i>

255
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,133
[Jane]
Yeah, okay. Love you, bye.

Oh, no way.

No, no, hold it. Hold it.

[camera shutter clicks]

261
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,400
Got it. [small laugh]

262
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,805
Wow.

263
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:42,547

All right. Amy, I'm really
freaking out right now

282
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,212
because all that stuff
you were saying earlier.

283

What were you talking about?

284
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,215
And I can't...
Like, now,

285
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,983
I don't know where you are

Yeah, hi, uh...

300

I feel like you put this idea
of dying in my head

301
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:30,607
and now I'm paranoid and
you're not calling me back.

302
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,744
Can you just call me back?

303
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,580
And I broke in your house.

We're on vacation in the Keys.

It's gorgeous
and I'm in the water.

309
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,277
I got the snorkel gear on.

310
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,112
- We were on one of those
- [whispers] You okay?

311
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,480
- [Jason] snorkel tours...
- I'm fine.

312
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:11,347
and she refuses
to get in the water.

313
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,283
- She wouldn't come in.
- [Susan] No, I'm telling you,

314

you guys,
dolphins are down to fuck.

315

This is her new kick, okay?

317
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,561
I'm curious
what you think of it.

318
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,663

with the idea that...

[knocking on door]

320
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,199
Are you expecting someone?

No, I'm not expecting anyone.

322
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:32,202
Did you get me a stripper
this year?

323
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,670
I should have done that.

324
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,106
Baby, one year
you have to get me a stripper!

325
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,409
He always threatens it...

- [door opens]
- [Jason] Hey.

327
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,177
I thought you weren't coming.

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,513
[Jane]
No, but then I decided to come.

- [door closes]
- [Jason] Okay.

330
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:46,349

I missed you.

Oh, I missed you, too.

00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:49,219
- No, I missed...
- [Jason] You okay?

333
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,554
Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good.

00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:52,222
Oh, you put these up.

335

Yeah. Well, we love
what you do. We love you.

336
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,260
- I love you, too.
- Why are you in your pajamas?

337
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,461
Yes. Well, they're floral.

338
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:01,397
[whispers]
I don't want to go in.

339
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:02,566
Is your wrist okay?

340
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,235
[Jane]
I gotta go see Madison.

341
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,302
- I got to go see Madison.
- Madison's sleeping.

342
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,771
- She's always happy to see me.
- Yes, but she's sleeping.

343
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,509
- What happened to your wrist?
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,177
Hi, Susan.

Hello, Jane.

00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:15,913
It's her birthday, so.

347
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,914
Happy... Happy birthday.

348
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:19,782
She just... She came.

349
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:21,384
Yes, I can see.

350
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,420
It's Jane.
Jane is here, everyone.

351
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:26,322
Jane, I'm so happy
you could make it.

Thought inspiration struck.

353
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,226
Let's go in and say hi
to everybody. Okay?

354
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,396
- I'll go say hi.
- You're just in time for cake.

355
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:35,298
I do. I love...
[whispers] I love cake.

356
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,766
Awesome, we're gonna have some.

357
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,836
She loves cake.

358
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,771
This is Jane.

359
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,639
[Jason] I told you about
Brian and Tilly?

360
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:44,240
- Hi.
- [Jason] Have a seat.

361
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:45,643
Susan was just
telling us about

362
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,944
her fascination
with dolphin fucking.

363
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,380
Oh, where you going? Sit down.

364
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:53,416
Take a seat. It's cool.

365
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:54,918
Anyways,

366
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,355
yes, dolphins are
like sex maniacs.

367
00:35:58,387 --> 00:35:59,889
You guys, I'm not kidding you.

368
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,391
Dolphins.

369
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,227
[Susan]
They will fuck all the time.

370
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,396
They fuck around
with porpoises,

371
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,731
with baby dolphins...

372
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:09,365
Sometimes they'll just kill it.

373
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:11,402
- I mean, it's wild!
- [Tilly] Oh, my gosh!

374
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:13,670
They've been known
to trap other dolphins in caves

375
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,440
to rape them.
[laughs] I can't even!

376
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:18,375
Do you know,
I just read the other day

377
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,743
that they will
bump into puffer fish

378
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,479
because they'll get high.

379
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:24,715
You can get high from
bumping into a puffer fish.

380
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,585
Wow. That's a new fun fact
that I haven't heard.

381
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:30,453
I knew their dicks
could grab things,

382
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,822
but I didn't know they
get high off of puffer fish.

383
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,525
- [Susan] You love that.
- [Jason laughs]

384
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:37,527
- [Jason] No, they get high
- [laughs]

385
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,930
- off of bumping into things?
- Yes!

386
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:42,566
Yes, I'm saying that dolphins,

387
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,402
they are, pretty much,
just like us.

388
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:47,837
Oh, Susan!
[laughs]

389
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:49,706
- [Susan laughs] They are!
- [laughs]

390
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:53,376
Okay, I'm sorry, that's
not exactly what I want

391
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,245
and how I want to
live my life,

392
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,380
- but we have similarities.
- [Jason laughs]

393
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:59,316
Right? It's human nature.

394
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,019
Doesn't, Michael Jackson have
that song called Human Nature?

395
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,021
Yes, he does. Madonna...

396
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:05,389
And Boyz II Men.

397
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:06,923
[Susan]
Love Boyz II Men.

398
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:09,393
[Tilly] Actually, I think
it's really interesting,

399
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,693
about the dolphins.

400
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,663
I like you. She's great.

401
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:15,566
She's great, Brian. Good job.

402
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,635
Yeah, she's great.

403
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,574
I didn't realize dolphins
were so interesting.

404
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,309
[Susan]
I know. I know!

405
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:29,380
They are really humans
without society.

406
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,014
- Jane?
- [Jane] Yes?

407
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:34,584
What's your take on
the whole dolphin-fucking thing

408
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,719
and how we're
not so different than fish?

409
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,455
- Uh...
- [Susan] No, baby,

410
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:40,023
dolphins are not fish.

411
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:41,791
- Okay, so Jane and I
- [sighs]

412
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:45,461
very rarely agree on anything,
but I actually think

413
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,897
we might be
on the same page on this one.

414
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,701
You spend all your days

415
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,702
looking deep
into your microscope,

416
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:54,637
looking at these
small images saying,

417
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,540
"Oh, this flower
is a universe,"

418
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:01,811
and I'm just saying that
dolphins are human-like

419
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,646
and we're all the same, right?

420
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,781
We're all the same.

421
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,884
Humans are the only animal

422
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:12,690
or creature that
pretends to be what it's not.

423
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:15,492
Albert Camus said that,
I think. I Googled it.

424
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,961
[laughs]

425
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:21,331
- [Brian] I like that quote.
- That's a good one.

426
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,767
- [Susan] Thank you, Jane.
- Wow, we have a reader.

427
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,670
She's something, huh?

428
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:27,871
[Susan]
She is.

429
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:31,675
[Jason and Susan laugh]

430
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,811
I just...
We're all gonna die.

431
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:37,747
I just think we should be able
to talk about it, right?

432
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,416
[all laughing]

433
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,483
I mean, I'm dying to know.

434
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:41,951
She's funny, right?

435
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:43,954
- [Susan] Wow.
- [Jason] No, she's joking.

436
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:46,356
- She's just joking around.
- You don't have to humor her.

437
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,358
- You're joking.
- Well,

438
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:51,427
it's like, I just
have this feeling,

439
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,995
the way that you know

440
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:56,532
when you're about to
get a cold the next day

441
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:58,134
and it just hasn't hit yet?

442
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:00,771
I know that's
what is happening.

443
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,539
I'm going to die tomorrow.

444
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:04,474
But how do you know?

445
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,442
I don't know. I just know.

446
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,445
So, you know it
or you don't know it?

447
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:12,516
Well, I know that I don't know.

448
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:16,420
but I know
I don't want to be alone

449
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:19,722
and I know that I'm
going to die tomorrow.

450
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,557
- [Susan] Well, if you...
- I know

451
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,626
that I'm going to
die tomorrow.

452
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,027
[Susan]
But you don't know.

453
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:26,797
I know that I'm
going to die tomorrow.

454
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:30,768
I know that I'm going to die.

455
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:36,039
Okay, great. So,
you don't know, right?

456
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:39,742
I know that it's my birthday

457
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:41,944
and I want to talk about
dolphin fucking.

458
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,947
It's all I want to talk about
tonight.

459
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,581
I don't want to
talk about death

460
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,050
because I am
not that old yet.

461
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,552
Okay. You know what?

462
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:51,087
Why don't I go into the kitchen

463
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:53,423
to get that special thing
for the birthday girl?

464
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,925
No, no, don't go now, Jason.
Just stay, now.

465
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,728
[laughs] What?
Go get my cake.

466
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,166
I'm gonna go get the cake.
[kisses]

467
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,034
Oh, my God.

468
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:07,070
I'm sorry, Susan. It's just...

469
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:11,809
something's just terribly wrong
and I just have to say it.

470
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,077
I'm going to die tomorrow.
I'm dying.

471
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,979
[Susan clears throat]
Jane, we heard you.

472
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,682
- [Jane] I'm dying.
- [Susan] I heard you! Okay?

473
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:19,950
[whispering]
You are doing

474
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,218
what you always do,

475
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,921
which is make everything
about you.

476
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,758
It's all about you, Jane,
all the fucking time.

477
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,727
You sit alone
in that room of yours

478
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,963
taking pictures
of God knows what,

479
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:35,932
because you can't hold
a normal fucking job.

480
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:39,001
The only reason I tolerate you

481
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:40,937
is to make Jason happy.

482
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,507
And I pray to God,
every fucking day,

483
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,576
that my sweet daughter
does not have

484
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:49,712
whatever gene this is
that makes you this way.

485
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:51,514
[gasps]

486
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:55,751
[Jason singing]
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

[sighs]

488
00:40:57,853 --> 00:41:01,491
- I just thought for a second,
- <i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

489
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,594
when the lights went out,
that that was it.

490
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:08,931
- Do you know? Is that it?
- <i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Susan ♪</i>

491
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:14,637
- Did we... I think that it...
- <i>♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪</i>

492
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,510
Are we already dead?

493
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:24,181
[Susan in other room]
Did Jason ever tell you

494
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:27,016
about the time that we had to
take her on vacation with us?

495
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,752
[Tilly]
Uh-huh. Yeah.

496
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,286
[Susan] She didn't want
to be left alone,

497
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,722
- so we took her. She got lost.
- It's okay.

498
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,658
I feel that way all the time,
like I'm going to die tomorrow

499
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,594
and I got to get
everything done today.

500
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,096
No. I <i>know.</i>

501
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:41,764
That feeling is
just paralyzing.

502
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:44,667
But it's really gonna happen
for me.

503
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:49,739
What are you talking about?
You don't know that.

504
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,108
Yeah, I do. I know it.
I mean, just like I know

505
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:54,310
if I drop this,
it's going to break.

506
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:55,878
[shatters]

507
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:57,580
[Susan]
For fuck's sake, Jason!

508
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:58,882
Mom?

509
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:00,317
[Susan]
I know she's your sister,

510
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,085
but she has got to go!

511
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,987
[indistinct voices echoing]

512
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,191
Mom?

[pop music playing quietly
on stereo]

516
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,692
Get the fuck away from me,
Jane!

517
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,327
[car doors close]

518
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,635
Jane, man. [chuckles]

519
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:55,271
She's crazy, right?

520
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,277
I don't think she's that crazy.

521
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:04,614
She could be right.

522
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,216
What?

523
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,387
I mean, consider for a second
that she's right.

524
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,623
We all have to die
at some point.

525
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,126
Why not tomorrow?

526
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:19,228
Yeah.

527
00:43:22,898 --> 00:43:24,999
Yeah.

528
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,637
Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,742
Do you want to get a drink
somewhere else?

530
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:34,010
Yes, I do.

531
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,715
- [dishes clinking]
- Just say, for instance,

532
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,117
- that Jane is right.
- [huffs]

533
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:46,922
Why are you always
making excuses for your sister?

534
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,258
Just listen to me.

535
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,427
I listened to you about
dolphin fucking.

536
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,396
Just listen.

537
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,932
- Fine.
- [dishes clink]

538
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,070
We're all gonna die
at some point.

539
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:02,105
[Susan]
Yeah, no shit.

540
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:04,807
We are going to die.
I'm gonna die.

541
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,678
[sighs]

542
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,416
I could die tomorrow.

543
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,391
- [dishes clinking]
- [water running]

544
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:28,699
[indistinct voices echoing]

545
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:44,114
[voices continue]

546
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:49,153
[whispers]
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

547
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:07,203
[indistinct voices echoing]

548
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,348
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

549
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,187
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

550
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:28,023
[crying]
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

551
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:29,792
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

552
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:36,232
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

553
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:52,481
- [Jason] Susan? Susan?
- [Susan sobbing]

554
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:55,551
- [Jason] Susan! Susan!
- Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

555
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:59,389
- [sobbing]
- I need to go to the hospital.

556
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,826
- [machine beeps]
- [breathing]

557
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,103
[kisses]
I love you, Pop.

558
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,179
[choking]

559
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:27,017
[steady beep]

560
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,161
- [Susan] Hey.
- [Jason] Hey.

561
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:39,563
- [Madison] Mom?
- It's okay.

562
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,398
- Dad?
- [kisses]

563
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,166
It's okay, it's okay.

564
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,235
It's okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

565
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:46,369
[sniffs]

566
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,538
Why are you crying?

567
00:46:49,304 --> 00:46:51,875
- [Susan sniffles]
- It's okay, it's okay.

568
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,277
Are you drunk?

569
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,145
[crying]
Yes, a little bit.

570
00:46:58,414 --> 00:47:02,286
I'm gonna die tomorrow.
And so is your dad.

571
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:09,159
I should have done this
for him sooner.

572
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:18,999
I was waiting for him to die
to break up with you.

573
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,972
I mean, I was gonna
give it three months.

574
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,907
I didn't want to be an asshole.

575
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:30,980
We weren't gonna last anyway.

576
00:47:33,682 --> 00:47:36,586
[Madison crying hysterically]
I don't want to die. Mom!

577
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:41,123
Mom, I don't want to die now.

578
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:42,626
[Susan]
She did this to us.

579
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:46,462
- [Jason] Who?
- [Madison shrieking]

580
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,898
[Susan]
Your sister.

581
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,300
Not only is she killing us,

582
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,302
she's killing her.

583
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:55,504
She's killing Madison.

584
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,411
[Jason]
What do you wanna do?

585
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:03,112
[Madison still crying
hysterically]

586
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,414
[Susan]
You know.

587
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:10,553
Okay.

588
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:12,922
[Madison shrieking]

589
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,257
[phone ringing in ear]

590
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:15,358
[indistinct chatter
in waiting room]

591
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:20,130
[Amy's voicemail] <i>There's no nd
to leave a message.</i>

592
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,070
[into phone]
Amy, please, call me back.

593
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:29,972
What the hell is that message?
What are you talking about?

594
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:31,473
I know you know
what is going on

595
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:33,376
and you've left me
all alone with this.

596
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:36,646
Please. Amy, please, please!

597
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,648
You're my friend, call me back.

598
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:44,286
[into phone]
Hey, it's Amy.

599
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,989
I won't be around tomorrow.

600
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:50,494
Or any day after that, but
feel free to leave a message.

601
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,302
[on recording]
<i>Hey, it's Amy.</i>

602
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:01,170
<i>I won't be around tomorrow.</i>

603
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,976
<i>Or any day after that, but
feel free to leave a message.</i>

604
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:15,552
[into phone] There's no need
to leave a message.

605
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,454
[man]
All right, let's do it!

606
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,125
[Amy]
Do I have to wear the helmet?

607
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:25,027
[man] Uh, yeah. Definitely very
important to wear the helmet.

608
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,696
You know, these things
look like big toys,

609
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,397
but at the end of the day,

610
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,666
if you hit anything too fast
and too straight on,

611
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:33,369
this thing can flip
right the fuck over.

612
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:35,304
Well, I'm gonna die anyway.

613
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,344
I mean...

614
00:49:41,443 --> 00:49:44,447
[laughs]

615
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,083
not here. I mean,
not on my watch.

616
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:48,418
[laughs]

617
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,485
Right.

618
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,555
But I'm definitely gonna
die tomorrow.

619
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:02,599
Umm...

620
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:09,538
[exhales]

621
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,446
I can't hear anything.

622
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:20,083
Okay.

623
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,353
[exhales]
But I'm dying tomorrow.

624
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:29,826
Please.

625
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:31,827
Look...

626
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,696
I don't think that
anything is wrong with you,

627
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,166
but if you're worried about
catching something,

628
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,602
I could easily give you
some antibiotics or...

629
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,538
No, I don't need antibiotics.

630
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,576
You know when you're
on a highway, you know,

631
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,644
and there's a semi
truck up ahead of you

632
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:51,447
and you know, I have to
speed up and get past that

633
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,316
before something
really bad happens?

634
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,718
That's what's going on.

635
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:58,388
Or when you're
walking in New York City...

636
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,489
Have you been to New York City?

637
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,662
Yes, I've been
to New York City.

638
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,664
Right, so in the summer,
when you look up

639
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,633
and there's air conditioners
everywhere, and...

640
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,635
you just know one of those
is going to pop out

641
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:15,271
and crash down on my head.

642
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,576
Or like, when you lock up
everything at night,

643
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,613
I mean, you make sure
everything's locked,

644
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,348
but then

645
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,353
you just know something
really bad is gonna happen.

646
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:33,188
And then you lay down
finally to go to sleep,

647
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:36,426
but then you imagine this guy,
and his friends,

648
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,494
and they're coming...

649
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:42,464
not just to take
everything that you have,

650
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,867
but to rape you, and kill you.

651
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,870
And not just rape you,
but taunt you

652
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:51,240
so, kind of, mercilessly

653
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:55,244
that you're going to have to
beg for your own...

654
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,940
[Craig]
Do you ever ride a dune buggy?

655
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,440
No.

656
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:00,510
- [Craig] You want to?
- Yes.

657
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,378
We could go now,
you can make a U-turn.

658
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,480
That's actually on
the schedule for tomorrow.

659
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:06,548
Oh, there's a schedule,
that's very fun.

660
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:08,717
A lot of people don't think
schedules are fun,

661
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,753
but I'm glad to hear
you think they are,

662
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:14,289
because to me,
that's a big part of my life.

663
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:15,491
[laughs]

664
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,701
[door closes]

665
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:42,518
- [keys jingle]
- We're in.

666
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,753
Hey.

667
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:46,322
Good job.

668
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,461
[Craig chuckles]

669
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:55,999
[Amy]
This place is nice.

670
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:03,840
[doors slide]

671
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,008
Wow.

672
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:11,748
So, this is
your brother's place?

673
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,682
[Craig]
Yeah, but he never uses it.

674
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:14,984
[Amy]
It's great

675
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:28,331
[Craig opens door]
Back door,

676
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,365
in case of an emergency.

677
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:31,835
It's good to know your exits.

678
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:40,943
[sighs]

679
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:46,081
I thought about buying
a place out here like this,

680
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:48,817
but I don't know,
it felt too isolated.

681
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,586
[Craig]
I like being isolated.

682
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:52,021
I don't think
you have a choice,

683
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:56,391
[laughs] 'cause you
don't have any friends.

684
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:58,094
[Craig laughs]
That's not very nice.

685
00:54:58,126 --> 00:54:59,895
What's wrong
with being isolated?

686
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,530
Nothing.

687
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:04,366
You know, I know you said
you didn't like TV,

688
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,436
so I went ahead and removed
all of the televisions,

689
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:10,105
in fact,
all the entertainment options,

690
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:11,673
so it's just you and me.

691
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:12,875
That's perfect.

692
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,682
[Craig]
You mind if I get more wine?

693
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,418
No, of course not.

694
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,954
No? I don't want to make you
uncomfortable if you...

695
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:26,822
That's fine,
just 'cause I don't drink

696
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,358
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

697
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,728
- Can't argue with that.
- [Amy chuckles]

698
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:52,448
Are those for show or
do people actually shoot?

699
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:54,684
We can shoot them.

700
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,054
Do you like guns?

701
00:55:58,086 --> 00:55:59,121
Yeah.

702
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:01,923
You wanna shoot some bottles?

703
00:56:01,956 --> 00:56:03,893
- No. [laughs]
- [Craig laughs]

704
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,094
I don't like guns.

705
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:07,896
Well, you don't have to.

706
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,965
- We can take that off schedule.
- [laughs]

707
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,666
Free up some time.

708
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:12,935
To do what?

709
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,139
Usually when I come out here,

710
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,840
I just eat a bunch
of mushrooms.

711
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,041
Oh.

712
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,011
I'd do mushrooms.

713
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,547
Yeah?

714
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:25,882
Just not alcohol.

715
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:31,020
Okay.

716
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:35,858
I like that. You like that?

717
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,666
Uh, do you have any eights?

718
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,101
Go fish.

719
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,539
Do you have any fives?

720
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:53,976
- [Craig laughs] You got a lot?
- [laughs]

721
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:55,945
You gotta have a five
in there, somewhere.

722
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:58,014
- I don't. Go fish.
- [Craig] Oh, my God.

723
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:02,184
Um, do you have any eights?

724
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:03,452
Did I just ask you that?

725
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:04,719
I can't remember.

726
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:06,456
- [laughs]
- Do you feel anything?

727
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:09,791
Mmm... I guess colors
are a little bit brighter.

728
00:57:09,824 --> 00:57:12,828
But I don't, like,
see anything.

729
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:15,731
Do you feel anything?

730
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,599
Um...

731
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:20,802
I'm seeing a bunch of diamonds
and hearts on these cards.

732
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:23,004
[laughs] I see them, too.

- Pizza!
- I'll get it.

736
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:31,681
Don't cheat.

I have extra cash
if you need it.

739

Is everything okay?

740
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:04,646

741
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:36,112
Pizza!

742
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:50,293
Is everything okay?

743
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:57,967
What's wrong?

744

745
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,643
The day after tomorrow?

746
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:12,581
What do we have to leave
a day early or something?

747
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,887
It's fine.

748
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,655
It's fine, everything's fine.

749

I can't believe it.

753
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:48,217
I know.

754
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:01,965
You wanna make out?

755
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:04,333
Okay.

756
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:16,378
Ah, I can't do this right now.

Everything's closet space.

763
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,801
I should have
built a tunnel

764
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:41,771

It's not really my specialty,

766
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:46,942
but I could...

767
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,777
I could refer you to...

768
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:53,014
I could refer you
to a psychologist.

769
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:54,983
It's just not really
my specialty.

770
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,887
You all right?

771
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:03,026
It's just, you're
really handsome and I...

if it's real.

that we spent together.

I just feel like if you
were really into me,

858
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:35,984
you would have, like,

859
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:39,520
texted to say
you weren't coming.

860
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,590

they used to talk about.

Hi.

[Erin] Do you think these ants
are gonna die?

910
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:52,975
Of course.

911
01:16:54,274 --> 01:16:55,376
Everything is.

01:17:24,404 --> 01:17:26,041

918
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:29,043
- It's my last period. [laughs]

[Jane grunts]

920
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,385
The women back in the day
used to sit in the streams.

921
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:43,123
And the streams would
take away all the blood.

922
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:45,960
- For like the whole...
- Tribe.

923
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:49,197
And the women would get their
period at the same time, too.

924
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:52,433
And, like, so when
the Spaniards came

925
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:54,802
and would see
the rivers of blood,

926
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,204
they would think, "Oh,
they're doing sacrifices."

927
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:59,039
[both laugh]

928
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:00,142
Weirdest thing.

929
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:03,744
I love trees.
I'm gonna miss them.

930
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:05,280

Um...

935
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,326
Do you do custom work?

936
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,000
Like, if I were to bring you...

937
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:34,802
a...

938
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:38,807
a mammal, could you
make a leather jacket for me?

939
01:19:40,274 --> 01:19:43,978
I can assume that
you know the smell of death

940
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:46,080
takes a while.

941
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:48,115
It's something that you learn.

942
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,929
We do do custom work.

943
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:04,499
You have to bring in the skin
as soon as possible.

944
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:06,234
It can't be rotting.

945
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:09,136
And ideally, it would be good
if it was warm.

946
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,038
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

947
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:14,876
If you bring the carcass in
and it's still warm,

948
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:16,877
I can skin it,

949
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:20,047
and then I will cure
it using a salt solution.

950
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,518
When the salt solution is done,

951
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:27,622
I will then take the hide and
hang it out in the sun to dry.

952
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:30,524
It's a very long process.

953
01:20:30,557 --> 01:20:33,360
And it's up to you
to bring in the hide

954
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:35,864
in the proper condition.
Do you understand?

955
01:20:35,896 --> 01:20:37,631
Uh-huh.

956
01:20:37,664 --> 01:20:40,601
If you bring it in that way, we
can make you whatever you like.

957
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:44,172
What do you do
with the rest of the body?

958

959
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:13,234

961
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:23,043
I'm okay.

962
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:31,653
I'm ready.

963
