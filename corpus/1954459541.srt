1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,339
Are you having fun?

2
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:51,879
Yes.

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,889
You know,
you wrote this song for her.

4
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,850
You sure.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,645
There is something romantic.

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,150
You sure.

7
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,738
"Baby, I wrote this song
if fucking"

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,495
Because you've never played that for me.

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,290
I had not finished bunny.

10
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,667
Wanted it to be super good.

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,086
- Did you like?
- Si.

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,213
- Yes?
- Si.

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,131
All right.

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,594
- And... find this.
- Si.

15
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,305
're So sweet.

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,306
Where did you get that?

17
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,519
I do not know, I think I
found in the grass.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,314
We're leaving.

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,400
Yes.

20
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,109
Yes.

21
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,033
Bunny, honey, where are you?

22
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,213
Yes.

23
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,885
My God. Sweetie

24
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,145
Baby, you're so bad.

25
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,479
I know.

26
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,048
God.

27
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,555
No, no, God.

28
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,490
Thou soul stays with me.

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,094
FIELDS OF THE DEAD

30
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,791
fucking hate  Lions.

31
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,085
This is a shock.

32
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,757
Trent
could not have found a research site.

33
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,676
Yeah, where is that is this place?

34
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,096
Is an abandoned farm that
university purchased 10 years ago.

35
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,057
In fact, they got it very cheap.

36
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,391
- Yes? .
- Yes

37
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,268
Well, probably
there is a reason for that.

38
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:59,400
Was it the killer boyfriend, a slaughter of Indians
,

39
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,193
not forget the fucking death cult.

40
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,945
Someone must have spent some time on the Internet
last night.

41
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,657
Yeah, well I had time to look
things more interesting than that.

42
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,910
What, boobs and vaginas?

43
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,536
In the account. All right.

44
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
Hey guys, need to start behaving
.

45
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,831
You were the ones who pointed
for research.

46
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,666
Yes
because it is mandatory for graduation.

47
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,835
Coercion?

48
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,130
And you who are, pre-lawyer?

49
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,883
Yeah, well mom fawning
playing for you, Trent.

50
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,010
- All right.
- Burned.

51
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,387
Look, going to be a difficult journey know.

52
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,013
But we can also have fun.

53
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,141
We do our research,
our work during the day...

54
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,768
and had a fun night.

55
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,895
Do not let it bother you,
affection. It will be a good week.

56
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,397
Thank you.

57
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,857
The best week!

58
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,791
Thank you.

59
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,292
God, this weighs.

60
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,837
That's a gay bag.

61
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,007
Thank you.

62
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,140
Well, my bag.

63
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
Ashley!

64
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,609
Cheryl, are you ready for the filets
store?

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,279
Here. Thank you.

66
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,905
Want to help me with this please?

67
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,701
Thanks for the help, these things always get
problems.

68
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,661
No problem.

69
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,372
Also, this should come
my share of the rent.

70
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry, your rent?

71
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,960
Yes, roommate.

72
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,754
I do not think so.

73
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,717
Moreover, do not you want a room with Ashley
?

74
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,139
Ashley is not the kind of woman he wanted
to cohabit.

75
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,605
Would you want a room with Ashley?

76
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,607
No, decidedly not.

77
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,692
Well, I think that settles it.

78
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,528
Actually
Linda and I share the store.

79
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,573
Well, that is fine,
I do not mind sharing.

80
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,786
- Shop, Cheryl.
- Si.

81
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,580
God, do not imagine things.

82
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,374

's Actually quite logical when you think about it.

83
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,253
I mean, Trent and
Randy, obviously. Linda and me.

84
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,255
Obvious.

85
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,174
Josh and you.

86
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,217
Course.

87
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,345
Ashley
has his own shop so... we are complete.

88
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,850
Yes, I guess that covers it.

89
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,970
Yes.

90
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,856
So much so, no!

91
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,202
I have three days to take her to bed.

92
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,207
Hey, knucklehead,
what the fuck do I do with this?

93
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,919
Sit up.

94
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,880
Is not funny.

95
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,050
All this corn was infected by this disease
earlier this year.

96
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,177
Yes, you can see there.

97
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,473
Let the barn. Gather and prepare all
,

98
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,641
we go early in the morning.

99
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,476
Early?

100
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,019
Very early.

101
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,522
Remember, I'm useless before seven.

102
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,359
Useless opposed to... porcelain.

103
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,944
Hey, no shower.

104
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,781
No shower out here.

105
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:37,159
All right. Well, I have to shower
at least once daily.

106
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,412
Seriously, we're one week.

107
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,539
I know,
a week without a shower, that's disgusting.

108
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,417
We are there.

109
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,962
It's okay. Good luck with that.

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,175
Go find a shower. All right.

111
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,067
So
I'm not interrupting anything here, right?

112
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,320
No.

113
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,865
is a little cloudy in here, yes?

114
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,996
I care little, but do not let Trent
see this.

115
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,791
I say, he acts quite great,
trying to be okay with you ..

116
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,628
But this is her thesis project.

117
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes this is fucked
is capable of killing someone.

118
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,344
So what touches me something?

119
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,070
That's disgusting.

120
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
It's not so bad.

121
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,742
What am I going to do?
I have to be clean.

122
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,078
You know, I have a plan B.

123
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,040
brought a hose, we can connect
to drain beside the barn,

124
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,544
take it to the barn, be
clean water. Privacy will also.

125
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,089
Will frost.

126
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,177
The put from morning, the sun's heat
,

127
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,764
but have to shower in forty seconds.

128
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,225
Forty seconds warm water, you can handle that?

129
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,938
- Forty seconds to shower?
- Yes, a shower actually.

130
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,274
You're an idiot?

131
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,780
Well, do you like that, wood?

132
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,495
Hi brother.

133
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,207
Does this still work?

134
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,459
This is an amazing machine.

135
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,753
- Well, now we have wood
tonight. - Yes

136
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,076
Lamp fuck, fuck..

137
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,521
Trent.

138
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,483
- God, Jones, you scared me.
- I've been looking everywhere.

139
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,694
Thought you returned to camp without me.

140
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,238
What ?, no.

141
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,406
I came here to find you, I
I'm looking at you.

142
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,410
Yeah, well, they are seven, and that's what makes
as 45 minutes.

143
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
So, what time is
camp?

144
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,333
In an hour or less.

145
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,379
Then we have time.

146
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,089
A little, yes.

147
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,758
Let's use that time.

148
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,429
Yes, we can... make snow cones
or something...

149
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,602
Steven would kill me if he saw me eating this.

150
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,146
Yes, I would be scared that you're neglecting
.

151
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,439
Because you arm is as big as my alita
.

152
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,786
You. know that he is training to be a boxer
, right?

153
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,778
Is in very good shape.

154
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,406
It's just that I also
is in good shape.

155
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,409
So this is how it will be,
five of us doing it all alone...

156
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,619
while the two lovebirds do God knows what.

157
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,664
Well, I bet you can guess what they are doing
now.

158
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,085
Moron.

159
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,503
I'm just saying.

160
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,755
Do you really think you are doing
in the barn?

161
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,008
Is so dirty there.

162
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,260
God would never do without.

163
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,178
Even with Steve.

164
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,098
Well, technically, Trent is in.

165
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,976
What an idiot you are!

166
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,186
're Back.

167
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,856
Hello gang, how's it going?

168
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,817
Randy, shine.

169
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,820
Hello friend. Hello.

170
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,532
Did you leave the computer in the barn?

171
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,578
You know, you took
wood for the fire?

172
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,289
Do not know what that means.

173
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,709
Did you have sex with her?

174
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
Smell sex.

175
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,565
Dude, that's Cheryl is very good.

176
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,028
Well, I think she has
eyes for one person here.

177
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,906
So, good luck with that.

178
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,054
I tell you, I see this as an obstacle
...

179
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:53,994
but as an opportunity, my friend
.

180
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,289
Thought you chosen sex partner to you.

181
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,791
What?

182
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,876
Ashley.

183
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,337
Since I was there and I've tried.

184
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,338
STAY AWAY.

185
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,673
Respect.

186
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,675
All the time.

187
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,679
You beer, my love.

188
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,808
You. do they talk about?

189
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,101
None.

190
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,061
Linda has a great voice.

191
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,021
Would be a good American Idol.

192
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,190
Yes, I should audition.

193
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,402
Yes, it should.

194
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,779
Should tell.

195
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,240
I understand.

196
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,130
But if you're a fan of Linda Small.

197
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,258
Yes, it is so wide.

198
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,844
I'd love to see that.

199
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,516
Well, once again, going for an encore.

200
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,853
No, I think it done.

201
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,903
Before that Downhill Cartwright was established,

202
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,615
residents
had a relationship of tension with the natives.

203
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,662
So these group
traveling in the region to prevent attacks.

204
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,791
However, travel prints
passed...

205
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,127
from the holy land of the Indians.

206
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,920
Native Americans.

207
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,591
Multiculturalism. Amordácenme.

208
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,343
They were here first, idiot.

209
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,598
Anyone else, Ashley?

210
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,810
'll Take that as a yes.

211
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:47,816
Two days after Jack and Emma Cartwright disappeared...

212
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,466
their bodies were found in the forest,

213
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:56,748
mutilated, in
skinned skull.

214
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,995
Raleigh Cartwright formed the group immediately war...

215
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,956
to achieve his revenge.

216
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,337
Later that night
inhabitants massacred a tribe nearby.

217
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,049
Men, women, children.

218
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,802
No one survived.

219
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,517
That's the official story,
but according to Indian legend...

220
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,895
Trent, by God,
Native American legend.

221
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,898
Shut up, Ashley.

222
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,027
Several days later, the men of the tribe who were...

223
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,365
hunting discovered his slain brothers.

224
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,743
Y
cast a curse on those who were responsible.

225
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:46,583
Nenwey, the worst curse, the
despicable of all beings.

226
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,505
Good!
Wonderful piece of land to investigate, Trent.

227
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,592
Yes love, I'm a little scared.

228
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,055
Is a story of camping
I am trying to have fun with you.

229
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
Well, how does it end?

230
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,688
The curse did not allow the souls to rest
blah blah blah Fuck.

231
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,567
This story stinks.

232
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,573
The scared, guys.

233
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,575
Where's the beer, Alex?

234
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,410
The forgot.

235
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:43,408
Linda, Linda hears.

236
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,070
"Brothers, we must avenge our
."

237
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:09,369
"We have been cursed and my loved ones have been snatched
I"

238
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:19,046
"The fault is yours, unless the person is born
not man."

239
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,557
"You and Cheryl must not leave me."

240
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:38,815
Cheryl arise,
Trent wants to do the job today.

241
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,614
Come on, get up, Trent
wants to look fit.

242
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,350
- Hey, you're fine.
- Yes, I'm fine.

243
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,438
I did not sleep very well last night.
Did you drink too much? You look stunned.

244
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,235
I had a bad dream about that woman
Trent spoke.

245
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,072
My God, that was so stupid.
All here know that stupid story.

246
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,742
I know, do not be so heavy on that.

247
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,496
Do not worry, I will not tell anyone
how pathetic you are.

248
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,999
Come on.

249
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:50,470
- Very hot.
- I know, a lot.

250
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,808
Are you done?

251
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,394
Ashley know, because it
take the shovel for a while...

252
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,813
I have to write the report of the day.

253
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,357
I do not use the shovel.

254
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,662
Thank you.

255
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,798
The ladies do not use the shovel.

256
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,742
Son 13:20 Ashley
if you're listening,

257
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:35,849
that means 20 minutes after one.

258
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,479
Temperature: A hot as hell.

259
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,108
Humidity: Probably 80%
judging by what I'm sweaty.

260
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,990
I hate them, they make me puke.

261
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,411
You can not be adopted without
give you a little back.

262
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:44,042
Hey, are you, are you guys? Hello.

263
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,343
Hi.

264
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,274
Hello?

265
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,538
"August 16, 1843.
I am nearing the end of my pregnancy."

266
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,877
"I counted the months and
afraid that this child does not belong to Raleigh."

267
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,674
"Nine September, 1848.
Jack is five years old and"

268
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:19,137
"is less like Raleigh
and his real father."

269
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:26,478
"Raleigh
looks so shady and I think it is"

270
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,270
". Beginning to suspect the truth"

271
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:34,486
"Three May, 1853. I'm sure Raleigh
knows."

272
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,822
"Treat Jack
more like a servant than a son,"

273
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,950
". And cruelly punished"

274
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,496
"I do not think
miss this for so long,"

275
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082
"because Jack is the spitting image of his father
."

276
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,626
"And the townspeople notice it."

277
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,796
"I fear for our lives, we must flee."

278
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,981
Hi gang. Preparing to leave.

279
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,944
And Josh?

280
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,944
Realising pleasure.

281
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,612
Not for twenty minutes, so
that we should go get it.

282
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:05,076
Josh! Hey, stop masturbating
, we gotta go.

283
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
Is not what I had in mind. No?

284
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,747
No. Sorry.

285
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,832
're An idiot.
I'll get it, I'll be right back.

286
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,045
HMT means talk to you later, SMS.

287
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,500
Yes, yes, yes.

288
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,218
What about Randy? Hello idiot.

289
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,388
Seriously.

290
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,474
That was funny.

291
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:37,024
Josh, Josh.

292
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:41,486
God, man
I was looking for.

293
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,366
Hey, I'm ten feet from you.

294
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,566
Hey friend. Hey.

295
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,918
Slight Literature?

296
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,004
Yes, I guess, this is so fucked up.

297
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:05,159
're Really into it,
we gotta go, we go.

298
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,020
Good job, even you Ashley.

299
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,064
Finished? Yes, we finished.

300
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,983
Thank God, I'm disgusting.

301
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:24,321
I'm taking a shower, do not follow me.

302
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,576
You heard her.

303
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:32,247
How drunk was
when I thought this would be a good idea?

304
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:37,085
'm An idiot. I was thinking about me.

305
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,547
I have to stop thinking with my... fret.

306
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,484
Forty seconds, you can.

307
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,661
God, because I do.

308
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:20,587
34, 33, 32, 31

309
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,218
Anyone there?

310
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,970
Alex, I'm going to hit.

311
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,697
What an idiot!

312
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,047
30, 29... 26...

313
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,580
Shit forty seconds.

314
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,580
"Which truth be told"

315
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,278
Hey, did you hear something? No.

316
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,869
"Which truth be told"

317
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,218
Cheryl, Cheryl. What is that?

318
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,059
Do you hear that?

319
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,605
I can not. Can we see how they are?

320
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,400
You gotta be fucking me.

333
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,392
It's okay.

334
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,319
Could stop Christ.

335
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,500
Cheryl, are you okay?

336
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:10,250
Say something, are you okay? We scared.

337
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,810
What the hell was that?

338
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,529
Everyone back to his tent to sleep.

339
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:09,120
Cheryl, hello,
'll take the sample or what?

340
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,998
Sorry, I'm a little out of my element
today

341
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,210
'm sure Ashley would

342
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,047
Scared me so much last night. This is A4.

343
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,260
So the two talked me
makeover and to each other?

344
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,470
Yeah, that would be the best time to

know Posh Spice,
my new best friend.

346
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,311
Yes, that whole scene Linda Blair
you had last night, definitely perfect.

347
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,565
It was great. We talk about
subtle power of pink.

348
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,152
And the majesty of
the Cosmo quiz.

349
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,904
Was amazing.

350
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,701
Hey ladies, Any of you can help me with my
"Dec State", dictated...

351
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,038
No. Okay, no.

clear sky. Normal temperature of 80
.

354
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:17,813
Signals bites everywhere... Shit!

355
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:22,109
Was just a bug. Randy and Trent:
status of the relationship: strong.

356
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:29,033
I still wonder if I'll be able to sleep with
Cheryl.

357
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:29,784
The prognosis is currently unknown.

358
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,544
Ashley,
you want to lay in the sun all day or...

359
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yes.

360
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,300
Okay.

361
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,387
Steve will take me to the wedding of her cousin
two weeks.

362
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,847
And I have to look tanned,
so leave me alone.

363
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,352
And I do not block the sun.

364
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:05,713
Guys, guys, I think I found something.

365
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,318
- Man, what the hell is that?
- I'm studying agronomy,

366
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,279
- I'm not the fucking Indiana Jones.
- Looks like a religious artifact.

367
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,618
I wonder if these were lands
burial of Native Americans.

368
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,580
Look, okay
look but make sure you back up where it belongs.

369
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,543
This land used to mean a lot, so I respetémoslo.

370
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,186
Idiot not snore.

371
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,327
My God. Damn.

372
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,080
Where this fucking idiot hid beer?

373
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:10,212
I have never been more sober in my life
. What the fuck is that?

374
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,151
Shit, shit.

375
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,410
Fuck!

376
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,038
Has anyone seen Cheryl?

377
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,096
It was
walk through the early morning.

378
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,598
- Alone?
- No, Josh was with her.

379
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,440
- Why Josh would be with her?
- I do not know.

380
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:03,195
Why two people escabullirían
in the woods alone? Randy? ¿Trent?

381
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,489
- So what, we look for?
- Maybe.

382
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:10,702
I hate to jump on the bandwagon of
perverts but Alex is right.

383
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,437
Call them and tell them that we found on the site
5.

384
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,329
We are going in 20
minutes with pants.

385
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,542
Great.

386
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,759
Be a good day. A good day.

387
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,731
Hey, it's me.
I do not know where you are, we're leaving.

388
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,778
Come to the site  5, is in your map.

389
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,407
Call me when you get this. All right.

390
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:56,165
In fact it is much better. Now I reach.

391
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,755
- You are right.
- Our ferocious leader is a fool.

392
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:09,136
- And you're no better.
- Look, he stressed.

393
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,975
Try to be great, to inspire,
but you can not perform under pressure.

394
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,978
Seriously, is like a
combination of five years of work.

395
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,484
Well, look, we advance what ifs
really work today...

396
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,280
So do not bother so much...

397
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,198
and then we can sneak to look for these lovebirds.

398
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,234
Do not think you're doing, right?

399
00:48:33,935 --> 00:48:36,954
I do not know, a journey of research like this...

400
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,752
outside in the forest, does
strangers bed partners, uh, maybe?

401
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,173
We'll see.

402
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,484
Cheryl.

403
00:49:19,485 --> 00:49:23,957
Cheryl, Cheryl!

404
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:33,387
I missed this morning.
Linda tried to call 4 times.

405
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,140
- Where were you?
- Here.

406
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,059
- And this morning?
- In the barn.

407
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,106
- With Josh?
- Yes.

408
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,654
- Where is Josh now?
- He said he was going to meet you

409
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:57,286
I felt bad, so I fell asleep here
.. Did you find it?

410
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,916
No. I'll have to report this to
Dr. Foy and the three are going to solve it.

411
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,169
I know, sorry,
was stupid.

412
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,630
're Absolutely right, it was.

413
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:50,088
"July 15: Day two of
sample collection."

414
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,344
"Son 13:20 Ashley
if you're listening,

415
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,305
<i>
that means 20 minutes after one o'clock." </ I>

416
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,894
"That's what she said."

417
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,565
"Soil samples look promising today
,

418
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,524
despite my best efforts...

419
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,611
things are progressing well."
"Why do not listen"

420
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,491
"Why do not you listen to me"

421
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,798
"Please, please listen,
I have little time."

422
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:41,223
This is stupid. "I'm trapped here
forgotten God

423
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,559
and we can not go."

424
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,944
"Please help, this
is our purpose."

425
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,698
"Your secrets must be disclosed."

426
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,159
"
Raleigh should be known for who he really was."

427
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,584
"Please help, can not stand this anymore
,

428
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,548
fear for our lives when he finds out."

429
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,970
"We must flee, no, you must flee."

430
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:37,696
"Do not have much time,
Alex, please listen to me."

431
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,869
Here is you water. Thank you.

432
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,178
Can I talk to you? Yes, please.

433
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,226
I do not remember what happened last night.

434
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:15,524
And no.
I do not remember anything until you found me today.

435
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:24,868
- What happened to Josh?
- I do not know, there was...

436
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,000
You know what, sure okay, sure.

437
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:42,511
Let's do dinner.
Why do not you go to the barn and looking at Alex?

438
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:03,281
"Please help can not stand this anymore

439
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
." I fear for our lives
when he hears "

440
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,801
- Alex
- Yes.

441
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,470
- Dinner is ready
-. Thanks.

442
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,443
Josh  Why not have your phone
Who does that?

443
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,782
probably thought it would not be covered here
What is it

444
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:52,622
This is a book that Josh was reading yesterday
.

445
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,667
was acting really weird with it What is

446
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,628
I do not know, at first I thought it was a
map...

447
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,590
treasure was in an expedition
or something...

448
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,176
but when I read
is the diary of a woman.

449
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:13,643
"I think Raleigh knows, I fear for our lives...
must flee."

450
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:21,359
- What was that, Alex?
- That phrase, I swear...

451
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,445
I heard my recorder

452
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,574
some random recording,
or something like that.

453
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:28,366
A voice, what the hell are you talking about?

454
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,869
- Let me hear.
- It's nothing, well,

455
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,582
rechecked and there was nothing.

456
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,375
But you heard a voice.

457
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,878
Thought it was a voice,
well, I'm not sure.

458
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,883
I'm exhausted.
I can not sleep with all this shit happens.

459
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,764
So this is your plan, Emma.

460
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,684
What?

461
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,270
Well, what are you supposed
do then sit here...

462
00:55:57,638 --> 00:55:59,773
and wait to do again. No, seriously
guys, something is happening.

463
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,402
Josh is a big boy.
You know what, Josh is fine.

464
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,280
Is probably elsewhere,
I believe that conversation...

465
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,616
him, that
end up elsewhere.

466
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:16,077
Is now dusk,
be here anytime. It's okay.

467
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,001
Yet.

468
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,849
- It's getting late.
- Josh should be back.

469
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:39,129
Yes, what time will it be enough
late to start looking?

470
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,230
About a half hour ago.

471
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,566
Well, yes. They need to stop, this is
seriously screwed.

472
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,248
Josh is there in the woods alone...

473
00:56:45,249 --> 00:56:47,779
and you're not going to find
because it is dark.

474
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,948
I'm tired.

475
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:54,077
Shit, I'm going to pee, you have one minute
twenty-five seconds...

476
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,578
to organize a search party.

477
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,832
That's it.

478
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,425
There is no spider,
there is a spider's nest.

479
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,139
There are three, then I do not pee.

480
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,860
The problem is
I am trying to do something good with my life,

481
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,613
not depend on others, and others
not disappoint me.

482
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,159
Sometimes you're a little anal
, ie, we can have fun.

483
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,371
But you understand that the fun has no place
...

484
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,417
in my career. I'm under a lot of pressure.

485
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,336
My mother has two doctorates,
my father in chemistry.

486
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,300
They are very intelligent people.

487
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,523
It is very frustrating when I'm
trying to do the same...

488
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:55,722
but I stopped a guy...

489
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,558
he wants to leave the forest alone for a while.

490
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,234
Shit.

491
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:23,872
My God.
Boys! Guys! Guys!

492
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,838
Is that Linda, what the hell is that?

493
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:43,186
- I think it's just a possum.
- We gotta get out of here.

494
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,022
True. We have to go back to camp...

495
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,985
Do not leave here, the
forest, middle of nowhere...

496
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,042
all must come with me.

497
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:54,572
Wait, we can not let Josh
here.

498
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,576
Fuck, I'll walk.

499
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,578
Fun.

500
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:04,581
You joined by four days of investigation.

501
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,794
Honestly, do you love me
suspend because I want to go first?

502
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,215
Someone did something terrible to Josh.

503
00:59:12,384 --> 00:59:14,010
See this.

504
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:22,933
All should come with me. It's crazy.

505
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,875
You joined for 4 days research
.

506
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:30,525
Do not you go, I need to
all the people who showed...

507
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,111
to help me in my thesis. This is my life.

508
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:37,825
When Josh returns, and
make, I'm going to tear,

509
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:39,093
But you do not go, dammit.

510
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,124
- Hey, Linda.
- What?

511
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:51,838
God, look, I talked to Trent
and agree...

512
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,090
to give you credit,
for what you've done...

513
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,634
and let you go.

514
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,637
I can take back to Cartwright
Downhill.

515
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,600
And there is a bus station,
where I think you can get...

516
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,185
the 11:30 to town.

517
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,104
Do not have to do that.

518
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,276
Linda, you're scared,
nobody will blame you if you go.

519
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,696
I know I will not.

520
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,408
But I have drunk so much
I can take.

521
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,816
Do you want to go look for Cheryl?

522
01:00:27,817 --> 01:00:31,000
No, I do not know.

523
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,879
No, I do not know.

524
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,006
No, I do not know what's going on.

525
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,850
I dunno.

526
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:42,259
Gotta get out of here.

527
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,350
- I have to go.
- Well.

528
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,143
- OK?
- Well.

529
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,564
Let's get your things, good.

530
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,207
- Take care.
- I will.

531
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,430
Where is Cheryl?

532
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,265
Are you going to miss Trent
when you go to Chicago?

533
01:02:11,154 --> 01:02:12,233
Yes

534
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,816
Me too.

535
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,073
Do you want me to wait while
buy the ticket?

536
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:29,245
I'm not fine, I'm a big girl,
despite my recent actions.

537
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:38,170
Seriously, do not be ashamed, either.
Were you scared, is not that great.

538
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:45,551
Afraid?
You did not see Cheryl in the store that night.

539
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,806
Did you see that skull?

540
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:53,061
Seriously, there is something horrible
is happening out there.

541
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,427
The girls are pretty scared, right?

542
01:03:25,118 --> 01:03:26,090
Yes.

543
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:31,349
Sorry you had to see that.

544
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,186
Shit.

545
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:47,031
This is pretty fucked up.

546
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,791
Sorry.

547
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:01,879
You know, you can go to bed,
I'll just wait for Randy.

548
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,841
You sure?

549
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,879
Yes. Thank you.

550
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,500
- See you in a few days.
- Yes.

551
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,130
- Let me help you with your team.
- No, it's okay, I have it.

552
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,723
Well, I've been really awful
you.

553
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,977
The last days or since I met you.

554
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:06,944
I'm so sorry. Thank you for supporting me
tonight.

555
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,490
- Really appreciate it.
- For nothing.

556
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,247
Well, again, it seems that
will rain. Take care, Randy.

557
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,833
Yes, beware.

558
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:50,655
- Hi.
- Cheryl, what do you do?

559
01:05:56,202 --> 01:06:00,927
I do not want to be alone, not after...

560
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:03,290
Yeah, well, I understand.

561
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:25,770
- Do not think I...
- No, no. Josh is fine.

562
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,779
I find in the morning.

563
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,538
Got to be kidding, shit.

564
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:34,133
Shit, by God, I see nothing.

565
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,289
What the fuck is that?

566
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,666
God. Shit, shit, shit.

567
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,471
Well, what was that?

568
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,195
Not let him do it.

569
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:43,452
I know what it hides.
Do not let them do it!

570
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,939
Randy
'm just worried about you.

571
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,903
You should be back.

572
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:23,199
Looks like a storm is coming, hurry up please
. Bye Bye.

573
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:41,093
- Come there's Josh.
- Damn, I'm going to kill you.

574
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,852
Josh! Seriously stop playing.

575
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,146
Cheryl.

576
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:30,558
Yeah Well..

577
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:02,020
Cheryl, this is a bit unexpected
but good.

578
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,368
Yes.

579
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,469
Ash.

580
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,416
Run.

581
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,261
Trent!

582
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:00,027
Do I...?

583
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:12,372
Do you understand now?

584
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:21,089
