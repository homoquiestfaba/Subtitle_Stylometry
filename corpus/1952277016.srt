00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,600
He's a smart man.

178
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Not to mention...

179
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
Well, what can we say about Celeste?

180
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,720
From the very first time we met her,

181
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
we knew.

182
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,320
We could all...

183
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,880
just tell that she fit--

184
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,880
that she belonged in this--

185
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
with us-- all of us.

186
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,360
And...

187
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,680
What I'm trying to say is

189
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,800
how happy we are to have her...

190
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,680
as our new daughter.

191
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000

Hi.

195
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,880
Hi, Julia. How are you?

196
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

197
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,040
- You remember Amanda?
- Of course. Hi.

- And, uh, her son Dean.
- Hey.

200
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,840
Hey.

201
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,800
So, did you find a place to Iive yet?

202
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,360
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Ah.

203
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,080
I'm all settled.
Uh, six weeks now.

204
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm renting, but it's-- it's cozy.

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
Good.

206
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,920
I was up in Toronto,

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,960
but my firm said
they needed me down here.

208
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes, I know. Doug told me you--

209
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,160
How have you found New York?

210
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,360
Uh, now, you'd met Dave
and Sarah before, right?

211
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,400
- No. This is the first time, actually.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

212
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,960
And they're terrific.
It was perfect.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,480
Congratulations, Julia,
about Chris and Celeste.

214
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,320
If you're half as excited as Doug is...

215
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
Oh, I am. I am.

216
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,280
Well...

217
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Thank you.

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,200
Yeah.

220
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,040
Yeah, that's right.

Oh, I-I-I was late. Sorry.

224
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,280
Did you get a chance to say hello
to Celeste's parents?

225
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
They seem terrific.

226
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,440
- How about Celeste?
- [ sighs ]

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,400
Mom, can you go back inside
and say hi to Celeste?

228
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Iet her introduce you to her parents.

229
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,240
I’ll write them a nice note.

230
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,720
- Mom...

At least say you're happy for us.

233
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,160
I am happy for you.

234
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,560
Can I go home now?
[ breathing heavily ]

235
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Hi.

236
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,160
Problem?

237
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,600
Yeah. The... hinge

238
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,800
is sitting too deep.

239
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh. Okay.

240
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,600
I gotta go to the shop over the weekend
and cut some shims,

241
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,400
which means that I can't put
the chandelier up till next weekend.

242
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,820
Honey...

243
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,320
She came.

244
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,080
She wasn't the Iife of the party,
but she showed up.

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,240
Yeah, she made an appearance.

246
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,160
She just moved back
to the city, you know.

247
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,280
Just give her some time.

248
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
She's gonna...

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
Whoo! Oh!

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,760
- What?
- Can you feel this?

251
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Come on, baby.
Do it again. Do it again!

[ Man ]
You knew what you did.

255
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
The fuck I did.
What kind of thing is that to say?

256
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
- What is the matter with you?
- Keep your voice down, for Christ's sake.

257

The bottom Iine--
this is just not my problem.

Well, whose problem is it?

259
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,160
Well, I guess it's yours, isn't it?

260
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,560
What am I supposed to do now?

261
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, for Christ's sake, stop crying.

262
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,320
I can't believe you're being such a prick--
that you can just sit there--

263
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,800
Fine.

Are you gonna pay
for those glasses?

- They're mine. I wore them in.
- No, you didn't.

Do you want me
to call the police?

I've had these glasses for years.

You took 'em right off the rack.

You think I don't know
my own merchandise?

These glasses
belonged to my mother.

right before she died

A Iittle noise is a good thing.

It means that we're
actually doing some work.

Now, every day, either Leo or l
are gonna be here on the site.

- I just wanted to tell you that--
- Do you understand?

Whatever you have
to say to me, I don't care.

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
There was this guy.

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,960
I met him in Michigan.
That's where I'm from.

Actually, it's more Iike--

345
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,480
it's more Iike,
when I come to New York.

346
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,240
Like he expects me to come.

Like it's a done deal.

348
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,560
And when I do, you know--
