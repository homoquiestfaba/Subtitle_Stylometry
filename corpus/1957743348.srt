1
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,031
Please.

2
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,148
Help me.

3
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,665
Someone wanted to say morning
to his daddy.

4
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,542
He wouldn't take no
for an answer.

5
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,960
He's just like his mother then.

6
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,378
Ah.

7
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,008
Another bad dream?

8
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,554
Yeah.

9
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,507
In this one I proposed,
but you turned me down flat.

10
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,601
Oh wow.

11
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,477
Talk about a nightmare.

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,439
You've been having a lot
of bad dreams, H?

13
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,821
And now I've woken up.

14
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,025
It's time to celebrate.

15
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,747
In England we do it in March,
but you're a Yank so...

16
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,753
Happy American Mother's Day.

17
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,091
Pula, did you have something
to do with this?

18
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,592
It was Guy.

19
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,877
He helped me set it up last
night after you went to bed.

20
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,051
Over here, it's customary to
give your wife an eternity ring

21
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,438
when she's given you a child.

22
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,941
Didn't you already get married?

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,068
Happy Mother's Day.

24
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,653
Thank you.

25
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,398
Oh, best gift ever.

26
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,076
Doria: Hello.

27
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,070
Oh, a little jazz.

28
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,247
Archie loves jazz.

29
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,814
- That's what I've been told.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,415
Happiness starts...

31
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,583
Love you.

32
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,710
Thank you.

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,969
Just put one on and
your troubles will be gone

34
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,096
Because happiness starts
with a smile

35
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,515
This is American music, yes.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,183
Pardon me, Your Highness.

37
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,093
When you're sad

38
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,439
Sir Briggs.
Here on a Sunday?

39
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,858
What's wrong?

40
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,111
I am so sorry, Your Highness.

41
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,834
When will it stop?

42
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,962
The journalist who tweeted this

43
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,840
has been fired
from the BBC but...

44
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,426
Buckingham Palace won't respond.

45
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,844
If Buckingham Palace
won't do it,

46
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,805
I want a joint statement
from Kensington Palace.

47
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,684
Prince William and Prince Harry
stand united against racism.

48
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,769
Your brother's people
have already said

49
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,690
that this is nonsense
and should just be ignored.

50
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,943
Again, I mean, they, they seem
to think it'll just go away.

51
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,361
A direct shot at our son.

52
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,738
It's hate speech.

53
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,532
This just proves what
we've been saying all along.

54
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,826
Archie's going
to need protection

55
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,654
like my father's
other grandchildren.

56
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,331
More, thanks to the vitriol

57
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,833
they continue to allow
the press to spew.

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,128
The palace would prefer you
to remain neutral,

59
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,380
as is tradition.

60
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,014
I thought it was tradition
to support your family

61
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,971
when they're under attack.

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,328
People are starting to notice
that things

63
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,936
between you and your brother
have gone awry.

64
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:51,730
Reporters: Prince William.

65
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,148
Have you met your nephew yet?

66
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,358
Have you seen Archie?

67
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,921
Well uh, we look forward
to seeing them

68
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,278
when things have,
um, quieted down.

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,426
If you go and visit
the new baby,

70
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,242
the public will be reassured.

71
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,245
I can't believe
they named him Archie.

72
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,413
It's not a royal name.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,369
I just don't know what to say
to him anymore.

74
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,538
Your future subjects
see themselves

75
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,590
as an extension of your family.

76
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,926
If you can't smooth things over
with Harry soon,

77
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,378
rumors of your feud
will only increase

78
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,547
and the nation
will feel unstable.

79
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,184
As future king,
I cannot allow this.

80
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,144
Fine.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,438
But I'm not bringing
Prince George and the children.

82
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,391
Very well. Just you and
the Duchess of Cambridge.

83
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,818
I'll inform the press.

84
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,905
Sir.

85
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,635
It's either go and pay respects
to your brother's brood

86
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,369
or banish them to Australia.

87
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,071
If wishes were horses,
beggars would ride.

88
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,907
Meggie Megawatt was such
a star on that Aus tour.

89
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,145
She might actually like
to go and live

90
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,586
on the other side
of the world now.

91
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,079
Enough.

92
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,026
There's enough enmity
going around already, Victoria.

93
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,883
Please don't fuel it.

94
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,470
Sir.

95
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,593
My goodness.
He's darling.

96
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,978
What a jolly little fellow.

97
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,438
He's so lovely, Meghan.

98
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,149
Thank you both for the gifts
and for coming all this way.

99
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,026
Of course, it's no bother.

100
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,278
We were planning a Windsor
visit anyway.

101
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,946
Where are the kids?

102
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,713
Didn't they want to meet
their new cousin?

103
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,450
- They've all got a cold.
- Tennis lessons.

104
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,204
Meg, I would love to see
the nursery.

105
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,789
Sure.

106
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,386
Fresh air?

107
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,185
Getting much sleep?

108
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,728
No.

109
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,317
I can't believe you're keeping
the kids away from us.

110
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,144
I told you, tennis lessons.

111
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,906
The future king must have
a good backhand.

112
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,324
Nice one.

113
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,950
Advantage.

114
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,821
Look...

115
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,875
I know we've been having
some healthy disagreements,

116
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,271
but we've got to at least
come together

117
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,545
to address racism in the press.

118
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,297
It's out of control.

119
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,667
Three times I've publicly asked
the British press to back off.

120
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,552
Once as a boyfriend,
once as a husband,

121
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,838
now as a father, to no avail.

122
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,785
Seventy-two members of
parliament signed a letter

123
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,850
saying Meg faced unfair attacks

124
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,345
with outdated
colonial undertones.

125
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,732
You need to bloody well
make a statement with me

126
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,943
decrying racism.

127
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,111
Publicly.

128
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,029
As future king,

129
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,024
push back on this
horrific bullying.

130
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,743
Bullying.

131
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,829
Such a powerful word.

132
00:06:54,998 --> 00:07:00,419
They are painting me as
a villain in the press,

133
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,464
and no one in the palace
seems to want to come out

134
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,256
and stop that.

135
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:09,761
Why not let me come out
and defend myself?

136
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,264
I understand your frustration.

137
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,226
There are lies and rumors
about me too.

138
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,105
But you know, this is the life
we signed up for.

139
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,876
I mean, if I took the time
to refute every little...

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,559
I feel silenced.

141
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,611
I know.

142
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,364
As an American,
you value freedom

143
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,067
and individualism
above all else.

144
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:36,246
And well, here we value dignity
above all else.

145
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,083
But isn't it dignified for me
to defend myself?

146
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,295
Well...

147
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,428
Harry: Think about someone
outside yourself for once.

148
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,087
This is bullying
and you know it.

149
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,891
They have so much to work out.

150
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,727
They have centuries
on their shoulders.

151
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,813
Don't we all?

152
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,766
Oh my god, for the last time,

153
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,277
I agree that diversity in
the family is a good thing.

154
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,446
Because it makes you look good.

155
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,593
But behind closed doors I
have to listen to concerns

156
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,575
about how dark
our babies might be?

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,368
They weren't expressing
concerns,

158
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,611
they were just curious.

159
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,788
Open your eyes.

160
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,196
Dad's even saying
when he's king,

161
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,583
he'll decree that only your kids

162
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,543
will have the titles of prince
or princess.

163
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,671
I thought you didn't want
your children raised that way.

164
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,798
If my kids have the titles
of prince or princess,

165
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,760
they get a much higher level
of police protection.

166
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,179
That is what I care about.

167
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,057
The racist death threats
are too much.

168
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,392
What causes problems
isn't color.

169
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,810
It's culture.

170
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,303
Meghan's American.

171
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,147
She acts more like a celebrity
than a royal,

172
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,127
and she doesn't seem to
appreciate the difference.

173
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,421
What she doesn't appreciate is
how the firm is perfectly happy

174
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,695
to lie to protect other members
of our family,

175
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,815
but everyone is suddenly silent
when the press attacks her.

176
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,492
I can't have this conversation
any more.

177
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,412
No, no, no. Someone on your staff
hates Meghan for no good reason.

178
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,668
H has been having a lot
of nightmares recently.

179
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,828
He won't say what about.

180
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,066
Well, isn't he feeling
a bit better

181
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,423
being out at Kensington Palace?

182
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,759
It's so lovely being out
in the countryside.

183
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,766
I really want to make
this work Catherine,

184
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:25,513
but you know how they say,
fish out of water.

185
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,650
Flapping and gasping here.

186
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,072
You know, Trooping the Color
is coming up.

187
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:39,193
Well we could um, we could ride
to the Trooping Parade together.

188
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,329
In an open-top carriage
so everyone can see.

189
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,165
That would be wonderful.

190
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,085
Yes, and if I wore the hat
I wore to your wedding,

191
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,371
Wills, he won't notice
but some clever journalists

192
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,632
will realize it's a sign
of fondness.

193
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,093
I never knew how eloquent
a hat could be.

194
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,139
Oh, we should coordinate
color palettes as well.

195
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,724
Whatever I wear,

196
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:05,729
the press will tear me apart
for this baby weight.

197
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,951
Reporter: It's a tradition that
goes back to 1748.

198
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,288
On this highly patriotic day,

199
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,075
a crucial ceremonial event
in British royal tradition

200
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,588
Everything is meticulously
planned

201
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,590
and designed to show
the strength of

202
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,800
Her Majesty's military power.

203
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,927
Soldier: March!

204
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,767
Reporter: Today, all eyes are on
Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex,

205
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:48,021
as this is her first official
royal outing in months.

206
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,026
In fact, some have accused her
of using her pregnancy

207
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,270
and maternity leave to hide
from negative press.

208
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,491
But today is a day
where no one can hide.

209
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,175
Are you all right?

210
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,389
Woman: Well look who's arrived?

211
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,640
Is that the woman

212
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,226
who wore the racist brooch
to Christmas brunch?

213
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,437
I'll see you later.

214
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:32,774
Father.

215
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,692
What?

216
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,977
She'll be on the balcony today?

217
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,780
Yes, well yes.

218
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,325
Of course felt the brooch,
a terrible faux pas...

219
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,953
but what can I do?

220
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,654
She's a cousin.

221
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,658
And Mother goes big
on forgiveness, I'm sorry.

222
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,838
I will try forgiveness too.

223
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,757
Thank you, my dear.

224
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:58,925
Ah, of course.

225
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
Andrew.

226
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,178
What's he up to now, eh?

227
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,688
All we have to do is go out
on the balcony,

228
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,074
wave for 10 minutes,
then go home,

229
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,527
throw on some jeans
and snuggle Archie.

230
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,288
I know.

231
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,915
I get it.

232
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,035
But I wish my boobs
would stop leaking.

233
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,880
Did you bring
the hand pump thing?

234
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,047
Yes.

235
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,175
I'll go find a ladies room.

236
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,641
Vickie, my dear.

237
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,478
Looking very stylish today.

238
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,687
Oh.

239
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,316
You know I've always had
a soft spot for trooping.

240
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,558
It's so patriotic.

241
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,153
Yes, indeed.

242
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:05,233
Marvelous opportunity to display
harmony betwixt our two houses.

243
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,870
You sure you won't have William
stand beside Harry?

244
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,573
Hmm, yes.
Quite sure.

245
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,961
Victoria, you know as well as I
that the whole of Britain

246
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,580
will be well aware that their
princes are at war

247
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,467
if they stand on opposing sides
of the balcony.

248
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,085
Precisely.

249
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,179
We played very nice
for the pretty wedding,

250
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,807
waved a flag, and now it is time
for William to show

251
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,310
that he, as the future king,
is not chumming with Me-ghan,

252
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,020
and Hazza the Duke of Hazards.

253
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,815
Good gracious.

254
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,442
You know, I wish I'd been taping
that for the Daily Mail article

255
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,936
I'm poised to leak.

256
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,947
Oh, they wouldn't publish it,
darling.

257
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,449
You know they only want snippets
from moi.

258
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:50,620
Speaking of, Meg's had a rather
wobbly bottom lip lately.

259
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,288
And that skin of hers.

260
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,284
Oh, it is so thin.

261
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,564
You know when she first arrived,
we called her Tungsten,

262
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,296
as strong as steel.

263
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,882
But now I am not so sure.

264
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,300
Hmm.

265
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,961
Perhaps those rumors of
postpartum depression are true.

266
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,346
Oh dear.

267
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,017
You know, I wasn't aware
the level of the bar

268
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,187
could be set quite so low.

269
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,772
Hmm.

270
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,653
Oh, Meghan darling.
So good to see you.

271
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,582
All things considered,
you look radiant.

272
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,334
Lovely to see you too,
Lady Twysden-Smythe.

273
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,586
Lady Hunt.

274
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,088
I didn't stop thinking about you
for a minute.

275
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,442
When the press published
that letter

276
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,999
you wrote to your father

277
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,886
Good lord. I thought my family
dramas were scandalous.

278
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,849
Is it true that they had
an attractive blonde journo

279
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,510
drive to Mexico to flirt it
out of him?

280
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,063
I'd be utterly mortified
if I'd written something

281
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,816
so personal and
it became public.

282
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,776
You poor dear.

283
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,448
Oh, Your Highness.

284
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,534
You look tired.

285
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,286
Life of a new father.

286
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,246
Life of a weak husband
more like.

287
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,789
Excuse me?

288
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,700
Our country's dealt with this
scenario before you know.

289
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,377
With Diana and your father.

290
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,871
A weak-minded prince
gets outflanked

291
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,215
by an attention seeking woman

292
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,217
who disrespects centuries
of tradition

293
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,054
and jeopardizes
the entire monarchy.

294
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:35,350
Those who do not learn from
history are doomed to repeat it.

295
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,851
Your Highness.

296
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,270
Markle, debacle. God.

297
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,397
What's wrong?
Everything okay?

298
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,528
I just need you to follow
protocol 100 percent today.

299
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,281
Okay. Does that really need
to be said?

300
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,449
Well the last time...

301
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,785
You mean the time I opened
my own car door?

302
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,904
Or the time I didn't want to
wear old white lady pantyhose?

303
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,458
Just please remember the order
of precedence.

304
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:05,413
I promise I won't ever stand
in front of your grandmother,

305
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,882
your father, his wife,
your brother

306
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,343
or Queen Catherine
of England in Waiting.

307
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,553
And always keep in mind
the press uses zoom lenses

308
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,640
and lip readers to scrutinize
every single move...

309
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm not an idiot.

310
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,895
But if I seem too stiff and
serious they'll say I'm unhappy

311
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,814
or being a new mother
is too much for me,

312
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,108
or there's trouble in paradise.

313
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,237
So I'd better smile
and smile and smile.

314
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,613
Yes.

315
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,949
Please.

316
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,327
Just be a royal robot today.

317
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,249
What about for the rest
of my life?

318
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,273
Reporter: So the Queen
has returned home.

319
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,955
Back at Buckingham Palace,

320
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,590
enjoying the proceedings already

321
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,968
watched by many on the balcony.

322
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,053
And it's a good moment.

323
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,227
Not now.

324
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,984
Turn around!

325
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,778
Turn around now!

326
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,152
Harry: Darling.

327
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,447
Darling.

328
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,366
Darling.

329
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,245
I said you look gorgeous.

330
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,038
Are you ready to go?

331
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,793
Are you all right?

332
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,712
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.

333
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,364
You don't have to come to
the Royal Albert Hall tonight.

334
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,555
I do. I do.

335
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,759
No sweetheart, you don't.
You need a break.

336
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:09,272
You don't understand.

337
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,934
If I'm left alone right now
I don't know what I might do.

338
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,629
I'm so sorry I snapped at you
on the balcony today.

339
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,958
I know that everything you do
is to protect me.

340
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,803
I almost turned my back
on the Queen.

341
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,182
You were turning around to talk
to your husband.

342
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,184
I can just see
the headlines now.

343
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,980
Brown American divorcee disses
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

344
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,525
as the national anthem plays.

345
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,486
At least you knew the words
this time.

346
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,829
I can't lose you.

347
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,582
I can't lose you.

348
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,134
Can we make a vow?

349
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,350
Never to let the outside world
spoil this.

350
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,893
I'd love to promise that,

351
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,681
but the British press will never
stop coming for you.

352
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,691
For Arch.

353
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,027
And sometimes I feel
so powerless.

354
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,780
You can't control everything,
Harry.

355
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:49,163
That's what the nightmares
are about.

356
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:55,711
I see you literally
being hounded to death.

357
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,880
And I'm helpless to stop it.

358
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,094
I can't bear to think my son
will grow up

359
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,388
stalked by paparazzi,

360
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,056
and I don't want this little boy

361
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,185
seeing his mother crying
every single day.

362
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:19,402
Well, unlike your mom,
I am not alone in this.

363
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,200
Your mom was barely even 20 when
she was pregnant with William.

364
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,953
I'm almost 40.

365
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,239
I know myself

366
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,543
and I have tools now to help me
manage it all.

367
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,877
Right?

368
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,713
Right.

369
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,143
Want to see what I'm working on
with Vogue?

370
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,438
A mirror.

371
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,647
Yes.

372
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,266
I'm putting a mirror
on the front cover, see?

373
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,778
So the reader gets
to see themselves

374
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,366
amongst these powerhouse women.

375
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,246
And also be on the cover
of Vogue, right?

376
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,960
All these women are going
to bend the arc of history.

377
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,463
Just like you.

378
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,442
Flower?

379
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,985
Hey Mom.

380
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,646
I know what you're doing.

381
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,031
What?

382
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,201
Okay. Let's go out for lunch
or a coffee.

383
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,327
Just give you a break.

384
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,912
You're burying yourself in work.

385
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,333
That'd be great, but they took
my wallet and my keys,

386
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,876
and I don't even have
my passport.

387
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,213
How am I supposed
to pop out somewhere?

388
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,840
You can ask them to send a car.

389
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:10,012
"Them" say I shouldn't be out in
public because I am overexposed.

390
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,431
If I go somewhere,
it's a national event.

391
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,007
All eyes on me.

392
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:18,270
Which is apparently the only
thing I care about.

393
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,647
It's been weeks.

394
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,516
You haven't been anywhere.

395
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,693
Yeah.

396
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,687
People still find ways
to make news out of me

397
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,073
even when I don't go anywhere.

398
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,243
Stay the f?á?
Out of my trailer

399
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,161
or I'll cut you, Kate!

400
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,790
Wow! How imaginative.

401
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm an angry black woman.

402
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,211
We need to redouble our efforts
to combat

403
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,589
small-minded inaccurate
portrayals such as this.

404
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,592
However, adding fuel
to the fire,

405
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,388
details have been leaked about
you editing British Vogue.

406
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,931
How was there a leak?

407
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,100
The editor hasn't even told
his own staff.

408
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,977
I don't know where the leaks
come from,

409
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,782
but the press are turning out
opinion pieces

410
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,315
spinning this move as typically
showy-offy.

411
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,235
But I purposefully decided
not to be on the cover.

412
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,904
Doesn't that make me
the opposite of a show-off?

413
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,450
In addition, unfortunately
details have also been leaked

414
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:16,370
about the cost of
Frogmore's renovation.

415
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,738
Three million.

416
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,601
Will and Kate's Kensington
Palace apartments cost

417
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,743
five million pounds of taxpayer
money to renovate.

418
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:23,502
Indeed.

419
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,295
But William...

420
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,246
Will be king.

421
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,552
So he's the king of the castle,
and I'm the dirty rascal.

422
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,597
Well, I wouldn't say
that the dirty rascal

423
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,758
is an unimportant player, sir.

424
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,605
In fact, this archetype is
crucial to the royal story.

425
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:46,609
When you were boys,
William was, was no saint,

426
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,277
and yet what did we hear about?

427
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,862
Harry's drug shame.

428
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,405
William was never mentioned.

429
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,616
When the Rota found out,
they protected Wills

430
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,952
and praised Dad as
a concerned father.

431
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,446
Indeed. The real job of
the Royal Rota,

432
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
the press board that covers
the monarchy,

433
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,335
is to create a narrative
which protects royals

434
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,670
in strict order of succession.

435
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,006
We must find a way around this.

436
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,468
Social media would mean
we avoid the Rota entirely.

437
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,845
We cannot just get rid
of the Royal Rota

438
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,555
just by wishing it so.

439
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:20,559
The old boys' network
is extremely powerful.

440
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,688
Maybe I need to strengthen
the new girls' network.

441
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,196
Hello?

442
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,489
Is everything all right?

443
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:34,760
Of course, everything is fine.

444
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,618
I was just calling to say hi.

445
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,486
That's very nice.

446
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,321
Happy birthday to you
by the way.

447
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,792
Thank you so much,
and thank you for posting

448
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,586
the lovely picture of us
on your social media.

449
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,107
Meghan: I'm sad we don't
have anything more recent

450
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,714
looking happy as a family.

451
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,217
Oh I know, I guess it's just
difficult these days

452
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,427
with the children
and everything.

453
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,597
Not to mention these leaks
that keep coming.

454
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,433
Goodness, I know.
How unfortunate.

455
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,511
The Royal Rota do seem to have

456
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:09,483
a lot of very specific
information, right?

457
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,402
Meghan: Where do they get
their intel?

458
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,020
Do you know?

459
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,858
I'm um, I'm not entirely sure I
know what you're trying to say.

460
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,359
Um, nothing.

461
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,697
I just... someone clearly
has an axe to grind

462
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,916
and I'm not sure why.

463
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,085
Is it because I use too many
emojis when I text?

464
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,754
I've heard that ruffled
some feathers.

465
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,549
Well that was considered
a cultural faux pas,

466
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,343
but not insurmountable.

467
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:41,765
However, you do outright declare
your intention to force change,

468
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,560
and you do so in bright
yellow neon.

469
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,164
Kate: You're a highly
intelligent woman Meg.

470
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,022
How could you not see
that this Vogue cover

471
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,107
was very provocative?

472
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,897
I mean, there's even a poem
in there with the F word.

473
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,227
It's hardly a smiley-faced
emoji.

474
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,738
Uh, I was...

475
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:59,399
And it is full of political
dog whistles, op-eds.

476
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:03,737
You know that royals are to
remain neutral on politics.

477
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,123
Don't rock the boat,
keep things calm and steady.

478
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,791
It is literally our job.

479
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,855
And, you know, it's not like
Wills and I don't want changes.

480
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,087
Of course we do.

481
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,423
But it has taken us a decade
to build up the goodwill

482
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,385
and the, the proper channels
to make those changes.

483
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,972
You've hardly been here a year.

484
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,924
There's a part of me
that is in awe of you

485
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,601
for wanting to take on
the palace,

486
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:29,104
but then the other part
just shudders because

487
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,483
the palace always wins, Meg.

488
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,526
I promise you.

489
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,112
The palace always wins.

490
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:45,954
Uppity, Anti-White, Divisive.
Absolutely idiotic.

491
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:50,000
Meghan's Vogue shows her
to be a hypocrite.

492
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,670
This is the opposite of what
I was trying to do.

493
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,963
You've worked on this project
for months now,

494
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,676
so any criticism is going to be
hard to take.

495
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:02,429
I thought the goodness
would shine through.

496
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,475
They're saying I should've put
more white women on the cover.

497
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,311
Apparently I should've also put
more men on the cover as well,

498
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:13,065
if I wanted to be
"fair to everybody."

499
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,643
This problem is thousands
of years in the making

500
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,113
and you want it
to change overnight.

501
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,323
Just breathe.

502
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,033
You're right, mama.

503
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,368
Of course.

504
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,248
It's always cold here.

505
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,491
Not just the place, the people.

506
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,877
Feeling sorry for yourself
won't help, Flower.

507
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,963
But I miss my friends.

508
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:41,051
I miss the California sunshine,
and I miss my mom.

509
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:48,100
I'm so alone and I miss
being myself.

510
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,677
I don't belong anywhere anymore.

511
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:55,274
You belong wherever that baby
and your husband are.

512
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,900
They love you.

513
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,235
Thanks Mom.

514
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,864
I gotta go.
Talk to you later.

515
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,199
Bye.

516
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,371
Oh Archie.

517
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,332
Did I ever tell you what
your name means?

518
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:21,258
Brave, genuine, and bold.

519
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:24,178
And yes you will be.

520
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,096
You are.

521
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,140
I love you.

522
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,809
I love you too.

523
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,439
The Africa tour will be
good for us.

524
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,318
Can't come soon enough.

525
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,806
Africa is where I fell
truly in love with you.

526
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,145
Let's do it all over again.

527
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,416
Shall we move here?

528
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:23,297
The firm would be happy
to have us out of England.

529
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,384
Did you know that
being your husband...

530
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,428
And my hero?

531
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,852
Makes me truly happy?

532
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,206
This is all going extremely well
you know.

533
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:01,335
The public are absolutely
delirious with joy

534
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,840
at Archie's first official
public engagement.

535
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,635
Arch meet Archie.

536
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,011
Perfect.

537
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,212
Great work Archie.

538
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,555
Yeah.

539
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,351
Um, unfortunately there are
however still rumblings

540
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:22,356
about this historic event
being held on foreign soil

541
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,941
with a non-Brit.

542
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,692
They mean non-white.

543
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:30,989
Well I suggest we dismiss this
with the disdain it deserves.

544
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,617
All right. Very busy week ahead,

545
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,162
so I want to see you all
getting some rest, yes?

546
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:47,798
"These photos are for you and your brother,
love and joy from Archbishop Tutu."

547
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,844
He wants you to work things out.

548
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,554
Working things out with Will
right now

549
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,265
feels more impossible than ever.

550
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,312
I know Mum would hate to see us
fighting, but...

551
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,818
she'd understand where you
and I are coming from

552
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,112
more than anyone else
in the world.

553
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,623
Reporter: Today during
his African tour,

554
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,793
Prince Harry walked in his
late mother's footsteps,

555
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,880
commemorating Princess Diana's
historic visit in 1997

556
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,508
which launched her campaign
to rid the community

557
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,929
of landmines 22 years ago.

558
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,445
Ma'am, why do you have to be
so political?

559
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,739
What do you hope to achieve
with this stunt?

560
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,241
You know, I'm just trying to do
good in the world.

561
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,076
What is wrong with that?

562
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:04,082
It's been an honor to retrace
my mother's steps today.

563
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,544
I lost her 22 years ago,

564
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:13,216
but her memory is with me daily
and her legacy lives on.

565
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,676
Thank you.

566
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,137
Harry, how is your relationship
with William these days?

567
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,431
Have you spoken with him
since you've been in Africa?

568
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,224
I said no more questions.

569
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,121
Do you have any plans to move
away from the UK?

570
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,728
Perhaps to Africa as has
been rumored,

571
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,979
banishing the Sussexes.

572
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,606
I said no more.

573
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,444
Reporter: Are you or are you
not going to stay in London?

574
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,779
Is the Queen banishing you?

575
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,864
Go.

576
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,533
Harry: Faster.

577
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,327
Faster!

578
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,797
Here, we give
self-defense classes

579
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:55,759
and female empowerment training
to young women

580
00:34:55,844 --> 00:35:00,097
because we are in an area that has the
highest murder rate in South Africa.

581
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,107
Thank you.

582
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you.

583
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,991
The rights of women and girls

584
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,661
is something very close
to my heart.

585
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,956
I know that when women
are empowered,

586
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,876
the entire community flourishes.

587
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,630
And on one personal note,

588
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,300
may I just say that while
I am here with my husband

589
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:40,137
as a member of the royal family,

590
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:46,092
I want you to know that for me,
I am here as a mother,

591
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:51,648
as a wife, as a woman,
as a woman of color,

592
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,317
and as your sister.

593
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:57,863
I am here with you
and I am here for you.

594
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,122
You're a superstar.

595
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,791
There's no one else
who can turn a tree stump

596
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:15,046
into the most powerful podium
in the world.

597
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:20,010
I didn't feel like a superstar.

598
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,638
I felt afraid.

599
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:29,769
Today was the first time
that I said I'm a woman of color

600
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:35,108
out loud and in public
since we got married.

601
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:39,154
And I was scared.

602
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,780
I shouldn't be scared,

603
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:46,536
I shouldn't have to hesitate to
say that I'm a woman of color.

604
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,165
I couldn't even speak my truth
without all these caveats.

605
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:55,170
Speaking on one purely personal
note, not as a royal.

606
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:06,765
I've been circling this idea
for weeks.

607
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,893
But I didn't know if I could
actually say it.

608
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,444
We have to leave the firm.

609
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,820
What?

610
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,491
No. We have to make this work.

611
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,660
We've tried to make it work.

612
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,953
Haven't we tried?

613
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:31,790
No. I can't ask you to leave
your family behind.

614
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,353
I wouldn't be leaving
behind my family.

615
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,542
I'd be leaving the firm.

616
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,128
But the monarchy is a family.

617
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,172
So is the mafia.

618
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,799
I'll always be my brother's
brother.

619
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,593
I'll always be my father's son.

620
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,471
But I never asked for the job
of being a royal,

621
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,265
and this isn't who I am.

622
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,601
It's like this toxic cycle.

623
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:56,398
The same story of my family
being told again and again.

624
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:00,026
I need to break the cycle,

625
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,737
and we've got to start telling
our own story.

626
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,450
How do we do it?

627
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,236
They're suing the press?

628
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,998
Wait, what, what, what don't
they understand about

629
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:17,002
the way the Rota works with
the firm and for the monarchy?

630
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,130
I will do my best to make it clear
to our friends in the Royal Rota

631
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,589
that the Sussex House

632
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,342
are not acting on behalf
of the palace as a whole.

633
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,595
What does the statement
from Harry say?

634
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:30,598
As a couple, we believe
in media freedom

635
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,101
and objective,
truthful reporting.

636
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,595
We regard it as a cornerstone
of democracy.

637
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,431
We have never needed responsible
media more.

638
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,775
Unfortunately, my wife
has become

639
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,937
one of the latest victims
of a British tabloid press.

640
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,574
Victim, victim, victim,
poor little me.

641
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,109
It's, it's, it's like he's back
in the army

642
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,579
and she's Major Meghan.

643
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,206
What are, what are they going
to do next?

644
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,086
Harry: Tom's not
in the royal pocket.

645
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:04,424
He gets it and he's
a real gentlemen.

646
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,301
We're going to be honest,

647
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,013
we're going to speak
for ourselves, directly.

648
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,894
Perhaps you can just
give us an idea

649
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,781
of what the last year's
been like?

650
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:34,070
It's, um, hard.

651
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,414
I never thought this
would be easy,

652
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,076
but I thought it would be fair.

653
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,380
A lot of talk in the press
about rifts with your brother.

654
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,298
How much of that is true?

655
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:50,011
Part of this family being under
the pressure that it's under,

656
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,305
stuff happens.

657
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:58,311
But we're brothers and we'll
always be brothers.

658
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:02,432
We certainly are on different
paths at the moment.

659
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:06,277
Not many people have asked
if I'm okay.

660
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:13,776
But it's uh, a very real thing
to be going through

661
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,495
behind the scenes.

662
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,916
What we need to do now is focus
on being real,

663
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,785
and focus on being the people
that we are,

664
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,797
and standing up for what
we believe in.

665
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,633
I will not be bullied into,

666
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,764
into playing a game
that killed my mum.

667
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,978
The emotion.

668
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,479
It... it feels very real to me.

669
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,106
Of course it's real.

670
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,024
That's what makes it
so bloody powerful.

671
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,193
It's just like your mother's
interview for the BBC.

672
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:50,530
She was manipulated
into giving that interview.

673
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:55,326
But still, I, I can't believe
she said all that.

674
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,987
Goes and tells the world
about Camilla,

675
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,748
the infighting with Dad.

676
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,375
Even her affair with Hewitt.

677
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,160
I bloody trusted that man.

678
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,828
She had him take us riding,

679
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,108
showed us around
the guard stables,

680
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,216
and all the while he
and my mother were...

681
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,384
Yeah.

682
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,003
And how did I find out about it?

683
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,177
By watching it all on telly

684
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,007
along with the rest
of the world.

685
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,509
I was 13.

686
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,853
I know.

687
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,791
Do you know I think my heart
first went out to you

688
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,940
right then and there?

689
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,610
Long before we'd ever met.

690
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,863
Must've been so painful,
my darling.

691
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,074
My housemaster at Eton.

692
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,911
He set up his own study
as a private place for me

693
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,623
to watch it all on telly.

694
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,041
I cried my bloody eyes out.

695
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,459
I know.

696
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,127
I know you did.

697
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,591
Did you see "it?"

698
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,800
Yes.

699
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,363
My mother did revealing
interviews like this

700
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,212
when she was preparing to leave
the firm.

701
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:59,516
Well, a separation would be best
for everyone.

702
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,477
But it must be done right,
on palace terms.

703
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,854
They can't be allowed to
bugger off with all of the glory

704
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,064
and none of the burden.

705
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,440
While I'm left holding the bag.

706
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:09,317
No, not on my watch, sir.

707
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,569
Well, I have just been told

708
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,406
that the Sussex clan is taking
a hiatus.

709
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,899
Six weeks.

710
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,118
They claim they need
some time off.

711
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,119
Let me guess.

712
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,571
In Barbados.

713
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,239
Canada.

714
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,241
Well it's, it's Commonwealth
at least.

715
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,628
And I'm told they're starting
a new personal website

716
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,246
run for them privately.

717
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,424
They're calling it Sussex Royal.

718
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,842
Sounds like a hotel.

719
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,680
But it will be made entirely
outside palace purview.

720
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,267
They will control the brand.

721
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,394
This is precisely
why I suggested

722
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,937
that only your children

723
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,774
be given the titles of prince
and princess when I am king.

724
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,776
But you're not king.

725
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,279
So what do you suggest
I do in the meantime?

726
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:58,441
We shall use what I believe
is called "cancel culture."

727
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,743
We can't exactly cancel
the most woke bloke

728
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,787
and his feminist bride.

729
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,832
Well, the firm can cancel
their royalness

730
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,835
and prevent them from stealing
the brand.

731
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,044
Your Highnesses.

732
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,623
With permission, I'd like
to ask the firm

733
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:15,758
to eliminate all mention
of Harry and Meghan

734
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,469
from the Royal Foundation
website.

735
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:22,473
This would send a clear message
to them and to the world,

736
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:26,352
literally and figuratively
that the firm has cut them out.

737
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,687
And excuse me for being blunt,

738
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,480
but that should include
the royal purse.

739
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,690
Oh.

740
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:35,153
They have to know what is
at stake, William.

741
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,947
They can't have it both ways.

742
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:43,161
You leave the firm,
you leave the family.

743
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:04,006
My father is acting even more
aloof than usual.

744
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,351
Did you explain that we just
need some time off?

745
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,019
Of course.

746
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,021
I said we need a bit of
a breather,

747
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,349
time to take stock.

748
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,693
I also said we want to stop
taking taxpayer's money

749
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,278
and pay our own way

750
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:21,023
so the press stops feeling like
we owe a pound of flesh or 10.

751
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,743
What did he say to that?

752
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,952
That we shouldn't expect

753
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:28,706
to have our extravagant
lifestyle paid for.

754
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,875
When I explained our plans
to generate income,

755
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,379
he just clammed up.

756
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,131
Said he didn't want
to talk about it.

757
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,510
I can't imagine a British male
saying that.

758
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,351
Afternoon, Leonard.

759
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,769
What's going on in the palace?

760
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,479
We feel so far away.

761
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,066
Well, um, the Sussex
royal website maneuvering

762
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,226
pushed the firm over the edge.

763
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,613
They felt that you were going
to capitalize on the brand

764
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,866
without fully paying the price.

765
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,953
And the price is silence.

766
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,538
Leonard.

767
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,915
Is there anyone you can talk
to inside the machine?

768
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,419
Ask for a little compassion.

769
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,745
No!

770
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,079
Look, Vicky.

771
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,798
We have both known each
other for years,

772
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,133
and we are both aware

773
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,593
that this is a highly tricky
balancing act.

774
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,922
But please, Harry and Meghan
are not some symbolic boogeymen

775
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,090
for you to demonize.

776
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,308
They're human beings,

777
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,428
with a new baby, I might add.

778
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,431
They just need to step back
for a while, that is all.

779
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,442
While promoting the hell out
of Sussex Royal

780
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,360
and selling god knows what.

781
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,215
Look, Harry wouldn't be doing
anything unusual

782
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,947
by selling things
under the royal brand.

783
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:46,108
Have you visited Buckingham
Palace gift shop recently?

784
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,119
Prince Charles sells
organic soup,

785
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,370
the Queen sells gin,

786
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:53,282
her grandson Peter sells
milk on Chinese telly.

787
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,895
Yes, he's been scolded
for being tasteless.

788
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,627
He won't do it again.

789
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,629
Look, the point is, Victoria,

790
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,841
that no one owns
the world "royal".

791
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,136
Have you seen the port-a-potty
brand, Royal Flush?

792
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,513
Why can't Prince Harry use
the term Sussex Royals

793
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,019
to, to, to, to spread goodwill
and basic human decency?

794
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,230
Because unlike a lav,
Harry is actually royal.

795
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,974
And he needs to bloody
well start behaving like it.

796
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,778
Let's discuss what's really
going on here.

797
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,572
If this is some sort of
popularity contest

798
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,907
we shall win it.

799
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,554
The Sussexes are the most
celebrated royal figures

800
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:29,485
since Diana.

801
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,120
Check your metrics, Lenny.

802
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,039
The Cambridges are always
ahead on Insta.

803
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,874
Only by a sliver.

804
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,876
And all thanks to
the bots you hired.

805
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,669
I don't even understand
what bots are.

806
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:39,837
Well clearly you do.

807
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,715
But here's what I don't
understand.

808
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,092
Why are you fighting us so hard?

809
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,781
I mean your team should surely
be delighted

810
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:51,057
to get rid of the rainbow
chasing divas for a while.

811
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,975
You have a fundamental
misunderstanding

812
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,852
of our position.

813
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,013
We wanted the Sussexes to play
their roles appropriately,

814
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,482
not abandon them completely.

815
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,235
They are simply asking
for some time off.

816
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,780
Being royal is not a part-time
job in a coffee shop.

817
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,865
It is a lifetime commitment.

818
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,693
Duty and dignity above all else.

819
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,709
Prince Andrew did what?

820
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,212
Randy Andy.

821
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:26,175
Sorry, what was that you were
saying about duty and dignity?

822
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,805
They say Andrew did what?

823
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,267
With teenaged girls.

824
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,603
Certainly one in particular,
allegedly.

825
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:41,107
This caused a major backlash
in the press and the public.

826
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,317
There's a spare who really
did live up

827
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:47,730
to the dirty rascal racket.

828
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,283
I hear the FBI wants to talk
with him.

829
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,577
Ugh, now we really need
to step back.

830
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,078
As soon as possible.

831
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,739
Uh yes, except that the palace
has asked

832
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,742
that he step back
from his royal duties.

833
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,911
Okay, so?

834
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,255
Well they are extremely
concerned that Andrew's scandal

835
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,442
will appear to be the reason

836
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,258
you're wanting to leave
the firm.

837
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,968
It doesn't make us want to stay.

838
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:13,014
Thus, they are directly asking
that you do.

839
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,256
We have to stay in the firm

840
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,350
because my uncle's
a disgrace to it?

841
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,894
Indeed.

842
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,730
The palace says quite adamantly
that you are to put on hold

843
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:25,443
all your plans to step back
until further notice.

844
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,361
No.

845
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,607
As soon as 2020 rolls around,
we're leaving the palace.

846
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,492
Permanently.

847
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,703
Tell them.

848
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,705
That's only a month away.

849
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,040
Sir.

850
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:42,710
If I may, this is
to our advantage.

851
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:43,961
How?

852
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,797
A Sussex exit makes them
a perfect, outrageously

853
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:51,344
disrespectful distraction
from... other stories.

854
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,056
First Meghan disrespects the
Queen by refusing her invitation

855
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,599
to spend Christmas
with the family.

856
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,059
It's outrageous.

857
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,020
And now, now she's depriving
the monarch

858
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,148
of a chance to spend time
with that adorable Baby Archie.

859
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,817
Now isn't that,
it's disgraceful.

860
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:14,158
Then we feed positive stories
to The Rota about your brood

861
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,486
and some perfect
Christmassy photos.

862
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,373
Well they always release photos
of the children at Christmas, so.

863
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,825
Yes but, but this year
it will be different

864
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,211
and extremely special.

865
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,924
Have you told Prince George
that he will one day be king?

866
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,836
No, not yet.

867
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,172
It doesn't make for the easiest
of school years I can tell you.

868
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,016
You can't delay it forever.

869
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,061
Announce that George has been
told of his grand destiny,

870
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,648
and then release official
royal lineage photos.

871
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,192
A new photograph of the Queen
and her three heirs

872
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,695
in the Buckingham Palace
throne room.

873
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:54,865
Let it be known who
the real royals are, hmm?

874
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,830
Ooh

875
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:05,793
Merry Christmas baby

876
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,129
Ooh

877
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:13,259
Merry Christmas baby

878
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,094
Happy, merry, jolly!

879
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,140
I think we got it.

880
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,216
No filter needed.

881
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,386
Oh, amazing.

882
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,648
Now that's a family
Christmas photo.

883
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,942
H, come look.

884
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,193
H?

885
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:38,576
The heart of the Christmas story
lies with the birth of a child.

886
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,327
Hey babe.

887
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,163
Everything okay?

888
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,331
The Queen's annual
Christmas speech.

889
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,241
She doesn't even mention us.

890
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,252
There's no photo of us
on her desk.

891
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,245
No Archie.

892
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,131
It's unprecedented.

893
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,009
Everything in that frame
is intentional.

894
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,920
The palace is sending a message.

895
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,514
They're making out that
we're not part of this family.

896
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,600
I told them I wanted out
of the firm.

897
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,226
The machine.

898
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:07,438
Not to be pushed out in the cold
and lose my grandmother.

899
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,482
I've got to set up a meeting
with her in person

900
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,692
as soon as possible.

901
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,072
I guess we're going back
to England.

902
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:27,124
Oh, welcome home Your Highness.

903
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,459
Your Highness.

904
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,462
We've done an extra special
deep clean.

905
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,123
Rumors of an impending pandemic.

906
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,624
Can you believe it?

907
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,343
That's why we didn't bring
Archie.

908
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,887
What's the status of the meeting
between me and Gran?

909
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,296
We want to be in and out of here

910
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,557
so we can get back to him
as quickly as possible.

911
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,392
The uh, the Queen's people

912
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:49,021
have postponed your meeting
again, Your Highness.

913
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:50,439
What?

914
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,150
The palace has said that
the Queen will be available

915
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:57,813
to see you in 23 days' time.

916
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh. That's a very long time.

917
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,035
Yes, well...

918
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,204
We British tend to be
rather good at pretending

919
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:10,543
something isn't happening for so
long it'll simply just go away.

920
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,669
It occasionally works.

921
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,212
This is not going away.

922
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,215
One moment.

923
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:18,801
Ah!

924
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:19,886
What? What is it?

925
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,720
What happened?

926
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:25,391
Your written plan that the firm
insisted that you put together to exit,

927
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,519
the details have just
been leaked to the tabloids.

928
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,678
God damn it.

929
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,772
How much do they know?

930
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,848
Enough to keep them
way ahead of us.

931
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,017
We're not going to let them.

932
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,944
Before the story can gain
momentum,

933
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,520
we'll put out a statement.

934
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,189
The Sussex Royal site.

935
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:44,201
We can launch right now and
post our statement in full.

936
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:48,372
With respect, the Queen has
not yet signed off on this.

937
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,417
They can't say we didn't try.

938
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,378
They forced our hand.

939
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,213
I'll talk to my father.

940
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,873
Leonard, can you get him
on the phone?

941
00:52:57,967 --> 00:52:59,374
Yes, sir.

942
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,488
We've got to get a post up
on Insta as soon as possible.

943
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,095
Leonard: Harry for Charles.

944
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,763
Here we go.

945
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,563
This is for the best.

946
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,690
Well I do hope so, sir.

947
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,276
Because I can guarantee you
after this,

948
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,863
your world will never be
the same again.

949
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,046
Pa.

950
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,317
I just thought you should know
we're going public

951
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,341
with our plans.

952
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,916
We've got to get ahead
of the press.

953
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,085
Have you gone mad?

954
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:43,928
When?

955
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,137
In about 10 minutes.

956
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:48,182
You can't be serious.
A 10-minute warning?

957
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,259
Pa, I've been trying
to tell you for months

958
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,019
and you've done nothing
but stall.

959
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,929
Now the press has it
from someone leaky.

960
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,106
Lord knows what they'll do
with it.

961
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:59,268
And if I'm really being honest,

962
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,464
I've been trying to tell you

963
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,604
I wanted to leave the firm
my whole life.

964
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,448
But you weren't listening.

965
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,492
The same way you didn't
listen to Mum.

966
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,277
Harry, how dare you?

967
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,620
You know?

968
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,291
You know Meghan had
her own moment

969
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,452
when she was pregnant
with Archie?

970
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,463
That's what the firm does
to people.

971
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,007
Oh Harry, stop this right now!

972
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,458
I am.

973
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,127
I'm stopping them
from destroying us

974
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,296
like they have so many others.

975
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,298
So yeah.

976
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,767
You get a 10-minute warning.

977
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,144
No turning back now.

978
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:43,487
Tonight, royal exit.

979
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,981
Seismic change
inside that palace.

980
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,386
- A new role for themselves.
- Le shock.

981
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,118
They say they intend
to step back.

982
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:49,910
To step back.

983
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,203
A Megxit.

984
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,038
They want to live life
by their own rules.

985
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,656
That's pretty dramatic stuff,
isn't it?

986
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,874
I mean, it's a bit of a wow.

987
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,326
They actually did it.

988
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,463
Hmm.

989
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,173
My birdies at the tabs.

990
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,555
Hello?

991
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,059
I know. We're in shock.

992
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:17,563
No, we had no idea they were
planning to leave.

993
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,107
Prince Charles was only given
10-minutes warning.

994
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,652
Harry's impetuousness always
gets the better of him.

995
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,687
There shall be consequences,
I assure you.

996
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,198
Disrespecting the Queen.

997
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,326
No, that's correct.

998
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:32,527
Her Majesty the Queen
had no idea.

999
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,246
No, it's disgraceful.

1000
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,540
Absolutely disgraceful.

1001
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,460
No, we're astounded at how
spoiled and ungrateful they are

1002
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:43,130
after everything that the palace
did to welcome them.

1003
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,776
Yes, Her Majesty will be
releasing a statement

1004
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,091
any moment now.

1005
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,720
And we've just now gotten word
moments ago

1006
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,214
that the palace has released
a statement indicating

1007
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:55,684
that they were completely
unaware that this was coming.

1008
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,271
Shockingly, even the Queen
herself was left in the dark.

1009
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,523
We've been trying to see her
for weeks.

1010
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:02,858
I was blocked.

1011
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,236
It's not just the tabloids.

1012
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,397
Major pieces in The New
York Times,

1013
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:11,116
Times of London,
none of it good.

1014
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,660
Everyone's going crazy
on social media,

1015
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:19,083
calling you a couple of selfish,
spoiled brats. #Megxit.

1016
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,585
I'm the dirty rascal now.

1017
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,670
Megxit.

1018
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,081
Like it's all your doing.

1019
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:28,592
Like you're the wicked witch
stealing the beloved prince

1020
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,595
because he has no mind
of his own.

1021
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,923
You know what they used to call
me when we got engaged?

1022
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,309
The hostage.

1023
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:38,894
Thanks for telling me.

1024
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,526
Ah.

1025
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,611
Please tell me you've got
good news, Leonard.

1026
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:52,607
The Queen has called
a royal summit,

1027
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,993
to be held on Monday,
January the 13th

1028
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,954
to address the crisis.

1029
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,497
Well...

1030
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,250
At least we get our
in-person meeting.

1031
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,836
Victoria: The Sandringham
Summit, the press is calling it.

1032
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,672
Her Majesty has requested
a family lunch beforehand.

1033
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,123
Just family.

1034
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,634
You and your brother,
with their Gran.

1035
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,804
No.

1036
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,018
Tell her no.

1037
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,138
And let the Royal Rota know
I refused.

1038
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,524
Let everyone understand it.

1039
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,902
My brother has not been loyal.

1040
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,645
Very good, Your Highness.

1041
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,982
And make sure Meghan isn't there
for these negotiations.

1042
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,651
No one in that room needs
her advocacy.

1043
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,598
Do you think she realizes
she only played a lawyer

1044
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,789
on the goggle-box, hmm?

1045
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:13,947
I have spent my entire life
building the trust

1046
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:17,659
of the people of this nation
and the Commonwealth.

1047
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:23,207
Assuring them that this monarchy
was something they could look to

1048
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:28,545
for stability and neutrality
and unity

1049
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:32,674
in times of, well, uncertainty.

1050
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,971
And you Harry, well, you have
fueled uncertainty.

1051
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:41,808
Yet another crisis that
we have to weather.

1052
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,977
I'm here to make amends

1053
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:48,398
and do whatever you feel is
necessary to move forward,

1054
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:49,724
Your Majesty.

1055
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:50,567
Hmph.

1056
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,819
One thing, if I may?

1057
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,733
It's extremely important
that everyone here knows

1058
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,246
that the desire to step back
is mine.

1059
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,748
This is not what Meghan wanted.

1060
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:10,837
All she wanted, desperately,
was to be a part of this family

1061
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:14,258
and a representative
of Your Grace.

1062
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:17,469
Hmm. I believe you.

1063
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,974
Oh, you brothers.

1064
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,310
I had hoped that you would
remain close.

1065
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:28,772
But the old pattern is powerful.

1066
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,650
It was thus with my father
and his brother.

1067
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:34,936
It was thus for me
and my sister.

1068
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,156
And then Andrew, well.

1069
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,704
So William.

1070
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:49,459
I ask you, what is your role
in all of this?

1071
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,952
Your Majesty.

1072
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,797
I did not contribute to my
brother's careless actions.

1073
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:57,801
But did you make every effort
to welcome your brother's bride

1074
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,555
into the family and the firm?

1075
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,133
We did our best under
difficult circumstances.

1076
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:09,855
And why, pray tell, did you
reject my invitation

1077
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,308
to a family luncheon
before today's summit, hmm?

1078
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:16,695
Well, I wanted to stick
to business.

1079
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,239
The monarchy is at stake.

1080
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,033
Oh you make my very point, dear.

1081
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,201
The monarchy is at stake.

1082
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:27,489
And a real opportunity
has been lost here.

1083
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:30,542
A brilliant job you've done
of managing it.

1084
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:34,338
Mother... Well...

1085
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:35,964
It's quite clear
we will not have

1086
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,717
a business agreement here today.

1087
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,888
I shall seek to make sure
that the press

1088
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:47,809
and the people understand that
we are more than a business.

1089
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:51,938
We are a family.

1090
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:58,904
Family business negotiations
will follow,

1091
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:05,077
and we will find a solution
in a matter of days, not weeks.

1092
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:11,917
The country deserves a swift
solution and quite frankly,

1093
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,502
so do I.

1094
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:21,718
I hope you will forgive me
if I use this opportunity

1095
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:25,880
to share with you my plans
for the future

1096
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,184
which now indeed have changed.

1097
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,731
Once Meghan and I were married,
we were excited.

1098
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,567
We were hopeful.

1099
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,486
We were here to serve.

1100
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,398
For those reasons,

1101
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:47,452
it brings me great sadness that
it has come to this.

1102
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,738
Over the next few months,

1103
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,624
I will be seeking a more
suitable way

1104
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,253
of combining a meaningful
public role

1105
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,915
with hopefully a more
private life.

1106
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,301
We are taking a leap of faith.

1107
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:08,590
I hope you can give me
the time and space

1108
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:12,352
that has been lacking
in recent years.

1109
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,610
Thank you for giving me the
courage to take this next step.

1110
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:41,006
What are you going to wear
to Commonwealth service?

1111
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:46,470
I haven't decided yet.
Why?

1112
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:48,533
Just want to make sure this time
you're not going to

1113
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,632
secretly consult with Meghan

1114
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,078
or wear something
from their wedding

1115
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,637
to show as a secret signal
of support.

1116
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:59,858
I didn't know you were such
an avid fashionista, dear.

1117
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,978
Find out what color she'll be
wearing and wear the opposite.

1118
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,365
All right. I understand.

1119
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,151
The Commonwealth service
is their last event as royals

1120
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,703
and you want to...

1121
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,331
I don't want a rival monarchy
being set up in North America!

1122
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,207
They're not royals.

1123
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,042
All right.

1124
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,919
All right, I understand.

1125
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:25,509
If the institution crumbles
when Gran dies,

1126
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,196
Meghan can go off
and earn a new fortune

1127
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,679
as a TV star or something.

1128
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:30,889
And I'll just be the guy

1129
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,786
under whom the centuries
old institution failed.

1130
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,643
That will be my legacy.

1131
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,479
Well, I'd like to think

1132
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,731
you'll have something
of importance left.

1133
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,442
Sorry.

1134
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,613
Sorry, of course.

1135
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:50,024
I love you.

1136
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,828
You're in an impossible
situation.

1137
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,081
An incredibly privileged
situation,

1138
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,376
and I'm proud to live up to it.

1139
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,836
It isn't easy.

1140
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,505
No.

1141
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,715
Moving forwards,

1142
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,426
you and I can start to show
a bit more PDA.

1143
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,595
Oh.

1144
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:13,557
People like that thing
that Meg did,

1145
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,059
rubbing a hand on Harry's back.

1146
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,894
Oh?

1147
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,521
Like this?

1148
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,315
And hug the people?

1149
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:23,401
Oh. All right.

1150
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,943
Yes, you can.

1151
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,780
And give some interviews.

1152
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,386
Maybe we could start
a YouTube channel.

1153
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:36,538
People want to feel close to us,

1154
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,791
the way they felt to my mother.

1155
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:43,295
I want to protect her legacy.

1156
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,338
Make it part of ours.

1157
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,891
Her Majesty as head
of the Commonwealth,

1158
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,934
will lead a multi-faith
religious service

1159
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,978
across five continents today.

1160
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,772
Delivering a common future
is today's theme.

1161
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,107
In her Commonwealth speech

1162
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,100
released by the palace
yesterday,

1163
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,436
the Queen said she hopes the
people of the Commonwealth

1164
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,239
will be inspired by
all that we share

1165
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,658
and move forward
with fresh resolve.

1166
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:17,278
Her Majesty said she felt it
inspiring to be reminded

1167
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:20,332
of the diversity of the people
and countries

1168
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:23,001
that make up our
worldwide family.

1169
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,878
Of course everyone
in the nation,

1170
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,171
indeed the whole world,

1171
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,456
will be watching today
as the two brothers

1172
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,134
Prince William and Harry
will be together in public

1173
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,627
for the last time

1174
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,888
before the Sussexes
are officially relieved

1175
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,765
of their royal duties.

1176
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:49,903
How do you feel?

1177
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:52,480
Sad.

1178
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,315
Proud.

1179
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,818
Confused.

1180
01:05:56,912 --> 01:06:00,580
Excited for whatever comes next.

1181
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:04,668
And more in love with you
than ever.

1182
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:17,672
And for my last day ever
as a royal,

1183
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,266
something a little
less fairytale,

1184
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:21,851
something a little more...

1185
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:22,979
Superhero?

1186
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,437
Hmm.

1187
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:25,346
A cape.

1188
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,681
A cape.

1189
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:30,485
And I had the tailor
line your suit

1190
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,737
with the exact same shade
of green.

1191
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:37,358
So when the wind blows up
the corner of your jacket

1192
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:41,863
everyone will see we match.

1193
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,833
We're well-suited.

1194
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,584
What?

1195
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,369
Brits love a pun.

1196
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,880
Lucky for you I love Brits.

1197
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,675
Well, this one anyway.

1198
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,098
Come in.

1199
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,437
I like that one too.

1200
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,105
I beg your pardon,
Your Highness?

1201
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,470
She's wondering
if you would move

1202
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,984
to North America with us,
Sir Briggs.

1203
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,226
Ah.

1204
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,115
No, going back to Downing Street
for me, I think.

1205
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,403
Well, all I can say is thank you
for everything,

1206
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:25,790
and goodbye.

1207
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,794
I'm sad you won't be part of
our team any longer.

1208
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,580
You're the only one I never
made cry, apparently.

1209
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,750
Ah. Well not even the death
of Bambi's mother

1210
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,510
could manage that mar.

1211
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,182
Serving you has been the honor
of a lifetime.

1212
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,437
I would hug you, but...

1213
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,097
Corona.

1214
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,691
A crown that nobody wants.

1215
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:52,984
Indeed.

1216
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,155
Final day, sir.

1217
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:01,109
Are you ready?

1218
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:03,828
I'm ready.

1219
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,873
I've been ready
for quite some time.

1220
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,835
Very good.

1221
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,462
Well after the Commonwealth
reception,

1222
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:16,299
a car will take you both
to the service

1223
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:20,929
with Her Majesty
to Westminster Abbey.

1224
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,058
Good luck.

1225
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:31,147
Soldier: Guards, present arms!

1226
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,690
Reporter: In their red tunics,

1227
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,295
fifty-three guardsmen stood
to attention this morning,

1228
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,839
each carrying the flag
of the countries

1229
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:38,312
which make up the Commonwealth
as their leaders arrived

1230
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:41,157
for the opening ceremony.

1231
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,827
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1232
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,264
In seven minutes
the cars will arrive

1233
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,163
to take you to Westminster
Abbey.

1234
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,434
Once you receive your programs,

1235
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,625
please make your way towards
the exit.

1236
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:57,173
Meghan: Keep up the good work
and thank you for everything.

1237
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,716
It's been an honor.

1238
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,517
What's the matter?

1239
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,894
There's no mention of us
in the procession.

1240
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,063
On our last day.

1241
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,566
Our very last event as royals.

1242
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,067
The palace,

1243
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,904
make that William,

1244
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:24,033
is shutting us out so we sit
like regular audience members.

1245
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,535
Only he and Catherine
walk the nave

1246
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,413
as part of the procession
with the Queen.

1247
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,212
Oy.

1248
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,259
What the hell is this?

1249
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,544
It's what you asked for.

1250
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,546
Why are you so upset?

1251
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,724
Whatever happened to just Harry?

1252
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,162
Four minutes until the cars
are here

1253
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,728
to take you to Westminster
Abbey, Your Highnesses.

1254
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,391
How does it look to have the one
person of color in our family

1255
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,860
removed from the procession

1256
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,548
when the majority of the
Commonwealth countries

1257
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,280
are in Africa?

1258
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,574
Not to mention Barbados,
Jamaica, Bahamas.

1259
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,982
What it looks like is that you
stepped down from your duty

1260
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,871
while the rest of us
lived up to it.

1261
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,957
You should've taken my advice
in the first place.

1262
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,081
William.

1263
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,342
Just come out and tell me
how you feel.

1264
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,722
Say it to my face
if you need to say it.

1265
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,310
Say it.

1266
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:34,771
Out loud.

1267
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,319
You're a disruptor

1268
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,939
and that's why Harry wanted you
in the first place.

1269
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,533
It's not just because
I'm pretty?

1270
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,111
The reason Harry and I
have been at such odds

1271
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:51,996
since you came into his life

1272
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,614
is because I could see
quite clearly

1273
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:58,503
that you wanted, even needed,
to challenge this system.

1274
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,982
I'm not saying I don't
understand why.

1275
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,714
I do.

1276
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,802
But this is a system I was born
to uphold and protect,

1277
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,512
and that's what I'll do.

1278
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,684
He was trying to protect us all.

1279
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,688
From one woman.

1280
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,606
One minute, Your Highnesses.

1281
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:24,063
You two have walked down
the aisle of Westminster Abbey

1282
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:27,865
side by side many times.

1283
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,659
Of course.

1284
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,371
Now I know, I know that today,
it will be hard.

1285
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:37,875
But... nothing could be harder
than walking down the aisle

1286
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:42,422
of Westminster Abbey
behind your mother that day.

1287
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,507
But you got through it.

1288
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,634
Together.

1289
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:51,505
What better way to,
to honor her than to,

1290
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,719
to show her that although
you do have your differences

1291
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,185
you're still united.

1292
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,187
Shoulder to shoulder.

1293
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,190
The programs are printed.

1294
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:12,327
Two thousand of them.

1295
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,912
You can change the rules.

1296
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,751
You're going to be king one day.

1297
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:32,046
You will not walk
the royal procession.

1298
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,215
But we won't either.

1299
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:37,051
Catherine and I will skip
the royal procession today,

1300
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:41,147
you sit in the row right behind
us with Edward and Sophie.

1301
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,232
Fine.

1302
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:50,898
Congregation: We affirm
that every person

1303
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:54,619
possesses unique worth
and dignity.

1304
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,330
We affirm our respect
for nature,

1305
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,416
and that we will be stewards
of the earth

1306
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:05,579
by caring for every part of it,
and for it as a whole.

1307
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:09,133
We affirm our belief in justice
for everyone

1308
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,178
and peace among peoples
and nations.

1309
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:15,681
Joining together in kinship
and affinity,

1310
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,976
in diversity and unity,

1311
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:22,939
as members of a worldwide family
of nations,

1312
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:26,442
we build on shared inheritances.

1313
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,329
Look at little Archie go.

1314
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,998
Meghan: H, come quick.
Arch is dancing.

1315
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:44,252
The little one said,
roll over, roll over

1316
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,838
There were nine in the bed
and the little one said

1317
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,465
Roll over, roll over

1318
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,385
We'll dance later, baby.

1319
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,555
Grandma's going to read
Duck Rabbit.

1320
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,560
Canadian officials
have just told me

1321
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,897
they will commit no further
resources for our protection.

1322
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:08,985
And my father has withdrawn his
financial support completely.

1323
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:12,530
But you and Arch were born
with targets on your back.

1324
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,074
You don't get a choice
in all this?

1325
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,119
They think I did have a choice
about who to marry.

1326
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,957
Which I absolutely didn't.

1327
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,670
I just can't believe my father.

1328
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,547
He knows what it feels like
to have the firm

1329
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:32,216
not approve the person you love.

1330
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,135
Harry: He's not returning
my calls.

1331
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:39,182
They want me to know
what it feels like

1332
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,601
to be out in the cold.

1333
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,604
They're exiling me.

1334
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,858
They're doing everything they
can to preserve the monarchy.

1335
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:52,186
We have to do what we can
to protect our family.

1336
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,489
We have to figure something
out quickly.

1337
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,491
The pandemic is spreading
so fast.

1338
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:59,660
They said international borders
are about to close.

1339
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,996
We won't be able to leave.

1340
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,081
And thanks to The Daily Mail
and that pap up a tree

1341
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,368
who shot you and Arch walking
with the dogs,

1342
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,670
they know exactly where we are.

1343
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:20,047
I know you're worried,

1344
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,810
and I'm sorry your family
is being so awful.

1345
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:27,396
I know a little bit
about that myself.

1346
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,110
But we have each other.

1347
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,695
And I have a plan.

1348
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:40,401
California knows how to party

1349
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:44,747
California knows how to party

1350
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:48,751
In the city of LA

1351
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,295
They're poplocking, woo

1352
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,050
So rough, so tough

1353
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,135
out here baby

1354
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,304
So rough, so tough

1355
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,889
out here

1356
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:05,685
California knows how to party

1357
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:10,022
California knows how to party

1358
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:13,317
In the City of L.A

1359
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,362
I like American royalty.

1360
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,863
Self-made too.

1361
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:21,117
How long do you think Tyler
will let us couch surf here?

1362
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,412
Till we find our own place.

1363
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,498
Oprah said we should
look near her.

1364
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:30,042
Find ourselves a real home.

1365
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,879
I like the sound of that.

1366
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:38,134
You really think you can make
California your home, babe?

1367
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,971
I know it's very different.

1368
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,895
Twist my arm.

1369
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,244
What do you reckon?

1370
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,204
Think we could be happy here?

1371
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,456
It's nice.

1372
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,874
It's big.

1373
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:14,295
Well, we're going to need
some extra room.

1374
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,501
Are you...

1375
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:21,844
I'm pregnant.

1376
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,883
It was a great honor to be asked

1377
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,595
to give a commencement speech
for my Alma Mater.

1378
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:06,138
But to be honest,

1379
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:10,267
I worried about how it would be
picked apart and analyzed.

1380
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:17,525
Then I realized the only wrong
thing to say is nothing.

1381
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,153
As I speak to you about my
support for Black Lives Matter,

1382
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,489
I feel sure of this.

1383
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:28,119
You, the next generation,
will lead with love.

1384
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,738
You will lead with compassion.

1385
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:33,791
You will use your voice
in stronger ways

1386
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,002
than you've ever been able
to before.

1387
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:44,844
Oh.

1388
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:49,473
Shall her relentless
self-expressing never cease?

1389
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:51,592
First she had to talk about
Black Lives Matter

1390
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:54,353
at a commencement speech,
now this.

1391
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:56,647
It's a big excessive, no?

1392
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:02,862
"Let us commit to asking others,
are you okay?"

1393
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,907
That's exactly what she said
in that interview, wasn't it?

1394
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:09,785
"No one asks if I'm okay."

1395
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,495
"As much as we may disagree,"

1396
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,539
"as physical distanced
as we may be,"

1397
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,792
"the truth is, we are more
connected than ever."

1398
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,170
We are not connected anymore.

1399
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,713
Well thank heavens.

1400
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:25,092
"Losing a child means carrying
an almost unbearable grief,"

1401
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,263
"an unbearable grief
experienced by many

1402
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:32,183
"but talked about by few.

1403
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,477
"Despite the staggering
commonality of this pain,

1404
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,688
"the conversation remains taboo,"

1405
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,899
"and riddled with unwarranted
shame,"

1406
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:43,027
"perpetuates a cycle
of solitary mourning."

1407
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:46,480
Yes, Me-ghan rolls again,
louder than ever.

1408
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:48,324
God she's such a show off.

1409
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:51,368
That is, it's one way
to look at it.

1410
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,037
Why?

1411
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,373
Why does she have to go on flapping
her feelings out like a bat

1412
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,084
every time she gets
a bit wobbly?

1413
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,829
I mean, some of us prefer to
keep such things private for,

1414
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,881
for good reason.

1415
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,509
It's a miscarriage.

1416
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:08,677
It's not like she's not going
to have another baby.

1417
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,346
She's pregnant again I hear.

1418
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,431
Due in the summer.

1419
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,121
Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry.

1420
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,645
I just...

1421
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:21,982
Your Highness.

1422
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,446
Victoria: Oh, it's pathetic.

1423
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,691
Well.

1424
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:33,360
There goes a good soldier.

1425
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,788
Now then.

1426
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,583
What are we going to do about
this bloody Oprah interview

1427
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:42,336
that she's planning, hmm?

1428
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:47,633
Hey Flower.

1429
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:48,542
Hi.

1430
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:49,636
What you doing?

1431
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,044
Oh, stuff.

1432
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:51,720
Right. Right.

1433
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,180
Stuff.

1434
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:56,049
Okay, come on.
Stuff can wait.

1435
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,185
Let's do fun.

1436
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:00,062
Outdoors, get some air.

1437
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,401
Take the boys to the beach?

1438
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,653
Mm-hmm.

1439
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,697
I'll drive.

1440
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,341
They're trying to stop us
from doing the Oprah interview.

1441
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:31,343
What?

1442
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:32,948
They're fighting back
because they think the interview

1443
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:36,140
will be a nuclear option.

1444
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,684
Ah, let them fight.

1445
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,928
We need to let people hear
our truth.

1446
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:44,264
I just hope the firm
is finally listening.

1447
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:48,101
Well, whether or not they are,
they can't retaliate.

1448
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,363
They've already taken everything
they can actually take from us.

1449
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:53,449
They've cut us off completely.

1450
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,870
You know what that means?

1451
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,247
We're completely free.

1452
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,627
You broke the cycle.

1453
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:16,513
This belonged to my mum.

1454
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,391
Thought you might want
to wear it.

1455
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:20,684
All right.

1456
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,570
If you could step on set,
that would be great.

1457
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:25,022
Oprah will be here momentarily.

1458
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,191
Meghan, you'll go first, yes?

1459
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,692
I'm ready.

1460
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,951
Well, as they say,

1461
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:42,289
may the bridges we burn
light the way ahead.

1462
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:48,671
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

1463
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,939
I got no support.

1464
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,360
They just said
"you're on your own."

1465
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:16,323
I had no idea what
I was going into.

1466
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:18,358
I was thrown into the deep end,

1467
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:22,788
and nobody ever helped me
at all.

1468
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,373
They'd be there to criticize,

1469
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,376
but never be there to say
well done.

1470
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:33,716
I just didn't want to be alive.

1471
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:41,843
It was a very real and
frightening constant thought.

1472
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:50,482
I threw myself down the stairs.

1473
01:23:54,864 --> 01:24:02,864
I went to HR, but they,
they wouldn't help me.

1474
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:08,250
They said it wouldn't look good
for the monarchy.

1475
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,743
So I was a problem.

1476
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:10,837
She's different.

1477
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,629
She's doing everything
we never did.

1478
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:13,797
Why?

1479
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,762
I was excluded totally.

1480
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:23,640
What would you say has been
your greatest achievement?

1481
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,769
To not bow down to pressure.

1482
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:35,527
At the beginning I always had
my head down.

1483
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:40,365
And now I'm ready to go forward.

1484
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:48,451
This is, in some ways,
just the beginning for us.

1485
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,835
Would you leave the format
of the monarchy as it is now,

1486
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,463
or would you alter it
for your sons?

1487
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,174
I am altering it.

1488
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:07,017
I'm the last person to think
woo-woo, you know?

1489
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:10,938
But it's undeniable
what the overlap is.

1490
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,149
So yeah.

1491
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,902
There was a bigger purpose.

1492
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:20,447
There was other forces at play,
I think.

1493
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:27,955
It's been unbelievably tough
for both of us.

1494
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,005
But at least we had each other.
