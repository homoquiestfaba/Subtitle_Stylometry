00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,604
NARRATOR: Since the
beginning of time,

4
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,942
Man has created a netherworld
of legend, myth, and folklore.

5
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,878
Today, men still scour the
earth for answers as a quest

6
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,613
For the truth continues.

7
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,049
For some, exploring
the unexplained

8
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,984
Affords the unique
challenge of seeking

9
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,019
Out that which is unknown.

10
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,889
One of the most disturbing
and compelling legends

11
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,059
Is that of a strange creature
that many claimed to have seen

12
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,627
Or had close encounters with.

13
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,999
This animal was,
until just recently,

14
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,369
Thought to be nothing
more than folklore.

15
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,070
Coinciding with
this assumption was

16
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,905
Most of the
scientific community,

17
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,507
Who dismissed the
reported sightings

18
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,343
And attacks as fueled
by the superstitions

19
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,712
Of the Latin American culture.

20
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,581
What is this animal
that has caused so

21
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,549
Much debate among scientists?

22
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,685
And so much fear among
the people of Puerto

23
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,455
Rico, Mexico, Texas,
and several other parts

24
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,223
Of the United States?

25
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,626
None other than the Chupacabra.

26
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,628
Literally translated
from Spanish,

27
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,631
It means one who sucks
blood from goats.

28
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,167
Beginning in the spring
of 1994, the Chupacabra

29
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,537
Began to attack goats
and other livestock

30
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,406
On this side of the border.

31
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,974
South Texas was the
first to be hit by a wave

32
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,976
Of these vicious events.

33
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,381
By the summer of 1996, called
Verano del Mal by the locals,

34
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,250
Or the evil summer, the
attacks had escalated

35
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,386
In number and violence.

36
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,723
Now horses, family pets, and
even humans were also being

37
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,225
Attacked by the Chupacabra.

38
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,761
Although the attacks were
witnessed by several people

39
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,731
And several photographs
were taken of the aftermath

40
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,167
Of a Chupacabra attack,
they were repeatedly labeled

41
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,370
As nothing more than a hoax.

42
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:36,276
That was until January 1997.

43
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,513
The videotape you are watching
is actual surveillance camera

44
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,418
Footage taken on a cold evening
on a Santa Maria, Texas farm.

45
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,187
This footage became one of
the key components that capped

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,690
An intensive
investigation that led

47
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,425
To the death of several people.

48
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,297
This is the true story using
actual video footage shot

49
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:00,468
By a group of intrepid
students from the University

50
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,570
Of the Rio Grande Valley.

51
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,204
These students set
out on a mission

52
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,408
To track down the
elusive creature.

53
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,978
The team which is headed by
cryptozoology student, Maria

54
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:15,048
Esperanza, directed their quest
to the small rural community

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,618
Of Santa Maria in
southern Texas,

56
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:22,823
The site of the most frequent
and recent Chupacabra events.

57
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,560
Along with Esperanza were fellow
students Pete Cortez and Daniel

58
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,563
Webster, both of whom
volunteered to document

59
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,799
The events as they happen.

60
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,767
The group also decided
to enlist the help

61
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,637
Of George "Army" Armistad.

62
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,907
Armistad was a former
Marine, personal bodyguard,

63
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,010
And a renowned firearms expert.

64
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,380
Once the team was complete, they
embarked on the daunting task

65
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,681
At hand.

66
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,218
This case, however, has a
deep, personal significance

67
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,153
For Esperanza.

68
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,423
MARIA ESPERANZA: It
was about a year ago

69
00:05:55,523 --> 00:06:00,260
When my uncle first told me
about livestock mutilations.

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,132
He said that someone...
Or something...

71
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,234
Was attacking his goats
and other livestock

72
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,671
Almost every night.

73
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,973
He said these things were
occurring closer and closer

74
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,677
To his home, so he was afraid.

75
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,679
I was too.

76
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,948
I suggested that he notify
the local authorities.

77
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,753
And I set up some camera
surveillance equipment.

78
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,689
I saw what was on those tapes.

79
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:36,063
That thing, that creature,
that killed my uncle,

80
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:36,864
It is not human.

81
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:48,008
They found him in the
woods a week later.

82
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,516
NARRATOR: Now, for
the first time ever,

83
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,487
The legendary Chupacabra had
been documented on videotape,

84
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,622
Proving its existence
and catapulting

85
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,857
It into the world of academia.

86
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,227
There were many questions
to be answered... among them,

87
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,529
What was this creature?

88
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,198
And where did it come from?

89
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,966
Some very credible
people believe

90
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,168
That the Chupacabra
was a secret government

91
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,671
Genetic experiment gone wrong.

92
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,741
The US government admits to
having a biomedical laboratory

93
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,877
And Puerto Rico, but will
not divulge any information

94
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,814
About the range of tests
that are conducted there,

95
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:30,283
Stating it as classified.

96
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,985
Others believe
that the Chupacabra

97
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,987
Is something much worse.

98
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,489
They believe that
the creature is

99
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:40,427
A pariah, a true symbol of
evil that exists in our world.

100
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,329
Still others believe
that the creature's

101
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,965
Not even of this earth.

102
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,702
Many different people with
many different beliefs.

103
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,204
However, the
Esperanza expedition

104
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,641
Set out to find the truth.

105
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,042
Here is their story.

106
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,548
A series of brutal
animal mutilations,

107
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,983
And other strange occurrences,
has brought the University

School of cryptozoology

109
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,589
To the Texas border
of Mexico... this time

110
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,727
To my hometown, Santa Maria,
Texas, population 800.

111
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,098
For the past several nights this
town has been gripped by fear.

112
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,433
It's being terrorized by
these animal mutilations.

113
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,737
And the carnage has everyone
locking their doors at night,

114
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,473

Mr. Lloyd Jackson,

operator of Jackson

117
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,612
Good morning, Mr. Jackson.

118
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,413
Good morning, Miss Esperanza.

119
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,216
I see you've brought a good
portion of Texas militia

120
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,085
With you.

121
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,653
But we travel light.

122
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,155
So Mr. Jackson, you...
You had an animal

123
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,824
Mutilation on you property?

124
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,826
LLOYD JACKSON: Yes, ma'am, it
happened some time last night.

125
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,739
Just as the reports have
said over the last few weeks,

126
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,842
This is no ordinary mutilation.

127
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,845
This is goat has been
disfigured and violated

128
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:10,651
By a twisted mind of a creature
with supernatural strength.

129
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:11,819
I would have
cleaned this mess up

130
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,420
By now, what with
it getting so ripe,

131
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,487
But I was waiting on you all.

132
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,724

farmhands wouldn't

Hispanic holy woman comes and...

180
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,026
Crypt... crypto what?

181
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,427
Cryptozoology.

182
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,595
Pardon me, ma'am.

University of the
Rio Grande Valley.

184
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,932
We spoke on the phone.

185
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,868
Sheriff, do you or
your deputy have

186
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,736
Any comment on the series
of animal mutilations

187
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,704
That have gone on here?

188
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,839
All right, now, hold on, ma'am?

189
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,975
Now do you have
any more information

190
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,944
About the unusual circumstances
surrounding my uncle's

191
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,079
Death, Charles Esperanza?

192
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:40,087
Tell us, sheriff, what kind
of animal leaves no tracks.

193
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,522
Um... ma'am, our investigation
found that Charlies

194
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,957
Esperanza had been
attacked by a wild

195
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,526
Animal as far as we can tell.

196
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,596
But I can assure you
that our department is...

197
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,831
Mm, hm.

198
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,466
Look, all I can tell you now...

199
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,535
Is that you can't
tell us anything.

200
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,341
You best settle down, ma'am.

201
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,312
Sheriff, my uncle was
murdered here last week.

202
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,548
And you are... you're writing it
off like an animal mutilation.

203
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:09,616
It's just...

204
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,218
I'm doing the best
job that I can, ma'am.

205
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:15,588
But there's a lot to this
than... turn that thing off.

206
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,590
Don't touch my camera.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,725
Shut it down now.

208
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,560
Just turn the damn thing
off, would you, please?

209
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,730
Don't touch... keep your
hands off my equipment.

210
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,399
All right, that's enough.

211
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,801
Nice going, fellas.

212
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,403
You all right?

213
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,139
I'm fine.

214
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,908
Sir, your people
and your crypto

215
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,110
Whatever van are
drawing folks in here

216
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,679
From all over Haldago
and Cameron Counties.

217
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,450
Pretty soon some idiot down in
McCallens is call a tach alert.

218
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,352
And every state
agency in Texas is

219
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,720
Going to converge on
our quiet little town

220
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,189
And raise all kinds of hell.

221
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,224
I think it's a little
late for that, don't you?

222
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,560
I would consider 100
livestock mutilation

223
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,763
In an isolated area in a one
month period of time a hell

224
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,932
Raising event.

225
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,968
Turn that thing off now.

226
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,102
There's no vote.

227
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:02,902
It stops here.

228
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,571
What stops here, sheriff?

229
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,639
The media link?

230
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,308
Or is this where the
conspiracy starts?

231
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,337
Chupacabra.

232
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,241
[Screaming]

233
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:54,121
The discovery of the Chupacabra
has given cryptozoology

234
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,157
Another notch to the
belt. But before we

235
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,859
Pat ourselves on the back,
there are many questions

236
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,094
That need answers.

237
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,964
For example, where does
a Chupacabra derive from?

238
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,900
Is it mammal or reptilian?

239
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,371
We have actual footage... video
footage... of a Chupacabra.

240
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,541
We've studied it, scrutinized
it, frame by frame.

241
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,478
And what do we see is a
Chupacabra that move and reacts

242
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,814
Like a primate,
almost humanistic.

243
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,951
But the samples of DNA
that we have clearly

244
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,954
State that the Chupacabra
is a cold blooded reptile.

245
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,135

247
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,138
Hold you fire.

248
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,706
Well?

249
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,541
Congratulations, you
just scared the piss

250
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,877
Out of a man-eating pussy cat.

251
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,580
Put your gun down, stupid.

252
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,581
Hector, you...

253
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,682
I've got enough coverage.

254
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,250
Let's just get out of here.

255
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,285
Cort, cover them.

256
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,422
All right.

257
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,760
Where is that fricking thing?

258
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,928
Oh, it's just the Curandera...

PETE CORTEZ: Maria,
I'm going to get this.

261
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,213
I'm going to get it now.

262
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,215
No, Pete, listen,
it's not worth it.

263
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,950
Look, just let it go.

264
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,789
Nobody move him.

265
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,124
I think he's going to be OK.

266
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,326
Just let him come to on his own.

267
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,327
What about the sheriff?

268
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,297
Oh, God.

270
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,703
Oh, my god, he's dead.

00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,372

It's everywhere.

00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,806
PETE CORTEZ: There's
an opening right here.

273
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:27,940
This is where I
think he got out.

274
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,741
Come on.

275
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,943
Come on.

276
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,579
Are you sure?

277
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,513
Be careful.

278

I don't see it.

right, Cort, you got this?

PETE CORTEZ: I got it all.

282
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,689
Easy.

283
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,890
Watch out.

284
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,425
Where'd he go?

285
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,394
I don't see anything.

286
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,032
This thing has
more intelligence

287
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,601
Than a normal animal.

288
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,773
Yeah, have you seen the video.

289
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,810
That thing almost
seems to fly sometimes.

290
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,946
And actually, it's
kind of clumsy.

291
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,749
I mean, its legs are too heavy
for this earth's gravity.

292
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:19,826
Yeah, you put all these things
together, and it's obvious.

293
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,994

PETE CORTEZ: I
think... I think it

295
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,764
Went straight ahead that way.

to go to the hill

297
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,401
And get some
coverage over there.

get some more police out here?

299
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,673

were in the barn,

300

all over the place.

than the both of us.

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,413
And what the hell is hanging
outside your doorway?

359
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,915
Hector, it smells not
like rotten garbage.

360
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,719
I had something like that
pried out of my ass in Nam.

361
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,286
Armistad, you're delirious.

362
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:35,988
You were never in Vietnam.

363
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,024
You were 10 years old.

364
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,326
Try not to talk and
conserve your energy.

Garlic salt charm given
to my by some witches

367
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,932
To ward off Chupacabra.

368
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,634
PETE CORTEZ: Does it work?

369
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,336
Until here.

370
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:54,206
Once again, the
means of extracting

371
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,142
Information from
the enemy surpasses

372
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,411
Anything you've ever done.

373
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,646
PETE CORTEZ: Where
are these witches?

374
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,814
And where can we find them?

375
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,183
I've seen them drink
some beer in cantina.

376
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,419
I can take you there
if you want me to.

377
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,655
I have seen them do things
that normal people cannot do.

378
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,423
Such as?

379
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,223
Keep away Chupacabra.

380
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,797
Armi, are you all right.

381
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,700
Finally, somebody
with some dog sense.

382
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,170
I think that was a compliment.

383
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,439
Are you OK?

384
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,974
We didn't mean to
leave you all alone,

385
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,408
But I checked out you out.

386
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,209
And it seemed OK.

387
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,177
It's OK.

388
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,046
I'm all right.

389
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,549
Do you know where the
Chupacabra's nest is?

390
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,151
Yeah, but lociento, I
would never go there.

391
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,889
All right, Armi, are you
thinking clear enough?

392
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,723
Yeah.

393
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,858
Do you have any ideas?

394
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,228
Well, Hector, do
you think you gather

395
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:53,032
Enough men tonight, help
us surround the goat pen,

00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,467
Track Chupacabra.

397
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,669
I can get some stronger darts.

398
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,139
Senor, Chupacabra
is very strong.

399
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,641
We're very lucky to be alive.

400
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,577
Only a loco would
go look for it.

[Music playing]

402
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,167
We were caught a
little of guard earlier.

403
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,169
We didn't know what to expect.

404
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,604
But we've had a
little experience now.

405
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,941
And we're going to
try catch this thing.

406
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,276
We're here in the
goat pen, hoping

407
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,678
That he will come
back to the same place

408
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,112
That he fed on last night.

409
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,382
It's about 10:00 PM, so we
think we got a little time,

410
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,418
Since he struck about 1:00.

411
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,288
Armi seems to have gotten
a stronger dart together.

412
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,524
Armi, how we doing?

413
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,826
I got a much stronger
load this time.

414
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,662
I get enough
tranquilizer in that dart

415
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,496
To stop a heard elephants.

416
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:00,700
We'll be ready for him.

417
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,538
In case that doesn't
work, I got my shot gun.

418
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:09,141
Basically, we're just going
to hide out here in the barn,

419
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:13,245
Be ready, stay alert,
and see what happens.

420
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,451
We've got some movement.

421

the whole whole group.

that thing and Jackson.

where that thing is.

Why the cover up?

little kitten, no larger

540
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,969
Than a rottweiler.

541
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:34,907
But this Chupacabra
is huge, enormous.

542
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,543
Well, judging
from the video, it

543
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:42,048
Seems very similar
to the theropods,

544
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,650
Which were present in the
middle Triassic period.

545
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,488
The most famous of these
was the tyrannosaurus.

546
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:52,892
The smallest was the
compsognathus, which was

547
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:56,095
Only about 2 and 1/2 feet tall.

548
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,231
One interesting point
is that theropods

549
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:03,502
Were very numerous in what is
now known as South America.

550
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,172
We know that theropods
walked on their hind legs.

551
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:10,910
They had large heads,
very sharp teeth.

552
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,879
The notion that the
Chupacabra could

553
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:17,884
Be a descendant from
one of these theropods

554
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,451
Is an interesting one.

555
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:25,757
But the theropods disappeared
by the Cretaceous period.

556
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,694
It's pretty difficult to
give a definite answer.

557
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,696
But it's possible.

558
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:34,333
At least, I think so.

559
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,968
This isn't good.

560
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,670
It's going to take forever for
the paramedics to get out here.

561
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,107
[Moaning]

562
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:43,675
It hurts.

563
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,476
I know.

564
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,311
Just relax.

565
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,952
I've seen 911 take two
hours to get to these parts.

566
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:57,523
Deputy, the Sheriff and I
were discussing the photos

567
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,892
Of my uncles crime scene.

568
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:03,029
He said I could pick them
up at the coroner's office.

569
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,997
Would that be where I
might find the tapes

570
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,366
Of what happened to him.

571
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:08,834
You know, you really
don't know what you're

572
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,270
Dealing with here, do you?

573
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,073
You know, Miss Esperanza,
this is probably the biggest,

574
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,208
Baddest Chupacabra in the world.

575
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,710
No, this is the granddaddy
of all Chupacabras

576
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,745
From what I understand.

577
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:20,846
But you know, they
don't tell me much.

578
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,950
No, see, the Chupacabra
policy is basically

579
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,617
Need to know basis only.

580
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,394
I mean, the boy
never had a chance.

581
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,830
Feel so horrible and stupid.

582
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,667
Hector's been with
me for seven years.

583
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,070
He just stood up
at the last second.

584
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:50,576
Mr. Jackson, we were all
running around It was crazy.

585
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,311
It was an accident.

586
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,845
No one is blaming you.

587
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,588
He used to eat his lunch every
day under the old oak tree.

588
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,724
Mr. Jackson, what we
have to concentrate on now

589
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:10,896
Is making sure that thing
doesn't hurt anyone else.

590
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:14,533
Wait, Hector told me that
there's a couple of witches

591
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,702
And... and they hang out
over at the cantina.

592
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:17,503
Witches?

593
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,108
I grew up in this town.

594
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,576
Everyone here is superstition.

595
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,946
It's... it's in our nature.

596
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,348
Those two girls
are really weird.

597
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,649
But everyone around
here believes

598
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,284
They've got strange powers.

599
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,320
And, you know what?

600
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,288
All my beliefs have been
blown to smithereens.

601
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,591
I... I could see it.

602
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,761
I guess I could believe
anything right now.

603
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,596
Well, so far we've got
a couple dead goats,

604
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,133
A sheriff with his
guts falling out,

605
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,735
And a ranch hand with
his head blown off.

606
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:53,272
What has to happen before we
decide to split this scene?

607
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,083
I've been bitten.

608
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,784
What?

609
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,186
What bit you?

610
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,154
That thing.

611
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:09,021
The Chupacabra?

612
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,989
Yeah, it was in the goat pen.

613
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,957
And everything was happening.

614
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:12,758
I didn't know at first.

615
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,427
It just was stinging.

616
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,329
But then I...

617
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,397
Doom, mija.

618
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,198
My god.

619
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,800
You are doomed.

620
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,072
You're going to die.

621
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:33,312
You only salvation is
[speaking spanish] hair

622
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,946
Of the dog.

623
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,015
Great, so maybe if we stick
around here long enough so

624
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,185
The rest can be bitten as well.

625
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,287
You better sit
down and shut up.

626
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,422
Or I'll come over
and do it for you.

627
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,523
Oh, man, you shut up.

628
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,657
Just calm down.

629
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,892
Who knows what kind of
diseases that may have.

630
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:47,726
Calm down.

631
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,860
Calm down.

632
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,962
Besides I haven't had my
Chupacabra vaccine yet.

633
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:55,834
Webster, everyone
needs to just calm down.

634
00:33:55,934 --> 00:34:00,506
We're not getting
anywhere with this.

635
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,908
We just need a
good night's rest.

636
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:07,846
We need to be ready for whatever
is going to happen tomorrow.

637
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:10,449
I've got some antiseptic
and some bandages.

638
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,153
Patch you right up.

639
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,987
There are bunks in
here for the crew,

640
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:19,891
And I've got room
for the curandera

641
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,527
Woman and Miss Esperanza.

642
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,206
Victor.

643
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,040
And the cross.

644
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,753
Victor, why don't
you say a few words.

645
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:52,158
You know him better
than anyone else.

646
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,025
[Speaking spanish]

647
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,083
Amen.

648
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:21,787
All right.

649
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:22,688
Let's get out of here.

650
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,290
That thing's still out here.

651
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,090
Let's go.

652
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,225
Get the shovels.

653
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,294
Victor, please.

654
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,629
Nothing else we
can do for him now.

655
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,970
So Mr. Jackson, do you see
the girls we're looking for.

656
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,239
I mean are they here?

657
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,142
I'm not sure, but I think
that's them over there.

658
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:47,413
What do you know about the
Jackson's ranch last night.

659
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:53,952
Are you... are you...

660
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,521
[Speaking spanish]

661
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,525
We must not talk
about this here.

662
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,693
Look, we have a place
at the old brewery.

663
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,663
Take us there and
we can talk then.

664
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:05,931
[Speaking spanish]

665
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,374
Put him on the table.

666
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:35,227
Another person was bit by
the Chupacabra yesterday.

667
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,628
I see that.

668
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,397
Your flesh rots as we speak.

669
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,370
Relax, it will be out soon.

670
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,240
The pain our friend
endures is but a drop

671
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,342
Of water in the
black sea of pain

672
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,043
In which you will soon drown.

673
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:56,815
The Chupacabra bite is deadly.

674
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,217
It's venom possesses.

675
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,021
Such bile and infection
that will soon rot away

676
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,057
And melt down your insides.

677
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,728
The worst part is near the
end when you start passing

678
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,464
Your own guts into the toilet.

679
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,433
Sometimes it takes hours.

680
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,368
Sometimes takes weeks.

681
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,804
And sometimes it takes months.

682
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,439
But the curandera
said that our salvation

683
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,808
Was in the hair of the dog.

684
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,676
What does that mean?

685
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,145
The only antidote
is the Chupacabra.

686
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,515
Only you can kill
it to rid your soul

687
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,449
Of a Chupacabra's infection.

688
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,275
All right.

689
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,276
All right.

690
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,745
All right.

691
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,747
What's wrong with him?

692
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,249
The Chupacabra attacked
and bit him last summer.

693
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,484
He grows more sick each day.

694
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,719
We're waiting for
the swell of death.

695
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:08,520
Kill me.

696
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,321
Kill her.

697
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:16,261
We understand that you can
take us to the Chupacabra's den.

698
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:17,763
Den?

699
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:18,964
That's a good one.

700
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,266
It's a hole.

701
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,403
Your sources are wrong.

702
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,405
You have my word.

703
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,708
Armi, give you 50 bucks.

704
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,545
What's wrong with
you, Esperanza?

705

75.

706
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,615
100 American dollars cash.

707
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,749
Due in advance.

708
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:41,687
Wait a minute.

709
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:42,488
Wait a minute.

710
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,557
Not so fast.

711
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,793
How do we know you're
not fussing with us?

712
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:48,727
Fine.

713
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,161
Forget it.

714
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,298
Find it yourself.

715
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:56,768
[Music playing]

716
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,592
Armi, the money.

717
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:28,166
Here's $50.

718
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,803
You get the other 50, when we
get to the Chupacabra's lair.

719
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35,273
No, I'll take the
second half now.

720
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,274
This is ridiculous.

721
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,143
Let's just get out here now.

722
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,611
Give the money back.

723
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,546
Hold on there, boys.

724
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,847
I've seen these girls around.

725
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,214
They'll do what they say.

726
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,186
Well the very existence
of such a creature,

727
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:52,958
Such as the Chupacabra, makes
us wonder about its origin.

728
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,993
I believe with many
of my parishioners

729
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,697
That the Chupacabra is
not an embodiment of evil.

730
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:02,200
To say that it's a creation
of Satan would be a mistake.

731
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,004
I believe that all animals were
placed on this earth by God.

732
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,339
There's no creature on
earth that's inherently

733
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,042
Evil, except perhaps for man.

734
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,846
It's the myth that
flourishes behind this animal

735
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,815
That gives rise to the
statement that it's

736
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,117
A device of the devil.

737
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,852
Of course, I understand
why many people

738
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,388
Think the Chupacabra is evil.

739
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:27,859
Uh... for instance, the
Hispanic culture is

740
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,195
Alive with myths and legends.

741
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,599
The people of Mexico, for
example, are devoutly Catholic.

742
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,068
They're very religious,
but equally superstitious.

743
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,637
They'll believe what
they want to believe.

744
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,772
And even the Pope couldn't make
them think any differently.

745
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:47,846
Do you know where we are?

746
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,014
Are we there yet?

747
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,720
Jackson, pull off
here to the right.

748
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,521
OK.

749
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,393
I guess nobody with good sense
comes out this way anyway.

750
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,671
This is good.

751
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:13,705
Hold on.

752
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,974
We go on foot from here.

753
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,296
How far are we walking anyway?

754
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,576
Jackson, keep your eyes peeled.

755
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,943
Webster, we got something.

756
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,344
Check it out.

757
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,016
Oh, god.

758
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,053
God.

759
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,989
Webster, cover it wide.

760
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,190
This is disgusting.

761
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,163
I think I'm going be sick.

762
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,965
Part of its
tissue's picked away.

763
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,167
Probably by animals.

764
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,036
It's looks like he's
been here for weeks.

765
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,941
Let's go.

766
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:44,763
Wow.

767
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,118
Let's go.

768
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,147
Hey, I've got
something over here.

769
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,553
There's another one.

770
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:49,494
God

771
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:50,461
Real fresh.

772
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,963
Oh, yeah.

773
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:52,964
Oh, no.

774
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:54,499
Jackson, keep your eyes peeled.

775
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,300
My god.

776
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,438
Dios mio, Carlos.

777
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,476
My god.

778
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:40,538
Hail, hail, great one, be with
me now and deliver this soul.

779
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,644
[Non-english speech]

780
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,586
[Screaming]

781
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,630
Got you.

782
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,632
I got you.

783
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:11,302
What the hell is
wrong with her?

784
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,571
What do we do now?

785
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,841
Everyone just be quiet.

786
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:18,243
Hey, hey, hey, just
give that to me.

787
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:19,310
Stop.

788
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,212
[Screaming]

789
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,683
Get her under control.

790
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,253
Look at her.

791
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,554
What the hell.

792
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,995
I have been...

793
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,463
Leave now.

794
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:39,430
Let's go.

795
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,398
Let's go.

796
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:41,632
Let's go, go.

797
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:50,909
My feet hurt.

798
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:53,044
DANIEL WEBSTER: How many
people have to die before we

799
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,480
Get to this Chupacabra's nest?

800
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,282
I'm sick of this.

801
00:46:57,382 --> 00:46:59,650
Look, why don't
you shut your mouth.

802
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,685
We have no communication.

803
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,587
And we're out here all alone.

804
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:06,424
Do you hear anybody
else complaining.

805
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:09,460
Maria, are you OK?

806
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,428
Yeah.

807
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,763
We can rest if we need to.

808
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:13,631
There's no time.

809
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,266
Are you sure?

810
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,234
Come on.

811
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,908
Maria, are you OK?

812
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:26,277
I'm just dizzy that's all.

813
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,813
She's definitely
running a fever.

814
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,681
Sarah, how much further is it?

815
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,117
DANIEL WEBSTER: I'm
not going much further.

816
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,518
We're here.

817
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:34,419
Oh, hell.

818
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,458
Those were put up to
ward away intruders.

819
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:41,759
I'm from around here.

820
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:47,298
Anybody who walks through
those doesn't come back out.

821
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,302
MARIA ESPERANZA:
What is this place?

822
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,837
This is where the
Chupacabra lives.

823
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,776
GEORGE ARMISTAD: OK,
people, show time.

824
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,146
Jackson, how many
rounds you got with you?

825
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:02,413
LLOYD JACKSON: Five in this gun.

826
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,182
Two in each of these pockets.

827
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:07,185
MARIA ESPERANZA: Armi, how many
of those darts did you bring?

828
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,787
GEORGE ARMISTAD: I got it
up to jack ten Chupacabras.

829
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,122
I got one speed loader left.

830
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,190
That's it.

831
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,360
DANIEL WEBSTER: Hey,
guys, guys, wait up.

832
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,195
GEORGE ARMISTAD: Deputy
Lowe, I want you and Jackson

833
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,197
To cover this perimeter.

834
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:23,834
Webster, Maria and myself
will be in this direction.

835
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,103
Sarah, I want you...

836
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,538
No, I'm staying here.

837
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:33,111
Wait, Armi, we've shot at
this thing how many times?

838
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:36,314
It didn't affect it one bit.

839
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,782
Is it just going to
kill another one of us?

840
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,550
I don't understand.

841
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,918
DANIEL WEBSTER: I'm with that.

842
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:45,256
Look, this Chupacabra has got
to be vulnerable somewhere.

843
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:48,059
I mean I can use its eyes as a
port to its brain or its mouth.

844
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,195
I mean, there's a lot
of soft tissue in there.

845
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,963
DANIEL WEBSTER: Yeah, but
what if none of that works?

846
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:53,098
What then?

847
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,832
Then we'll just use the
rest of the afternoon

848
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,167
To work on plan B.

849
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,269
DANIEL WEBSTER: I thought Maria
already alluded to plan B,

850
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,071
Going back to the ranch house.

851
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,707
Look, I've had just
about enough of your...

852
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:03,674
DEPUTY LOWE: Over here.

853
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,176
Maria, over here.

854
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,389
GEORGE ARMISTAD: OK,
what do we have here?

855
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:25,463
The cave, fed by the
last people just like you.

856
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,101
And stuff they left behind.

857
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:34,339
GEORGE ARMISTAD: Careful.

858
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:35,540
See they tried to blow it up.

859
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,547
OK, here's what
we're going to do.

860
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,648
We're going to
use that dynamite.

861
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:47,052
We're going to blow up
the hole to its den.

862
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,219
Block the entrance.

863
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,955
Then when it comes
back from its hunt,

864
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:55,960
It will at least be confused,
disoriented, frustrated.

865
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:57,828
Then maybe we have a chance.

866
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,267
Armi, think we if
turn this the thing up

867
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:07,838
We could make it strong
enough to hold that thing in.

868
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,775
I can get in done.

869
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,844
It's not as strong as I'd
like it to be, but if it was,

870
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,980
Then we wouldn't be
able to up right it.

871
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:19,117
And then I'm going to
position myself inside.

872
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,218
What?

873
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,219
As bait?

874
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:22,187
Yeah, don't worry.

875
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:24,622
It'll work.

876
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,192
Listen, this is
a tricky monster.

877
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:29,560
We've all seen a lot.

878
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,961
Armi, I'm with you.

879
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,030
I'm going to go inside the
cage to get some coverage.

880
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:34,165
Let's do it, buddy.

881
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,566
Let's do this.

882
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,436
But if we can get the
Chupacabra in the cage,

883
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,905
We could get some back
up back up out here

884
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,374
And secure this thing
once and for all.

885
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,742
I agree.

886
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,711
Let's get started.

887
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:49,914
Let's turn this thing over.

888
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,015
Lift on three.

889
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,650
One, two, three.

890
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:58,789
Hey, Cort, you up?

891
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,590
PETE CORTEZ: Yeah.

892
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:09,400
The guys are trying to
make this thing strong.

893
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,506
In case this doesn't work,
in case we don't make it,

894
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:23,281
Whoever finds this tape, you'll
know this Chupacabra is real.

895
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:29,387
We did everything within
our power to kill it.

896
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:30,888
Just like the witch told us.

897
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:35,193
This is the opening to
the Chupacabra's lair.

898
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,828
I got enough dynamite that
the force of the blast

899
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,464
Should seal it shut.

900
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,611
Once that happens, Chupacabra's
got to play by our rules.

901
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,514
Cort, I want you to move back.

902
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,417
Take cover.

903
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,586
OK, Cort, here we go.

904
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,836
[Explosion]

905
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:25,042
With us inside as bait and
the Chupacabra den blown shut,

906
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,212
It should come straight for us.

907
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:30,581
At that point, I got
a dart waiting for it.

908
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,518
I'll go ahead and drag it
inside, secure the cage,

909
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:37,355
Douse it with
gasoline, light it up.

910
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,524
Now, if anything goes
wrong, I got the deputy

911
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:41,526
And Jackson to back me up.

912
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:44,128
Guys, make sure
you shoot to kill.

913
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,963
DEPUTY LOWE: I'll be
unloading on that son of gun.

914
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,132
LLOYD JACKSON: I'll
be here for you, man.

915
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:50,868
OK, it's getting late,
so let's get to it.

916
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:03,714
Thanks, I'm going to need it.

917
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:04,682
All right, Cortez.

918
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,894
OK, the door is closed.

919
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,496
I'm going to put
this knot in the wire

920
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,197
So you boys can get
at it if you need to.

921
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,137
Let's just say you boys
are crazy for doing this.

922
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:27,938
But good luck.

923
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,280
Armi, are you ready?

924
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,281
I'm ready.

925
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,029
Hey, Armi, Cort,
you guys OK up there?

926
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:01,839
Oh, my god.

927
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,845
No, Armi, it's Louisa.

928
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:10,481
Sarah?

929
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,282
Sarah?

930
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:12,116
She left us.

931
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:19,624
Oh, my god.

932
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:22,059
Did that thing do that to you?

933
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,832
Sarah!

934
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,134
Louisa, she's gone.

935
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:33,203
We don't know where she is.

936
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:37,274
I can't die alone.

937
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,976
We're here.

938
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,946
We'll help you.

939
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,881
Not with strangers.

Sarah!

941
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:51,856
She's dead already.

942
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:03,634

01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,826
Jackson, have a seat.

1080
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,165
Come in.

1081
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:46,937
Are you OK?

1082
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,873
We didn't mean to scare you.

1083
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:53,510
I don't think they
speak English, Cort.

1084
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,412
[Speaking spanish]

1085
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,154
We're not the border patrol.

1086
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:09,159
[Speaking spanish]

1087
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:14,731
Please.

1088
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,101
I hope I said that right.

1089
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,821
DANIEL WEBSTER: Cort, what
are we going to do now?

1090
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:39,323
We're going to stay
here for the night.

1091
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,525
At first light, we'll
head for the car

1092
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,461
And make it back to town.

1093
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:45,762
Maria is not doing too well.

1094
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:50,935
And Jackson's burned pretty
bad, but he's stable.

1095
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,602
I'm sure they'll both
make it through the night.

1096
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:56,874
It's just way to
quiet out there.

1097
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,709
Can't you do something
to board that up.

1098
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,880
Web, you're making me dizzy.

1099
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,680
I don't know.

1100
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,849
It's way to quiet out there.

1101
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,284
It's making me nervous.

1102
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,319
It's going to be all right.

1103
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,489
It's going to be all right.

1104
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:13,390
I'll find something.

1105
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,458
How about one of these boards?

1106
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,193
We can pull on of
these boards up here.

1107
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,262
[Speaking spanish]

1108
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,274
Ask one of those
guys if they've got

1109
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,708
Some nails around here...

1110
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,179

[Screaming]

1112
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,552
Be careful.

1113
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:16,553
What is it?

1114
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:20,690
Does he know how
to use that thing?

1115
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,562
Get away from that window.

1116
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:28,032
Stay away from the door.

1117
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:29,499
[Speaking spanish]

1118
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:35,906
DANIEL WEBSTER: No,
don't go out there.

1119
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:38,375
MARIA ESPERANZA: Stop.

1120
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,377
[Short roar]

1121
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,880
[Gun shots]

1122
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:51,922
Where'd he go?

1123
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:55,392
[Screaming]

1124
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:34,198
Hey, Web, look at this.

1125
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:39,769
Dr. Hernandez, what
do you make of this?

1126
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,606
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: Looks
Like a bar code to me.

1127
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:45,409
MARIA ESPERANZA:
That's what I thought.

1128
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,844
You know what that means.

1129
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,013
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
It's interesting.

1130
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,353
We're here at the cryptozoology
lab at the University

1131
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,155
Of the Rio Grande Valley.

1132
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:01,925
We're about to do an
autopsy on this specimen.

1133
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:04,694
It's been in cold storage
for about 48 hours

1134
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,830
Since it expired.

1135
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,600
We know it seems hasty, but...
Well... before any government

1136
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,538
Agencies takeover, like
the CDC or the FBI,

1137
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,142
We want to know the truth.

1138
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:20,677
Maria, before we start
cutting into the specimen,

1139
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:23,947
I'd really like to examine it.

1140
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:27,851
This huge cranium, I believe
that's why most people believe

1141
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:29,486
It to be extraterrestrial.

1142
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:34,724
Look at this mandible.

1143
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,026
Yeah, I noticed the
angle of langerhans.

1144
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:41,098
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
Look at the canines.

1145
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:44,101
See how they protrude
forward instead of down?

1146
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,136
Yeah I noticed that earlier.

1147
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,437
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
That makes me believe

1148
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,938
They're used for
holding or grabbing

1149
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,042
Rather than biting or tearing.

1150
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:56,113
And there's no occlusion
between the teeth.

1151
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:58,548
The grasping and
holding design is also

1152
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:04,221
Apparent in the double
phalange... hand or paw.

1153
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:06,656
We noticed that up close and
personal, didn't we, Cort?

1154
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,892
PETE CORTEZ: Yeah, I try
not to think about it.

1155
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:11,395
I try to put that in the past.

1156
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:17,834
We noticed, doctor, that it has
six areolas, but not just that.

1157
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:22,739
It actually has
developed mammary glands.

1158
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:26,243
But its reproductive
organs are undeveloped.

1159
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:29,546
Do you think it
could be asexual?

1160
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,915
Quite possible.

1161
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:35,752
I guess we'll find out
when we cut open, huh?

1162
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,228
Maria, this flesh
is almost wing-like.

1163
01:07:44,328 --> 01:07:47,664
I know, there
were times when it

1164
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,599
Seemed to glide through
the air like it was flying.

1165
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,537
Doctor, what do you think
of this spinal material?

1166
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,447
It looks like an extension
of the spinal cord.

1167
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:05,449
Interesting.

1168
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:08,252
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: The tarsals
and metatarsals are double

1169
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:11,755
Flinched, just like the claws.

1170
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:15,892
The feet are extremely flat.

1171
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:17,427
MARIA ESPERANZA: That
explains all the jumping

1172
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:22,098
And landing he did so well.

1173
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,734
Ready to take a look inside?

1174
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,535
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: Yes.

1175
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,775
MARIA ESPERANZA: We're
now going to a in-nucleate

1176
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,278
The eye from its orbit.

1177
01:08:34,378 --> 01:08:36,813
Basically, remove the
eyeball from the eye socket.

1178
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,925
In order to actually
release the eye,

1179
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,994
I'm going to have to
sever the ocular tendon.

1180
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,209
Hey, Cort, you getting
pictures of this?

1181
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,183
We're almost there.

1182
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,493
No wonder its eyes were glowing.

1183
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:24,794
It's the humorous fluid.

1184
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,675
The lingual bifurcation,
the forked tongue,

1185
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:41,845
Explains how the specimen
was able to do the siphoning.

1186
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:47,684
That's how he did it.

1187
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:26,256
Can you get it?

1188
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:27,056
Come on.

1189
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,235
We're not going to take
a look at the viscera,

1190
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:43,106
The internal organs, by cutting
in through the abdominal wall.

1191
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,079
The doctor is cutting through...
Um... the mid-rectus abdominus

1192
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:50,880
Muscle.

1193
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,482
MARIA ESPERANZA: Post
autopsy DNA findings show

1194
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:27,784
An erratic molecular structure.

1195
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:32,656
It's as if the chromosomes
are in a battle for supremacy.

1196
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:33,957
This is definitely
one of the most

1197
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:39,829
Unique and disturbing genetic
strains I have ever seen.

1198
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:42,098
As the mayor, I
have seen the people

1199
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,768
Come together as a community.

1200
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:49,172
They have watched for
each other's animals,

1201
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:53,042
For each other's safety, for
the good of the children,

1202
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,446
And definitely for the
good of each other.

1203
01:11:56,546 --> 01:12:00,316
I'm not saying that some of them
are at fear for their lives.

1204
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:04,554
But as you know this has been a
major problem for quite awhile.

1205
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:09,125
And of late, it has become
an even bigger problem.

1206
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:12,328
And it is disastrous
to our well being.

1207
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:15,164
The community thrives
on their animals.

1208
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:20,670
And it is essential that the
breeding stock be preserved.

1209
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,441
So they've had to take extra
time and care with the animals.

1210
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,842
They can't leave
them in the field.

1211
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,878
They have to be very
cautious about the timeliness

1212
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,515
And work together
to bring them in.

1213
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:32,649
How's life been?

1214
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:34,217
Well, it's been
pretty quiet in Santa

1215
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,119
Maria since all that happened.

1216
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:38,655
Even the curandera
lady got better.

1217
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,323
She's kind of local
healer around here.

1218
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:43,527
Things have been pretty
easy going since then.

1219
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,729
And I guess for me too.

1220
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,096
I've been going though
a healing process.

1221
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,097
It's been painful.

1222
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,401
But I'm making progress.

1223
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,703
Glad the ordeal is
all over though.

1224
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:55,004
It was pretty devastating.

1225
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:57,974
I don't ever want to endure
something like that again.

1226
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:02,245
But the information that was
acquired, it's priceless.

1227
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:05,248
I just feel really bad that
so many people didn't make it.

1228
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:09,185
[Music playing]

1229
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:26,970
It's kind of hard to
deal with sometimes,

1230
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:33,176
You know, the
things that we saw.

1231
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:36,646
Which you can read in my
new book, "Terror in Texas",

1232
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,549
A Survivor's Story."

1233
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:43,753
Yeah, we had our critics.

1234
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,922
But for the most part,
the scientific community

1235
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:48,558
Valued our work.

1236
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:50,059
So did the tabloid
industry, ironically.

1237
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,600
But I feel as... as if
we made a big sacrifice.

1238
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,102
I mean, we put our
lives on the line.

1239
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:02,772
But we accomplished
what we set out to do.

1240
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:03,907
We found a Chupacabra.

1241
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,144
There was this one critic.

1242
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,480
It was awful.

1243
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,584
He had nothing good
to say about us.

1244
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:17,020
I remember what he wrote.

1245
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,555
We shouldn't have
destroyed a living

1246
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:22,992
Specimen, because it could
have been further studied.

1247
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:26,696
Can you believe that?

1248
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,465
Well, I got my Chupacabra.

1249
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,338
