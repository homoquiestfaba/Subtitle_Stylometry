00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,533
Yeah.

2
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,267
Of course I got it.
What do you think?

3
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,633
Two shots,
and two more to be sure.

4
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,067
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet,

5
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,400
but whatever toulon's hiding,

6
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,900
this looks like a great place
to find it.

7
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:40,733
I told you,
satisfaction guaranteed.

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,633
I'll ring you back.

9
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:50,067
Ok, puppet master,
tell me everything.

10
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,167
Man: It all began, I suppose,

11
00:01:55,233 --> 00:02:01,167
one day with old afzel...
In Cairo...

12
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,100
Long ago.

13
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,600
[Indistinct chatter]

14
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,500
The most
sensational secret
the sands have revealed

15
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:24,433
since the unholy
desecration of
ramses' tomb.

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,967
Look.

17
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,133
Already the electrical
marvels of the present

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,433
cast a cruel light
upon their deficiency.

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Dead end.

20
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,233
The formula's not here.

21
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,333
No, no one's getting it.
Toulon made sure of that.

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
Well, we'll just
move to phase two.

23
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,633
Man:
Don't worry.

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,933
You won't be defenseless
for long.

25
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,067
It looks like you two
are not gonna give me
any trouble.

26
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,300
What is this?

27
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,600
This is a robbery,
Mr. hirst.

28
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,200
Then you'll be disappointed.
I'm not a rich man.

29
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,867
But you can take
anything you want.

30
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,700
I have a set
of wine glasses
in the dining room

31
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,933
that might fetch you
a few dollars.

32
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,833
I don't give a damn
about that shit,

33
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,967
and you know it.

34
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,600
The only thing
I'm interested in

35
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,067
is the only thing
of value you have,

36
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,167
and that's
Andre toulon's formula

37
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,100
for bringing
these creatures to life.

38
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,600
Again, you'll be
disappointed.

39
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,067
Don't test me.

40
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,800
You're very good
with a gun, I'm sure.

41
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,767
But you just want
something I don't have.

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,067
This looks like
the right place.

43
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,067
No. I knew toulon,

44
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,133
but he never
confided in me.

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,867
You want the collector
that bought his diary.

46
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,567
I have his address.

47
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,367
Yeah, I know that man.

48
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:19,300
I killed him 6 hours ago,
and the diary is worthless.

49
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,133
You want to try again?

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,967
I've dealt with
your type before.

51
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,900
Don't screw with me,
old man.

52
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,567
I want that formula.

53
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,967
I can't give it to you.

54
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,633
It's not
some instant recipe
I can just hand over.

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,367
It's more complicated
than that.

56
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,100
Really?

57
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,933
Aah! Ohh.

58
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,933
You don't know
how high the stakes are

59
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,633
or how far I'll go.

60
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,633
I'll do what I can.

61
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,733
I'll give you
whatever toulon left me.

to know,

This better
be something.

65
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,067
It will be.

Well, my friends, how are you?

Oh, don't answer that question.

Young and healthy, cool, calm,
collected, and contented.

69
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,200

I do... a frail, fragile old man.

75
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,733
But I'm going to alter that.

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,967
Next time,
we'll cut off your feet,

77
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,900
and I'll put you up on wheels,

78
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:53,167
and you can all
pull me along in the trunk.

79

will be swept away.

I can see better
than any other two.

95

If one is better than two,

96
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,533
then perhaps none
would be better than one.

97

nowhere else but hell.

Everywhere is hell,
for we are the damned.

There is no escape
from fate.

We are all puppets
dancing on a string.

Free will is an illusion.

We can only act
at the whim
of the puppeteer.

merely as a bridge...

for the soul.

Ricardo, voice-over: I had been
a caretaker at the bodega bay
inn for the off-season,

549
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:30,067
just me and my experiments.

550
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,167
I was researching
artificial intelligence,

551
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:35,200
trying to make my model robots
function autonomously.

552
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:38,967
I was working for biotech,
a major scientific
industrial concern,

553
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:42,500
with Dr. Baker
and Dr. Piper,

554
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,667
but some power was unleashed,

555
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:49,933
some awesome power that was
beyond our control,

556
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:53,067
and after killing
Baker and Piper...

557
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,167
Aah!

558
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:56,433
It came after me.

560
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,100
So you two
know each other?

561
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,967
Well, you bet we do.
We go all the way back
to the institute.

562
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,333
Ricardo, voice-over:
A coworker of mine
decided to visit,

563
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,500
interrupting a planned weekend
with my girlfriend.

564
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,833
He brought along another girl.,
a psychic,

565
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,100
who right away suspected
something was wrong.

566
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:25,667
Was she ever right.

567
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:28,833
Mind if I sprint
through your program
here, Ricardo?

568
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,067
I'd rather
you didn't.

569
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:38,400
Come on. It's not
like I'm gonna
steal anything.

570
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:40,200
Ricardo, voice-over:
Through her channeling,
I found a trunk in a room

571
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:42,033
I'd never gone in,

572
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,933
a trunk full of puppets,

573
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,233
lifelike puppets that
had been built by Andre toulon.

574
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,800
He'd escaped Nazi Germany
and come here,

575
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:56,833
and his spirit was very present.

576
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,867
He's been working
on the very equations
and theories

577
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:00,433
that I was working on.

578
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:07,100
He was afraid
of what they'd do
with that power.

579
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,767
Ricardo, voice-over:
We found vials of substance

580
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:15,600
that when injected
into the puppets gave them life,

581
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:20,533
by all accounts, real life
and independent thought.

582
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,133
Man: This is
so stimulating.

583
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,133
It was amazing.

584
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,600

585
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:26,733

But the evil that was trapped
in Dr. Baker and Dr. Piper

591

caught up with us.

592
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:50,467
We unleashed creatures
from the underworld

593
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:55,067
that were after
the same secret we were.

594
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:57,900
It was a nightmare that
I didn't believe at first,

595
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:01,433

I couldn't escape the truth.

We banded together and fought.

598
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,467
The puppets attacked
the creatures instinctively,

599
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:18,167
and the spirit of toulon
guided us through the battle,

600
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:24,067
giving us courage
and showing us the way
to defeat the beasts.

unfinished puppet,

the strongest creature.

I am with you.

613
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:39,267
The power of the magic
has been set free.

614
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:42,400
Now it needs a wise master
to channel and control it,

I have to have that,

622

that I am satisfied.

someone waiting to
discover my secret,

00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,233
always someone who didn't
have the knowledge

to fully understand
what a gift or a curse

627
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,100
the formula for the puppets
really is.

you to Robert.

00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:26,067

Yeah. We call
this fellow pinhead.

it's all just bunkum,

but these are
the real models.

633
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,900
See that mean-looking
fellow there,
we call him blade.

634
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,533
Don't shake his hand.

635
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,300
Fellow next to him
is called six-shooter,

636
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:38,933
and that's Jester,

637
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,767
and our lovely lady
is leach woman.

638
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:42,967
Why leach woman?

639
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:45,800
Well, hope that
you never find out.

Not on these puppets.

644
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,867
How do you
make them?

645
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:00,333
Well, I have
a confession to make.

646
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,933
I didn't make them.

647
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:04,700
I bought them
at an auction
years ago.

648
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:05,867
They came
in an old trunk,

649
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:07,733
and when I took
them home, well,

650
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,300
they were the same then
as they are now.

651
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,367
See, I've tried
to duplicate
their process,

652
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:14,567
but I've never been able
to make a living puppet.

653
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:19,933
I've come close.
Heaven knows
I've come close.

654
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,067
Mm. Can't say I like
the way they're
staring at me.

655

Oh, don't be fooled
by the way they look.

656
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,667
They're really gentle.

00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:33,367
Hard, fine grain.
No knots, no flaws.
Perfect wood.

658

like it.

444 pieces.

666
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:59,733
Each piece must be
cut precisely
to scale

667
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,133
like the inner gears
of a wooden clock.

668

There can be
no flaws,
no mistakes

in size, dimension,
or shape.

670
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:10,633
Otherwise,
the puppet cannot be
properly assembled.

671
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,467
All this
would be wasted.

672

What will it look like
when it's finished?

673

in good time, son.

I carve them,

678

they'll still just be
pieces of wood.

together make them live?

the secret

of how to make
a dead thing live?

682

into it.

you have into this

01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:28,900
I... please.
You don't understand.

725
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:31,567
All I've done
I've done for you.

726
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:34,367
Aah!

727
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:35,633
Please.

728
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,667
Don't make me
hurt you, please.

729
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:45,233
Aah!

730
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:54,300
What are you doing?

731
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:55,633
I beg you.

732
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,800
All that I've done,
all that I've created,

733
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:03,600
I've done it for you.

734
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:08,600
No! No! Aah! Aah!
No, blade, no!

735
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,833
[Screaming]

736
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:55,367
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

737
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:58,533
What have you done?

738
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,433
You see?

739
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,267
I did it.

740
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,733
I did it.

741
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:22,967
Robert, no!

742
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,200
[Screaming]

743
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:30,200
Toulon: Greed, envy,
and power killed my enemies,

744
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:31,267
not the puppets.

745
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,767
My experiments continue,

746
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,767
and so do my wooden creations,

747
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,067
but their secret
is not for the timid.

748
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,067
They have the ability
to live forever,

749
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,467
and you can live
through them

750
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:43,367
if you have the desire,
the will to do it.

751
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:45,300
If you let no one
stand in your way

752
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:48,067
and devote your life
to their existence,

753
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:49,333
you can be a puppet master.

754
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,767
The ultimate power is yours
for the taking.

755
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:54,800
You'll never control
those creatures!

756
01:04:54,867 --> 01:04:56,833
They're mine!

757
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,600
You fool.
That's not
what I want.

758
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,767
Don't you
understand?

759
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:05,467
Your little friends
brought Andre toulon
back to life.

760
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,800
[Scraping]

761
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,800
He wasn't some
benevolent soul.

762
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:42,067
He was a psychopath!

763
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:43,400
Don't you know how
he spent

764
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,933
the last days
of his life
right here

765
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:47,767
in this very hotel?

766
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:55,100
Tonight, we take up
residence

767
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:59,300
in our permanent
new bodies.

768
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:17,500
To us.

769
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,367
[Chanting foreign language]

770
01:07:58,367 --> 01:07:59,533
[Gasps]

771
01:08:27,067 --> 01:08:30,133
[Toulon's voice]
You see how easy
it can be?

772
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,533
Only a moment
of pain,

773
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,600
and then
immortality.

774
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:38,400
All will soon
be glorious.

775
01:08:38,467 --> 01:08:40,600
[Gasps]

776
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:44,433
[Grunting]

777
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,267
You filthy schwein!

778
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:48,833
You brought me
animal brains!

779
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,533
Animal brains. Ohh.

780
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,233
I'll just have to make
the best of it.

781
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:02,133
You see, I must
keep my promise
to Elsa.

782
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,867
Your hard work
has not been in vain.

783
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:08,267
Of course, you may
wither into dry wood,

784
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:11,867
but you've given me
back my wife.

785
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:13,067
Man: Coward!

786
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:16,300
Here, Michael! Here!

787
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,967
Hurry!

788
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:26,900
Are you still
afraid?

789
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:32,600
But we must make
you drink,
sweet fräulein.

790
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,567
We cannot waste
our fuel, mein frau.

791
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:45,767
Only a single
goblet remains.

792
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,467
Stay back,
you fool!

793
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,300
Come back with that!

794
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:04,167
Aah!

795
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,467
[Groaning]

796
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:18,067
Woman: Michael!

797
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,433
Toulon: Elsa, stop!

798
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,067
Come back to me!

799
01:10:29,133 --> 01:10:31,300
[Groaning]

800
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,633
Ugh!

801
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,467
Ohh, ohh.

802
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,767
[Puppets growling]

803
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,800
[Toulon whimpering]

804
01:11:26,067 --> 01:11:28,200
[Screaming]

805
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:51,767
He began his final
experiment,

806
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,200
soul transference.

807
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:55,867
I'm not here
for the secret

808
01:11:55,933 --> 01:11:58,600
of bringing these
puppets to life.

809
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:03,167
I want to know
what makes them
die for good.

810
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,333
Damn fool.

811
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,300
I was sent here
for the secret

812
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:16,900
by the creatures
toulon left behind,

813
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:22,333
immortals,
souls trapped
in wooden bodies,

814
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,700
living every day
in agony.

815
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:30,533
All they want is
revenge on their
puppet master,

816
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,200
and now that's you.

817
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:35,933
Congratulations
on your legacy.
