WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?

872
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:58,130
YOU MUST TAKE CARE
OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

873
01:08:00,146 --> 01:08:02,093
I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT.

874
01:08:02,127 --> 01:08:03,830
BUT IF I'M GONNA SAVE
MY KID,

875
01:08:03,866 --> 01:08:07,028
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
DELORENZO CAN NEVER
GET TO US AGAIN.

876
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:10,156
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT
FOR YOU.

877
01:08:11,095 --> 01:08:15,126
UM-MMM. NOT A CHANCE.

878
01:08:15,162 --> 01:08:18,428
YOU SEE, UNFORTUNATELY
I'M IN THIS THING
TOO DEEP.

879
01:08:18,463 --> 01:08:21,521
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE
GONNA GET RID OF ME NOW.

880
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,260
AND IF YOU TRY,

881
01:08:23,295 --> 01:08:27,222
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
GO SEE DELORENZO
ON MY OWN.

882
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:30,212
MAYBE SHOW UP AT THE
EXACT SAME TIME YOU DO,

883
01:08:30,246 --> 01:08:31,949
