1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,633
- [Narrator] Tonight's
film is a dramatization

2
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,233
of private investigator
Kim Paris' account

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,500
of events surrounding
an actual murder case

4
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,600
and is based on her
recollections,

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:20,167
personal interviews, and
police reports.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,033
Some composite characters
have been used

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,433
for dramatic purposes.

8
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:33,067
(tense music)

9
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,200
(gun firing)

10
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:23,200
(dog barking)

11
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,067
- Grandma, Grandpa!

12
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,367
(screaming)

13
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:35,200
(upbeat music)

14
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,000
- [Man On Radio] Kim?

15
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,133
Kim?

16
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,567
Kim?

17
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,667
Kim?

18
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:55,767
Kim?

19
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,133
Kim?

20
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,000
Kim?

21
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,533
Paris, are you there?

22
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:07,300
- What?

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,833
- [Man On Radio] Nothing,
just checking to see

24
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,700
if you're awake.

25
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,567
- I'm awake, I'm ready,
and I'm waiting.

26
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,000
- She just left.

27
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Okay, give it 10 minutes.

28
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:26,600
- 10 minutes?

29
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,167
No way.

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,233
I'll go nail him now.

31
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,333
- Kim, you've never done
this kind of thing before.

32
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,700
It's a $100,000 claim.

33
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,800
I got you the job.

34
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,133
If you blow it, I get the blame.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,433
Damn it, Kim.

36
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,500
You gotta listen up.

37
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,100
- That's what I needed,
just what I needed.

38
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,067
If it isn't one thing
with cars, it's another.

39
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,467
I just had the carburetor,
whatever that is, rebuilt

40
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,800
and now I've got a flat tire.

41
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,467
Could that be connected?

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,233
Look, I just got a flat
tire and I'm on my way

44
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,433
to a modeling appointment
and I'm gonna be late.

45
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,267
Can I go in and use your
phone, call the service guy,

46
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,533
have him come out and
fix my tire?

47
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,333
- Why don't you
change it yourself?

48
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,300
I'd do it for you only
I hurt my neck.

49
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,467
I hurt my back, too.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,767
- Oh, that's too bad.

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,500
- You're a model, right?

52
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,400
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,533
- Uh, hmm.

54
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,000
- Hell, but men are dumb.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
- Okay, you just show
me what to do

56
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,433
because if I'm told what to
do, I can do mostly anything.

57
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,333
- Yeah?

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,433
Well, that's quite a thought.

59
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,000
(both laugh)

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,833
- There it is.

61
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,733
- You're gonna need a jack
and a lug wrench, too.

62
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,800
- It's pretty complicated,
isn't it?

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,667
- Nah.

64
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:58,833
Okay, just stand back.

65
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:01,067
It'll be a lot easier
if I just do it for you.

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,267
- Oh, are you sure?

67
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,800
What about your back,
and your neck, and all?

68
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,600
- Well, sometimes for a lady,

69
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,600
you gotta make a little
sacrifice, hmm?

70
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:13,767
- I am gonna watch and
see exactly how to do it.

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,367
(camera shutter clicking)

72
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,033
- Hell, I think a sight
like that's enough

73
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,000
to cure a fella of more
than whiplash.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,067
You say she used to be a
topless dancer?

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,500
- She wasn't much use at that.

76
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,300
- Well, everybody likes
different things.

77
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,500
- She can't dance.

78
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,067
She doesn't have any rhythm.

79
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,233
- Is that a fact?

80
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:43,100
Oh, well.

81
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,633
So, that's that.

82
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,067
What else you got, Posey?

83
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,000
Tom, get me a pack
of cigarettes.

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,800
- Well, I think we ought
to draw a line

85
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,367
under the Campbell account,
Clyde.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,200
We haven't come up with
anything in a month or more.

87
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,367
- I know how long we've been
taking their money, Posey.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,500
I told them when they came to me

89
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,400
that murder cases
were slow movers.

90
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,500
It's been two years since
somebody shot the Campbells.

91
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,667
Houston Police Department
haven't come up with diddly.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,833
- I spoke with Dan Halsey at the

93
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,200
police department the other day.

94
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,400
They're waiting for the
estate to get settled,

95
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,633
see where the money goes.

96
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,500
- [Clyde] Halsey couldn't find
his butt with a flashlight.

97
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,600
I thought you were
onto this fellow.

98
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,200
The boyfriend of Cindy Campbell.

99
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,033
What's his name?

100
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:18,767
- David West?

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,767
He gave Cindy her alibi.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,333
- Where's the coffee?

103
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,133
- You didn't ask for coffee,
Clyde.

104
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,533
No problem, I'll get it.

105
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,300
- Campbell had some
pretty scuzzy clients

106
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,667
in his line of lawyering, Clyde.

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,067
It could've been one of them.

108
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,800
- Not what the family thought.

109
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,133
They think their little
sister Cindy did it.

110
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,433
- They think she killed
her own parents

111
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,800
with her two kids right
there in the room?

112
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,233
- That's why they hired us.

113
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,467
- Well, we can't get
anywhere near Cindy.

114
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,800
She's a recluse.

115
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,800
Never comes out.

116
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,667
- Cindy's holed up.

117
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,300
Is this David West
holed up with her?

118
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,167
- Uh-uh.

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,067
They split up.

120
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,567
- You could try Kim on it.

121
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,533
She's kind of flaky, you
know, but she's plenty smart.

122
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,167
- His name is David West.

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
This could be good.

124
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,100
He's some kind of gun freak.

125
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,233
You know, a survivalist.

126
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,567
Into that
bodybuilding macho stuff.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm gonna create a whole
new style just for this gig.

128
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,067
Yes, he won't know what hit him.

129
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,900
- I don't know.

130
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,033
I don't like the
sounds of this guy.

131
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:23,267
I mean, what's he supposed to
have done, murdered somebody?

132
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
(upbeat music)

133
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,567
- His ex-girlfriend's
parents got blown away.

134
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,100
Could've been anybody.

135
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,033
Maybe even a professional hit.

136
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,633
They just think he knows
something about it.

137
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,733
Once I fix my hair,
it'll be perfect.

138
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,533
(tense music)

139
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,033
- All right, it's the
white house.

140
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,567
He's not home, so you
might have to wait a while.

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,167
And remember, Kim.

142
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,600
It was me who suggested you for
this, so don't be too weird.

143
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,833
Now, you have to
remember everything

144
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,800
so that it doesn't trip
you up later.

145
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,333
Keep to the facts about
yourself as much as you can.

146
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,100
Where you were born, what
your father does, all that.

147
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,533
Don't...

148
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,033
Don't fantasize.

149
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,033
(Kim laughs)

150
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,200
You can tell him about
being in the Navy,

151
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,667
you can tell him about being
an air traffic controller,

152
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,800
and you can tell him
about the topless dancing,

153
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,800
and about the time you
were raped, if you have to.

154
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,767
- I don't wanna do that.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,167
Why would I wanna do that?

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,333
- Yeah, well chances are, Kim.

157
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:48,300
- Call me Theresa.

158
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,333
Theresa McNeil.

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,467
- Yeah, right, Theresa.

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,633
Chances are, he's gonna
come onto you, right?

161
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,067
So, you're gonna want
to keep him off

162
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,267
without completely chilling him.

163
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,367
- Well, you know I know
how to do that.

164
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,367
- Yeah, okay.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,100
But David West might be
as easy going as I am.

166
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,567
So, something like
what happened,

167
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,467
can explain why you're
not hot to trot.

168
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,467
- Last guy I told about that
dropped me like a stone.

169
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,100
Don't worry, Tom.

170
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,500
Theresa McNeil can take
care of herself.

171
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,400
(tense music)

172
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:43,767
- How is she?

173
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,167
- Think Clyde'll blame me
if she blows it?

174
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,433
- If she blows it,

175
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,333
what Clyde thinks will be
the least of our problems.

176
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,733
She's on her own out there.

177
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,667
- She'll be okay.

178
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,633
(car engine starts)

179
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,600
- Oh, I was in the Navy
for four years before this.

180
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,467
Were you now?

181
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,367
Yes, I was.

182
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,467
It's what brought me to Texas.

183
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,033
Corpus Christi, mainly.

184
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,167
Yeah, it's a fun town.

185
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,067
Air traffic controller.

186
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,233
Yep.

187
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,800
Yep, I was one of those.

188
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,067
Only woman among 50 guys.

189
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
You better believe I
got to know men.

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,433
No, I'm not anti-man,
I'm just tired of these

191
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,000
add-water-and-stir
relationships.

192
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,267
Love.

193
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,300
Love, love, love, love.

194
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,333
Love, have I ever been in love?

195
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,700
This is kind of a
personal question,

196
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,500
don't you think right
off the bat?

197
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,233
No, I'll answer it.

198
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,833
I'm just saying it's
kind of personal.

199
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,700
No, I've never been in love.

200
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:03,167
I love people, but in love?

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,067
No.

202
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,400
What's the difference?

203
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,233
(engine revving)

204
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,067
I don't know, but I bet
you when it happens,

205
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,533
you sure can tell.

206
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,533
(uptempo music)

207
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,633
- [Woman] Hey, let's party!

208
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,833
- Hi, I'm Theresa McNeil.

209
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm Theresa McNeil.

210
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,633
(exhales sharply)

211
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,667
Hi.

212
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,133
- Hi.

213
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,100
- Is Charlie home?

214
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,067
- No.

215
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,800
- No?

216
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,033
You know when he'll be back?

217
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,533
- I don't think I
know any Charlie.

218
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,433
- [Kim] No?

219
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,133
Do you live here?

220
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,633
- (laughs) Yeah, I live here.

221
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,200
Charlie doesn't.

222
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,100
- Oh.

223
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,033
This is 3031 Franklin?

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,133
- [Man] That's right.

225
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,267
- Damn, I must've got the
address wrong.

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,567
Charlie Lockwood?

227
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,833
- I never heard of him.

228
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,233
- This is a real drag.

229
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,533
I drove all the way
across Houston.

230
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,833
You have a phone?

231
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,333
- (chuckles) I think so.

232
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,700
- Yeah, can I come
in and use it,

233
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,567
maybe save myself a wasted trip?

234
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
- Yeah, absolutely.

235
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,433
- Yeah, I'm here now.

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,667
Yeah.

237
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,233
Well, are you sure you
gave me the address right?

238
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,433
I'm telling ya.

239
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,433
No.

240
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,833
Never heard of Charlie Lockwood.

241
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,200
No.

242
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:57,233
All right, it's 555-8624.

243
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:58,800
All right.

244
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,133
I can't sit here all night.

245
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,533
Yeah, bye.

246
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,100
- So, any luck with Chuck?

247
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,500
- I tell you, making a
decent connection's

248
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,233
a real hassle these days.

249
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:10,200
It was no problem at all when
I was down in Corpus Christi.

250
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,267
Great place.

251
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,400
- [Man] Yeah?

252
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:16,633
- [Kim] This yours?

253
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,533
- [Man] No.

254
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,400
I just got a room here.

255
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,567
The guy that owns it,
it's his trip.

256
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,633
- He some kind of Vietnam vet?

257
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,700
- He wishes.

258
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,033
He's into the whole, um...

259
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,167
I don't know, he's just
into thinking about

260
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,367
all that kind of stuff.

261
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,667
So, what are you
trying to score?

262
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,200
- Weed.

263
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,400
They're gonna call me back
if they can locate Charlie.

264
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,367
You mind if I wait here?

265
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,267
- Oh, no.

266
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,167
But I gotta go out in a minute.

267
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,833
I gotta hook up with Dave.

268
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,500
- [Kim] Oh, hey, I
don't wanna hold you up.

269
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,300
- Oh, no.

270
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,400
Listen, if you're
looking to score,

271
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,667
I can probably put you
in touch with somebody.

272
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,833
How much you wanna buy?

273
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,800
- Depends on the price.

274
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,500
- Of course it does.

275
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,033
So, you wanna come with me?

276
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,167
- No hassles, right?

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,233
- No, no hassles, right.

278
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:08,233
Jeez, I'm just gonna hook up
with Dave for his birthday.

279
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,200
- Oh, hey, that's great.

280
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,633
You can say I'm his present.

281
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,467
- Yeah, right.

282
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,733
(lighter flicking)

283
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,033
(people chattering)

284
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:25,367

285
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:50,167
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

286
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:58,667

290
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:18,600

291
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,833
(uptempo country music)

292
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,033
(people chattering)

293
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,467
- So, you were an air traffic
controller in the Navy?

294
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,300
- Mm-hmm, two years.

295
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,400
I never lost a plane.

296
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,567
- You must've been just a kid.

297
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,733
- Yeah, well, I left
St. Louis when I was 17.

298
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,467
Ran away.

299
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,667
Joined the Navy so I
could get taken care of.

300
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,467
- So, what do you do now?

301
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,233
- Oh, I'm kinda between
gigs as they say in showbiz.

302
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,533
I live with my sister
Sammi and her old man.

303
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,500
My overhead's pretty low.

304
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,433
- You in love with anybody?

305
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,267
- That's kind of a personal
question, isn't it?

306
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,633
- Prefer that I ask you
impersonal questions?

307
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:14,133
Like, can you give me
a ride home?

308
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,100
- What, you don't have a car?

309
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:19,567
- I have a Trans Am, but it's
got a busted transmission.

310
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,533
I got a job that doesn't pay
enough for an oil change.

311
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,600
- Yeah?

312
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,633
Well, maybe your luck's
about to change.

313
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,633
- I don't believe in luck.

314
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,533
- Hey, how about that?

315
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:29,400
Neither do I.

316
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,000
- I have to talk to Steve, okay?

317
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:52,233
(engine revving)

318
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,333
- So, how come you don't
believe in luck?

319
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,767
- I just think everything
that goes to the trouble

320
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,100
of happening was inevitable.

321
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,800
I mean, you come up to
something in your life

322
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,400
some big decision you know
is gonna alter everything.

323
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:08,067
You think you made a choice,
but when you look back on it,

324
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,267
you see you did the only
thing you could've done.

325
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,067
- So, everything's
decided in advance?

326
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,733
That's what you're saying?

327
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,200
That's not much fun.

328
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,633
- Well, when you read a book,
see a movie,

329
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,167
everything's decided in advance,

330
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,567
but it's fun while
you're finding out.

331
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,100
Hey, turn here.

332
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:27,000
(tires squealing)
(car horns honking)

333
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:28,833
You drive like I think.

334
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,467
- I'm a great driver.

335
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,533
- That's what I said.

336
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,300
So, how come you left home
when you were so young?

337
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,367
- I was a difficult kid.

338
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,800
My father kept
getting on my case.

339
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,667
- Oh, tell me about it.

340
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,433
- Well, I remember the
night I left.

341
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:44,100
I was terrified, but I kinda
got myself backed into a place

342
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,567
I couldn't get out of, you know?

343
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm like that.

344
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,300
Anyway, he was downstairs
watching television,

345
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,267
60 Minutes it was, and I brought
my bags down one at a time.

346
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,833
I pile 'em in front of
the front door, you know.

347
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,300
Last of all, I go get
my Snoopy dog.

348
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,600
I stick him right on
top of the pile.

349
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,400
I keep thinking he's gonna
turn around, you know,

350
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,467
and see it and say, Kim,
don't go.

351
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,367
- [David] Kim?

352
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
- He always called me by
my middle name, Kimberly.

353
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,367
I hate it.

354
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,267
- Well, that's probably why.

355
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
- Probably.

356
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,300
Anyways, he never did
turn around,

357
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,233
not even when the taxi came.

358
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,300
He just kept
watching 60 Minutes.

359
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,367
- Hey, it's hard going
up against Andy Rooney.

360
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,467
(laughs)

361
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,633
This is my street.

362
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,600
- Here?

363
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,300
(tires squeal)

364
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:57,800
There you are.

365
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,667
You're free to go.

366
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,100
- So, what's this all about?

367
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,133
- What's this all about?

368
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,533
Haven't you ever picked
up a girl in a bar before?

369
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,067
- I'd have said it was
you who picked me up.

370
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,667
- [Kim] So, are you saying
that's never happened to you?

371
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,500
- Often enough to know it
doesn't feel like this.

372
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,533
- I'm not into these
just-add-water-and-stir

373
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,800
relationships.

374
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,700
- Neither am I.

375
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,267
Am I gonna see you again?

376
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,067
- How about same time,
same place tomorrow night?

377
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,100
- Well, we're gonna have
to be more straightforward,

378
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,233
Theresa, if this
relationship's gonna work.

379
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,200
Tomorrow.

380
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,267
- Tomorrow.

381
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,567
- So, do you have to sleep
with him or anything?

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,433
- Undercover doesn't mean you
have to get under the covers.

383
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,633
- Yeah, but don't you have to,
like,

384
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,233
taunt him with your
body until he confesses?

385
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,667
- Who says he has
anything to confess?

386
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,033
- Well, how come they're
paying you to date him then?

387
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,633
- I'm not dating him.

388
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,367
- I thought you were
seeing him tomorrow night.

389
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,800
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,400
Same time, same place.

391
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,267
- Hmm.

392
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,333
Sounds like a duck to me.

393
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,467
Now, come on, Kim.

394
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,367
Is he cute?

395
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,267
- Ask Theresa McNeil.

396
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,633
- [Sammi] Who's Theresa McNeil?

397
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,233
- [Kim] That's the
name I'm using.

398
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,133
- Now, wait a minute.

399
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:40,933
I thought you was
calling yourself...

400
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,067
Who's that girl,
Denise something?

401
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
That girl from the
insurance scam.

402
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,400
- Denise Donnelly was
totally helpless.

403
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,800
She couldn't change a flat tire.

404
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,433
Denise Donnelly is not the type

405
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,167
David West would be
interested in.

406
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,733
- What is the type David
West would be interested in?

407
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,733
- Well, now there's the trick,
Sammi.

408
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,067
First, I have to find that out.

409
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,733
Then, I have to become her.

410
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,700
(laughing)

411
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,100
(people chattering)

412
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:12,567
(uptempo country music)

413
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,267
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.

414
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,567
Kim?

415
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,133
Kim Paris.

416
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,233
Billy Curtis.

417
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,633
Corpus Christi?

418
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,600
Launch commander's office.

419
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:23,267
Don't you remember?

420
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,200
Hey, it's me.

421
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,633
Hey, we went out and got
drunk that night.

422
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:26,567
We had a great time.

423
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
You remember, Billy Curtis.

424
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:30,200
- Would you get your
hands off me, huh?

425
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,533
I mean, that's enough, you know?

426
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,767
God.

427
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,500
- You all right?

428
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,367
- Yeah, that guy
just grabbed me.

429
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey, wait a minute.

430
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,633
- I think a minute
would be too long.

431
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,367
- I just wanted to say hello,
okay?

432
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
- Consider it said.

433
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,067
- Yeah.

434
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,233
Yeah.

435
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,533
- Oh, put it out of your mind.

436
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,467
Let him deal with it.

437
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,600
- Maybe I overreacted.

438
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,267
- Don't apologize for
how you feel.

439
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,200
Don't look for trouble,
but don't walk away.

440
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,167
Some people see something
they don't like and they say,

441
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,700
that's wrong, and they
look down at their feet,

442
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,767
and shuffle 'em around,
and walk away.

443
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,167
I don't do that.

444
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,233
- You're a pretty tough
dude then, huh?

445
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:21,233
- No, I just see things through.

446
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,400
- I need a beer.

447
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:26,367
Can I have a beer?

448
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,533
The reason that I was
late is that Sonny,

449
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:34,600
my sister Sammi's husband,
he's kind of strict.

450
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,433
I couldn't tell him I
was coming to see you.

451
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,533
- Now, why's he strict with you?

452
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,300
You're not his wife.

453
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,067
- He's possessive.

454
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:46,167
You know, it's that
family kind of thing.

455
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,133
- Sounds like he's mafia.

456
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,567
- You must be clairvoyant.

457
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:57,167
He is kind of mixed up
in that kind of thing.

458
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,833
Does that bother you?

459
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:05,800
- No.

460
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:10,167
I had a girlfriend whose
father was a lawyer

461
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,733
for all kinds of lowlifes.

462
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,733
He didn't like Cindy going out
or having a life of her own.

463
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,033
Just like your sister's
husband Sonny.

464
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,033
- Well, he was her father.

465
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,667
Maybe he cared about her.

466
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,033
- Yeah, maybe.

467
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:28,300
- Sonny's not that bad.

468
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,133
Sometimes it helps to
have a man look after you.

469
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,333
How does your friend and
her father get on now?

470
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,800
- He got killed in a car crash.

471
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,667
Mother, too.

472
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,300
- Oh.

473
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,133
- So things worked
out just fine.

474
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,133
- [Kim] Oh, that's awful.

475
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,033
- The Campbells were
nicer people dead.

476
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:53,133
- David, what a
terrible thing to say.

477
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,067
- Yeah, it is.

478
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,200
But the Campbells were
terrible people.

479
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,433
All of their kids got
severely screwed up by 'em.

480
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:01,333
- Even your friend?

481
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,600
What was her name, Cindy?

482
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:04,767
- Oh, especially Cindy.

483
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,367
Cindy almost didn't make it.

484
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,067
- Was she in the car
when it happened?

485
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,000
- No.

486
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,267
No, I was with her when
she got the news.

487
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,400
- Are you and she still close?

488
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,167
- No.

489
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
No, after Cindy lost her
parents, things changed.

490
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,333
We don't see each other anymore.

491
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,700
It's all in the past.

492
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,833
I want you to know that.

493
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,333
- Hey, if you say so.

494
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,167
- No, I want you to believe me.

495
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,233
- I do.

496
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
I do believe you.

497
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:51,433
- Good.

498
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,767
Good.

499
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,667
I want things to be straight
between us, Theresa.

500
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,400
- [Kim] You may have to find
your own way home, okay?

501
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,400
- [Sammi] Oh, all right.

502
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,667
- [Kim] Now remember,
you and Sonny are only

503
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,333
married six months.

504
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,400
- [Sammi] His name is Sonny?

505
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,533
- [Kim] Yeah, he's very
old fashioned about stuff.

506
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,833
- [Sammi] What does he
care whether my husband's

507
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,033
old fashioned or not?

508
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,133
- [Kim] I told David he won't
let me get calls from guys

509
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,233
because I don't want him
to have my telephone number

510
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,567
and know that we live in
the same area.

511
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,167
I told him I live all the
way across town.

512
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,833
- What happens if you run
into him at the laundromat?

513
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,567
- I'm gonna take our clothes
to one of those places

514
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,633
where they do 'em for you

515
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,300
and then I'm gonna put
it on my expense account.

516
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,200
- You can do that?

517
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:33,033
- Deep cover costs, kid.

518
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,033
Now remember, don't blow it,
okay?

519
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,100
'Cause my name is Theresa.

520
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,333
- You think I am so stupid
I can't remember a name.

521
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,700
- Hey, cut down the Texas draw,
okay?

522
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,167
You're supposed to be
my older sister.

523
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,233
- I am not older than you.

524
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:41,800
- Don't be confused.

525
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,733
It's just a cover story.

526
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,033
- I'm not the one who's
getting confused.

527
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,300
- So, how come you
didn't run away from home

528
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,367
and join the Navy?

529
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
- Couldn't stand all that
yes, sir, no, sir stuff.

530
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:55,033
- Sammi was always
Daddy's favorite.

531
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,833
He taught her how to play pool.

532
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,800
- Dad's a real hustler, huh?

533
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,433
Amazing the way parents
operate on kids

534
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:01,600
and kids on each other.

535
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:05,800
Seen a lot of those
kind of games,

536
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,433
putting one kid
against the other.

537
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,567
- A dollar she makes it.

538
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,500
- You're on.

539
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,300
- Do you mind?

540
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,200
- $2.

541
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:20,733
- You're on.

542
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,233
- Oh.

543
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,733
Nah, I put her off.

544
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,467
She's really good.

545
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,167
Daddy used to make us play
all the time for money.

546
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,333
- I feel like I know him
without ever having met him.

547
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,533
- Kim exaggerates everything.

548
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:38,567
(suspenseful music)

549
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:53,200
- How come you still call her
by your father's pet name?

550
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,567
Suggests to me you
haven't accepted Theresa

551
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,700
for who she really is.

552
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Want a little bet on this one,
Sammi?

553
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,167
Remind you of childhood.

554
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,000
- Five bucks a game,
best of 10, loser breaks.

555
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,100
- It's what Daddy liked to bet.

556
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:24,467
- Shoot pool, big sister.

557
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:32,000
(pool balls clacking)

558
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,400
You hustled me, didn't you?

559
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,067
- Well, kind of.

560
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,033
You mind?

561
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:51,633
(both laugh)

562
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,400
- You're pretty smooth.

563
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:55,600
I like that.

564
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,167
You take care of Theresa,
can't you?

565
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,500
- [Kim] Yeah.

566
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,333
- You're not looking for
somebody else to do it for you.

567
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,400
- Is that how it was with Cindy?

568
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,067
- Something like that.

569
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:18,233
(engine revving)

570
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,767
(subdued music)

571
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,100
- Of course, if you don't
want to talk about it.

572
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,667
- You coming in?

573
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,367
- David, I'm not ready
for a physical thing.

574
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,300
It's not you.

575
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,167
It's something that happened.

576
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,133
- You don't have to explain.

577
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:09,733
It's okay.

578
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,333
You don't have to worry.

579
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:16,633
I don't want what you
don't want to give.

580
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,267
- [Kim] Some place.

581
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,067
You a survivalist, or what?

582
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,167
- [David] (laughs) Well,
I'm surviving so far.

583
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,933
- And that's enough for you.

584
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,167
- Hey, don't knock it
till you try it.

585
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,600
You go from home, to the Navy,
to living with your sister.

586
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,667
That's not taking too
many chances.

587
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,233
- And you, too.

588
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,700
- I live every day like
someone's sneaking up behind me.

589
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,333
So, I practice every day
sneaking up behind them.

590
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:42,267
Cheers.

591
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,633
- So, were you very
much in love with Cindy?

592
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,333
- Whoa, you don't give up,
do you?

593
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:52,233
- [Kim] No, sir.

594
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:58,067
- I created Cynthia,
or I tried to.

595
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,800
I was in love with what
she was gonna become.

596
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,167
- [Kim] Doesn't
sound too loving.

597
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:06,233
- When I first met Cindy,
she weighed about 200 pounds,

598
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:09,167
had greasy hair, complexion
like a glazed donut,

599
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
and a nose like Pinocchio.

600
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,267
She hated herself.

601
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
I didn't blame her.

602
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,633
- [Kim] So, why were you
attracted to her?

603
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,300
- 'Cause I could feel the
pain coming off her in waves.

604
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,233
She was like
radioactive with it.

605
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,067
And I was interested in
why this ugly, fat chick

606
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,400
was just so totally screwed up.

607
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,367
- [Kim] Did you ask her?

608
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,333
- Sure.

609
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:30,567
I said, how come a fat,
ugly chick like you

610
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,633
is so totally screwed up?

611
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,033
- [Kim] What did she say?

612
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,567
- Well, she said a
lot of things,

613
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,500
but in the end it all
came down to one thing.

614
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:42,067
Somebody was putting her down
and that person was Cindy.

615
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,300
- [Kim] You said her father was

616
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,733
terrible to her or something?

617
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,433
- Her mother wasn't much better.

618
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,500
But you can't blame
everything on your parents.

619
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,233
It just doesn't solve
your problems.

620
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,700
I told her, quit complaining.

621
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,200
You're just giving away
your power to the past.

622
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,233
So, I got her to stop
eating the crap she ate

623
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:06,233
and got her to start
exercising, reading books,

624
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:08,300
you know, to clean out her mind.

625
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,400
Put her in touch with her gift.

626
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:12,367
She was a natural psychic.

627
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,200
She didn't know it.

628
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:16,233
She knew stuff before
it happened,

629
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,633
but she never figured why.

630
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,300
I even got her to get
her nose fixed.

631
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,067
Turned out pretty good.

632
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,000
- [Kim] And were you
in love with her then?

633
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:41,433
- I was trying to make her
into somebody like you,

634
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,400
but I just didn't have
the blueprint.

635
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,700
- Well, there's only one
of those and I have it.

636
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:49,600
- I know.

637
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,200
I know.

638
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:58,733
(subdued music)

639
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,600
- David is a person of
deep feelings

640
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,600
and considerable sensitivity.

641
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:13,167
He has expressed a remarkable
degree of affection for me

642
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,233
and indeed may be in the process
of falling in love with me.

643
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,200
Now listen.

644
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,533
This is the one time, first
and last, I'm telling you.

645
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,733
This client isn't paying
for you to get

646
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,333
jugged up every night with
some sleazeball

647
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,467
that's so hot to trot that
he tells you he loves you.

648
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,067
If you think he's keeping
something hidden

649
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,167
about the Campbell
killings, that's one thing.

650
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,367
But I don't wanna hear
anything more

651
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,333
about this Dear Abby soap opera.

652
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,400
(hand slams)

653
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:53,100
- Aw, to hell with them
and their agency.

654
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,333
I survived before this,
I'll survive after it.

655
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,667
They're all so damn scared
of the old tone, you know?

656
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,167
They all think they're the ones
who know how to handle this.

657
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,400
I am the only one who could've
got this close to David.

658
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:03,433
Don't they get that?

659
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,200
- You love it.

660
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,533
You just love it.

661
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,033
All this playacting.

662
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,733
Miss Undercover, USA.

663
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,133
- What is your problem?

664
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,133
- You love making up lies.

665
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,533
You love believing 'em.

666
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,667
- You're supposed to
be my friend.

667
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,100
I don't need this from you.

668
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,800
- I am your friend
and I know you

669
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,533
which is more than you
do right now.

670
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,833
You're getting involved
with this creep, aren't you?

671
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,333
- How do you know he's a creep?

672
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,367
You hustled him at pool,
that's what you know.

673
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,600
You don't know what it's
like being somebody else,

674
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:31,300
being seen as somebody else,
feeling like somebody else.

675
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,333
- Answer the question, Kim.

676
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,833
- You promised to
call me Theresa.

677
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,567
- Answer the question, Theresa.

678
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,433
- That's the way it works
for me and it's working.

679
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:39,700
I'm getting close to him.

680
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:42,367
- You slept with him yet?

681
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,133
- No, I haven't.

682
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,733
And he hasn't pushed me, either.

683
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:46,600
He--

684
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,633
- Oh, respects you.

685
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,700
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.

686
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:51,533
I think he does.

687
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,233
- Aw, sweet.

688
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,233
(tense music)

689
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:13,733
- David?

690
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:17,700
David?

691
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,000
David?

692
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,700
David, you here?

693
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,433
David, it's me.

694
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:53,233
(knocks on door)

695
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,500
(dramatic music)

696
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:23,433
- Bang-bang.
(Kim yells)

697
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,400
- Damn it, David.

698
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:25,667
Don't do that.

699
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,067
Don't ever do that.

700
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,233
- You didn't hear me coming,
did you?

701
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,067
- I think that sort
of thing sucks.

702
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,033
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

703
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,233
- How do I know that?

704
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:46,633
- Why?

705
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,200
Why do you think I
might hurt you?

706
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,133
- I...

707
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,000
It's not you.

708
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,700
- Well, who is it?

709
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,067
- You scared me, okay?

710
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,800
Fine, all right?

711
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:00,667
You scared me.

712
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:13,367
- There's something you're
not telling me, Theresa.

713
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,633
You can tell me anything.

714
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,800
- About a year ago, I was raped.

715
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,133
It was partly my fault.

716
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,600
(subdued music)

717
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:34,700
I ran out of gas, and I
was walking to get some,

718
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,200
and a car came by.

719
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,667
It was kind of in the country.

720
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,733
Two guys were in it.

721
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,433
They asked me if I
wanted a lift, I said no.

722
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,200
They said it was a couple
miles to the next gas station.

723
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:53,067
He said, "What's the
matter, don't you trust us?"

724
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,233
I said it wasn't that,
but I'd walk anyway.

725
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,333
I was too close to the car.

726
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,633
He grabbed my wrist and
they drove off.

727
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,700
I had to run alongside.

728
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,033
After a bit, I fell down.

729
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,500
They stopped the car and
pulled me inside.

730
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:39,300
- Well, that wasn't your fault.

731
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:43,433
- I don't know.

732
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,600
Dumb of me.

733
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,500
- To run out of gas?

734
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,200
- Yeah.

735
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,267
I'm always doing dumb
things like that.

736
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,333
- Rape isn't a punishment for
running out of gas, Theresa.

737
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:58,167
Not even in Texas.

738
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,000
- Then why?

739
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,300
Why did it happen?

740
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,100
Why did it happen?

741
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,133
(Kim sobbing)

742
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,467
- Because it is an awful
world we're in.

743
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:28,467
I won't ever let that
happen to you again.

744
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,233
Never.

745
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,433
Never, never, never.

746
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,400
- [Man] George, give me five
of these, will you please?

747
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,600
(coin clanks)

748
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:45,200
- I want a tuna melt on
rye and some iced tea.

749
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,233
The money...

750
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:47,233
(fist pounding)

751
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,100
Gummit.

752
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,833
The money's in my coat.

753
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:50,733
- I'm buying.

754
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:53,700
- Well, well.

755
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:56,833
If it ain't Sam Spade
come a slummin'

756
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,733
in his 500 buck threads.

757
00:38:58,767 --> 00:38:59,933
Tell me, Posey.

758
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:03,833
How is the private enterprise
law enforcement business?

759
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,367
- Well, it's up to taking
you to lunch, Halsey.

760
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
- Yeah?

761
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,633
Well, ain't that nice.

762
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:15,800
I can't help it, Posey.

763
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,633
I'm just not very partial
to private detectives.

764
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,433
- That include me?

765
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:21,600
- Oh, no.

766
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,100
You know I got a
little soft spot

767
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,033
in my heart for you, Posey.

768
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:26,433
I guess it's on
account of that name

769
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,833
you had to grow up with.

770
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,333
Posey, Posey.

771
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:31,600
How come you never changed it?

772
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,400
- [Posey] You play the
cards you get, Dan.

773
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,367
You play the cards you get.

774
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,133
- No, don't give me that bull.

775
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,700
Next thing you'll tell me
is it made a man out of you.

776
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:39,600
- Oh, no.

777
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:40,567
I wouldn't go that far.

778
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,300
(both laugh)

779
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,633
Dan, we've been working
on the Campbell case.

780
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:47,667
I suppose you heard?

781
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,067
On behalf of the family.

782
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,300
- [Dan] What's that
costing the sucker?

783
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,133
- Well, they thought the
Houston Police Department

784
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,167
had kind of quit on 'em.

785
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,967
- Hey, hey, hey.

786
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
You get a guy that
that many people

787
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:00,567
got a motive for killing,

788
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,433
you either get lucky
or you either get slow.

789
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,367
- Yeah.

790
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,333
Well, we're working the
David West angle.

791
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,200
- David West.

792
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,167
Good luck, Posey.

793
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,667
I spent a long time trying
to break that alibi.

794
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,100
- Yeah, well, we've
got a girl next to him.

795
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,600
Her name's Kim Paris.

796
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,500
She's, well...

797
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,533
Well, she's kind of flaky,

798
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,633
but she's got her
hooks into West.

799
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,433
The only thing is, Clyde
doesn't take her seriously.

800
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,033
- So?

801
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,200
- Well, you know the case.

802
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,100
You know West.

803
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,133
I thought maybe you
could talk to her

804
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,733
and see if you could
figure out what she's got.

805
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
She's kind of exposed out there.

806
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,367
- What's in it for me?

807
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,533
- Apple pie.

808
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:56,667
- A la mode?

809
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,233
- One scoop.

810
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
- One scoop.

811
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:04,033
All right, bring her by.

812
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:04,433
- All right.

813
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:05,467
Louise?

814
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,667
- Okay, now I recommended
you with the agency.

815
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,533
You're gonna have to tell me
if you're getting anywhere.

816
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,067
- Listen, listen.

817
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,933
I got a great idea.

818
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,800
David is a believer in
psychic stuff.

819
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,500
Cindy was psychic.

820
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,433
- Nevermind about the psychic.

821
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:13,267
Just tell me if you're
getting anyplace.

822
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,400
- Will you just listen to me,
Tom?

823
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,467
Okay, I'm gonna tell David
that I've had this dream,

824
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,033
like he's in danger, you know?

825
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,700
And then the next time
that I go and pick him up,

826
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:22,400
you drive by and you fire a gun.

827
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,500
Not at us, but I mean
like in the air, okay?

828
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,000
And then he'll think I
have it, really have it.

829
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:28,767
- This is crazy.

830
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,333
This is...

831
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,333
This is really crazy.

832
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,500
You didn't put this in
your report, did you?

833
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,633
- Hey, it was just an idea.

834
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,433
I'm just trying to be creative.

835
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:36,833
- It sounds like you're
desperate to me.

836
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,433
- Maybe I should be taping it.

837
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,300
(horn honks)

838
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,167
- Theresa.

839
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,700
- David.

840
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,200
It's David.

841
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,500
You play along with me,
all right?

842
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,433
Hi.

843
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:48,600
- How are you?

844
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,667
Hey, look at you.

845
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,567
- I look awful.

846
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,467
- You do not.

847
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,400
- This is my
brother-in-law Sonny.

848
00:41:58,367 --> 00:41:59,400
- Well, hello, Sonny.

849
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,800
Theresa told me about you.

850
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,667
- Oh, yeah?

851
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,767
Yeah, she mentioned you.

852
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,200
- Great.

853
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,667
Hey, how about you and your
wife having dinner some night

854
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,533
with me and Theresa
over at my place?

855
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,500
- Oh, Sammi would love that.

856
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,700
You know how she loves to
go out, Sonny.

857
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,700
- I fix a pretty good
Mongolian lamb.

858
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,367
How about Saturday?

859
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,133
- Saturday?

860
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:22,933
Uh.

861
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,200
- I think Saturday
would be fine.

862
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:25,467
- [Tom] I don't know.

863
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,667
- [Kim] I'll work on him.

864
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,167
- Saturday.

865
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,067
Hey.

866
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,267
Well, good.

867
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,167
Nice to meet you.

868
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:38,167
Saturday it is.

869
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:44,400
(engine starts)

870
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,100
- [Kim] Bye, David!

871
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,500
See you Saturday!

872
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,100
- Damn it, you are careless,
Kim.

873
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,333
We should not have
been out here.

874
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,167
- I thought that worked
out pretty good, Sonny.

875
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,633
- What is this
brother-in-law crap?

876
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,100
- That's what I told him why I
can't invite him to my house.

877
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:01,033
I live with this pig of
a brother-in-law Sonny.

878
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:01,600
You'll be perfect, huh?

879
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:02,467
- No, no.

880
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,133
No, I am absolutely not
going to dinner

881
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,300
pretending to be some hood.

882
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,733
- You gonna blow my cover, Tom?

883
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:07,700
Is that what you want, huh?

884
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:10,367
If I tell Clyde that
you can't pull it off,

885
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,067
he won't let you fetch
his cigarettes anymore.

886
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,300
(Kim laughs)

887
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,200
- [Tom] Kim.

888
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:17,667
- Don't forget, Sammi.

889
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,133
You're different when
you're around Sonny.

890
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,467
You're quiet, subdued.

891
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,633
- Where'd you come up
with this mafia?

892
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,867
What was the idea of that?

893
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,033
- Well, didn't you say that
the Campbell murders were like,

894
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,267
you know, executions,
like professional?

895
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,400
- Yeah.

896
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,533
- Okay, so maybe Cindy had
somebody hire some hitmen.

897
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,367
Maybe David is the one who
did the hiring.

898
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,433
Did you ever think of that?

899
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:35,300
- This is crazy.

900
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,100
It's absolutely crazy.

901
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:36,633
Crazy, Kim.

902
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:37,567
- Theresa, Theresa.

903
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,800
You gotta remember to
call her Theresa.

904
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,533
- Hey, would you watch your
mouth when you're talking to me?

905
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,467
You're gonna end up
with cement shoes.

906
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,800
(laughing)

907
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,367
- This is never gonna work, Kim.

908
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,233
I mean, Theresa.

909
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:51,633
This is never gonna work.

910
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,233
(laughs) No.

911
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:55,533
- I don't believe in free will.

912
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,400
I mean, it looks like you
have a choice,

913
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,300
but when you examine,
really examine it,

914
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,633
you see one thing leads to
another the only way it could've.

915
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,500
I mean, all history's inevitable

916
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:07,200
'cause it goes through
the trouble of happening.

917
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,533
May sound kind of fatalist.

918
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,533
- [Tom] Sounds dumb.

919
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,400
That's what it sounds like.

920
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,567
- You believe in free will then?

921
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,667
- Oh, nothing's free,
including this dinner.

922
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,833
- Now, what price do
you see yourself

923
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:22,133
paying for this dinner?

924
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,800
- Well, I gotta sit here
and listen to you go on

925
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,100
about all this stuff you
don't know nothing about.

926
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,200
Why don't you two broads
go powder something?

927
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,567
- [Sammi] Sonny.

928
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,533
- [Tom] Go on, beat it.

929
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:52,067
- You certainly have a way
with the ladies, Sonny.

930
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,600
- West, don't use
sarcasm with me.

931
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,233
It ain't gonna work.

932
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:59,700
What I want to know
about is what you

933
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,500
have in mind with my
sister-in-law.

934
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,600
- I intend to marry Theresa.

935
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,367
I respect your position,
your feelings,

936
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,700
and how you're
protective about her,

937
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:12,633
but I'm gonna take care of her.

938
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,500
Now, this house is my
property and I can fix it up

939
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:15,533
and get a very good price.

940
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,100
Theresa and me didn't have any
choice but to meet each other

941
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,367
and we have no choice but to
keep on knowing each other.

942
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,133
I don't know how it is
with you and Sammi,

943
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,133
but that's how it is with
Theresa and me.

944
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,533
- We'll be out in the car, okay?

945
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,667
Oh, and thank you, David.

946
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,567
Goodnight.

947
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:41,733
Theresa will join us
in a moment.

948
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,733
That guy's nuts.

949
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,200
He did it, I really
think he did it.

950
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:47,533
- Uh-uh.

951
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:48,167
No way.

952
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,267
- What do you mean no way?

953
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,433
- Oh, he's out to lunch all
right, but not that way.

954
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:52,500
Want to know what he told me?

955
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:53,067
- What?

956
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,800
- He wants to marry her.

957
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:54,533
- Oh, my god.

958
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:55,400
- Oh, yeah.

959
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,233
You wanna know what else?

960
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,133
- What?

961
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,267
- They have no choice, he says.

962
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,700
- What?

963
00:45:58,733 --> 00:45:59,667
- No choice.

964
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:07,267
- David, shouldn't you
have asked, well,

965
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,633
spoken to me before you
spoke to him?

966
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,067
- I don't think I did
anything wrong.

967
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,400
I love you, Theresa.

968
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:15,700
- I know, but what I'm saying
is shouldn't you have--

969
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:16,700
- Do you?

970
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:17,700
Do you really know?

971
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Do you really know I love you?

972
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,067
I wanna marry you.

973
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:24,800
When I have to, I can
get things done.

974
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,067
I do not intend to
deliver blueprints

975
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,700
for the rest of my life.

976
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:30,533
Take this house, fix it up,
and sell it.

977
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:32,600
We can do whatever we
want to do with the money.

978
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:35,400
Have a life, family.

979
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:37,600
You and me.

980
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,100
(water rushing)

981
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:01,433
- He asked me to marry him,
Sammi.

982
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,633
Isn't that something?

983
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,000
I mean, a lot of guys
have hit on me,

984
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,300
but the first time I get the
white picket fence proposal

985
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,133
and I'm pretending to be
somebody else.

986
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:22,233
- Kim, why don't you just
forget this whole thing?

987
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:26,333
- What, tell him I changed
my name to Kim Paris

988
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:28,267
and you got divorced from Sonny?

989
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,567
- You don't have to
tell him anything.

990
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,233
Not a thing.

991
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,800
We could just split.

992
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,767
I'm not exactly
doing great here.

993
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:40,533
- Mm-mm.

994
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,233
- You're getting serious about
this guy, aren't you, Kim?

995
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,833
Aren't you?

996
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:52,533
- Kim isn't.

997
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,633
I'm not so sure about Theresa.

998
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:07,367
(people chattering)

999
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,267
Excuse me.

1000
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:13,733
Watch it.

1001
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:29,600
(metal banging)

1002
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,333
Do you know where
Sergeant Halsey is?

1003
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,500
Halsey.

1004
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:36,400
- Halsey, he's banging on
that typewriter over there.

1005
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:37,267
That's right.

1006
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,133
You're quite welcome.

1007
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,267
- [Dan] Piece of junk.

1008
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:48,667
- Sergeant Halsey, Kim Paris
from the Clyde Wilson Agency.

1009
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:51,667
How do you want me, sitting,
standing?

1010
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,367
- I don't know if I
want you at all.

1011
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,300
All right, all right.

1012
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,667
What do you got on David West?

1013
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:04,267
- I think he knows a
lot about Cindy Campbell

1014
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,500
and about her parents.

1015
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,100
- Well, no kidding.

1016
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,500
That couldn't be because
he was shacked up with her

1017
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,033
for two years, now could it?

1018
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:19,033
- He lied to me about the way
the Campbells were killed.

1019
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,700
He said they were
better people dead.

1020
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,133
- Did he tell you who shot 'em?

1021
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,033
- [Kim] No.

1022
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:24,267
No, he didn't say
anything like that.

1023
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,233
- Well, what do you think?

1024
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:26,167
What do you think?

1025
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,867
- Me?

1026
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,700
- Yeah, you, Miss Private Eye.

1027
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,533
What is your
professional opinion?

1028
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,300
- I don't know.

1029
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,733
I don't think that David.

1030
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:36,700
- Well, let me ask you this.

1031
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,200
How long have you been
shacked up with David West?

1032
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,300
- I'm not shacked up
with David West.

1033
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,467
- I hear tell that he
wants to marry you.

1034
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,033
Now, why would a weirdo
like David West

1035
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:52,333
want to marry you, Ms. Paris?

1036
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,500
- I think he's in love with me.

1037
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,367
- Oh, in love.

1038
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,433
Oh, well sure.

1039
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:56,233
Now, I see.

1040
00:49:57,533 --> 00:50:00,600
In order to prove his
love to you,

1041
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,600
he's gonna confess to
the Campbell murders.

1042
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,500
Is that it?

1043
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,067
Okay.

1044
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,167
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1045
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,333
Okay, okay.

1046
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,600
So he's not sleeping with you.

1047
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:11,667
You're not sleeping with him.

1048
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,800
Why not?

1049
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,933
- Because I don't want to.

1050
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,067
- [Dan] Oh, and what does
he have to say about that?

1051
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,300
Wait a minute.

1052
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,367
Has he got you pegged for some
kind of virgin or something?

1053
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,367
- I don't know why you're
talking to me like this.

1054
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,133
- Oh, you don't.

1055
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:22,933
- [Kim] No.

1056
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:24,800
- Well, I'll tell you why,
darling.

1057
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,600
Because I'm a cop and
I don't trust

1058
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:28,800
private detectives in general

1059
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,367
and I don't trust Clyde
Wilson in particular.

1060
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,033
And I especially don't like
it when he sticks some bimbo

1061
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,100
out on the street who thinks
that all she has to do

1062
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,133
is flash a little skin and
she can get a confession

1063
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,733
out of every punk that
she comes across!

1064
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:44,833
- [Man] Go, go, yeah.
(people applauding)

1065
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,500
- Well, that'll teach her, Dan.

1066
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,833
Coming in trying to
cooperate with the police.

1067
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:49,733
- [Dan] Butt out.

1068
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,167
- Hey, hey.

1069
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,567
You don't need this
stinking job.

1070
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,467
I mean, it's Looney Tunes.

1071
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,233
You don't even know
what your name is.

1072
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,533
Quit the case.

1073
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:02,500
- Well, what am I gonna
do about David?

1074
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,300
I can't just run out on him.

1075
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,833
(pan clatters)

1076
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:07,333
- Run out on him?

1077
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,400
What is the matter with you,
Kim?

1078
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,367
You'd be doing him 50
different kinds of a favor

1079
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,567
if you ran out on him.

1080
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,033
You've been lying to that boy
since the day you met him.

1081
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,133
- That's not true.

1082
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:18,200
That's not all true.

1083
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:21,733
God, Sammi.

1084
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,700
What am I gonna do?

1085
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:29,567
- How about tell him the truth,
Kim?

1086
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,200
What would be wrong with that?

1087
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:36,567
(subdued music)

1088
00:51:41,267 --> 00:51:43,167
- [David] I talked to a real
estate lady about the house.

1089
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,400
She said with a little fixing up

1090
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:47,700
I could get maybe 60,
65 grand for it.

1091
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:50,700
Hey, what's wrong?

1092
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,600
Look at me.

1093
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,200
Talk to me.

1094
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:56,367
You can talk to me.

1095
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
- David, I have to go
away for a while.

1096
00:51:58,433 --> 00:51:59,333
- [David] I think we should.

1097
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,033
I think we should go to Mexico.

1098
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,833
The way the peso is, we could
live there good a long time.

1099
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:03,767
I know guys who've done that.

1100
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,100
- No, I mean on my own.

1101
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,300
- [David] Why do you
have to do that?

1102
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,200
- I just do.

1103
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,033
I have to get things straight.

1104
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:14,800
- What's not straight?

1105
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,700
Is this about Cindy?

1106
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,700
I told you there's nothing
between Cindy and me.

1107
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:19,600
It is over.

1108
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:22,067
Oh, trust me.

1109
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:29,033
There are a lot of things
I wanna talk to you about

1110
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:30,200
and have you understand.

1111
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:39,233
But I need you to, you know,
make some kind of a commitment.

1112
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,200
- No, I can't.

1113
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:44,500
Not now, not yet.

1114
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,300
I need time.

1115
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,533
- But what if you go away and
I never hear from you again?

1116
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,200
- You will.

1117
00:52:58,233 --> 00:52:59,433
I wouldn't do that.

1118
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:01,767
- I love you, Theresa.

1119
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,167
Why do you have to go away?

1120
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,700
- David, you have to believe me.

1121
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:10,600
I'm all confused about things.

1122
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:17,000
My feelings, who I am,
all kinds of things.

1123
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:19,633
I gotta get things straight.

1124
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,300
I just, I have to.

1125
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:26,700
- All right.

1126
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,267
All right.

1127
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:35,833
Well, when you're
figuring all this out,

1128
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,533
just remember I love you.

1129
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,233
(subdued music)

1130
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,367
- And I love you.

1131
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:56,600
- Oh, then why do you
have to go away?

1132
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,300
- I don't know.

1133
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:07,533
I don't know.

1134
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:41,567
- So, did you do it?

1135
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,467
Did you tell him?

1136
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:44,333
- I said...

1137
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,667
I said that I loved him, Sammi.

1138
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,767
I couldn't help myself.

1139
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:03,500
- Well, you better start,
Kim, 'cause you got company

1140
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,433
and I don't think
they're here to help you.

1141
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:12,533
- So, how come all of a
sudden this jerk believes me?

1142
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,300
- [Posey] Well, Sergeant
Halsey was just

1143
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:14,967
testing you first time, Kim.

1144
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,300
- No, he wasn't testing me.

1145
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,467
He was insulting me
and he was enjoying it.

1146
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,133
- Yeah, I was a little
rough on you, Ms. Paris.

1147
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,500
Just one of those bad days,
you know?

1148
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,633
- Ms. Paris.

1149
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:25,467
- Thing is, Kim.

1150
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,233
You're the best thing
they've got.

1151
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,733
The Campbell case has
been on hold--

1152
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,933
- No such thing.

1153
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:32,600
We've been waiting for the
Campbell will to be probated.

1154
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,467
Now, as soon as they
divide up the estate,

1155
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,467
we'll follow the money, see if
any of it goes to David West.

1156
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,533
- Which could take a
year or more.

1157
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,533
In the meantime, you are
the only thing they've got,

1158
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:47,233
no matter what
Sergeant Halsey says.

1159
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:48,633
And the reason he's here now,

1160
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,533
is that he can set you
up with a wire.

1161
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,667
See what you can get
out of David.

1162
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,800
- You want me to record him?

1163
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,333
- Well, as I recall,

1164
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,267
you thought that you
could get West to talk.

1165
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,133
You know, on account of
him being in love with you

1166
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:08,267
and you never having
slept with him.

1167
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,400
- Kim, don't let him talk
to you that way.

1168
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:17,467
- Most likely be a waste
of your time and mine, too.

1169
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:24,333
Unless you really got
something going with this guy.

1170
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:28,500
Course, you're the only
one who'd know about that.

1171
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,633
So, do you or don't you?

1172
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,567
Tell me you do.

1173
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,633
I'll believe you.

1174
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,733
- Yeah, I got something going.

1175
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,133
- [Dan] Okay, now you gotta
push both of these down

1176
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:01,700
for it to record.

1177
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:02,333
- [Kim] Mm-hmm.

1178
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:03,300
- Are you listening to me?

1179
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,833
You gotta push both of
'em down, all right?

1180
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,333
Now, here.

1181
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:09,200
You gotta make sure the
microphone stays in the clear.

1182
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:10,800
All right, all right, let's go.

1183
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,667
Say something.

1184
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,200
- Sergeant Halsey is a pig.

1185
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,367
- How's that?

1186
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,067
- [Man On Radio] Repeating,
Sergeant Halsey is a pig.

1187
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,367
- All right, let's go.

1188
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,800
Come on.

1189
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,700
Now remember, it's no good
if you do all the talking.

1190
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:30,467
He can't just sit there
and yes and no ya.

1191
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,033
You understand?

1192
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:34,100
It's gotta come out
of his mouth.

1193
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:35,800
It's gotta be in his words.

1194
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:37,033
- Of course.

1195
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:38,200
Do you think I'm trying
to frame him?

1196
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:39,367
- I'm just explaining.

1197
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,300
- Kim, we'll be here
just in case.

1198
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:44,467
- In case of what?

1199
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:48,233
I don't have anything to
fear from David.

1200
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,633
He's the one that's in danger.

1201
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,433
(subdued music)

1202
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,167
(car horn honks)

1203
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,167
(car horn honking)

1204
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,067
(tires squealing)

1205
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:26,500
- Remind me to have her license
revoked after this is over.

1206
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:28,433
This is Halsey, you
guys hanging in?

1207
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:29,500
- [Man On Radio] Hanging in,
Sergeant.

1208
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:30,400
Hanging in.

1209
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:46,267
(exhaling rapidly)

1210
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,333
- Hey, Dave.

1211
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:50,233
What's the idea behind all
that stuff you're doing?

1212
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:52,200
I mean, I see these old
Chinese guys on the TV

1213
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:53,800
going after it and they just
look like they're trying

1214
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,633
to hack their way through
some kind of imaginary jungle.

1215
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,467
- That's exactly it, Steve.

1216
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,267
System for getting
through the jungle.

1217
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,567
And this teaches you
how to stay in the now.

1218
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,667
The big now, no past, no future.

1219
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,500
That's how you survive
in the jungle.

1220
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:10,367
- [Steve] Wow, man.

1221
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,700
That's pretty deep.

1222
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:14,133
You ought to write
fortune cookies.

1223
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:14,700
Hey, Theresa.

1224
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:15,800
- [David] Theresa.

1225
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,033
- [Steve] You should've
been here, man.

1226
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,500
It was a real
learning experience.

1227
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:21,100
- It's so good to see you.

1228
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,567
I didn't know when you'd
get it straightened out.

1229
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,667
- David, we have to talk.

1230
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:27,700
- What's wrong?

1231
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,033
- I'm in the big now, man.

1232
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:33,633
- [Dan] Jimmy.

1233
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,200
- Hey, man.

1234
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:36,067
Signal's clean.

1235
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,400
- Okay, good.

1236
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:38,533
Sit over here.

1237
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:47,200
- What's wrong?

1238
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,067
Tell me what it is.

1239
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:50,433
- David, why did you lie to me?

1240
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,267
- What about?

1241
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,333
- About Cindy's parents.

1242
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:56,267
They weren't killed in
a car accident.

1243
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,667
- How were they killed?

1244
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,200
- [Kim] They were
shot in their bed

1245
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,067
in front of their grandchildren.

1246
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,800
Shot three times each
by two people

1247
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,267
who've never been arrested.

1248
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:07,733
- She's got some guts.

1249
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:09,400
- [David] How did you
find that out?

1250
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,667
- I checked in the newspapers.

1251
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,400
It took a lot of looking,
but it was there.

1252
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:15,600
- Oh, what made you do that,
Theresa?

1253
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,133
- [Kim] I didn't believe
what you told me.

1254
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:17,833
- Why?

1255
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:18,833
- Because you lied to me.

1256
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:20,200
- How'd you know I lied to you?

1257
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,400
- I don't know how I knew.

1258
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,233
I can't explain
everything like you can.

1259
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,133
I don't know.

1260
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:27,300
Is just something I could feel.

1261
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,267
I never thought I'd find out
that they'd been murdered.

1262
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,633
- The way they died
doesn't change the fact

1263
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,500
that they deserved to.

1264
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,400
I didn't lie about that.

1265
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:34,400
- I don't care about them.

1266
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:35,067
I don't know them.

1267
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,133
It's you I know.

1268
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,700
Now, you say you want us
to be together.

1269
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,200
You say you want me
to trust you.

1270
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:40,533
How is that gonna happen
if you're gonna

1271
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,300
lie to me about
something like that?

1272
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:05,233
- You have really good
instincts, don't you?

1273
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,333
I mean, I kept asking
myself why you went

1274
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:09,400
on and on about Cindy.

1275
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,433
You weren't picking up any
kind of interest from me.

1276
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,500
- We've become very close,
David.

1277
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:16,300
Now, there was something
and I could sense it.

1278
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:19,067
I thought it was about
you and Cindy.

1279
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,333
I knew you weren't telling
me everything about her.

1280
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:23,200
I thought maybe you were
still involved with her.

1281
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:24,067
Maybe.

1282
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:24,733
- Oh, no, no.

1283
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:26,267
- Then what was it?

1284
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,833
What made you tell me that lie?

1285
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,633
You don't have to lie to me,
David.

1286
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,133
- Cindy got a bad deal.

1287
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,233
A real bad deal.

1288
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:55,567
By the time I met her, she
was all lost and gone to Hell.

1289
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,733
And I went there, too, to
try and bring her back.

1290
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:00,033
Sounds kind of melodramatic,
doesn't it?

1291
01:02:00,067 --> 01:02:02,100
I went to Hell to
bring her back.

1292
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,333
But it's the truth.

1293
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,533
Where Cindy lived was Hell.

1294
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:16,500
Her father...

1295
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,167
had been molesting her
since she was a child.

1296
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,467
The family knew and
nobody did anything.

1297
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,133
I guess, while he was
doing it to Cindy,

1298
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,300
he wasn't doing it to them.

1299
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,267
You'd think they'd be on her
side, but they hated her.

1300
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:38,433
But she hated herself.

1301
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,167
She blamed herself.

1302
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,733
(subdued music)

1303
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:46,733
It's like when you
ran out of gas.

1304
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,467
Oh, I'd get her to agree
to stop seeing him,

1305
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,667
but there was always some
excuse why she couldn't stop.

1306
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,733
She'd just lie there.

1307
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:00,467
So, what could I do?

1308
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:02,467
What could I do?

1309
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,600
Oh, you have any idea how
angry that can make you

1310
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,200
when somebody you care
about is dying

1311
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:09,167
and they won't try to get well,
won't even want to get well?

1312
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,367
- Why didn't you leave her?

1313
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,167
- I couldn't do that, Theresa.

1314
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,233
When you go into
something like that,

1315
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,167
you have to see it through.

1316
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,033
I told you I was that way.

1317
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:17,167
When I commit, it's
the whole way.

1318
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,067
- But you got her to stop.

1319
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,433
Stop with her father, right?

1320
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:23,100
Right?

1321
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,533
- Well, I took her away
from all that,

1322
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:29,267
but I didn't take all
that away from her.

1323
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,200
You see, it gets to be
a part of you.

1324
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:35,467
How you feel, how you are.

1325
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:39,400
Cindy never got away
from the way she felt.

1326
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:40,300
She put it onto me.

1327
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,333
You know what I'm saying?

1328
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:51,167
Um...

1329
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:57,233
She didn't want me
to punish her.

1330
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:03,667
I would and then I'd have
to forgive her.

1331
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:08,133
Well,

1332
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:14,300
I got a picture in here
that comes in my head.

1333
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:20,567
Like somebody switched on
a light and I can see her

1334
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,033
and I can see him doing
what he wants.

1335
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:23,767
Anything he wants.

1336
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,133
- [Kim] Oh.

1337
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,500
- [David] You know what
I'm saying, don't you?

1338
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:27,833
- Why didn't you get
her out of there?

1339
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,300
- You ever been any place
you just didn't

1340
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,700
know who you were, Theresa?

1341
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:31,833
- David, I think you
should leave.

1342
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,167
- I did, I did leave.

1343
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
I got out, she got out.

1344
01:04:34,233 --> 01:04:35,067
We had to.

1345
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,033
You understand that, don't you,
Theresa?

1346
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:36,700
(knocking on door)

1347
01:04:36,733 --> 01:04:37,567
- Hey, y'all.

1348
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,433
I got some nose candy.

1349
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:39,200
- Steve, get out!

1350
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:40,033
Get out!

1351
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:41,433
- I'm just offering some blow,
man.

1352
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,100
- Where are you going?

1353
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,100
- I have to get out.

1354
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,700
- It's 'cause of what
I told you, isn't it?

1355
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:48,900
- You didn't tell me anything.

1356
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:50,800
- It's about Cindy and me and
you hate me because of it.

1357
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,267
- I don't hate you, David.

1358
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,433
- Oh, but you don't love me.

1359
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:54,333
- You.

1360
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:55,500
- I can see it in your face.

1361
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:56,300
- You don't know me.

1362
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,067
You don't know
what's in my face.

1363
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,300
- Cindy, wait a minute.

1364
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,267
You want me to trust you?

1365
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,233
I want you to trust me.

1366
01:05:02,267 --> 01:05:03,167
That's why I told you.

1367
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,400
- It doesn't matter about trust.

1368
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,533
Who am I that you should
want me to trust you?

1369
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:09,600
- You're Theresa and I love you.

1370
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:14,267
Theresa.

1371
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,167
- She chickened out.

1372
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:15,867
- [David] Theresa, wait.

1373
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,200
- The broad has chickened out.

1374
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:18,433
- Theresa, where are you going?

1375
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:20,433
- I don't care about Cindy, I
don't care about her father.

1376
01:05:20,467 --> 01:05:22,033
- Or me, or us.

1377
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:24,200
You don't care about us.

1378
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,033
You asked me to tell you
about Cindy, so I tell you,

1379
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:27,467
and all of a sudden you
just don't wanna know.

1380
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,133
- David, let go of me.

1381
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,167
- [David] No, wait.

1382
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,033
- Where are you going?

1383
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:32,200
- [Posey] I think
she's in trouble.

1384
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:32,867
- Shh, shh, shh.

1385
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,700
- What are you waiting for?

1386
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:34,700
- Sit your butt down.

1387
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:35,833
- [Posey] We've gotta
get her out of there.

1388
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:36,700
- Listen, just listen.

1389
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,533
- He's in the car with her.

1390
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,067
- I know he's in the
car with her.

1391
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,133
Shut up.

1392
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,433
- I didn't know what it
was between you and Cindy.

1393
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:48,567
I mean, I didn't get it,
about the thing about

1394
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,333
her parents being killed and
found her dead in the car.

1395
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:53,600
It doesn't even matter because

1396
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,400
I'm just sorry for
Cindy and for you.

1397
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:58,633
- Okay, Theresa.
- I'm sorry for us, for me.

1398
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,367
- Theresa.
- David.

1399
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:05,367
- I killed them.

1400
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,733
- You shot 'em?

1401
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:25,300
- The only thing I could do
for her after everything else.

1402
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:32,500
She was still the same Cindy,
she just looked different.

1403
01:06:34,733 --> 01:06:37,100
She was chained to herself,
her old self.

1404
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,567
I broke it.

1405
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:44,433
- You?

1406
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,400
You yourself?

1407
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:49,433
- Well, she couldn't.

1408
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:53,700
You couldn't expect her to.

1409
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:55,133
- [Kim] No, she couldn't.

1410
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:58,500
- Well, I'll be.

1411
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,300
- She did it.

1412
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,267
She did it.

1413
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,500
(David breathing heavily)

1414
01:07:12,467 --> 01:07:15,400
- I told you.

1415
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:16,367
I told you.

1416
01:07:21,267 --> 01:07:22,233
Oh, tell me.

1417
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:23,100
- [Kim] Yes.

1418
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:24,067
- Just tell me it'll be--

1419
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,033
- Yeah.

1420
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:27,133
Yeah, it's gonna be all right.

1421
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,167
It's gonna be all right.

1422
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:33,667
It's gonna be all right.

1423
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,767
David.

1424
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:47,667
David.

1425
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,367
(subdued music)

1426
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:09,200
(Kim sobbing)

1427
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,533
I have to go.

1428
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,433
- No, just don't go right now.

1429
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:43,533
- No, come on.

1430
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:44,600
It's okay.

1431
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:45,567
I have to...

1432
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,567
I have to...

1433
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:52,567
I have to think
about everything.

1434
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:58,133
Okay?

1435
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
Okay?

1436
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:05,400
- I can't believe I told you.

1437
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,400
I love you.

1438
01:09:08,267 --> 01:09:10,333
I couldn't have told you.

1439
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:12,533
- I know.

1440
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:17,667
I know, but it's a lot, David.

1441
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:26,100
It's a weight and I
have to let it sink in.

1442
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:30,233
- It's gonna drive you away.

1443
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,433
- No, it isn't.

1444
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,100
- I love you.

1445
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,667
- I love you, too.

1446
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:59,767
- I've given it to you, my life.

1447
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,567
You know that, don't you?

1448
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,667
(car engine starts)

1449
01:10:36,867 --> 01:10:39,433
(tense music)

1450
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,600
Drive safe.

1451
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,433
(tires squealing)

1452
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:01,267
(retching)

1453
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:29,000
(people chattering)

1454
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,433
- DA's in with the grand
jury playing the tape.

1455
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:42,533
Won't be long after that.

1456
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:47,267
Once they hear him say it,
that's it.

1457
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,000
(subdued music)

1458
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:39,133
- I don't have any time
for this right now.

1459
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:42,500
- You did it, kid.

1460
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:44,700
They indicted him.

1461
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:48,600
Hey.

1462
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:50,767
Hey, hey, I wanna tell
you something.

1463
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,400
For what it's worth,
you were good.

1464
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,267
Better than good.

1465
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,633
I've never seen it done better.

1466
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,567
- Yeah, think I can
make a career out of it?

1467
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,033
- I think you could do
just about anything

1468
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:04,433
you set your mind to.

1469
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,333
- Since when did you
start giving compliments

1470
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:08,267
to bimbos from private
detective agencies?

1471
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,200
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1472
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:11,433
You caught me on a bummer
that first time.

1473
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,767
My old lady walked out on me
just a couple days before.

1474
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,833
- I don't know the old lady,

1475
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:16,733
but she made the right choice,
Halsey.

1476
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,433
- Well, if Kim is finished here,

1477
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:22,467
I'm gonna bring her back
to the office.

1478
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,400
Clyde wants to see you.

1479
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:24,467
- In a minute, in a minute.

1480
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,533
- Hey, you got your case.

1481
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,233
Ease up.

1482
01:13:26,267 --> 01:13:27,300
- I really need to talk to you.

1483
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:30,000
- Thanks, Tom.

1484
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,400
- We'll see you at
the elevators.

1485
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:37,067
- What is it, Halsey?

1486
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,100
You wanna get together for
drinks and discuss my prospects

1487
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:42,133
now that the old lady
walked out on you?

1488
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:48,433
- The DA wants you to see
David again with a wire on.

1489
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,333
- You just said that the
grand jury indicted him.

1490
01:13:51,367 --> 01:13:52,300
- No question, got him cold.

1491
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,233
- So?

1492
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:56,200
- So, we can't indict Cindy,

1493
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:58,433
not with what he said
on those tapes.

1494
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,500
- But with what you have,

1495
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:00,833
you can get him to tell
you the rest.

1496
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:01,700
- Sure, we can.

1497
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:02,700
And then the second he
gets a lawyer,

1498
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:04,567
he'll plea bargain his
testimony against Cindy.

1499
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,067
- Plea bargain for what?

1500
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,600
- For not getting the needle.

1501
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:12,367
(subdued music)

1502
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:25,167
- They want the death penalty?

1503
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,267
- Two counts capital
premeditated for-gain homicide.

1504
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,233
Now, that gets you the big
ticket in Texas, honey.

1505
01:14:30,267 --> 01:14:31,433
- He didn't do it for the money.

1506
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,367
- Hey, we don't know that.

1507
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,433
We don't know why he did it.

1508
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:35,133
All we know is what he told you.

1509
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:36,500
And most of what he told you,

1510
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:39,233
Cindy told him and she
lies about everything.

1511
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:44,233
We got no proof that her
father ever laid a hand on her.

1512
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,267
(tense music)

1513
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,367
You, uh...

1514
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:57,200
You never did see
what little David

1515
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:58,567
did to those people, did ya?

1516
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,267
- I'm sure we can get
this thing on Crackdown.

1517
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,500
She's coming in to see me

1518
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:51,800
and I'll explain everything
she needs to know.

1519
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:53,267
- [Man On Phone] Clyde,
you gotta get her--

1520
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,233
- Oh, I understand.

1521
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:57,033
Just so you understand
when the time comes,

1522
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:58,300
I wanna make the announcement

1523
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,067
about the agency's involvement.

1524
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,767
Yeah, sure.

1525
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:04,433
I'll take care of this

1526
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,100
and I know you'll take
care of your part.

1527
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,100
Yes, thank you.

1528
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:10,833
Well, sit down.

1529
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,700
Take the weight off those
lovely legs of yours.

1530
01:16:13,733 --> 01:16:15,433
- What do you wanna see
me about, Clyde?

1531
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:20,200
- Well, I wanted to tell
you you did a hell of a job

1532
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:21,467
and I'm real pleased.

1533
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:24,367
- I'm pleased you're pleased,
Clyde.

1534
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:27,400
- Well, the thing is,

1535
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:29,767
we got a little end or
two left untied.

1536
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:34,300
Seems they need for David
to really place Cindy

1537
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,600
at the scene of the crime

1538
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,633
before they bring
either of them in.

1539
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:42,033
- So, they can get the
death penalty for David.

1540
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:43,267
- Well, yeah.

1541
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,400
They wanna kill
somebody for this.

1542
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:50,567
Cindy would be a hard one being
a woman and all with kids.

1543
01:16:51,467 --> 01:16:53,667
Law's kind of sexist that way.

1544
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,500
- What if I won't do it?

1545
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:02,167
- Hell, that's just talk, yeah?

1546
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,233
You'll do it.

1547
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,600
This is your case.

1548
01:17:06,633 --> 01:17:08,567
It's not complete.

1549
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,067
- Feels pretty complete to me.

1550
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,033
- David fooled you, Kim.

1551
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:15,067
Had you thinking he was a
pretty nice guy.

1552
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:18,433
- What does this have to
do with anything?

1553
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,100
- Hell, you sounded more upset

1554
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:22,133
on those tapes than David did.

1555
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:24,100
I didn't even
recognize you on it.

1556
01:17:24,133 --> 01:17:25,233
- I caught him, didn't I?

1557
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:26,833
Does it matter how I sounded?

1558
01:17:26,867 --> 01:17:30,500
- Well, not to me, not to
the HPD, not to the DA,

1559
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,767
but how about to you, Kim?

1560
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:36,500
How about when you meet
David in court

1561
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:38,667
and you're sitting there
looking at him

1562
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,133
and those tapes are
saying you love him?

1563
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,033
- I had to say that.

1564
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:44,200
I don't love him.

1565
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,467
- That's what you wanna
be sure about.

1566
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,700
Seems kinda to me like
you fell for the guy.

1567
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:50,567
That's the way it sounded.

1568
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,333
Listen to those tapes.

1569
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,300
Listen, I'll tell you what, Kim.

1570
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:58,467
I think you'd do yourself
a power of help

1571
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,733
if you went back in
there cold as ice

1572
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:03,200
and tied a ribbon on this case.

1573
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:08,233
It sure would impress the hell
out of just about everybody.

1574
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,733
Might even make you feel
better about yourself.

1575
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,433
- Well, I'll just have
to see how much

1576
01:18:16,467 --> 01:18:18,300
better about myself
I wanna feel.

1577
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,933
- Yeah, and I want
you guys ready.

1578
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:31,033
Why don't you go ahead and
get in your cars, all right?

1579
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:34,067
(people chattering)

1580
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:44,400
- How's she doing?

1581
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,200
- How should she be doing?

1582
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,133
- Did you call him yet?

1583
01:19:03,633 --> 01:19:06,533
You know, we're gonna
be right there.

1584
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:10,400
No more than 10 seconds away.

1585
01:19:12,633 --> 01:19:14,533
You stay in public places.

1586
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:18,767
You don't go back to his place.

1587
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,800
That's a no-no.

1588
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,433
You give us a code.

1589
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:24,200
Something you'll say
that'll let us know

1590
01:19:24,233 --> 01:19:25,233
you want to get out.

1591
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:30,600
We'll be there.

1592
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,200
You understand?

1593
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,467
- Yeah, I understand.

1594
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:42,767
All right, just leave me alone.

1595
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:45,667
- Right.

1596
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,733
(door closes)

1597
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,367
(tense music)

1598
01:20:23,467 --> 01:20:24,433
- [David On Phone] Yeah?

1599
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,700
- David.

1600
01:20:26,733 --> 01:20:30,133
- [David On Phone] Oh, I
thought you weren't gonna call.

1601
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:30,700
God.

1602
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:34,167
Do you have any idea how
long a day is?

1603
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,000
- It's been a pretty long
day for me, too.

1604
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:43,367
- [David On Phone] I
wanna see you.

1605
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,700
- I thought we should talk.

1606
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:48,200
- [David On Phone] I
think we should do

1607
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:49,067
more than talk, Theresa.

1608
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,167
I'm not expecting sex, Theresa.

1609
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,067
Just...

1610
01:21:00,867 --> 01:21:02,100
Just some ears.

1611
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,800
I need that.

1612
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:06,667
Some ears.

1613
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:22,133
- Trick or treat, right?

1614
01:21:24,433 --> 01:21:25,300
- Oh, Kim.

1615
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,300
I don't want you to do this.

1616
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,367
You've done enough.

1617
01:21:30,233 --> 01:21:31,133
More.

1618
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:35,133
- He so much as makes a
move towards me

1619
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:37,300
and the cops will be
all over him.

1620
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:42,533
(uptempo music)

1621
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,233
- We need to know
where Cindy was.

1622
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:13,133
We want her exact location
at the time of the shooting.

1623
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:15,500
Was she in the room, was
she waiting in the car,

1624
01:22:15,533 --> 01:22:16,467
did she offer him money?

1625
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,267
All that kind of thing.

1626
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,400
Now, if you think
he's suspicious,

1627
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:21,633
if you think anything
is wrong, you just say--

1628
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:23,133
- I'll say I don't
want one of these

1629
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,833
just-add-water-and-stir
relationships.

1630
01:22:24,867 --> 01:22:26,600
That's a pretty good line.

1631
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:28,133
- Yeah.

1632
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:29,067
Yeah, okay.

1633
01:22:32,067 --> 01:22:34,500
Kim, one more thing.

1634
01:22:35,733 --> 01:22:39,133
You don't go back to his
place no matter what.

1635
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,567
When you leave the restaurant,
that's it.

1636
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,267
Whether he's told you about
Cindy or not, that's it.

1637
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,600
- You really care about
me, don't you, Sergeant?

1638
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,600
- I'm just doing my job.

1639
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:03,500
And my job is to see to
it that this punk

1640
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:04,667
doesn't kill anybody else.

1641
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,233
You leave the restaurant,
you turn into a liquor store,

1642
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:14,800
say you need a pack
of cigarettes.

1643
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,200
You get out of the car,
walk away.

1644
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:23,000
Don't look back.

1645
01:23:26,733 --> 01:23:27,600
Don't look back.

1646
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:41,433
- [Waiter] Smoking or
non-smoking?

1647
01:23:41,467 --> 01:23:42,333
- [Kim] Smoking.

1648
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,467
Thank you.

1649
01:23:50,367 --> 01:23:52,567
- Well, this is the
yuppie rip-off joint.

1650
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,833
- What, are you ashamed to be
seen in public with me, David?

1651
01:23:54,867 --> 01:23:55,667
- Yeah.

1652
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,267
Of course not, no.

1653
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,400
I just hate this kind of
pretentious dump.

1654
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:00,600
- [Waiter] Would you
care for anything

1655
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:01,867
from the bar before you order?

1656
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,167
- [Kim] We'll have a bottle of
dry white wine, a Chardonnay.

1657
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,467
- [Waiter] Very good, thank you.

1658
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,067
- Well, hey.

1659
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:08,833
You're making decisions tonight.

1660
01:24:08,867 --> 01:24:09,700
I like that.

1661
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:13,500
Long day today.

1662
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:15,467
Boy, it was a long one.

1663
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,833
I kept thinking, what
have I done?

1664
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:20,367
What have I done?

1665
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,300
I promised myself when
this business went down

1666
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,367
I wasn't gonna get put away.

1667
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,067
I'd check out first and
here I am handing my life

1668
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,600
over to this person that I love.

1669
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,367
I don't really know.

1670
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,300
You scared me, Theresa.

1671
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,433
I don't mind telling you.

1672
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,333
- Poor, dumb bastard.

1673
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,300
- You must've been scared
when Cindy knew.

1674
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,633
- Why?

1675
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:44,033
What was Cindy gonna do?

1676
01:24:45,733 --> 01:24:46,733
- I guess not.

1677
01:24:46,767 --> 01:24:48,500
Her being there and all.

1678
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:49,400
Was she?

1679
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,133
- Take it easy, Kim.

1680
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:55,033
Take it easy.

1681
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,000
- It's really all right, is it?

1682
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:14,267
I mean, you've accepted it,
that I did it.

1683
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,600
- What was that you once said?

1684
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:18,733
Things are inevitable
once they've gone

1685
01:25:18,767 --> 01:25:20,667
through the trouble
of happening.

1686
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,600
- Right.

1687
01:25:21,633 --> 01:25:22,600
Yes, right.

1688
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:25,100
I think I found my
first disciple.

1689
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:27,033
- Wasn't Cindy your first?

1690
01:25:27,067 --> 01:25:31,033
- Oh, Cindy never knew
what I was talking about.

1691
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:33,033
She wasn't smart like you.

1692
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:35,700
- She was smart enough to get
you to do what she wanted.

1693
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,333
- Something like that.

1694
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,467
Something as big as that's
gonna change your life.

1695
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,667
Nothing's gonna be the same.

1696
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,667
You don't let anybody else
make those decisions for you.

1697
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:55,167
- You mean, it was your idea?

1698
01:25:57,433 --> 01:25:58,767
- No, I'm saying...

1699
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:10,633
I did it as much for me
as I did for her.

1700
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,167
I take responsibility
for my actions.

1701
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:19,100
If I ever have to live this
life again, I got no complaints.

1702
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:21,567
It's my philosophy, stay
in the now and no regrets.

1703
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:25,133
- Yeah, but whose idea was it?

1704
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:33,133
- Cindy begged me to
do it and I wanted to.

1705
01:26:36,067 --> 01:26:38,367
I saw it was the only thing
that could set her free.

1706
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,600
So, I made sure she was
right there beside me

1707
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:44,067
so it was hers as well.

1708
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:46,500
It was like I was her arm.

1709
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,467
I pulled the trigger, but
she planned it.

1710
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,333
- The girl's a genius.

1711
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,833
We got 'em both.

1712
01:26:57,867 --> 01:27:00,200
- And her kids didn't
recognize her?

1713
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:04,100
- No, she'd run out the
door and had a mask on.

1714
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,667
I didn't know they were
gonna be there.

1715
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,433
When you start on
something like that,

1716
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:14,300
you've got nothing but
nerve to see you through.

1717
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,433
I was in my soldier mode.

1718
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:23,300
You have no idea how it feels.

1719
01:27:27,633 --> 01:27:29,233
To be able to talk about it.

1720
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:32,433
- Did Cindy offer you any money?

1721
01:27:32,467 --> 01:27:33,367
- Yeah.

1722
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,833
That was the bit that
really bugged me.

1723
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:35,667
- [Kim] How much?

1724
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:36,533
- A lot.

1725
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:37,400
It bothered me a lot.

1726
01:27:37,433 --> 01:27:38,533
- I mean, how much money?

1727
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,533
- 25,000.

1728
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,233
It just confused things.

1729
01:27:45,267 --> 01:27:48,333
Made it not clear why I
was doing it.

1730
01:27:48,367 --> 01:27:52,500
I had to think about it,
keep things separate.

1731
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,533
- How much did you get?

1732
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:57,667
- Nothing, I didn't
get any money.

1733
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,300
It's all tied up in the estate.

1734
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:01,967
I'm not gonna touch it.

1735
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,700
I mean, it just makes
things different.

1736
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,433
I didn't do it for the money.

1737
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:14,100
Anyway, the cops will be
waiting for that.

1738
01:28:14,133 --> 01:28:15,233
Money talks.

1739
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:19,200
I think I'll feel a
lot better about myself

1740
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:20,500
if I forget about the money.

1741
01:28:22,167 --> 01:28:24,467
- You're right about this place.

1742
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,567
Let's get out of here.

1743
01:28:28,233 --> 01:28:29,400
- Where do you wanna go?

1744
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,033
- There's only one
place for us now, David.

1745
01:28:40,567 --> 01:28:41,633
- Jimmy, where's the driver?

1746
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:42,533
- He's right outside.

1747
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,400
- Get him, get him.

1748
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:44,100
Let's go.

1749
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:46,000
We're gonna stay right with her.

1750
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:50,733
- I gotta get some cigarettes,
I'm out.

1751
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:53,000
- We'll stop at the
liquor store on the way.

1752
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:54,733
- Yeah.

1753
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,333
- You know Friedrich Nietzsche?

1754
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,433
Well, he got blamed for
all sorts of stuff

1755
01:29:00,467 --> 01:29:02,033
like being a Nazi philosopher.

1756
01:29:02,067 --> 01:29:03,133
Well, he wasn't.

1757
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:06,067
He saw some things
really clearly.

1758
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,333
He had this theory called
the Eternal Return.

1759
01:29:09,367 --> 01:29:11,633
He said you had to live your
life and be willing to live it

1760
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:14,667
again exactly the same,
no changes.

1761
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,133
And that was the
difference between

1762
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:18,200
truth and falsehood,
Heaven and Hell.

1763
01:29:20,067 --> 01:29:21,833
Sometimes things make
sense suddenly

1764
01:29:21,867 --> 01:29:23,633
that you thought made
sense before.

1765
01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:30,600
You missed the liquor store.

1766
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,100
- Yeah, next one.

1767
01:29:34,133 --> 01:29:35,633
- Well, you gotta have
some in here.

1768
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:36,667
- No, I don't.

1769
01:29:37,733 --> 01:29:38,667
- [David] How can you tell?

1770
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,733
You could have a box of Havanas.

1771
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:40,800
- 'Cause I just smoked them all

1772
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,133
and I know what I have in there.

1773
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:43,200
- Wait a minute, let me look.

1774
01:29:43,233 --> 01:29:44,167
- Move in closer!

1775
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,300
Driver, move in closer!

1776
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,533
I think he found the mic.

1777
01:29:46,567 --> 01:29:47,733
- [Kim] Just give me the purse,
David.

1778
01:29:47,767 --> 01:29:48,500
Give me it.

1779
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:49,300
- Okay, okay.

1780
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:54,500
Here's your purse.
(car horn honks)

1781
01:30:04,467 --> 01:30:05,333
What is it?

1782
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,400
- Nothing.

1783
01:30:09,433 --> 01:30:10,667
- Well, hurry back.

1784
01:30:11,733 --> 01:30:15,133
(subdued music)

1785
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:18,033
(door clattering)

1786
01:30:27,867 --> 01:30:29,200
- Get your hands in
front of you!

1787
01:30:29,233 --> 01:30:30,133
Get 'em out now!

1788
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:31,233
- [David] Okay, okay.

1789
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:32,567
- Get out, out, out!

1790
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,633
- [David] Okay, okay.

1791
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:34,600
- Cuff him.

1792
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,667
Get him up.

1793
01:30:40,867 --> 01:30:43,600
David West, you're under
arrest for the murders

1794
01:30:43,633 --> 01:30:45,400
of Virginia and James Campbell.

1795
01:30:45,433 --> 01:30:46,833
Anything you say can
be taken down

1796
01:30:46,867 --> 01:30:48,467
and used as evidence in
a court of law.

1797
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,333
- Theresa!

1798
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:50,400
Theresa!

1799
01:30:50,433 --> 01:30:51,367
Theresa!

1800
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,400
Theresa!

1801
01:30:52,433 --> 01:30:54,167
- You don't know her name,
David.

1802
01:30:55,567 --> 01:30:56,600
But it isn't Theresa.

1803
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:02,500
- Theresa?

1804
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:03,367
Theresa!

1805
01:31:04,433 --> 01:31:06,067
- [Police Officer] That's
it, let's wrap it up.

1806
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,767
- Theresa!

1807
01:31:08,133 --> 01:31:09,233
Oh, Theresa!

1808
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,533
- [Tom] You don't have to
acknowledge him.

1809
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:14,533
- I do.

1810
01:31:16,767 --> 01:31:18,133
Yes, I do.

1811
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,067
- Theresa!

1812
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,567
Why?

1813
01:31:23,633 --> 01:31:26,800
(subdued music)

1814
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:27,667
Theresa!

1815
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,100
Theresa!

1816
01:31:31,167 --> 01:31:34,167
(car engine starts)

1817
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,200
(subdued music)
