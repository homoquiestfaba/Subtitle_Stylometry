1
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:04,182
We all dream
of being someone else,

2
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:12,023
to ride a new wave,
to be reborn, to start again.

3
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:19,113
The only problem is
if you let it,

4
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:22,032
like a cancer,
it will consume you.

5
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,369
This isn't the first time
this story has been told

6
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,080
and it certainly
won't be the last.

7
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,334
But this is the real story
and it could happen to you.

# ...that I used to know #

21
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:50,793
# Rediscover #

22
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:57,216
# Lives that never seem
to know where to go #

23
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:03,764
# No, it's nothing
it's nothing at all #

24
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:10,687
# No, it's nothing
it's nothing at all #

25
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,441
# Doo-doo
and it gets me... #

26
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,413
Oh Jesus! Oh my God.

27
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,206
Oh Jesus!

28
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,752
Tell me I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

29
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,045
Oh!

30
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,672
Fuck no! Fuck.

31
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,557
J. Hey, stranger!

32
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,727
I brought you
notes from class.

33
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,230
J?

34
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,357
Oh, shit.

35
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,030
J?

36
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:13,911
J?

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,708
Shhh no, no, no.
Shhh. No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,127
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm okay. Shhh.

39
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,338
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

40
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,757
Shhh, shhh. Shhh. Shhh.

41
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,427
Shhh. Shhh. Shhh.

42
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,179
J?

43
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,347
Jesus Christ!

44
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:35,765
Shut up.

45
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,107
I'm so sorry.

46
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,441
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,278
J?

48
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,814
Jesus!

49
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,274
What are you doing here,
Martha?

50
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,819
I came to bring you notes.
Is that blood on you?!

51
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:36,737
Yeah it was just...
I had a little accident.

52
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:37,947
It's no big deal.

53
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,074
An accident? What...
what's going on?

54
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,575
Nothing, nothing.
It's just...

55
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:43,035
J, what is going on?

56
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:46,329
We haven't seen you all week
and your place is a disaster

57
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,872
and you've blood all over you,
what is going on?!

58
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:48,873
I've just been busy.

59
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:50,208
Look at me.
I'm trying to help you!

60
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,626
I don't need your help!

61
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,755
I don't need anyone's help.

62
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,351
September 21st.

63
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:13,187
I woke this morning
to a girl in my bathroom.

64
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:17,108
I'm starting to do things
I can't remember.

65
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:22,529
If Martha would have seen...
she must never know about him.

66
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:25,490
I can't believe it's only been
two weeks since Mary died.

67
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:38,961
So what's your new number?
Ah, that's clever.

68
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:42,464
Yeah, that's what
I'm gonna call you from now on.

69
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,758
No, I won't take it.

70
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,678
If that's what you want,
I promise.

71
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:52,765
Would you just cool it?
Give me the rest of your number.

72
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,725
Okay.
I'll bring it tonight.

73
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,770
I'll see you
and the others later. Bye.

74
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,376
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

75
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,544
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,963
Thanks for covering
for me yesterday.

77
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,089
Dude!

78
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,301
- Nice wipe out there.
- Shut up, man.

79
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:33,302
It was a good catch.

80
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,554
It was nice.

81
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,389
You playing or what?

82
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,933
No, man? I'm not playing.

83
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:41,059
Danny boy, let's get a beer
or something.

84
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:43,312
- See you guys later.
- Okay. Bye.

85
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,896
See you, guys.

86
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,022
Hey, Jack?

87
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,065
Hey, Martha, how are you?

88
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,608
I'm well, how are you?

89
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:50,652
What do you say we go up
to my folks' cabin this weekend

90
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:52,070
for a little R and R?

91
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:53,321
J actually got us

92
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,406
these amazing tickets
this weekend to a concert

93
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,783
so maybe another time?

94
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,243
Oh, all right.

95
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,662
Okay. See ya.

96
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:02,996
So we'll see you tonight?

97
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,414
Yeah, well...

98
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,665
Oh, shut up.
We're gonna be there.

99
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:06,708
Come on, okay,
we're going to be late.

100
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,709
All right.

101
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:08,960
- Bye.
- See you.

102
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,383
Listen, ass wipe

103
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,426
I was trying to set her up
for this weekend

104
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,678
and you came along
with your little tickets there.

105
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:22,139
You are pathetic,
you know that, Jekyll?

106
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,767
If you ever get in my face
again, I'll kill you, maggot.

107
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,236
They tell you in school

108
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,948
that how you play the game
is all that matters.

109
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:44,409
But that's not true.

110
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,662
Who cares
who comes in second?

111
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:54,335
Winning is why you play the game
and that's all there is.

112
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,254
Beating the other guy.

113
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,591
Without that
you're nothing.

114
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,727
Well, I'm not gonna come in
second anymore.

115
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,991
Professor Higgins
please go to the dean's office.

116
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,535
Professor Higgins
please go to the dean's office.

117
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:45,549
You medical students
think you're indestructible.

118
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:46,925
You got ten minutes.

119
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,545
Oh, I can't.

120
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,256
Hey. Yes... Yes,
you can. Here.

121
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,346
Okay. Right.

122
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,773
Mary, you were my...
my best friend

123
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:54,403
and, um... and I love you.

124
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,828
And you will always,
always be in my thoughts.

125
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:13,171
I was so sick of you
always borrowing mine, so...

126
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:26,725
I don't know what to say.

127
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,518
I just wish
this never happened.

128
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,071
Life is eternal

129
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,406
and love is immortal

130
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,952
and death is only a horizon.

131
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:52,248
And a horizon is nothing
save the limit of our sight.

132
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:02,966
I'm so sorry.

133
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:09,681
# Kyrie eleison #

134
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:10,723
- Mary?
- Mary?

135
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,601
Did she take something?

136
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,186
Take her pulse.
Take her pulse. I don't know!

137
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,813
I just took her pulse.

138
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,899
She's freezing.
Give her mouth to mouth!

139
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,860
# Christe eleison #

140
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:27,030
You're gonna make it, Mary.

141
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,450
# Christe... #

142
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,161
That's it, that's it.

143
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,163
Okay, that's it.

144
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,916
Somebody call a doctor! Mary!

145
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,378
Somebody! Do something!
Do something!

146
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:53,763
# Christe eleison #

147
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:02,312
It's not working. It's not working.
You gotta be kidding.

148
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,526
It's okay, it's okay.

149
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,825
Oh my God!

150
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:18,494
It's okay.

151
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:23,874
She OD'd, J.

152
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:29,546
My best friend OD'd
and I couldn't save her.

153
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,214
It wasn't your fault.

154
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,759
I know.

155
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:37,887
There's nothing
you could have done.

156
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,229
Why are you so nice? Hm?

157
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:50,899
I'm nice.

158
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,900
You know, you always...

159
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:55,361
you always say
the right things.

160
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,621
What's wrong?

161
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,959
I can't do this.

162
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,585
Why?

163
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,840
Because I can't.

164
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,304
Why, don't you...
don't you want me?

165
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,223
We are going to...

166
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:30,101
We are here to celebrate
the life of our friend, Mary.

167
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,687
And... and get completely
wasted in her name.

168
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,565
Hey J! J!
Come back here.

169
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:45,657
# Time is colored in #

170
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:50,119
# The black and white #

171
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,289
# Of your sin #

172
00:15:54,832 --> 00:16:00,546
# So burn... burn the flag #

173
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,048
# Rip it up #

174
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,053
# Bury the rags #

175
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:13,516
# But I will find you still #

176
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,852
# Move in for the kill #

177
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,687
# You cut her hair #

178
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:37,538
# So live, live long #

179
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:45,128
# See her face in everyone #

180
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,051
# Turn... turn the page #

181
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,845
# And start again #

182
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,475
# Change your name #

183
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,252
I've taken my fourth dose,
Wednesday, February 3rd.

184
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:17,880
Increased the dosage
from 3 to 5 milligrams.

185
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,965
There's been... uh...

186
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,219
there've been
slight side effects

187
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,764
non-debilitating,
a slight euphoria perhaps.

188
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,324
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

189
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,909
the human brain.

190
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:38,245
The most important
organ in your body.

191
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,247
This three-pound masterpiece

192
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,333
has gotten the human race
where it is today

193
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,545
and will get it
where it is going tomorrow.

194
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:49,756
It is without question...

195
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,886
the last frontier
of modern medicine

196
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,805
and since this little
brain dissection

197
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,474
will account for 20%
of your final mark

198
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,476
I suggest you use yours.

199
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:28,958
Yeah, hey, I'm just... like 5,
5 minutes, 5 minutes.

200
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,253
Okay, guys,
be aware that your specimens

201
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,423
may have experienced trauma
in the squamous temporal bone

202
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:37,091
so look for extradural mass

203
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,551
that presses against
the cerebral hemisphere.

204
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:44,389
Unfortunately, we can't
always get perfect specimens.

205
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:48,977
Mr. Jekyll, I read your
research suggestions last night.

206
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,103
All your own work?

207
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,729
Yeah, it is.

208
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,648
Well, we should talk.

209
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,110
Oh, I'm sorry,
Professor Poole.

210
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,279
The cops, they wanted
to talk to me

211
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:01,989
about what happened
the other night.

212
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:04,825
Oh. Well,
you better make a start.

213
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:06,201
Okay.

214
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,793
- What did they wanna know?
- Hm?

215
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,503
- The cops.
- Nothing.

216
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:18,796
I haven't seen them yet.

217
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:23,508
But I... I just sold the Mustang
got a '67 Porsche.

218
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,926
Why?

219
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,178
Why? Why not?

220
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:29,347
Miss Udderson, Mr. Lanyon,

221
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,974
if it's not too much trouble,
please.

222
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:32,975
Right, sorry.

223
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,278
- What is this?
- It's an exam.

224
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,833
Can you tell me where you've
been for the last three nights?

225
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,002
I'm sorry.

226
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:03,712
I was just out.

227
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:05,881
what do you mean out?
Did you not think of calling?

228
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:07,966
No. I don't need to tell you
everywhere I am.

229
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,259
You know what?

230
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,552
We can talk about this
when you come home, okay?

231
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:32,697
Thank you.

232
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:41,371
So you believe you can succeed
where greater minds have failed?

233
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,749
Not exactly D.A. proof, is it?

234
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,125
I thought you could help me.

235
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,460
Really? And why is that?

236
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:57,636
Kids are cooking up
this stuff all the time

237
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,972
with shit they buy
from the drugstore

238
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:00,931
or off the internet...

239
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:04,726
and they are
killing themselves too.

240
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:07,145
Didn't you learn anything
from your friend's death?

241
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:08,688
The recreational drugs
you're talking about

242
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,024
are not the magic cure-all
for life's woes, J.

243
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:12,859
You are intelligent enough
to know that.

244
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,237
There's nothing recreational
about what I want to do.

245
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,696
They are already testing ecstasy

246
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,865
for post traumatic
stress syndrome.

247
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:21,783
We should be doing the same
type of drug research.

248
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:24,327
Look, I admire
your altruistic nature, J,

249
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,955
but what you are talking about
is paradise engineering

250
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,957
altering someone's personality.

251
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,293
- For the better.
- It's just a dream.

252
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,128
There is no way
that I can give you permission

253
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,214
for this line of research.
The drugs involved are illegal.

254
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,925
The laws is the law and we all
have to work within its confines

255
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:43,428
ill-conceived
as you may think they are.

256
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,763
Now, let me see
if I can find you

257
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,932
a safer line of research
for your talents,

258
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:49,976
maybe something
that comes with a grant.

259
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,568
Yeah, well, I don't do safe.

260
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:02,529
So screw your grant
and screw you.

261
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:08,701
Mr. Jekyll, if you wish
to remain in this medical school

262
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:11,162
<i>you will take my advice</i>

263
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:12,914
'cause God is not a D.J.

264
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,749
and life is certainly not
a dance floor.

265
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:16,459
And while you're
searching for heaven

266
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,419
be careful you don't find hell.

267
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:33,529
No, actually
that's not what happened.

268
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:35,573
He was supposed to be here at 8.30

269
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,658
and he didn't show up until 8.45.

270
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,660
No. Exactly, yeah.
So that's what I said to him.

271
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:41,703
He's got to show me
a little bit more respect.

272
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:42,663
Hang on a second,
that's my other line.

273
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:43,830
Just a sec.

274
00:25:43,914 --> 00:25:47,083
Hello. Pharmacy.
Hi, Dr. Drake.

275
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,252
Uh, yeah, I think
I have enough of that.

276
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:50,795
Can I just give you
a call right back?

277
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:53,256
I've just got
another emergency call.

278
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,925
Okay. Thanks so much.
Bye, bye.

279
00:25:56,008 --> 00:26:01,221
Hi, it's me again.
So what's happening with Gary?

280
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:04,516
You didn't! Did you like it?

281
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,604
Aaah!

282
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:22,324
Macy are you there?
Macy? Macy!

283
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:31,666
So here I am, afraid to move.

284
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,460
I have no idea who she was
or how she got there.

285
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,840
But I know what I have to do.

286
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:45,428
When I bring back Hyde,
when I take the drug,

287
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,014
everything's okay.

288
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,784
Disposing of a human body
is never easy...

289
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,747
unless you've been taught
where to start.

290
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:21,003
- Yes, that's it.
- Four vodka shots.

291
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,546
You sure you're gonna
take care of this?

292
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:24,131
- I'm sure.
- Yeah?

293
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:28,093
That's my dude.
I like him. I like him.

294
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:31,220
Hey, uh, you guys,
we need to talk about J.

295
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:32,597
Yeah, I haven't seen him in days.

296
00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:33,764
Well, I went over
to his place today

297
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:35,808
and there is something
up with him.

298
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,645
I think there's something wrong.
He had some blood on him.

299
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:41,355
Is this the same J
we were talking about?

300
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:42,898
Yeah. But I think
we need to seriously...

301
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:44,608
Yeah, guys, you know what?
Enough about J, all right?

302
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:46,151
Grab a little shot and...

303
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,485
Yes!

304
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:52,156
Jam it. Guys, hands out.
Hands out.

305
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,951
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

306
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:58,996
these are Lanyon's
home-made party poppers.

307
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,790
- Oh!
- Wow!

308
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:03,625
Just like grandma used to make.

309
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,585
- Why? Oh no.
- Not tonight.

310
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,588
Martha, these are really,
really, good, okay?

311
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:09,881
I made them with my own hands.

312
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,049
It's good.

313
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:12,800
Trust me, please,
I'm a doctor.

314
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:14,010
You'll be fine.

315
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:18,013
- Mm. All right.
- That was easy.

316
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,307
Very good!

317
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:21,433
Whoo!

318
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,230
You spilt!

319
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,816
Hello.

320
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,067
Do you want another one?

321
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,528
Hey, buddy.
You need some help?

322
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,613
- Lanyon?
- Yes, that's me.

323
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,323
- Absolutely... no.
- Do you know her?

324
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:39,950
Do you know her?

325
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:40,951
Oh, yeah, I know her.

326
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:43,620
Do not introduce
my cousin to Cindy.

327
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:45,664
Lanyon! Absolutely not.

328
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,583
Not Cindy.
This is my cousin, okay?

329
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:52,420
- I love Cindy.
- No, sweetie. No, she's...

330
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:53,588
You wanna be introduced to Cindy?

331
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:55,589
- She is bad news.
- I love Cindy, yes.

332
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:57,591
- Everyone loves Cindy.
- Everyone loves Cindy. Hey!

333
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:59,259
Oh, God!

334
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:00,928
Cindy?

335
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:02,721
- Over here!
- Does he really know her?

336
00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:04,723
Yeah, we all do.

337
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:06,558
- Oh no.
- Come on.

338
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:10,895
Great. Here's Cindy.

339
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,814
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hi.

340
00:29:12,855 --> 00:29:14,232
Cindy. Hi.

341
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:15,566
So are we gonna play
hunt your little weiner again,

342
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,567
Lanyon?

343
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,028
Oh. Boy, oh boy.

344
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,072
That's not right.
How have you been?

345
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,907
Good.

346
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,492
- Hey.
- Cindy...

347
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:28,244
this is Josh.
Josh, this is Cindy.

348
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:31,205
Cindy, Josh is not training
to be a doctor so he has a life.

349
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,667
Josh, Cindy is a nurse.
So she will shag anyone.

350
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,210
Not you.

351
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:39,380
Hey, Cindy.

352
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:41,882
Nice one. Right there.
Right there. I like that.

353
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:45,427
What do you think? Find yourself
a nice corner and... and play.

354
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,762
- Josh?
- Fine.

355
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,557
Go on. Bravo.

356
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,101
Come on,
I think that's gonna work.

357
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:54,352
- Thank you!
- I think it'll last.

358
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:56,062
I really do,
I think it'll last.

359
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:01,650
Cindy, can I ask you something?

360
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:02,609
Mm-hm.

361
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,444
Where the hell are we?

362
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,488
Oh, it's the one place
you can always be guaranteed

363
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,948
to find a stiff.

364
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:11,868
Is this a good idea?
What if somebody comes in?

365
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,870
- So play dead.
- Vodka. Ah.

366
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,919
This is weird.

367
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:24,838
You said you'd try anything.

368
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,464
Yeah...

369
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:30,593
so up you get.

370
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,682
It's cold.

371
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:41,520
Oh!

372
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,068
Cindy?

373
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:39,740
Cindy?

374
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,877
Cindy!

375
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:01,093
Hello, Cindy?

376
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,768
Cindy!

377
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,913
So are you ready to go again?

378
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:37,084
Josh? Josh, where are you?

379
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:42,839
Stop fooling around.

380
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:48,553
Josh?

381
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,616
- Oh, this door.
- Right there.

382
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:15,369
Yeah, you got it, you got it.

383
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,996
Ha!

384
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,332
Forgot.

385
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,500
It's okay, it's still there.

386
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,044
Gentle with this, the window.

387
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,462
Yeah.

388
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,339
Well, thank you for getting me.
It's so nice.

389
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,969
I'm here for you,
you know that?

390
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,304
I know. I'm good.

391
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,807
You know, I'm... I... I'm good.

392
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,018
- You are?
- Yeah.

393
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:42,519
You know, all that stuff
that happened to Josh

394
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,770
it was after he was dead.

395
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:47,482
No, I know.
So how is... how is everybody?

396
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,485
Oh everyone's good.
Dan's Dan.

397
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:52,737
You know, I mean,
there's no change there.

398
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,488
I'm still as wildly popular
with the ladies

399
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,199
- as I was before. Yeah.
- Of course.

400
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:01,078
- And uh... J?
- J?

401
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,537
J, he's good.

402
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:05,540
You know I... uh
I don't really see him too much

403
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:07,167
so... so...
you know he's working hard.

404
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,837
I guess, getting it together,
unlike some of us.

405
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,840
I've now increased the dosage
to 20 milligrams.

406
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:20,095
Yeah, there's a...

407
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,891
there's a small feeling of
conflict within my soul but...

408
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,314
I am now violent, predatory,

409
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,818
sexually aggressive.

410
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,672
# One - take control of me #

411
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,799
# You're messing with the enemy #

412
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,343
# Said it's 2 -
it's another trick #

413
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,636
# Messing with my mind #

414
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,847
# I wake up
chase down an empty street #

415
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,724
# Blindly snap
the broken beats #

416
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,393
# Said it's gone
with the dirty trick #

417
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,854
# It's take all these days
to find ya #

418
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:15,855
# Ooh #

419
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,982
# Ahh ahh ahh #

420
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,316
# I tell you I want you #

421
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:20,442
# Ooh #

422
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:22,569
# Ahh ahh ahh #

423
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,779
# I tell you I need you #

424
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:24,905
# Ooh #

425
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,865
# Ahh ahh ahh #

426
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,283
# The blood on my face #

427
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:29,242
# Ooh #

428
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:31,327
# Ahh ahh ahh #

429
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,996
# I just wanted you near me #

430
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:36,540
This is no longer an experiment.

431
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:39,001
This is me.
This is who I've become.

432
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,171
I am Hyde.

433
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,179
Vodka, Red Bull?

434
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:58,102
Could I see some I.D., please?

435
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:09,737
Nice picture, Heather Poole.

436
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,951
See you in a couple of years.

437
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:21,832
Excuse me?

438
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:23,333
It's Hyde, right?

439
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,876
What can I get you?

440
00:36:26,962 --> 00:36:30,381
Vodka, Red Bull and a soda.

441
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:34,635
Mr. Hyde, this girl
is clearly underage.

442
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,763
Yeah, the vodka is for me.

443
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,313
Thanks.

444
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:51,984
These guys can't tell jack shit.
You sure look 21 to me.

445
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:53,528
It's Heather, right?

446
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,365
12 dollars, please.

447
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:05,580
Keep the change.

448
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:30,979
So, how old are you?

449
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,856
Not much older than you.

450
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,943
But who cares, right?
It's what's inside that matters.

451
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,737
It's who you are that counts.

452
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:41,697
God, that's exactly how I feel.

453
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,324
Everyone's always judging me,
I just hate it.

454
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:46,868
- Who judges you?
- I dunno.

455
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,412
My mom, everyone.

456
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:52,832
Well, your mom is wrong
to judge you.

457
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,543
Pretty girl like you.

458
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,094
Stop it,
you're embarrassing me.

459
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:10,056
Stop it?
I... I just can't help it.

460
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,392
You're just so pretty,
Heather Poole.

461
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:19,023
I bet all the boys
have to get in line for you.

462
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:20,983
- No.
- No?

463
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,276
Well, they should.

464
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,030
I know I would.

465
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,287
That was nice.

466
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:47,173
What do you say me and you

467
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:50,260
we go somewhere
a little more private?

468
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,391
What do you say,
Heather Poole?

469
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:04,314
So, do you wanna make out?

470
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:12,947
Good morning, Mr. Kellar.

471
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,907
I promise this won't
take long. Okay...

472
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:19,411
November 18th,
I watched them again today.

473
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:21,747
...nausea and abdominal pain.

474
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,418
Martha is finally back
from burying her cousin.

475
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:31,005
And there's Dan.

476
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,590
Look at him.

477
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,012
Seems so pleased
with himself.

478
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:43,225
I can't stand
the sight of him.

479
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:48,271
He reminds me of what
I used to be.

480
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:52,900
Everything about him
makes me sick!

481
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:56,237
- Martha?
- Yeah?

482
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,822
You didn't have to
come back so soon, you know.

483
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:01,268
Yeah, I know, I just
was going crazy at home.

484
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:03,388
Well, as long as you feel ready.

485
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:04,988
You'll find things are
pretty much back to normal here.

486
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,908
Of course they've
beefed up security.

487
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:08,188
Have you talked to the dean?

488
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,908
- Yes.
- Good.

489
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:11,228
Well, I'm not sure
which classes

490
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,828
you're going to be
attending either

491
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,388
but give us a couple of days
and we'll sort it all out.

492
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:15,948
Thanks.

493
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,348
- Hey!
- Hi.

494
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,388
It's nice to have you back.

495
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:20,388
Thanks.

496
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:23,268
Ah... did you get my emails?

497
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:27,028
I did. I... I did get your emails.

498
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:31,628
I'm sorry I didn't reply.
It was hard.

499
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,028
Yeah, sure, I understand.

500
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:35,668
I... I just...

501
00:40:35,748 --> 00:40:40,068
It's just good to have you back.

502
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:41,988
Thanks, honey.
I'll see you later?

503
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:43,908
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:40:55,428 --> 00:41:02,068
# Tell all my friends,
I have gone to the moon #

505
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:10,908
# Tell all my friends
I will write them soon #

506
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:18,868
# And tell them...
if you see them #

507
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:27,228
# That I am better left alone #

508
00:41:29,148 --> 00:41:32,668
# 'Cause I'm living up here
where the air's thin... #

509
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:33,988
J?

510
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:38,308
# Where gravity don't
bring you down #

511
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:42,588
# I'm living up here
and I'm watching your #

512
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:46,308
# Universe cooling down #

513
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:50,148
Come on, let me in.
I wanna talk.

514
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,988
# I spend my days #

515
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,628
J?

516
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:56,668
# Beneath a perspex dome #

517
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,388
J, are you in there?

518
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,108
# I think that I have #

519
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,068
Come on, let me in.

520
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,708
# Finally come home #

521
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:08,068
J.

522
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,788
# So tell them #

523
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:12,068
J.

524
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:14,508
# If you see them #

525
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:23,668
# That I am better left alone #

526
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,268
# 'Cause I'm living up here
where the air is thin... #

527
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:30,548
November 20th.

528
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,548
I finished my last batch
of the drug this morning.

529
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:36,308
It's becoming
almost impossible to get it.

530
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,948
I'm running out of options.

531
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:41,468
But I can never go back
to who I was.

532
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:53,868
Hey, Danny boy, you're going to
have to make effort, right?

533
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,508
None of this stupid shit.

534
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:57,628
Just get off my case, man.

535
00:42:57,668 --> 00:43:03,548
Oh, Danny boy,
I'm only trying to help you.

536
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:06,708
Oh, Danny boy.

537
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:14,228
All right. Ha ha ha.

538
00:43:17,508 --> 00:43:19,708
Hey.

539
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:21,028
Ch... Christ, J.

540
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:22,628
Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

541
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,988
I need you to get me
some special shit.

542
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:32,828
Can you get that for me?

543
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:34,428
- What're you cooking?
- Can you get it or not?!

544
00:43:34,468 --> 00:43:37,188
I'll see what I can do, but
I'm not gonna make any promises.

545
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,228
- I owe you, man.
- Wait, no, J?

546
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:43,588
- What?
- Are you okay?

547
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:44,988
I'm fine, man.
Thanks, though.

548
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:46,308
You know, Martha,
she was just here.

549
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:47,828
She was just here. She says you
haven't seen her for days.

550
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,228
I saw her. I saw her.

551
00:43:49,308 --> 00:43:50,508
Tell her I'll
meet up with her later.

552
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:51,748
J, why don't you just...

553
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,388
J, why don't you just
hop into a cab with me?

554
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,788
Leave me alone!

555
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:04,868
I just wanna be
Hyde all the time.

556
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:08,228
I had no idea how intoxicating
this could be.

557
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:59,108
J? It's me.

558
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,748
J!

559
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:47,708
Oh, my God!

560
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,788
Oh, my God,
you scared the shit out of me.

561
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:50,988
How'd you get in here?

562
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,228
Your gate was unlocked.

563
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:55,268
Look I... I...
I came over here

564
00:47:55,348 --> 00:47:56,748
because I need
to clear things up with you.

565
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:59,348
You have been
completely ignoring me.

566
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:02,948
- Why?
- Am I ignoring you now.

567
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,788
J, I'm so sick of this
back and forth shit

568
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:07,268
between you and I.

569
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:09,228
How could you not call me
once when I was gone?

570
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:10,908
After everything
I was going through and then...

571
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,668
I know you heard me over
at your elevator the other day

572
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,708
and you didn't even let me in.

573
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:52,668
Oh, my God.

574
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,828
Oh!

575
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:11,828
Oh!

576
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:18,108
Oh, my God!

577
00:49:30,788 --> 00:49:32,868
That was amazing.

578
00:49:38,468 --> 00:49:39,708
God, you look so good.

579
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,708
You look different.

580
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,508
Why didn't you return my emails?

581
00:49:55,748 --> 00:49:58,788
November 22nd.

582
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:03,668
The dosage amounts I need
at this stage are beyond toxic.

583
00:50:03,748 --> 00:50:09,548
I need so much more that,
to have the same effect...

584
00:50:09,628 --> 00:50:12,908
I've become a slave to it.

585
00:50:12,988 --> 00:50:17,788
Every second of everyday
it speaks to me.

586
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:47,268
Wow!

587
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:51,828
I can't believe you paid that
guy 300 bucks to get in here.

588
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:53,148
Yeah, well,
that's what it takes.

589
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:55,108
I told you J wouldn't show.

590
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:56,668
Hey, it's early.
He promised he'd come.

591
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,628
He better come I already
paid for him at the door.

592
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:02,588
What?

593
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:04,428
You look amazing.

594
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:07,748
Oh, Danny boy, thank you.

595
00:51:07,788 --> 00:51:09,468
Think we are all looking
pretty hot tonight.

596
00:51:09,508 --> 00:51:10,588
Yeah.

597
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,188
Thanks.

598
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:19,748
- Here you go.
- Oh, uh...

599
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:22,268
It's... it's okay.
It's on the house.

600
00:51:22,308 --> 00:51:25,108
- You're a guest now.
- Uh... whose?

601
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:28,388
- Hyde's.
- Oh yeah, right.

602
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:32,148
I don't know any Hyde.

603
00:51:32,228 --> 00:51:33,908
Me neither. Cheers.

604
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:36,388
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

605
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:43,228
Okay. Unless they throw us out
I'm gonna party till I drop.

606
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,468
And one more thing I'm
definitely being checked out by

607
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:46,668
that girl at the bar.

608
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:48,588
- Where?
- Right there.

609
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:55,708
Hi?

610
00:52:12,308 --> 00:52:15,548
I can't believe him!
How does he do it?

611
00:52:15,588 --> 00:52:17,148
Hey um... Danny?

612
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:19,188
Yeah?

613
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:22,868
Mary knew a Hyde.
It was written in her locker.

614
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:24,908
Martha, just...
just chill all right?

615
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:29,668
We'll... we'll sort it out
tomorrow, okay?

616
00:52:29,748 --> 00:52:31,228
Okay.

617
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:36,948
Dan.

618
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,188
So... cool hairstyle and smooth
clothes does it for you, huh?

619
00:52:41,268 --> 00:52:42,668
J's not even here.

620
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:44,548
Yeah, well he might as well be.

621
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:57,268
I'm gonna go.

622
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:31,388
Shit.

623
00:53:32,028 --> 00:53:34,708
You skank!

624
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:38,228
What's the matter, Dan?
Not jealous, are we?

625
00:53:38,308 --> 00:53:40,068
Dan, what the hell
are you doing?

626
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:42,468
Ask this asshole.

627
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,268
It feels good doesn't it, Dan?

628
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:46,828
Fuck you!

629
00:54:07,588 --> 00:54:09,988
November 26th.

630
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:12,588
I wake with them every night now.

631
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:15,708
Only I don't think
they're nightmares.

632
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:17,748
I think they're memories.

633
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:44,708
Then she says she wants
to tie me up, right?

634
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:46,148
And I'm saying no way.

635
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:47,428
I mean I ain't doing
nothing like that shit.

636
00:54:47,508 --> 00:54:48,668
We just met.

637
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,188
I mean the bitch could have cut
my balls off, right?

638
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:55,388
Yeah.

639
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:58,228
You with me here, Dan?
She wanted to tie me up, man.

640
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:04,988
All right, you just gotta let her go.

641
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:07,508
It's... it's just not gonna happen,
you know that.

642
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:10,788
Yeah, but he's
so wrong for her.

643
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:12,268
You didn't see what I saw.

644
00:55:12,348 --> 00:55:15,348
Okay, J's no saint
but... but who is?

645
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,868
Just cut him
some slack, man, okay?

646
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,468
You know what
you need to do, Danny boy?

647
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:21,028
You need to get out
into the big wide world

648
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:24,428
and start mowing some new lawns,
you know what I mean?

649
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,468
Right? Yeah.

650
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:35,748
I'll just be a minute

651
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:37,308
and then we are gonna start
reprogramming your sex life

652
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:40,388
in that Irish pub on 4th, okay?

653
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:43,668
Don't touch anything.
See you later.

654
00:56:12,788 --> 00:56:13,828
Hey, how about we head...

655
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:37,948
Does that scare you, Dan?

656
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,108
Your ear's bleeding.

657
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,428
You a gambling man, Dan?

658
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:17,308
This is how it is, Dan.

659
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:19,268
We're gonna play
this little game.

660
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:22,268
If you win, you walk
out of here alive.

661
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:28,628
It's your turn.

662
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:38,748
Come on, Dan.
It's not that fucking hard.

663
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:44,588
Put your hand, there you go.
Cock it back, there you go.

664
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,228
And pull the trigger!

665
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:52,428
Must be your lucky day, huh?
Lucky day.

666
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,588
God, you are fucking pathetic.

667
00:59:06,988 --> 00:59:09,108
My turn, right?

668
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:10,948
I want you to watch me this time.

669
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,228
Fucking watch me!
Are you watching me?

670
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:15,428
Are you watching me, Dan!
Are you watching?!

671
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:24,828
That's how you do it, Dan.
That's how you fucking do it.

672
00:59:34,348 --> 00:59:35,748
Quit fuckin' around.

673
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:38,748
Point it at your little
fagotty head, that's it.

674
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:41,908
You ready, Dan? Are you ready?
Are you ready to die, Dan?

675
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:12,268
There's no way back.

676
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:17,028
I can't stop him.

677
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:25,188
The drugs Lanyon got me
were contaminated.

678
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:31,148
One minute I'm me and the next
I become the devil himself.

679
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,228
I've lost all control.

680
01:01:10,108 --> 01:01:15,868
# Kyrie eleison #

681
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,628
What you're going to see
is a young man

682
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:23,708
with severe gunshot trauma
to the head.

683
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:25,308
Are you ready?

684
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,828
Can you positively identify
the body as that of Daniel Cool?

685
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:45,308
It was called in as a suicide.
Clearly it wasn't.

686
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:50,068
We're just waiting on the prints
to confirm it.

687
01:01:50,148 --> 01:01:53,028
Who would wanna hurt Dan?

688
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,628
I thought you might tell me that.

689
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:03,188
Sorry.

690
01:02:03,268 --> 01:02:05,548
Oh, just one other thing.

691
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:09,788
Do you recognize this?

692
01:02:09,828 --> 01:02:14,148
No. Why?

693
01:02:14,228 --> 01:02:16,708
It was in Daniel's hand
when he was found.

694
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:24,428
Hey, J?

695
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:29,348
Hey, J, wait up.

696
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:31,468
Wait up,
J. Wait up, wait up.

697
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,908
Hey, man, where have you been?

698
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:37,028
Dude, man, Dan's dead.

699
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:39,028
I know.

700
01:02:39,108 --> 01:02:41,748
Hey what... hey? Hey? Hey?
Hey? Hey!

701
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,588
What's the matter with you?
Is that all you got to say?

702
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:45,668
They were contaminated,
Lanyon.

703
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:48,788
The drugs you got me
were contaminated.

704
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:51,108
- What?!
- I trusted you!

705
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:54,108
And that's the shit
you get me?

706
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:57,468
Hey, what the fuck
is the matter with you?!

707
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,708
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

708
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:01,628
Oh, yeah? Listen to me.

709
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:03,548
Anything you've done,
you've done to yourself.

710
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:05,788
I got what you asked for.
No, I got what you asked for.

711
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:08,068
Maybe you made
the fucking mistake.

712
01:03:08,108 --> 01:03:14,228
The only mistake I ever made
was having you as a friend.

713
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:15,588
Fuck you.

714
01:04:03,428 --> 01:04:04,668
- Professor?
- Martha.

715
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,868
- I really need to talk to you.
- Not a good time.

716
01:04:06,948 --> 01:04:09,348
- It will have to wait.
- Oh, my God.

717
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:12,828
- She's my daughter.
- What happened?

718
01:04:12,868 --> 01:04:15,068
- She was beaten, raped.
- I didn't... I didn't...

719
01:04:15,108 --> 01:04:16,868
The police are
looking for the guy now.

720
01:04:16,908 --> 01:04:19,228
- Let's talk out here.
- Okay.

721
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,628
Just I know
it was J's pendant.

722
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,028
I saw it on him.

723
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:07,748
Look, before you call the police
you should talk to J.

724
01:05:07,788 --> 01:05:08,668
Martha, there's gotta be
thousands

725
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:09,788
of those pendants around.

726
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:12,308
Can I use your phone?

727
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:24,868
D - E. H - Y - D - E.

728
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,428
- Hyde
- What did you say?

729
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,988
That's right.
No, Hyde's not his real name.

730
01:05:58,028 --> 01:06:00,828
It's Henry Jekyll.
He's one of my students.

731
01:06:00,868 --> 01:06:04,548
Yes, Martha Udderson.
She's here with me now.

732
01:06:04,588 --> 01:06:07,188
Well how would I know?
That's your job. Find him!

733
01:09:16,428 --> 01:09:18,628
Shit! Fuck!

734
01:11:02,068 --> 01:11:07,068
He should have hurt me,
not you.

735
01:11:11,748 --> 01:11:13,508
- Oh, my God.
- What?

736
01:11:13,548 --> 01:11:14,748
He's in the hospital.

737
01:11:14,828 --> 01:11:17,268
Shit. Martha, wait.

738
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:19,908
Call the police,
call them again.

739
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:24,868
Look up, Lanyon, "something
wicked this way comes".

740
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:31,428
Was it Shakespeare
or was it Ray Bradbury?

741
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:35,588
I always get those two
so confused, don't you?

742
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:37,988
What? What did you say?

743
01:11:38,068 --> 01:11:39,628
Oh. God.

744
01:11:43,588 --> 01:11:44,468
All right.

745
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:46,108
Just listen to me!

746
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,468
J!

747
01:11:53,788 --> 01:11:57,308
Mate, I got these pills for you.

748
01:11:57,348 --> 01:11:59,228
I know you love these pills, right?

749
01:11:59,268 --> 01:12:00,428
You love these pills,

750
01:12:00,508 --> 01:12:01,868
just like Grandma
used to make, right?

751
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:04,348
Isn't that what you say?
Lanyon's home cooking.

752
01:12:04,428 --> 01:12:07,068
Let me see.
Just a cold piece.

753
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:08,988
It's all right. Yeah, see?
There you go.

754
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:12,348
That's one, hold it in.
That's it.

755
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,468
Open your fuckin' mouth.

756
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:17,548
Come on. That's right.

757
01:12:17,628 --> 01:12:20,428
There you go, there you go.

758
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:23,868
There you go.
There you go. Back up.

759
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:26,588
Oh, yeah. That taste good?

760
01:12:26,628 --> 01:12:32,028
Quite a fighter, aren't you?
Good, huh? Good?

761
01:12:32,108 --> 01:12:36,988
Look at you. Let's just keep it back.
There you go.

762
01:12:37,068 --> 01:12:40,028
You're starting to piss me off.
Jesus Christ.

763
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:46,108
You better shut the fuck up
and take these fucking pills!

764
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:49,028
You love these freaking pills.

765
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:50,588
Fucking take them.

766
01:12:52,228 --> 01:12:53,508
All right.

767
01:13:06,388 --> 01:13:08,628
It's all down.

768
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,268
Don't you throw up on me.

769
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:14,388
That's it, all right, all right.

770
01:13:14,468 --> 01:13:19,588
There we go.
That's it. That's right.

771
01:13:43,388 --> 01:13:44,988
Martha, we should just
stay in one spot.

772
01:13:45,028 --> 01:13:46,548
Then stay!

773
01:13:55,628 --> 01:13:57,188
Martha?

774
01:13:58,788 --> 01:14:00,388
Okay, they gotta be
down there.

775
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:02,588
This is dumb, Martha.

776
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:04,828
Oh, God!

777
01:14:04,868 --> 01:14:07,508
Oh, my God. Lanyon! Lanyon!

778
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:09,548
Shut the fuck up,
are you crazy? Stop it!

779
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,948
No. Are you coming with me?

780
01:14:15,028 --> 01:14:16,388
You're not really
going to do this.

781
01:14:16,468 --> 01:14:17,748
This is stupid, Martha!

782
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,908
Lanyon is my friend, okay?

783
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:26,588
Okay.

784
01:14:31,228 --> 01:14:33,788
Shit. Okay.

785
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,148
Oh, my God.

786
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:19,388
It's so creepy. What is this?

787
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:22,348
I don't know.
I don't know, it's...

788
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,388
...something, I don't know.

789
01:15:27,468 --> 01:15:29,388
I had no idea this
was underneath the hospital.

790
01:15:29,468 --> 01:15:31,708
Me either.

791
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,468
Here.

792
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,308
- Did you hear that?
- I don't know.

793
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:05,668
- Shit! Shit!
- What?

794
01:16:07,508 --> 01:16:08,868
Come on!

795
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:18,428
Professor?

796
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:32,588
Professor?

797
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:15,548
Shhh. Shhh. It's just me.
Let's just go.

798
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:17,628
Let's get out of here.

799
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:26,788
That's gotta be it.

800
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:35,708
J! Open the door!

801
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:37,308
Open the door!

802
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:44,468
Oh, my God.
No! No! Shit!

803
01:17:44,548 --> 01:17:45,508
Open the door.

804
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:46,468
Move! Move!

805
01:17:46,548 --> 01:17:50,148
- Push!
- Open the door.

806
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,068
J!

807
01:17:54,148 --> 01:17:59,148
Lanyon!

808
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:01,028
Where are you, Lanyon?

809
01:18:14,468 --> 01:18:17,268
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

810
01:18:19,868 --> 01:18:21,308
Oh, my God!

811
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:34,068
Oh, no.

812
01:18:38,268 --> 01:18:39,828
Oh, my...

813
01:18:47,908 --> 01:18:50,508
Oh, Lanyon. I'm sorry.

814
01:20:04,468 --> 01:20:06,788
They tell you in school

815
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:10,068
That how you play the game
is all that matters.

816
01:20:10,148 --> 01:20:12,988
But that's not true.

817
01:20:13,028 --> 01:20:16,988
Who cares
who comes in second?

818
01:20:17,028 --> 01:20:19,668
Winning is why you play the game.

819
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:23,708
I mean, that's all there is

820
01:20:23,748 --> 01:20:27,068
beating the other guy.

821
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:30,308
Without that you're nothing.

822
01:20:30,388 --> 01:20:32,948
Martha, don't.

823
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,228
Well, I'm not going to
come in second any more.

824
01:20:45,388 --> 01:20:47,268
I can hear you outside
in the tunnel.

825
01:20:49,788 --> 01:20:51,988
Please, Martha,
don't judge me too harshly.

826
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:56,308
All I ever wanted to be
was somebody else.

827
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:07,868
When the experiment fails,
you terminate it.

828
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:11,708
If I don't...
if I did not kill myself now,

829
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:16,388
I would kill you, Martha.

830
01:21:16,468 --> 01:21:18,908
And God knows I love you
more than life itself.

831
01:21:23,188 --> 01:21:25,948
I'm so sorry, Martha.

832
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:16,548
Someone once said evil is
the ultimate temptation.

833
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:20,148
What's so terrifying
is that it's within us all.

834
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:25,628
If you let it, like a cancer
it will consume you.

835
01:22:25,668 --> 01:22:28,748
This isn't the first time
this story has been told

836
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:31,268
and it certainly
won't be the last.

837
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:35,068
But this is the real story,

838
01:22:35,108 --> 01:22:37,148
and it could happen to you.

839
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:46,748
# What will do for us? #

840
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:51,908
# What will do for us? #

841
01:22:51,948 --> 01:22:57,028
# What will do for us? #

842
01:22:57,108 --> 01:23:00,668
# Oh-ah #

843
01:23:06,908 --> 01:23:10,468
# Oooh #

844
01:23:10,548 --> 01:23:15,628
# Move on #

845
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:21,828
# With a black rose
in your hand #

846
01:23:21,908 --> 01:23:24,588
# Straight on #

847
01:23:30,628 --> 01:23:35,748
# Go on #

848
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:43,148
# Crash and burn #

849
01:23:47,428 --> 01:23:50,148
# Yeah #

850
01:23:51,908 --> 01:23:56,948
# What will do for us? #

851
01:23:57,028 --> 01:24:01,948
# What will do for us? #

852
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:07,148
# What will do for us? #

853
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:10,748
# Oh-oh #

854
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:36,708
# Just turn your back #

855
01:24:44,228 --> 01:24:47,948
# Just turn your back #

856
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:50,548
# On everyone #

857
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:52,868
# Everyone #

858
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:58,148
# Just turn your back #

859
01:25:04,068 --> 01:25:07,708
# Just turn your back #

860
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:11,388
# On everyone #

861
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:17,868
# Just turn your back #

862
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:27,708
# Just turn your back #

863
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:35,508
# On everyone #
