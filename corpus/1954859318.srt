1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:02,297
Five hours of dancing.

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:03,914
Seven hours of harmonies.

3
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:06,589
And I sweated through 14 bandannas.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,193
Thank goodness we can escape
the stresses of Hollywood

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:10,917
at the amazing palmwoods pool.

6
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:12,494
What's this?

7
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:13,794
I didn't order extras.

8
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,555
We live here. This is our pool.

9
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:19,170
No, this is the set for the sexy
dog dog food commercial,

10
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,107
starring lightning the tv wonder dog.

11
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,134
Hey, lightning.

12
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,078
Strike the boys.

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,197
What's that?

14
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,489
Uh!

15
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:33,322
Well, at least we can recharge
in the stylish palmwoods lobby.

16
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:37,459
Ah, the four hockey players
from Minnesota.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,399
I'm not getting a friendly vibe.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,211
No loitering in the lobby after 9:00.

19
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,640
Oh, look at the time.

20
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,448
9:01.

21
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:52,117
Then there's the gracious interior
of our very own apartment 2-j.

22
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,929
This place is horrible.

23
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:01,960

00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,899

What? I'm busy.

00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,067
We'd like a nicer apartment, please.

43
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,017
How come every one else gets
one of those cool apartments?

44
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,837
And ours is a big time dump.

45
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,891
2j, a dump?

46
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:03,459
If by "dump," you mean "really cool."

47
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:08,461
As you know, the palmwoods
is home of the future famous.

48
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:14,175
Do you know how many showbiz legends
have stayed in this very room?

49
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,614
Do you know how many stains and
smells there are in this very room?

50
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:21,149
If you spill, it's a stain.

51
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,007
When Lindsay Lohan
throws up chocolate milk,

52
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,393
it's history.

53
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,971
And this slight blemish,

54
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:32,722
the result of a Shia
LaBeouf indoor soccer game.

55
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,750
No soccer in the rooms.

56
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:39,105
And are you telling me
that you're too good

57
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:43,093
for the tv enjoyed by Kanye West

58
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:46,769
when he was known around
here as lil' Kanye West?

59
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,872
Can we at least paint the place?

60
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:53,422
No, 'cause your lease specifically
states that there will be no painting...

61
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:58,169
No hanging of personal pictures

62
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:00,109
I'll allow this one.

63
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,444
No construction of any kind.

64
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:06,005
And there is no way I am putting
four hockey-playing hooligans

65
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,422
into one of my finer apartments.

66
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:12,927
So installing an indoor swirly slide
is completely out of the question?

67
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:16,676
This matter, like this door, is closed.

68
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,316
I'm surprised the pipe didn't burst.

69
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:22,838
Pipe just burst.

70
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,884
Yep.

71
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,134
We need a new crib.

72
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,458
Yeah, right, like that's just
gonna fall from the sky.

73
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,771
We call it the ultimate teen crib.

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,381
Filled with amazing home
electronics, arcade games...

75
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,052
A swirly slide!

76
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,719
Cool, right?

77
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,782
Put a swirly slide in my office.

78
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,974
Griffin, I don't know what this is,

79
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:48,265
but I need to work with
the dogs on harmonies today.

80
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,589
Change your plans.

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,165
Our ancient japanese founder, Mr. Fujizaki,
wants to dump our music division.

82
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:58,032
But your boys are going
to change his mind.

83
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,458
- And we get to live in there?
- Yes...

84
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,732
For two hours.

85
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,219
But you have to do a promotional video,

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,929
surrounded by rcm/cbt/
global net/sanyoid products,

87
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,186
which will show Fujizaki
why our future rock stars

88
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:14,442
are perfect for selling his blenders,
plasma tvs, and missile defense systems.

89
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,094
Oh, and do some interviews.

90
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:18,691
You know, why they love to
sing, why they wear that helmet,

91
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,767
and why they love rcm/cbt/
global net/sanyoid arcade games,

92
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:28,760
industrial-strength playground slides,
and the new xz5 micro laptop.

93
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,396
Look how tiny.

94
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:33,294
And we could all wear bandannas.
It could be our thing.

95
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,068
Bandannas.

96
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,492
Griffin, you can't keep coming
into my studio every day

97
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,517
and interrupting my training sessions.

98
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:42,970
Yes, I can.

99
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,366
And do the interviews by the water.

100
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,659
Fujizaki thinks water is lucky.

101
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,272
It's weird.

102
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:52,304
But you want a performance
in the teen hangout crib thing.

103
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:53,145
Exactly.

104
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,659
And I need it in two days,

105
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,099
or the music division will be gone.

106
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,389
But have fun with it.

107
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,407
Okay, we'll build the teenage crib
here in studio "a."

108
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,191
I'll find a nice beach
location for the interviews

109
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,940
and put in some calls for a hot director.

110
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,332
I'm a hot director.

111
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,761
And we're doing everything here,

112
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:14,268
because it's easier,
quicker, and cheaper.

113
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,609
You, I want to show you where
you're gonna build this thing.

114
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,602
No. No way. It's impossible.

115
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,774
A week ago, we were a
hockey team in Minnesota.

116
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,543
And today we're a band in L.A.

117
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:35,871
Anything is possible.

118
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:39,523
Okay, you have a point.
But how are we gonna get all this in here?

119
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,665
Take any color you want.

120
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,026
We're not wearing bandannas
in the video, okay?

121
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:47,307
You know what? You guys never support
my risky fashion choices.

122
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:49,874
Now, the first ste is
getting the set designer

123
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:54,086
to build the ultrateen crib here
and not rocque records.

124
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,448
Yeah, that's simple.

125
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,038
And how are we gonna do that?

126
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:02,691
Logan, are you forgetting that
palmwoods is home of the future famous?

127
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:06,756
Wait for it.

128
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,961
Trevor, I trusted you with my heart,

129
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:12,878
my soul, my money.

130
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,584
- Camille.
- What?

131
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,546
We need to borrow your acting.

132
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:17,789
Sure.

133
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,304
I need this installed by 3:00 P.M. tomorrow
at the palmwoods, not rocque records.

134
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,163
Can you do it?

135
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:27,907
Because if you can't,
Mr. Griffin will find somebody who can.

136
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:31,441
Yeah, it's all pre-built here.
And the paint will be dry by 3:00.

137
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,492
Good.

138
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,439
Call Mr. Griffin on this number only,

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,611
if you have any more questions
or run into any problems.

140
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:39,516
Back to work, everybody.

141
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,484
Arthur Griffin's office.

142
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,391
One moment, please.

143
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,016
Do your Griffin impression now.

144
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:51,861
Ow!

145
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,331
Hello?

146
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,710
Uh-huh.

147
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,771
Yes.

148
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,299
Move that set to the palmwoods, now.

149
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,455
Okay, I need to touch my llama now. Bye.

150
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:02,470
- Yes!
- Yes!

151
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,885
I owned them in there.

152
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:06,813
All you've done is set us up for big-time trouble.

153
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,230
Oh, our little logey,

154
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,231
so pessimistic.

155
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,447
So scared of everything.

156
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,496
And so hot.

157
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,102
Okay.

158
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,196
And I'm not scared.

159
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:20,062
I'm realistic, as in, what
are you gonna tell your mom

160
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,874
about the crew that'll
be invading your apartment

161
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,914
tomorrow from 11:00 to 3:00?

162
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,063
Hey, I almost forgot.

163
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:26,479
I'm gonna go look for a job tomorrow,

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,275
so I'll be gone from
about 11:00 to 3:00.

165
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,742
Okay, that happened, but what now?

166
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,399
I have no idea.

167
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,469
Frankly, I can't
believe we got this far.

168
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,618
Hey, look.

169
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,963
Wrist-dannas.

170
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,306
Okay, our next worry is Gustavo.

171
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:49,763
We need to find someone
who can think like him.

172
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:52,235
Someone who can get inside his head.

173
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,450
Where are we gonna find
someone that devious?

174
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:59,245
First, you're gonna need more
future stars from the palmwoods.

175
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,138
I recommend the Jennifers
for their lack of fear.

176
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,389
Next, you'll need cordless power tools,

177
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,252
sawdust, cool code phrases, and...

178
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,515
Wait, Katie.

179
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,025
Where did you get the whiteboard?

180
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,529
Speaking of bitters, you have
to keep him in his cage all day.

181
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,017
But the key to this
whole ultra 2-j makeover

182
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,467
is convincing Gustavo to shoot
the interviews by the pool

183
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,703
like that dog food
commercial last night.

184
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:35,065
Right. And once our teen dream
remodeling is complete,

185
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:39,937
he'll have no time and no choice but to shoot
our rock performance right here.

186
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,703
And I get the first turn
on the swirly slide.

187
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,234
I get first turn on the swirly slide.

188
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:45,483
- I do!
- No, I do!

189
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,892
You can go together.

190
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:51,517
Let's do this.

191
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,125
We're not wearing bandannas.

192
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,613
Bandannas are cool.

193
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:09,172
You cannot shoot against this.

194
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,498
Yes, I can.

195
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,853
Fujizaki is gonna know
that water is fake.

196
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,008
Fujizaki is 200 years old.

197
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,665
All he knows is what yogurt he likes.

198
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,739
Oh, yeah, and I say so!

199
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,641
He's in a bad mood.
Abort mission.

200
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:26,160
Just stay cool.
If we fail, we fail.

201
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,548
Heel.

202
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:29,497
Stay.

203
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,110
Speak.

204
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,395
We took some pictures of the pool
at the palmwoods,

205
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:34,938
the greatest pool ever,

206
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,863
very lucky water.

207
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,562
It's a great location
for the interviews.

208
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,157
Hot directors shoot there all the time.

209
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,469
Swirly slide!

210
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:47,013
Oh, the dogs are directing my video now.

211
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:50,138
Well, let me tell you how it works here.

212
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,376
You are the dogs, and I am the trainer.

213
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:55,672
Now, sit.

214
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,090
Don't sit.

215
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,388
This pool looks great.

216
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,949
And it's close enough that
we could be back here by 3:00

217
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,547
to shoot the performance at
the ultrateen hangout place.

218
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:11,527
- Yeah.
- So smart.

219
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,609
Oh, yeah!

220
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,639
No yeah!

221
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,635
You do what I say,
and I say no, no, no!

222
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,923
Hey, let's do the interviews
at the palmwoods.

223
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:31,236
Here's the check for the location fees.
And thanks for making this happen.

224
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:35,568
There's also a "making this happen" fee
for me making this happen.

225
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,268
$500?

226
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,220
I'll be in my office if you need me.

227
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,055
Mwah!

228
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:54,874
The bird is in the cage,
and the Jennifers are in place.

229
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,695
Okay, team, remember your missions.

230
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,851
James, you stall Gustavo.

231
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,620
Carlos, Katie, and Camille,
you head to rocque records

232
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:08,277
and fake build the ultrateen crib while
Logan and I install the swirly slide

233
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:09,800
and all those other electronic goodies.

234
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,138
Okay, James is up first.

235
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,002
I'll shoot the rest of you dogs later.

236
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,356
Move out.

237
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,030
Okay, I'm headed over to rocque records.

238
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,373
They should be building the crib now.

239
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:27,465
And be nice to the boys.
And stop calling them dogs.

240
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:31,589
Kelly, here's a secret
that you need to learn:

241
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:35,138
All talent are dogs!

242
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,318
And dogs need to know who's in charge,

243
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,079
or they will not listen to commands

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,123
and poop on your carpet.

245
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,362
Just be back at the studio
with the boys at 3:00.

246
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,406
James, sit.

247
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,111
Take off that bandanna.

248
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,737
<i>Take off that bandanna.</i>

249
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:07,515
Ah!

250
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,582
- Whoa, whoa
- Whoa!

251
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,735
Where do you think
you're going, little lady?

252
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,174
I'm Kelly Wainright.

253
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:21,297
- I need to check on the ultrateen crib.
- Sorry, can't come in.

254
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:22,397
No hard hat.

255
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,812
Liability.

256
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,884
Oh, well, I'll just get some coffee.

257
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:31,182
Come back later.

258
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:44,969
Was the eye black really necessary?

259
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,977
No.

260
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,766
The music really sets
the tone, don't you think?

261
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,294
Jennifer, you're up.

262
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,734
Just to be clear,
we get to be in the video,

263
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,525
which will be seen by a lot of people, right?

264
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,622
Are you kidding?

265
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:05,090
It's gonna be seen in Japan.

266
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,360
Welcome to the palmwoods.

267
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:11,515
Elevators are that way.

268
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:13,796
And please do your best to remain quiet.

269
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:16,248
We wouldn't want to
disturb our other residents.

270
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,141
I still say this is a bad idea.

271
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:30,910
Hey, a life without risk
is a life unlived, my friend.

272
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:34,457
Now off to apartment 2-j.

273
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,547
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

274
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,437
So far, so good.

275
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:45,109
Look, I told you there
was nothing to worry about.

276
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,147
I love being a part of the
rcm/cbt/ global net/sanyoid family.

277
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:51,471
But I hate their hair dryers.

278
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:52,314
Cut!

279
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:54,992
Just say what's on the card!

280
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:58,188
Why? They've completely
ignored ionized technology.

281
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:02,681
You have said nothing that I can use
in the last two hours.

282
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:07,641
And in no way am I
purposely stalling you.

283
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,816
Where'd you get that bandanna?

284
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:11,086
A waffle?
No, thanks.

285
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,425
I already ate.

286
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,268
Ah!

287
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:19,715
Ah!

288
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:23,653
It's the set designer.

289
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,102
I'm worried.

290
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:26,871
Uh, Griffin?

291
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,247
No.

292
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,409
Ow!

293
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,931
- Hello?
- Yeah, the room's too small.

294
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:36,834
So if you want that swirly slide to fit,
we're gonna have to bust into the ceiling.

295
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,020
Is that okay?

296
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,274
Break through the ceiling?
No, no. We'll be arrested.

297
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:43,682
Uh, sir, can we demolish the ceiling?

298
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,996
Yes.

299
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,681
Rip it up, boys.

300
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:52,095
You better be right about
this taking risks thing.

301
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,151
Fire in the hole!

302
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,339
Code red, code red!

303
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,567
Bitters is on his way.

304
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,584
What is going on up here?

305
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,488
Please tell me you guys
are good at teen scream horror flicks.

306
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,925
They're desperate.

307
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,228
We want talking parts
in your next three videos.

308
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,103
You do all our ironing
for the next month.

309
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,089
And we sing backup on your next track.

310
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,129
Done.

311
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,616
Where's the ketchup?

312
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:32,954
The refrigerator you
installed fell on us!

313
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:35,918
Do you know how bad blood stains?

314
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,889
And now we're gonna run to our
lawyers and sue the palmwoods.

315
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,389
No, no, no. Please don't sue.

316
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,155
Don't sue!

317
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,372
Don't sue!

318
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:49,711
They're good.

319
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:59,401
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

320
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, the batteries died out.

321
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,760
Hey, is the set done?

322
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,998
Sorry, lady. Just a minute.

323
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,233
I need to see the set now, please.

324
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,306
Yeah.

325
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:11,624
No!

326
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,058
Carlos?

327
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,098
No! This is not Carlos.

328
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,691
Please go away.

329
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:19,706
Ah!

330
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,364
I am getting security.

331
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,558
And you really think this is gonna work?

332
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,299
It works in cartoons.

333
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:30,134
Okay, bitters is gone,

334
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:33,014
and we just have to keep Gustavo
occupied for one more hour.

335
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,576
I can't believe it.
I think we're actually gonna make it.

336
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,092
I'm not even scared.

337
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:45,172
Why are the Jennifers dripping ketchup
all over my palmwoods?

338
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,393
- Hey.
- Dogs, interviews now!

339
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,621
Ah!

340
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:59,201
All done with my long interview.

341
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,592
Bitters. Code red, code red!

342
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:21,115
This is my house.
You play by my rules.

343
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,686
- Rah!
- Ah!

344
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,438
And they said bandannas weren't cool?

345
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:43,616
I need to check on the ultrateen crib.

346
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,051
Oh, no.

347
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,049
I love all rcm/cbt/
global netsanyoid products.

348
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,238
And I hope to fill my
room with them someday...

349
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,269
Soon.

350
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,281
And cut.

351
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,678
That was amazing.

352
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,560
What?

353
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:12,497
What?

354
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,375
Yeah, it came out really good, huh?

355
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,234
Uh...

356
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:21,110
It came out amazing.

357
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:22,914
Swirly slide!

358
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,622
Whoo!

359
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,469
Ah.

360
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:30,640
Eh.

361
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:33,224
There's no time to move
the set back to the studio.

362
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,547
Uh.

363
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:42,518
And the video has to be great for Fujizaki,
or we are out of a job.

364
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,107
Uh!

365
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:54,059
Light it and shoot it!

00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,842

367
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:01,403
cut! Print!
And strike the set.

368
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,103
What's going on?

369
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,203
No, where are they going with that?

370
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:07,407
- Where you going with that?
- Back to the warehouse.

371
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:08,691
The whole couch?

372
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,985
- Come on.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

373
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:13,880
Did you dogs think you were
gonna get to keep this stuff?

374
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,595
Swirly!

375
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:19,817
Oh, that's really, really good.

376
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,141
The little dogs thought
they outsmarted the big dog.

377
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,282
Take down that cool thing.

378
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, come on. The couch?

379
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,235
What? My slide.

380
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:37,449
Oh.

381
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,685
But I do have to admit,

382
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:45,408
we did get some pretty
great stuff today.

383
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:49,860
Let's just hope Fujizaki
thinks so tomorrow.

We love singing.

391
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,178

I'm not afraid to take a risk,

400
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:32,961
much like rcm's 64 bit
core risc processor.

401
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:34,648

I like the boys.

- Yeah!
- Yes!

405
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,870
I've never seen Fujizaki so excited.

406
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,603
Frankly, I think it's the
first time I've seen him move.

407
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,107
You were a good boy today, Gustavo.

408
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:01,950
Good boy.

409
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:11,783
So we learned a lot here today, didn't we?

410
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:13,824
You did some things.

411
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:15,282
We did some things.

412
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:18,520
Ten hours of harmonies!

413
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,427
No breaks!

414
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:21,902
Move out!

415
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,408
Hey!

416
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,904
Well, I love what you've done
with the place.

417
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,293
Uh...

418
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,896
Good job today.

419
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,820
This is awesome.

420
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,544
This is a bone.

421
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,451
Come again?

422
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,600
I realized today, sort of,

423
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:03,495
that if you really want
to train dogs properly,

424
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,133
you need to throw them
a treat now and then.

425
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,263
So enjoy your treat.

426
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,727
You're not getting any more.

427
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,465
And we lost a day of rehearsal
because of the shoot,

428
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:16,663
so it's at the studio, 7:30 a.M.

429
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:17,998
We'll be there. No problem.

430
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,854
We promise, no more surprises.

431
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,088
You've altered this room.

432
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:33,512
You've completely
devastated this apartment.

433
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:36,044
You locked him in the supply closet?

434
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,093
No.

435
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,929
Bandanna man did.

436
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,721
This is a total lease violation.

437
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,227
Man, cool swirly slide.

438
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,576
I want all of you out of here tomorrow.

439
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:51,075
What if I add another grand
to your "making it happen" fee?

440
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:53,292
Have a palmwoods day, everyone.

441
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,514
Enjoy your stay.

442
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,179
You like them.

443
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:02,900
They're not like other bands
you've produced, are they?

444
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,666
They're dogs, and I'm training them.

445
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:10,745
I don't like them!
