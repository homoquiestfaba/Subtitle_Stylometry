00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,002
Lovingly cooked by BakeMaster

4
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,099
(Audience talking)

5
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,203
(Orchestra tuning up)

6
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,158
(Baton tapping)

7
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,270
(People whispering...shhh)

8
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,703
(Clears throat)

9
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:22,708
The story you are about to see,
has been told before.

10
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:24,352
A lot.

11
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,833
And now we are going to tell it, again.

12
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,349
But different.

13
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:30,693
It's about two star crossed lovers,

14
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,503
kept apart by a big feud.

15
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:35,179
No one knows how this feud started,

16
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,652
but it's all quite entertaining.

17
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:40,106
Unfortunately, before we begin.

18
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:43,944
There is a rather long boring prologue,
which I will read to you now.

19
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,135
(Clears throat)

20
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:47,962
Two households.

21
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,862
Both alike in dignity.

22
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,429
In fair Verona.

23
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,971
Where we lay our scene.

24
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,432
From ancient grudge.

25
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,671
Break to new mutiny.

26
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,730
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

27
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:06,319
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.

28
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,360
Ah Mrs. Montague. How you just love to ruin my day.

29
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,310
My Sisters dear cardigan Mr. Capulet, it suits you.

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,195
-Feisty old hag.
-Grumbly old codger.

31
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,258
Oink...oink

32
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,149
(Rooster crows)

33
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,374
Oh, great.

34
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,502
I got one! I got one!

35
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,277
I got one! I got one!

36
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,429
(Moans) Oh.

37
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,616
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.

38
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
Huh, Tybalt!

39
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,625
(Choking)

40
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,554
Hold on. Blues are at it again.

41
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,382
Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.

42
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,833
Lady Blueberry

43
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,996
Your tulips are looking a little limp this
year, aren't they.

44
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,758
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.

45
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,573
The proper word is 'insinuating'.

46
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,046
Illiterate.

47
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,456
I am not illiterate.

48
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,300
My parents were married!

49
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,150
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.

50
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,596
(Giggles)

51
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,011
'Shroom all clear?

52
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,811
Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

53
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,334
Gnomeo, it's your mum.

54
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,094
-Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.

55
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,716
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.

56
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,969
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,

57
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,607
...our beautiful, beautiful garden,

58
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,998
from this angle?

59
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,275
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.

60
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,993
That tree was your father's pride and joy.

61
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,270
May he rest in pieces.

62
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh, how you remind me of him.

63
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,078
Oh which is why I wanted to say.

64
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,197
I know, I know. My chores.

65
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,420
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting consider it all done.

66
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,560
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!

67
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,556
...done.

68
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,174
All I wanted to say was...

69
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,285
Good luck.

70
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:18,085
Thanks, mom.

71
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,596
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.

72
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,297
Red, I hate the word.

73
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,482
Wow.

74
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,014
A Cupids Arrow orchid.

75
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,771
Oh, Juliet!

76
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,457
Oh!
Whoa!

77
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,926
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.

78
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,241
Oh, you want to get smashed?

79
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,928
A flower that will put that
blue garden to shame.

80
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,177
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.

81
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,436
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...

82
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,706
Uh, I am a Red after all.

83
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,276
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was.

84
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,360
Bless her to bits.

85
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,337
Now, back where you belong.

86
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,166
I  can't just stay tucked away on
this pedestal all my life.

87
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,557
Don't you see.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,062
When will you realize you're delicate.

89
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,963
I'm not delicate.

90
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,899
She's definitely not delicate.

91
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,880
Stubborn girl.

92
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,934
Oh, right.

93
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,228
Delicate, hmm.

94
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,159
I'll show him who's delicate.

95
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,282
(Gnomes cheering)

96
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,015
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

97
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,867
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.

98
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,510
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
-Okay boys,  ya all know the rules.

99
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,289
And I don't need to repeat them, but I'm gonna.

100
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,628
'Cus I wanna.

101
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,674
And here they are.

102
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,767
No biting, no scratching, no kicking.

103
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,358
No burping, no slurping, no prancing.

104
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,704
No squalling, no laughing,
no heeing, no hawing.

105
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,358
And more than anything...

106
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,169
nooo cheating!

107
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,769
No cheating?
Hey, that's not fair.

108
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,956
*Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)*
-On your marks.

109
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,752
Get going.

110
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:18,201
*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*

111
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:24,429
*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*

112
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:30,477
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*

113
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,077
*My sister looks cute in her braces and boots.
A handful of grease in her hair.*

114
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:45,643
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*

115
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:51,354
*Whoa, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in.*

116
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:57,365
*Get about as oiled as a diesel train.
Gonna set this dance alight.*

117
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:05,328
*Cause Saturday night's the night I like.
Saturday night's all right, all right, all right.*

118
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,955
*Woo, oo, ooo.*

119
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,607
(Sings in tune with Saturday)
*Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.*

120
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,649
(Sings in tune with Saturday)
*Tybalt, Tybalt.*

121
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:18,703
*Saturday, Saturday, Saturday.*

122
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:21,132
*Saturday night's all right.*

123
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,208
*Saturday...*

124
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,328
(Taunting laugh)

125
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,813
-(Laughs)
-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.

126
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,546
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.

127
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,282
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.

128
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,618
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-Huh?

129
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,721
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.

130
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,551
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.

131
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:02,983
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth
is getting even bigger than your hat.

132
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,633
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.

133
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,517
Yeah, the 'finish' line.

134
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,811
Adios, loser.

135
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,261
(Taunting laughter)

136
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,876
Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.

137
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,208
No body won't come out.

138
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:23,685
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.

139
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,901
(Crowd angrily shouting)

140
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,894
Well if he won't come out.

141
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,908
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-(Benny gasps in shock)

142
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,831
(Crowd gasps in shock.)

143
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,935
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.

144
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,485
Then I say. It's about time someone did.

145
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,199
And payback is gonna be fun.

146
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,602
'Shroom, lets go kick some grass.

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,719
This mission into Red garden territory,

148
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,351
is gonna require maximum stealth.

149
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,996
Well you won't get much stealthier than this.

150
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:15,796
Hello.

151
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,666
(Ball in spray can rattles)
(Benny giggles)

152
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,218
(Snoring)
Mumbles: I got one.

153
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,991
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

154
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,369
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.

155
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,990
(Whines) Oh.

156
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,840
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

157
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,858
(Dog growling)

158
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,061
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.

159
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:19,836
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.

160
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,225
And I'm going to need you to cover me.

161
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,116
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.

162
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,965
I'm washing my hair. I don't have hair.

163
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,273
He'll know it's a lie.

164
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:31,307
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.

165
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,949
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

166
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,951
I'll be quick.

167
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,980
-(Gasps in fright)
-Growling.

168
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,905
-(Barking)
-(Juliet screams)

169
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,370
Out, out!

170
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,236
Ben stop, over here boy.

171
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,792
Wow! That was quick.

172
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,129
I'm to easy to see.

173
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,007
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.

174
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,167
Oooo, a new outfit.

175
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,276
I'm on it.

176
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,099
Here.

177
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,481
That is cute.

178
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:00,963
Give it a turn.

179
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,979
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.

180
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,426
Now go get your flower.

181
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,861
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?

182
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,237
How much less?

183
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,723
Try black.

184
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,779
Aaaaaaah!

185
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:30,002
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you
any attention in that.

186
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:31,196
Then it's perfect.

187
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:41,456
Oooo,
(Speaking Japanese)

188
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,556
I'm going in.

189
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,995
Take care.

190
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:57,351
I'm telling your Dad you're doing your hair.

191
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,359
Let's play a game.

192
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,353
I'm thinking of a movie.

193
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,173
It's a...it's one word.

194
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,841
And it starts with a...'spider'.

195
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,349
All: Is it, Spiderman?

196
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,621
Oh you're good, okay.

197
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,234
Great, I love going commando.

198
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,179
Shh, I know, just the key.

199
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:42,731
(Can on back rattling)

200
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,057
(Can rattles)

201
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,347
Shhh.

202
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:56,983
(Can rattle's loudly)

203
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,508
Okay, I have another one.

204
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,732
Two words.
The first word is 'Spiderman'.

205
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,890
All: Spiderman Two?

206
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,069
Okay, who's cheating?

207
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,352
Benny, give me the paint.

208
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,609
Benny?

209
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:23,858
No!

210
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:27,892
(Snoring.)

211
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,514
(Shakes can, ball rattling.)
-Benny!

212
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,518
Benny!

213
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:43,991
-Huh?
-Huh?

214
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,633
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.

215
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,475
Run for it, now.

216
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:57,422
Where did he go?

217
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,928
He's in the begonia's.

218
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,135
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.

219
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,155
Find him!

220
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,556
-Not here.
-Not here, either.

221
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,608
Nothing but Pansies here.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Come on.

223
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,969
Hold on.

224
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,947
Whoa, whoooa!

225
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,970
-Hey, Benny
-What?

226
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,140
-See you on the other side.
-Gnomeo!

227
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,554
Ah, ha, ha.

228
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,546
Hmm.

229
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:55,844
(Growls in anger)

230
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,234
I wish I could stay but...

231
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:06,316
...gotta fly.

232
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!

233
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:24,908
Huh!

234
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,132
(Birds chirping)

235
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,540
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*

236
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,568
*Feel I'm feeling light*

237
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,668
*I like to see the sights.*

238
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,227
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*

239
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,916
*Ducking up and down*

240
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:08,669
*All these crazy sights and sounds*

241
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,874
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*

242
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:20,120
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*

243
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:24,269
*Famous last lines of a fool*

244
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,104
*Just when you think.*

245
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,872
*Your chain is just one link.*

246
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:35,371
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*

247
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,310
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

248
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,062
*My, my, my what have we here?*

249
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,183
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

250
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,712
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

251
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,734
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*

252
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:56,206
*Someone's out there saying hello.*

253
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,834
*Heeeellooooo.*

254
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,505
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.

255
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,208
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.

256
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:09,777
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't my garden.

257
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,782
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.

258
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,225
-Oh, this?
-Yes.

259
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,555
I don't know. I think I'm going to
have to keep ahold of this one.

260
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,762
What? But I saw it first.

261
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:22,866
So why don't you just hand it over.

262
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,441
Well I grabbed it first.

263
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,252
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

264
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,602
But if you want it.

265
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,546
-Come and get it.
-All right.

266
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,950
Thanks.

267
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,006
Aaaah!

268
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,401
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.

269
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,420
What, and miss this view?

270
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,865
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?

271
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Whoa!

272
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,095
Who's your Gno-me now?

273
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,665
*Hello, Hello. Hello, Hello*
-Hey!

274
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,573
*My, my, my what have we here?*

275
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:59,886
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

276
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:02,092
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*

277
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:05,360
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*

278
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:10,074
*Someone's out there saying, hello*

279
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,420
*Hello.*

280
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:18,577
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*

281
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:21,145
*Hello, hello.*

282
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,755
*Heeeellooooo.*

283
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:27,999
*Hello, hellooooooooooo.*

284
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,257
Oh no, he's a blue.

285
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,345
Not a blue.

286
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:08,035
Juliet. Your not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?

287
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:12,446
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same
question, Tybalt.

288
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,036
We're looking for a blue Gnome.

289
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,640
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.

290
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,613
Got a scratch, right here.

291
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,430
And his name's Gnomeo.

292
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,551
You haven't seen him, have you?

293
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,248
Uhhhhooo, um.

294
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,435
Uhh, he sounds awful no.

295
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,766
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.

296
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,986
Well lucky you.

297
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,850
Come on, let's get inside.

298
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,612
Juliet.

299
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,234
A red.

300
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,329
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?

301
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,382
Sooo, where is the oh so important,
life changing orchid?

302
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,389
Um...

303
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,345
Um...

304
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,717
What, what orchid?

305
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:20,688
What?

306
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,115
Hmmm?

307
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:24,766
Shut up!

308
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,110
You met a boy.

309
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,693
What? No! Well maybe...

310
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:32,537
Sort of, um...yes!

311
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,786
Yes I did.

312
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,793
I need details.

313
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,606
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?

314
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,184
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?

315
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,921
Well let's call it sturdy.

316
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,274
And his uh..(Whistles up)

317
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,201
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?

318
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:51,296
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.

319
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,516
You might say it looks sort of...

320
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:54,868
...blue.

321
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,096
Blue.

322
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,616
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.

323
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:05,768
(Madly laughs)

324
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,508
No, I don't get it.

325
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:12,923
(Gasps) Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep,
you cannot take with a blue.

326
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,883
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.

327
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:15,980
Zzzzip.

328
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,803
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!

329
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:24,430
-Is it?
-It's doomed.

330
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,952
-What?
-A red and a blue.

331
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:28,949
It just can't be.

332
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,297
So it's a doomed love.

333
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,405
And that's the best kind.

334
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:34,913
You'll never see him again.

335
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:39,184
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".

336
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,098
"I only saw him once".

337
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,119
(Gasps and moans with sorrow)

338
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,920
(Whines, moans, and groans with longing and pain)

339
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll only see...what do you mean?

340
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,549
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.

341
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,674
How romantically tragic.

342
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,544
Your love is doomed.

343
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,869
Your love is dead.

344
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,115
Your love is doomed.

345
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,378
Your love is dead.

346
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,847
It's doomed.

347
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:08,195
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?

348
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,233
Dooomed!

349
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,239
I've never seen Lord Redbrick so riled up.

350
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,592
We have to find Gnomeo.

351
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,814
Let's split up.

352
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,173
(Sighs) I wish I could quit ya.

353
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,356
Both: Hmm.

354
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:32,397
Oh well.

355
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:33,445
Let's go fishing.

356
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,814
All right, mate.

357
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,908
Go find, Gnomeo.

358
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,400
Doomed!
Dead!

359
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,493
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.

360
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,888
Oh, Gnomeo.

361
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:09,956
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.

362
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,558
To never see each other again?

363
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,754
Why must you wear a blue hat?

364
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:16,207
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or...

365
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,580
green like a leprechaun, or...

366
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,346
or purple like, um...

367
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:23,621
like uh, like some weird guy.

368
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:24,808
I mean what's in a Gnome?

369
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,780
Because you're blue my father sees red,
and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.

370
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,982
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing
to keep us apart.

371
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,413
-Should it?
-No, no! It shouldn't.

372
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:35,058
I couldn't have said it better myself.

373
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,587
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?

374
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,781
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...

375
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,903
I came here, to...

376
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,751
Well. I don't know I just wanted to see you again.

377
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:46,097
Are you crazy?

378
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,914
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.

379
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,806
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.

380
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,329
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

381
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,229
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.

382
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,939
I'm trying.

383
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,926
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

384
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:07,923
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Do something.
-The button's stuck.

385
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,390
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*

386
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,120
Ah, Juliet!

387
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:16,318
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.

388
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,633
There's somebody behind you!

389
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,891
'Shroom!

390
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,012
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!

391
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,141
Juliet! What's the ....

392
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,050
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.

393
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:27,896
Excuse me, little help here.

394
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,629
My dad's coming.

395
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,704
So, you must be, Gnomeo.

396
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:32,968
Lovely to meet you.

397
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,157
Even though it's seconds,
before you're discovered and killed.

398
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,494
-Quick, hide.
-Juliet!

399
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:40,570
I told you before, no music in the
grotto after ten o'clock.

400
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,540
What's going on here?

401
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,178
Um, It was a...

402
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,006
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.

403
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:50,066
And he...he...

404
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,148
...dropped his nuts.

405
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,239
Yes, nuts.
The size of boulders.

406
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,341
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.

407
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:58,944
Well, okay. But no mucking about.

408
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,184
Especially not tonight.

409
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,259
We've been attacked.
By a blue!

410
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,530
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?

411
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,560
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.

412
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,486
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.

413
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,267
Lord Redbrick, I've been having
problems with my...(Mumbles incoherently)

414
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,575
-Your what?
-(Mumbles incoherently)

415
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,791
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.

416
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,833
It's not ideal.

417
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,953
-But I...
-Just go.

418
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,136
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.

419
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,553
-Um...
-What?

420
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,709
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!

421
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,217
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?

422
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,642
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.

423
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,553
I mean it's just as pondy as ever. (Laughs)

424
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,848
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?

425
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,087
What? What was it?

426
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,182
-That thing, over there.
-What did it look like?

427
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,412
-Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.

428
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:45,483
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince,
and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, whatever.

429
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,873
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

430
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,269
(Dejected) Oh!

431
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:58,185
(Hopeful) Oh.

432
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,200
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?

433
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,928
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.

434
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,984
What?

435
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:06,928
Whoa!

436
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:11,016
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.

437
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,673
Thank you.

438
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,337
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.

439
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,246
No, really. I'm stuck.

440
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,693
(Both Laugh)

441
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,677
So, uh, heh...

442
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,071
Can I see you again tomorrow?

443
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:41,503
Yes, but not here.

444
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,972
Back in the old Lawrence place then?

445
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,426
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.

446
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:45,573
I can do 11:45.

447
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:46,523
Done.

448
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:48,053
That frog was right.

449
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:50,889
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

450
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,385
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you,
when he finds how much you weigh.

451
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:06,043
Shroom, you see this face?

452
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:07,783
It's a happy Gnome face.

453
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:09,211
Now come here.

454
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,550
Come on.

455
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,016
(Miss Montague singing happily)

456
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,237
Outrage, infamy!

457
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,235
The gardening gloves are off then,
are they?

458
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,782
You, wrecking my mower.

459
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,963
Dear lady, you are insane in the brain.

460
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,123
I never thought that you'd
stoop to such a level.

461
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:51,251
Oh, and by the way, kindly stop
stealing my underwear.

462
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:54,803
In your dreams, you jacked off cabbage.

463
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:58,265
Oh, how could she do this to Tybalts wishing well?

464
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,775
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.

465
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,044
Why would anyone ever pick on you?

466
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:07,952
Who thinks I should order the best, new lawnmower?

467
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,846
Money can buy.

468
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,151
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?

469
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:21,885
All: Because nobody likes him.

470
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,111
-(Growls)
-So what are we going to do?

471
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,745
Find their weak spot.

472
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,972
Then what are we going to do?

473
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,250
Damage.

474
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,950
Lot's and lot's of damage.

475
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:43,388
(Both evilly laughing)

476
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,967
(Keys tapping)
Right.

477
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,533
Mess with me will you, Capulet.

478
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,785
I'll show him what, that old pompous.

479
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:05,533
It's not over, not by a long shot.

480
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,947
Yeah, uh, right. What have we got here?

481
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:14,009
Show the world the mighty web ....

482
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,439
Oh, no. No, no, not good.

483
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,857
Pick one.

484
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,830
-Yes, that one.
-No.

485
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,789
Oh, yes that one.

486
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:23,627
What's this?

487
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,179
Are you losing the war in your garden?

488
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,558
Well brother maybe it's time
for a secret weapon.

489
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,572
Terrafirminator!

490
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:34,444
It's the most useless, 500 horse power...

491
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:38,030
ground dominating piece of hardware,
the world has ever seen.

492
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,962
TERRAFIRMINATOR!!

493
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,156
It's unnecessarily volatile.

494
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,186
Now with 75% more power!

495
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,110
It clears...clears.

496
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,698
It digs...digs.

497
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,309
It mulch,...Mulch

498
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,841
Your lawn will be afraid to grow.

499
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,020
Terrafirminator!

500
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,604
Get the weapon that plans destruction!

501
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,237
(Babbling side effects and disclaimers)

502
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,983
(Laughs) That one.

503
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,221
Oh my.

504
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:09,653
Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.

505
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,553
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

506
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:14,180
That's a bit in-your-face.

507
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,452
This is more my speed.

508
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:17,972
(Meow)

509
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,447
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.

510
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,289
Oh, no.

511
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,061
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*

512
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,347
Definitely not.

513
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,259
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*

514
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:48,320
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*

515
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:56,860
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*

516
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:04,109
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*

517
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:11,322
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*

518
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,855
*When I was down*

519
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,778
*I was your clown*

520
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,254
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*

521
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:25,656
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*

522
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:33,388
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*

523
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:36,253
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*

524
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,663
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

525
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:41,340
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*

526
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:43,772
*I won't go breaking your heart.*

527
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:45,742
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

528
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,857
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*

529
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:50,754
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

530
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:56,402
*Don't go breaking my.
I won't go breaking your heaaaaaaart.*

531
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:59,778
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*

532
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,398
Juliet. There you are.

533
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,496
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our
little discussion yesterday.

534
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,843
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.

535
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,387
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.

536
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:13,631
Who'll keep you safe.

537
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,254
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.

538
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,686
Yes, yes of course, why?

539
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,918
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.

540
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,497
-Dad!
-All right, all right.

541
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,199
No one will ever say I don't
know when I'm not wanted.

542
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,907
-Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.

543
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:26,561
Here it is, gypsaphilla.

544
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:29,123
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.

545
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,180
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.

546
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:35,115
You think you got it down and bram,
you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.

547
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:36,544
Even though you thought
it was a level of chalk.

548
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:37,551
Weird.

549
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:41,328
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.

550
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,209
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit,

551
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,081
rude to leave me on the first date.

552
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,770
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.

553
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,072
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.

554
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:53,676
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.

555
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,757
A small token of my affection.

556
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:57,914
Oh, wow!

557
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,663
Juliet, do you realize what this is?

558
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,825
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.

559
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,062
Oh, a love triangle.

560
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:07,366
Which I call, Foxcup.

561
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,617
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.

562
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,504
Well, I mean I guess I've got my dark side, sure.

563
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,664
Hey there, Juliet.

564
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,190
What a name, it's a great name.

565
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:19,846
Goes with your, eyes.

566
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,570
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.

567
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,865
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?

568
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,477
That's a killer, man.

569
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,474
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.

570
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,269
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?

571
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,507
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!

572
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,991
Uh, (uneasy laugh) never better.

573
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,589
Do you think anyone heard that?

574
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,855
(whispers) There's nobody here.

575
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,376
(Whispers) Then why are you whispering?

576
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,263
(Softly) Why are you whispering.

577
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,294
Oh, look at that.

578
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,798
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.

579
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:58,405
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.

580
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,829
Let's start her up.

581
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,123
Yeah, okay.

582
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,347
Check out the power on this beauty.

583
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:08,750
She's empty.

584
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:10,750
Bingo!

585
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:15,350
-Hey, try this.
-Thanks.

586
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:26,661
(Both coughing)

587
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:44,994
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

588
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:46,063
Yeah, it's me.

589
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,571
It's me, too!

590
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,589
(Both screaming)

591
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:53,446
What was that?

592
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:54,785
I have no idea.

593
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:59,098
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.

594
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,725
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.

595
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,602
And I'm not afraid to use it.

596
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,477
Do you think I scared it?

597
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,992
(Spanish accent)
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.

598
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:13,127
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.

599
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,321
(Scats) Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.

600
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,937
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.

601
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,361
And setting me free.

602
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:22,187
I love you!

603
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you know what it's like to
be trapped for thirty years?

604
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,821
All alone, by yourself.

605
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,721
No one for to talk at.

606
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:32,817
Hola, Featherstone,
como esta usted? (How are you?)

607
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,718
Ah, bueno, Featherstone,
how's the other leg?

608
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,605
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.

609
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:42,407
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?

610
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,519
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.

611
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,468
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.

612
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,754
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.

613
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,624
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.

614
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh, oh, oh. Up, up, up.
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes.

615
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:02,319
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.

616
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,512
Both: Date! No, no not dating.

617
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,470
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.

618
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,141
-Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?

619
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,963
-He's a blue.
-She's a red.

620
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,540
And I'm pink!

621
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,875
Who cares?

622
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,584
Anyway, I got to ask.

623
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:18,102
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?

624
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,068
Ohh, I know, I know.

625
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,356
Un momento, I'll be right back.

626
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,833
Juliet, wait.

627
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,424
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?

628
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,450
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.

629
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:36,602
Oh, really?

630
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,692
Yeah.

631
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,353
GO!

632
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,425
Ta da!

633
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,189
Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.

634
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,905
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...

635
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,578
We still got to do something about these weeds.

636
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,941
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.

637
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,544
Well I don't know. A weed
by any other name is still a weed.

638
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,300
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.

639
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,129
(Takes in deep breath. Blows over it)

640
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:24,171
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?

641
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,514
Kinda pass you out, huh?

642
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,014
I going to sit down now.

643
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,036
(Both laughing)

644
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,161
I've got a confession to make.

645
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,142
I've never actually driven a mower.

646
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,535
No, you're a natural.

647
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:42,331
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.

648
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,510
You know this is crazy, right?

649
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:53,202
Yeah.

650
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:56,055
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.

651
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,369
Oh and me a blue.

652
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:59,027
No way.

653
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,227
My whole life my mom raised me to
hate you guys. You reds.

654
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,142
So, this could never work.

655
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,774
Could it?

656
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,765
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.

657
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,383
Can it?

658
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,385
(Blowing)
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.

659
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,385
Oh baby, you know I
getting into this now.

660
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:20,940
See the trick is to go like... (Blows sharp)

661
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,237
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...(Blow's short)

662
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:28,928
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.

663
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:32,131
And uh, I promise.

664
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,030
Your secret is safe with me.

665
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,420
Well, should we?

666
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,565
I can do 11:45.

667
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,309
Not soon enough.

668
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:57,863
(Sighs contentedly)

669
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:03,021
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.

670
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,233
Careful there, you're going to kick something.

671
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:06,531
What's eating you?

672
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,086
Huh?

673
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:12,834
(Crying) How?

674
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
How?

675
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,276
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.

676
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:19,626
How could this have happened?

677
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,505
Well, where were you?

678
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,661
I was...

679
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,591
I was nowhere.

680
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,242
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.

681
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:34,396
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed,

682
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:35,486
the most beautiful thing we blues have.

683
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:39,314
Your father planted her.

684
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:42,566
We raised her from a seedling.

685
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,165
(Bunnies sobbing)

686
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,292
Those blasted Reds, come on.

687
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,214
We'll make them pay.

688
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,542
(Gnomes shouting for revenge)

689
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,032
Every last one of them.

690
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,282
(Shouts in anger)

691
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,550
Every last one?

692
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:11,977
(Strums Elton John's 'Your song')

693
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:18,136
*It's a little bit runny.*

694
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,403
*This pesticide.*

695
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:25,369
-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.

696
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,409
-Oh, this is painful.
-Oh, sweet torture.

697
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,022
*Don't have much money.*

698
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,391
*But, but if I did.*

699
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:39,703
*I'd buy a big house where.*

700
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:42,974
*We both could live.*

701
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:51,764
*If I was a sculptor...*
-Ooo, sexy, sexy.

702
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:58,197
*A man selling stuff for plants
it's called, Miracle grow.*

703
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:03,316
Uh, Gnomeo!

704
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:07,757
(Humming 'Rock-a-bye baby')

705
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,018
Okay.

706
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,830
Then we go need a bunch of coconuts.

707
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:35,863
Wha?

708
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:47,731
Juliet no, wait.

709
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,592
I...I um...

710
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:55,872
A blue, a blue!

711
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:57,793
-Abort, abort the mission.
-What?

712
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:00,121
-What happened.
-Ah, the muzzle jammed, let's go.

713
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:09,398
Gnomeo!

714
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Hmmm.

715
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:25,651
Such a big hat, on such a small gnome.

716
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,307
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?

717
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:31,931
Let's take this baby out into the alley.

718
00:43:31,932 --> 00:43:33,336
Then what are going to do?

719
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,010
We're gonna have a smashing time.

720
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:38,473
(Evilly laughs)

721
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:41,860
Oh come on, Juliet.
It's  not as bad as all that.

722
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:43,700
Is that your big move on a second date?

723
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,580
You wine them, dine them and
spray them with weed killer?

724
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:47,948
You got to admit, it is original.

725
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,888
Hola, my fellow funsters are back already.

726
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,598
I mean be reasonable.
I didn't have a choice...

727
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,610
...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?

728
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,677
Just a toilet in the middle of a yard,
with nothing growing out of it.

729
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,049
Oh you blues are so infuriating.

730
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,463
Wait a minute, us blues?

731
00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:03,580
So, what you guys want to do?

732
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:05,703
-Featherstone, we're busy.
-Come on guys.

733
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:09,800
-Let us have some-a fun.
-Let me tell you something about you reds.

734
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:12,908
-Us reds?
-Oh, can't we all just laugh about this?

735
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:15,157
I know the little mushroom can.

736
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:16,515
Both shout: Featherstone!

737
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:18,181
-We're in the middle of something.
-You wouldn't understand.

738
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:20,114
-We're talking.
-All right, so just leave us alone.

739
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:25,114
Right,
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:29,993
You know sometimes I get
a little over excited.

741
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:33,172
Especially having such great new friends.

742
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:35,060
Like you and...

743
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:37,495
But I know I can be a bit...

744
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:39,376
...much.

745
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,547
Wait, Featherstone.

746
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:46,524
-Hey.
-Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry.

747
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,602
I may not be a smart bird.

748
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,003
But I know what love is.

749
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:32,737
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*

750
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:39,166
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*

751
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:46,713
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*

752
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:52,113
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*

753
00:45:52,644 --> 00:45:53,644
*Then*

754
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:06,335
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*

755
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:13,200
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*

756
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:18,687
*There's only so much you can do,
to keep some things alive*

757
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:25,606
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*

758
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:32,242
*Each one of us knowing,
every inch of it was us*

759
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:39,019
*We pulled it all together,
hoping and believing.*

760
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:45,736
*That love built this garden
for the two of us to dream in.*

761
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:06,166
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.

762
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,532
And...

763
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,193
I couldn't do nothing about it.

764
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,981
But you...

765
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:16,758
...you can.

766
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:29,107
You know I think that crazy pink
plastic bird might be right.

767
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,038
What if we never went back?

768
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,479
Never go back?

769
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,205
But what about my Dad?

770
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:37,044
And Nanette and the red garden?

771
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:40,276
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.

772
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,086
But here, here we're a matching pair.

773
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:49,320
Juliet, will you stay here, and
build a garden with me?

774
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,935
I'd love to.

775
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,070
GNOMEO!

776
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:27,248
What are you doing?

777
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:31,233
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.

778
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,515
BENNY!
Benny, wait.

779
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,629
Well, well, well.

780
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,413
If it isn't little big hat, Benny.

781
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,287
Mess with the red garden, will ya.

782
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,866
BENNY!

783
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:57,986
NO!

784
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:04,638
Ooo, that felt good.

785
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:07,963
Oh no!
Oh, no.

786
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:11,493
Tybalt!

787
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,799
A hat for a hat.

788
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:21,781
Gnomeo, no!

789
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:36,662
You wouldn't attack an
unarmed Gnome, would ya?

790
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,209
Sucker.

791
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,125
Pity.

792
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,922
Tybalt, the wall.

793
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:47,944
You don't I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do ya?

794
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:49,582
Ha, ha, what wall?

795
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:56,895
Ut oh, that wall.

796
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Blast!

797
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:02,589
What was that?

798
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,614
What's happened?

799
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:08,716
Tybalt?

800
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,430
Tybalt.

801
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:12,331
Tybalt?

802
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:18,540
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.

803
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,644
(Gasps) Ooo.

804
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:30,006
Smash him hat.

805
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:34,105
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?

806
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,792
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.

807
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:37,097
No, he didn't do it.

808
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,813
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.

809
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:40,500
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.

810
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:44,934
-Catch.
-What?

811
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:52,682
Smash him back.

812
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:54,906
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!

813
00:50:58,051 --> 00:50:59,481
Stop, stop that.

814
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,690
Revenge!

815
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:12,817
Whup!

816
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,620
Woo...

817
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:47,185
-What were you doing?
-No!

818
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:48,830
-I love him.
-What?

819
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,373
Doomed.

820
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,370
Oh, someone do something.

821
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,713
(Gasp in shock)

822
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,137
Gnomeo!

823
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,319
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.

824
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,817
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.

825
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:12,069
(Sobs) He's gone.

826
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:23,131
(Crying) Oh Gnomeo.
(Sobs) No, no not Gnomeo.

827
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:25,257
Let's get you home now.

828
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:29,127
Oh, my poor, poor boy.

829
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,451
Hmm?

830
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:57,401
Stay, stay!

831
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:58,416
Good boy.

832
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,711
Shroom!
Shroooooom!

833
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:48,805
(Panting)

834
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:58,762
No!

835
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:14,187
-A gnome?
-Yeah, Mate.

836
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,459
It looks like your sister.

837
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:43,630
You left me no choice, Juliet.

838
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:45,702
I've lost your mother.

839
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:47,917
I am not going to lose you.

840
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:55,636
(Sadly) Mmmm.

841
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,192
Hmm?

842
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:07,469
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.

843
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,190
All right, we've got to
avenge, Gnomeo.

844
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:11,555
Here's what we're going to do.

845
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,429
Now...(Mumbles softly)

846
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:16,647
No, not now Shroom.

847
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:18,178
(Continues to softly confer)

848
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:19,478
Right, got it.

849
00:56:34,536 --> 00:56:37,903
Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.

850
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:39,404
What, what you trying to say?

851
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,648
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?

852
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,964
No, did he jump?

853
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,153
Little Mustafa?

854
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:47,457
Little Richard, what?

855
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:53,694
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.

856
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,764
Well what?

857
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,728
Oh, no.

858
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,544
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?

859
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:04,083
No, little mushroom.

860
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,770
He was a smashed.

861
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,257
I saw it myself.

862
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:12,695
What, you want I still to follow
you some more. Okay fine.

863
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,247
I go with you, I go.

864
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,402
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.

865
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:20,698
And where is this well that
everyone has fallen into?

866
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,753
Psst.
Oink, oink.

867
00:57:45,022 --> 00:57:46,022
Ready?

868
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:54,225
(Groans)

869
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:08,201
Hmm?

870
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,014
Huh, oooh, hello.

871
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:23,724
Whoa!

872
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,249
Hmm?

873
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:45,007
Aaaaaaaaaah!

874
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:54,762
(Keys sounds like piano keys)

875
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:25,060
Terrafirminator!

876
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,371
Are you losing the war in your garden?

877
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,658
-Never!
-Well brother, maybe it's time for a secret weapon.

878
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:33,911
-Bring it on.
-TERRAFIRMINATOR!

879
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:35,595
This one's for Gnomeo!

880
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:38,491
Meoooooww!

881
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,185
(Squealing madly)

882
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,452
Hah, hah, yeah.

883
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:24,532
Huh?

884
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:26,826
(Worriedly whines)

885
01:00:28,943 --> 01:00:29,943
(Whines) Come on.

886
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:31,553
Ohhh!

887
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,495
Oh, ruddy purse.

888
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:44,637
Call me.

889
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:51,247
So Juliet and me we decided that we wouldn't
carry on this horrible feud.

890
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,808
It was great, but then my
best mate Benny found out.

891
01:00:54,957 --> 01:00:57,403
And Tybalt, who's a right piece of bad gnome.

892
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,773
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.

893
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:04,356
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed.

894
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:05,996
Which wasn't my fault.

895
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,060
Then I was chased down.

896
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,626
Exiled.

897
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,347
Stuck up here on your head.

898
01:01:11,562 --> 01:01:13,044
Far away from, Juliet.

899
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:16,013
Extraordinary.

900
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,482
Your story,

901
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:20,614
It does put me in mind of another.

902
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:22,621
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.

903
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:25,076
There are remarkable similarities.

904
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:26,579
What happens?
Did they get back together then?

905
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,743
Get back together?

906
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:29,332
Um, no.

907
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,752
Not exactly.

908
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,456
What exactly do you mean?

909
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,825
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!

910
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,840
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!

911
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:40,582
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.

912
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,028
Takes his own life.

913
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,762
She wakes, finds him dead.

914
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,588
Takes her life, both dead!

915
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:48,754
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!

916
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:51,690
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!

917
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:53,767
Author, author!

918
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,185
What did you say?

919
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:59,761
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?

920
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,444
My dear boy, this is a tragedy.

921
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,287
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.

922
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,638
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.

923
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,193
Well I suppose that he could have made
it back in time to prevent disaster.

924
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,314
But I like the whole death part better.

925
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:16,186
Oh dear.

926
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:23,917
Whoo hooo!

927
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:25,159
Featherstone.

928
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:27,544
One word.

929
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
Plastic.

930
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,959
How'd you find me?
Shroom!

931
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,875
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.

932
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Not yet.

933
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,286
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head.

934
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,230
What is it, boy?

935
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,828
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.

936
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:44,981
He's been going on and on and on since the accident.

937
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:48,983
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers,
chocolates and strangers....

938
01:02:48,983 --> 01:02:50,237
Juliet's in danger.

939
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:51,441
No, that's not it.

940
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:54,273
Juliet's in danger!

941
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:56,372
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.

942
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,972
I've got to get back to Juliet,
and save her.

943
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:02,777
That's what he said, but she was
dead before he got home.

944
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,077
We'll see about that.

945
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,021
Whoa...

946
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,580
Tada!

947
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:35,377
-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?

948
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,482
This baby is fully equipped.

949
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,751
Equipped for what?

950
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:40,588
It has settings for edging,

951
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:42,170
trimming, mulching,

952
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,170
and revenge!

953
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,997
Do it, Benny.

954
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,827
Do anything it takes.

955
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:53,672
Make them rule the day they destroyed my son.

956
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:58,429
Unleash the gods of war.

957
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:10,651
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

958
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:13,715
six, five, four,

959
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,837
three, two, one.

960
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:29,099
Ah, no, no!

961
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,150
Ohh.

962
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:47,407
Oh, no!

963
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:50,580
Go', blimey!

964
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,450
Oh, no.

965
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,500
ATTACK!

966
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,530
Counter attack!

967
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:10,321
Counter, counter attack.

968
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:14,148
Wwww, whoa, whoooa, whoooa!

969
01:05:14,563 --> 01:05:16,032
All: Ah me, no, no, no!

970
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,083
Nyah, nyah!

971
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:26,667
I got one.

972
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Thank you.

973
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:32,409
(Moans) Ohhh.

974
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,496
Not, the dolphin.

975
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:38,565
Oh...ah...oh...no!

976
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:41,870
Nooooo!

977
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:42,508
Paris.

978
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:48,238
Wa...watch out!

979
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,413
Gentlemen, I suggest we put our heads together.

980
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:51,719
Charge!

981
01:05:56,773 --> 01:05:58,755
Oh, no, no, nooo!

982
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,065
Yee haw!

983
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:04,225
Cannonball!

984
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,540
Right!

985
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,074
What?

986
01:06:19,823 --> 01:06:20,823
Juliet!

987
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:23,997
You're alive.

988
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:26,430
-Come with me.
-Okay

989
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Oh, no.

990
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,131
Gnomeo!

991
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:45,422
Would you like to complete destruction now?

992
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,263
Destruction in progress.

993
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:05,919
Come on, come on, come on!

994
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:28,157
Oh, Juliet!

995
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:31,358
Oh, my son. It can't be.

996
01:07:33,502 --> 01:07:34,887
Target locked.

997
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,879
She's going to blow!
Get back, get back.

998
01:07:41,138 --> 01:07:42,138
Huh!

999
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:44,396
-Huh.
-Huh.

1000
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:45,640
-Huh!
-Huh!

1001
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:52,257
It's no use, go.

1002
01:07:54,397 --> 01:07:55,586
Go.

1003
01:07:55,587 --> 01:07:57,603
I'm not going anywhere.

1004
01:08:06,744 --> 01:08:08,220
Told you so.

1005
01:08:57,661 --> 01:08:59,051
-Huh!
-Oh!

1006
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:15,147
(Sadly sighs) Oh.

1007
01:09:28,924 --> 01:09:29,924
Huh?

1008
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,745
It's okay, I'm okay.

1009
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:36,607
Ewww!

1010
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:43,829
I'm sorry about your son.

1011
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:47,464
I'm sorry about your daughter.

1012
01:09:47,465 --> 01:09:49,956
I was just trying to keep her safe.

1013
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:52,001
And, now...

1014
01:09:52,247 --> 01:09:54,715
The whole thing, is my fault.

1015
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:57,923
Our fault.

1016
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:21,527
-This feud.
-Is over.

1017
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,154
*Tiiiiki, tiiiki, tiikii, tiki rooom.*

1018
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:31,987
*The tiiiiki, tiiki, tiki, tiiiki, room.*

1019
01:10:31,988 --> 01:10:37,238
*The birds...flowers croon. Tiki, tiki, tiki room.*

1020
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,041
I don’t' know about you.

1021
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,727
But, I think this ending is much better.

1022
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:27,584
(Rooster crows)
(Pig squeals)

1023
01:11:28,807 --> 01:11:31,967
-Good afternoon, witch.
-Nitwit.

1024
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:39,471
(Both gasp in shock.)
Both: AAAAAHHHH!

1025
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,250
<i>*"Crocodile Rock"*</i>

1026
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:48,011
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1027
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,313
*La, la, la, la, laaaaaaaaaa.*

1028
01:11:54,706 --> 01:11:57,053
*I remember when rock was young.*

1029
01:11:57,054 --> 01:12:00,243
*Gnomeo and Juliet had so much fun.*

1030
01:12:00,244 --> 01:12:03,274
*Holding hands and skimming stones.*

1031
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:06,790
*Had their own gold Chevy
and a place of their own.*

1032
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,293
*But the biggest kick they ever got*

1033
01:12:09,294 --> 01:12:12,611
*Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock*

1034
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:15,874
*While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock*

1035
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,908
*They were hopping and
bopping to the Crocodile Rock, hey!*

1036
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:24,737
*Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still*

1037
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:30,609
*They never knew me a better time
and I guess I never will*

1038
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:37,280
*Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because we gonna dance all night*

1039
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:41,847
*And the Crocodile Rocking
is something out of sight*

1040
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:43,857
*Yeah, yeah, yeah.*

1041
01:12:59,932 --> 01:13:04,841
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1042
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:07,791
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1043
01:13:07,978 --> 01:13:12,196
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1044
01:13:12,197 --> 01:13:15,721
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1045
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,154
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*

1046
01:13:19,154 --> 01:13:21,432
*La, la, la, laaaaa.*

1047
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:28,479
*-Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.
-..........................Crocodile rockin.*

1048
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,494
*-Crocodile rockin'
Laaaaaaaa, la, la,*

1049
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:32,954
*-Ooo, a rock, rock, rockin',

1050
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,268

1051
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:44,509
Oo, thank you.
