1
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,158
Dispatch, this is 42-15.

2
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:37,876
I'm pursuing armed robbery suspect
at tunnel construction and 32nd.

3
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,480
Requesting backup.

4
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:43,235
Damn it.

5
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:41,126
- Chief. Thanks for calling.
- Agent Pollack.

6
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,279
Check that number.
We think this could be your guy.

7
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:45,960
Tell me what you got.

8
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:49,562
The officer chased the suspect
into the tunnel, shots were fired.

9
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,597
When our guys finally got here,
this is what they found.

10
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,678
- Where's the rest?
- That's the question of the day.

11
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:09,204
Agent Matt Pollack, FBI, meet Deputy
Medical Examiner, Andrea Karthas.

12
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:13,125
I ran UVs 30 yards each way
on the tracks...

13
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,277
and I couldn't find
a trace of blood.

14
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:18,638
- You're after the Downtown Reaper?
- That's right.

15
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:26,046
This is not my guy.
It's not his style.

16
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,082
The Reaper is a neat freak.
This is too much of a mess.

17
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,486
Looks like
he was literally torn apart.

18
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,959
- What's this?
- I don't know yet.

19
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:46,040
I won't know for sure
until I send it to the lab.

20
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:49,398
- You let me know as soon as you do?
- No problem.

21
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:53,202
I'll drop down
Dr. Franklin's office later. Thanks.

22
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,595
- Matt?
- Yeah?

23
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:03,476
- Sorry to drag you here for this.
- That's all right, Chief.

24
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,918
We've been seeing a lot of copycats
in the last few weeks.

25
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,804
A lot of sick people.

26
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,755
I'll tell you what, I'll still
run a check to match this M. O...

27
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,961
- and have your guys do the same.
- For sure.

28
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:22,764
Be sure we're locked down here.
It's gotta be cleared in four hours.

29
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:27,763
We've got some VIPs coming through.
The tunnel's reached halfway point.

30
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,680
Petronovich wants to show off
his tunnel again.

31
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:34,562
Fortune 500s, politicians...

32
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,919
Yeah, my people.

33
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,158
- Thanks, Chief.
- See you, Matt.

34
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,924
I'll look forward to it.

35
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,035
Damn it! I do not need this now.

36
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:49,518
They want me to worry
about a dead cop...

37
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,963
when I have six strip mall complexes
that don't have the right permits!

38
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:56,642
Permit applications are already in,
and I don't anticipate any problems.

39
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,957
As for the incident in the tunnel...

40
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:03,677
you might want to postpone
the VIP tour till we clear the mess.

41
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,280
I might, might I?

42
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,682
Let me tell you a little something
about how business works.

43
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,880
Just like in war, when you're running
a Fortune 500 company...

44
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,721
occasionally you run into
a thing called "collateral damage."

45
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:22,565
Sometimes something
gets in the way...

46
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,560
and you just have to
push that thing aside.

47
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:27,720
- Sir...
- Listen.

48
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,365
It's a terrible thing that happened
to that officer today...

49
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:35,201
and I'm just sick, personally,
that it happened in my tunnel.

50
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,640
See, Dave...

51
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:42,080
sometimes even bad publicity
can be good publicity.

52
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,956
Where are the plans
for station nine?

53
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:53,164
- Dr. Franklin, what do you have?
- Massive tissue loss.

54
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:57,441
He was cut almost completely
in half. Lots of severed bones.

55
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:01,040
Whoever did this must have used
something incredibly sharp.

56
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:03,641
You see here?
What's left of the legs?

57
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,803
These are the strongest bones
in the body. Look how they're cut.

58
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,720
There are no splinters,
no evidence of crushing.

59
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:14,756
I don't know any man or animal
with the strength to do such damage.

60
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,758
What about a machine
or some other device?

61
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,200
There'd be metal residue.

62
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,357
Even a high-density plastic
leaves a trace.

63
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,244
But here, nothing.

64
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,239
The fluid Andrea collected.

65
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:28,996
What is it?

66
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,284
Based on tissue damage it caused,
I thought it was an acid.

67
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,519
After I ran some tests, I discovered
it's a combination of proteins.

68
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,280
- Right. Meaning?
- Well, it's an enzyme.

69
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,799
This one has a profile similar
to those found in some insects...

70
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:48,721
but never in this massive quantity.
I can't identify it.

71
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,002
What does an enzyme like that do?
What is it for?

72
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:56,399
Well, for digestion certainly.
It's similar to human saliva.

73
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,924
It's not something that could
immobilise someone immediately.

74
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:03,795
I'd like to send a sample to the CDC
consultant at the university here.

75
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:07,960
- Do you know Dr. Foster?
- Emily Foster, the entomologist?

76
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,364
I know her.
We've worked together before.

77
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,325
I'll give her a call
and see if she can analyse it.

78
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,481
You know what? I'll take it to her.
It'll be a lot faster. Thanks.

79
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,876
Hello.

80
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,402
Matt, what are you doing in town?

81
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,004
- You going somewhere?
- To Whistler, for the long weekend.

82
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,920
- Skiing?
- Not me. I'm a snowboarder now.

83
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:51,046
- I should have guessed.
- What can I do for you?

84
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,443
I was hoping
you could take a look at something.

85
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,802
We found a fluid on a victim's body.

86
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,438
What do you need the CDC for?

87
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,365
The lab can't identify it.
Franklin thought maybe you could.

88
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:05,644
Great. Put it in the fridge.
I'll look at it when I get back.

89
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,797
I'd appreciate it
if you could take a look now.

90
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,526
Matt, I gotta jam
or I'm gonna miss my flight.

91
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,201
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

92
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,602
Wow.

93
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:00,080
These were done
by something razor-sharp.

94
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,726
The scrapes
on what's left of the femur...

95
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:08,320
I think his legs
were cut straight through.

96
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,955
- Looks like a bear attack.
- More like he was eaten.

97
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,762
Eaten?

98
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,442
Look.

99
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,325
Here, here, and here.

100
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,996
I've seen
these kind of lacerations before.

101
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,317
- I need a piece of paper.
- Here.

102
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,325
From the lacerations
on his remains...

103
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,638
and the marks evident
on the x-rays...

104
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,082
this is what the jaws
would look like.

105
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:51,281
Looks like an insect's mandible,
only a thousand times bigger.

106
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,401
- Right. From outer space.
- I'm not kidding.

107
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,041
The enzymes are definitely insect.

108
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,006
With the amount recorded...

109
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,045
that would have to come
from something over 80 kilograms.

110
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,276
That's huge.

111
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,325
- Emily, this is ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

112
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,838
Every once in a while,
a new species...

113
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,805
or an old species that
we thought was extinct, pops up.

114
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,286
Last year, in Norway...

115
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:18,076
a 20-foot section of a giant squid
washed up onshore.

116
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,637
The cross section showed that
it was over 125 feet long.

117
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,158
Nobody wanted to believe
that it existed.

118
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:28,001
Because you've never seen it before,
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

119
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,644
You said that he was attacked
in the new subway station?

120
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,799
- That's right.
- We've gotta get over there.

121
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:40,161
If what I think is true,
we've gotta contain this thing.

122
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:44,997
- What about your trip to Whistler?
- I'm here, aren't I?

123
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll call Lembeck.

124
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,680
Welcome, everyone.

125
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,961
My name is Jack Ball...

126
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,084
and I am a vice president
at Petronovich Enterprises.

127
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you for coming.

128
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:21,126
Today, you are the first to ride
the state-of-the-art system...

129
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,277
beneath the depths of Mount Airy.

130
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:26,446
This is one of the deepest tunnels
in the world.

131
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,243
No one believed it could be done.

132
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:32,806
Thanks to the determined efforts...

133
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:36,038
of Victor Petronovich
and Petronovich Enterprises...

134
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,477
we are halfway there.

135
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,966
- Yeah!
- Yes!

136
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,917
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,560
Once it's done, how long will it
take to get from here to Portsberry?

138
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,481
Once completed, the commute
will take under 45 minutes.

139
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,883
A vast improvement
over the three hours it takes today.

140
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:00,323
This will mean more commerce,
more business, money.

141
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,719
So how long is the track?

142
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:08,925
The total trip, city to city,
will be 38 miles...

143
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,404
though, today, we will only travel
the completed 19.

144
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,676
Boo.

145
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,120
Come on, Jack.

146
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:20,600
The chief engineer-designer,
Mr. Yokoto, will also be joining us.

147
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,917
He's also happy to answer
any of your questions.

148
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,406
- Enjoy.
- And they're off.

149
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:32,479
Once Stewart takes the ride
this afternoon...

150
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:35,725
we'll have no trouble
securing the remaining vacancies...

151
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,844
for stations five and six.

152
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,919
Mr. Petronovich, I have
Chief Lembeck, Agent Pollack...

153
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,601
and Emily Foster from the CDC
here to see you.

154
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,565
Thank you, Hal.
We'll continue this later.

155
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:03,882
Before we head back...

156
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,357
I'd like to point out that we are
in the deepest part of the tunnel...

157
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,838
about 2 miles under the mountain
and 19 miles from downtown.

158
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,239
- Did you see that?
- See what?

159
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,405
I saw something moving.

160
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,675
Those are just the shadows
cast by the halogen lights.

161
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,120
Nothing to worry about.

162
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,365
No, that's not what I saw.

163
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,156
Boo!

164
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,240
Stop that. Look what you made me do.
I'm a mess.

165
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,042
Mr. Petronovich,
we have to secure the tunnel...

166
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,800
and send a team there
to find out what we're dealing with.

167
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,321
This is potentially
a very serious problem.

168
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:51,522
Potentially?

169
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:56,075
I have spent years and billions
of taxpayer dollars on that tunnel.

170
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,919
You think I'll jeopardise
this project on a potential problem?

171
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,760
- An officer is dead.
- And that's a tragedy.

172
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,359
I've got a train full of investors
who won't be comfortable...

173
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,961
being greeted by a SWAT team
on their return.

174
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,120
It's not too good for business,
if you can understand that.

175
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,482
- The evidence...
- There have been crews down there...

176
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,922
for two years, day and night.

177
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:21,125
If there was something that big,
somebody would've seen it by now.

178
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,362
Do you have anything other than spit
to back up your theory, Doctor?

179
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,041
We're proposing to go in there
quickly and efficiently.

180
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,040
What wouldn't be good for business
is to have another incident.

181
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:37,679
The Feds control this investigation,
and I am required to support them.

182
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,640
I appreciate your candour,
Agent Pollack...

183
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:47,681
and I wouldn't want to interfere
with a federal investigation.

184
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,960
My people will be done in the tunnel
soon, and it's all yours.

185
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:55,438
We'll send a team there to make sure
that all your friends arrive safely.

186
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,682
Good day.

187
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,078
- Get me Reynolds.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,761
What's that?

189
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,846
- I don't know.
- Something's out there.

190
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,441
It's just a few kinks
in the system, folks.

191
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:20,726
No, I don't think so.

192
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,158
There's something
on the roof!

193
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,518
- Where?
- Get out of here.

194
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,201
What the hell...

195
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:55,366
As well as could be expected.
We're on our way to the scene now.

196
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,483
Okay, good. See you there.

197
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,116
He's a real charmer.

198
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,516
I wish I could say
his bark was worse than his bite.

199
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,565
- What are you talking about?
- What's that about?

200
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,797
What do you mean
there's no one left?

201
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:10,039
It's a massacre.
They're dead! Everyone's dead!

202
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,004
Calm down. Where is Jack Ball?

203
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:14,317
Didn't you hear me?
They're all dead!

204
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm bringing in the CDC.

205
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,280
There's no time to mobilise them.

206
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,796
- I need your SWAT team.
- Done. Benton's team is ready.

207
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:22,720
- I need everything you've got.
- Anything you want.

208
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:26,402
We need lights. What we're looking
for has been living in the darkness.

209
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,806
Lights can give us an advantage.

210
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,526
How about a train? There's a lot
of ground to be covered.

211
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,962
- The surveyor car.
- Stay out of this.

212
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,162
Tell me about the train.

213
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,522
It's well-equipped,
self-contained, self-propelled.

214
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,757
It has communications
and a close-circuit video.

215
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,077
- Good. What's your name?
- Dave Reynolds.

216
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,443
- I built the tunnel. I know it well.
- Obviously not well enough.

217
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,803
- Can you drive this train?
- Absolutely.

218
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,599
Let's go. Come on.

219
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,480
Mr. Petronovich, do you want
Jack Ball's home number?

220
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,196
- What the hell for?
- So you can call his wife, sir.

221
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,363
We've been briefed.
Come on, Matt. Is this for real?

222
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,918
- I'm afraid so.
- Now I've heard everything.

223
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:30,718
- Officer Benton, SWAT leader.
- Emily Foster, CDC Field Supervisor.

224
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,163
- She's coming with us.
- Garcia, another vest.

225
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,320
There you go.

226
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,400
Yeah, that's standard issue.
You'll get used to it.

227
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,398
And it'll be your best friend.

228
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,644
- Matt, you seen the ride?
- No.

229
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,763
Let's go. I'll show you.

230
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,565
Titanium construction.
Powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.

231
00:19:56,647 --> 00:20:00,242
And we rigged the exterior with
high intensity lights, as requested.

232
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,997
You've met Dave Reynolds, right?

233
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:06,995
He'll drive this thing. He knows
this tunnel better than anybody.

234
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,799
How deep does this thing go?

235
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,355
Can we maintain radio contact
with the command centre?

236
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,200
The track's 19 miles long,
and 2 miles below the surface...

237
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,845
at the deepest point
of the mountain.

238
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:19,476
So the radios can communicate
with each other in the tunnel...

239
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:22,037
but they won't reach the outside.

240
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,398
However, the car has
a dedicated com system.

241
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,796
It uses the rails as an antenna.

242
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,636
- Ready on the line, sir.
- All right, we're good to go.

243
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:33,397
- Let's get them together.
- All right.

244
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,798
- You sure about this?
- What do you have to worry about?

245
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,115
Listen up.

246
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:44,035
This is Agent Pollack of the FBI,
special advisor on this mission.

247
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,561
You answer to me. I answer to him.

248
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,798
What we're dealing with here
is nothing we've ever seen before.

249
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,082
It is not to be underestimated.

250
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,682
But we do know it's very aggressive,
fast, and powerful.

251
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:00,644
This is Dr. Emily Foster from CDC,
in charge of managing containment.

252
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,206
So please listen up.

253
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,076
Based on evidence, I can speculate
as to what this thing looks like.

254
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,442
It's about 2 or 3 metres
in length...

255
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:12,839
insect or reptilian in appearance,
and moves at the speed of light.

256
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:15,477
We know it's strong
'cause it can cut through...

257
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,162
a 1-inch piece of stainless steel
like it's a tin can.

258
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:22,205
So be very careful.

259
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:24,365
Are there any questions?

260
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,203
Our mission is to find this thing
and kill it.

261
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:32,359
Under no circumstances is it to be
allowed to the surface, got it?

262
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:33,675
Yes, sir.

263
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,918
- Let's move out.
- Let's go.

264
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,602
- Reynolds, slow it down.
- You got it.

265
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,485
I want you guys to use the green-tip
armour-piercing rounds.

266
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,956
I guess no warning shots
for this puppy.

267
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,235
We've got enough ammo here
to start a war.

268
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,519
All this over a bug.

269
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,042
- This is a wild-goose chase.
- Hey!

270
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,278
Come on, man, you heard the lady.

271
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,358
We're dealing with
a dozen people mutilated...

272
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:50,042
by something stronger and quicker
than anything logic can explain.

273
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,243
If I've learned one thing
on this job...

274
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,124
it's never underestimate
your opponent.

275
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,401
I hear that.

276
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,043
This is a hell of a machine
you got here.

277
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:07,685
We lost two men in a cave-in...

278
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,440
so Petronovich built this
for Yokoto and me.

279
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:14,042
With its own power supply, oxygen,
food, provisions...

280
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,085
we figured we'd last
until someone could dig us out.

281
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,998
That's uncharacteristically
nice of him.

282
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,806
Not really.
He couldn't afford to lose us.

283
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,604
Though he did find a way to have
the taxpayers pay for it all.

284
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:27,120
Yeah, that figures.

285
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:32,718
I want you to stay on the train.

286
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,566
This could go bad.

287
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:39,406
Don't do this.

288
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:43,325
I'm just as qualified
as the rest of them.

289
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:50,243
If you don't let me go in,
they're gonna know something's up.

290
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:52,916
Look...

291
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:56,567
I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

292
00:23:58,127 --> 00:23:59,845
I can take care of myself.

293
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,356
Hey.

294
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:12,682
Thanks.

295
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,445
Reynolds, what's this?

296
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,998
That's the bypass
to the staging area...

297
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,282
where the construction equipment
and supplies are.

298
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,600
- What was that?
- Slow it down.

299
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,722
What is it?

300
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:43,002
I think I saw some movements
in the shadows.

301
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,799
No, I don't see anything.

302
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:50,006
But I guess it's worth a look.
Let's go.

303
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:54,996
What's that?

304
00:24:56,527 --> 00:25:00,315
The refuelling station of this car,
liquid oxygen and hydrogen.

305
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,602
Lock it down.

306
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,403
Benton, what's the plan?

307
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,565
I'm taking an eight-man team
down the tunnel to check it out.

308
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,636
All right.

309
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:27,515
Riley, Porter, Cohen,
Johanson, Green...

310
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:30,605
Howsam, Lu, Garcia.

311
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:35,237
Bergstein, Manning, you'll stay here
and set up a defensive perimeter.

312
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,637
Remember to keep your radios turned
to channel four.

313
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,201
Let's go.

314
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,442
First team.

315
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,435
Stay low.

316
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:29,884
Second team,
keep those lights in front of us.

317
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:38,878
It's not smart to send the men in
without a preliminary video feed.

318
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,925
Benton wouldn't have gone
if he thought he couldn't handle it.

319
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,237
We've reached an elbow
in the tunnel.

320
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,320
Looks like it goes on
about another 8 or 9 yards.

321
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,716
- Roger that. Proceed with caution.
- Sir!

322
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,357
We found a hole
near the end of the tunnel.

323
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:11,076
Looks about 16 inches in diameter.
We're moving in to check it out.

324
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,356
Go NVG.

325
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:26,875
- It's negative on the night vision.
- Howsam, go thermal.

326
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:35,603
Insects are cold-blooded.
They won't read on thermal.

327
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,162
The fuel cell.
Does it give off any heat?

328
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,721
No, it's cool to the touch.
It never gets hot.

329
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,923
Tell them to stand down.

330
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,721
- What are you saying?
- We're in a dark, damp tunnel...

331
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,923
a breeding ground for insects
we can't even see.

332
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,684
- Negative on the thermal.
- Benton, keep your distance.

333
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,679
- Get a video read ASAP.
- Video.

334
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,998
We're still
getting negative here, base.

335
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:07,315
Can they go infrared?

336
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,240
- Can you go infrared?
- Illuminate with infrared.

337
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:17,166
Howsam!

338
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:20,556
Howsam!

339
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:23,276
Come on!

340
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:31,758
Back! Porter! Cover!

341
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,356
Back! We've got a man down!

342
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,642
Requesting permission
to go after them, sir.

343
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:47,560
Negative. Hold your position.
Benton, pull back!

344
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:48,966
Howsam, come on.

345
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:05,287
They're behind us! Open fire!

346
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:23,318
- Sir?
- Get my helicopter ready.

347
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,762
Get back! We can't stop them!

348
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,765
Get aboard. Hurry!

349
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,838
Come on, get aboard. Hurry!

350
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,483
Reynolds, get it going!
Get it going now!

351
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,398
Give everything we got.

352
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:12,278
Get us the hell out of here!

353
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,156
Base, we need an immediate evac.
Do you copy?

354
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:24,236
- Help me!
- Get it off!

355
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,961
Emily! We need a med kit!

356
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:39,037
- Shoot it.
- I can't get a shot.

357
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,559
What the hell was that?

358
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,842
There was only supposed to be
one of them.

359
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,483
They're dead! There was
only supposed to be one of them.

360
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,402
One.

361
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,886
How the hell did they get through
a Kevlar vest like that?

362
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:15,721
Bug saliva adapts
to anything it's eating.

363
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,321
It's how they hold their place
in the food chain.

364
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:19,965
I don't believe this.

365
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:24,840
I need an inventory of the weapons
and ammo we've got on board.

366
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,806
Now get to it.

367
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:30,199
Bergstein, I want you to check
every inch of this train.

368
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,916
Bergstein, come on. Get to it.

369
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,840
- How you doing?
- I'll live.

370
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:41,687
We need to figure out
where this train is going.

371
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,646
We need to establish communication
with the outside. Can you do that?

372
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,797
- I'll check on it right away.
- Good.

373
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,162
What now? How do we get back?

374
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,920
There is no "back."
The tunnel is sealed.

375
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:56,996
- Where does that leave us?
- I don't know, I'll figure it out.

376
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,600
Emily, come with me.

377
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:17,955
- How are we getting out of here?
- That is the least of our problems.

378
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:23,875
The explosion must have damaged
the rails, severed the hard lines.

379
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,036
So?

380
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,245
So that means
we get to go 10 miles an hour.

381
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:32,516
Not to mention,
all the power is out.

382
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,925
At the moment, this car is running
on its dedicated fuel cell.

383
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,201
That is an O2 warning...

384
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:42,484
which means the explosion must have
damaged the ventilation system.

385
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,159
How much air do we have left?

386
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:47,557
That depends on the fire.

387
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,716
If it keeps burning, it could
consume all the air within an hour.

388
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,085
What are our options here?

389
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:03,642
There's only one way out of here.

390
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:08,437
There's a bypass route
8 miles from here, at T-48.

391
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,164
It leads
to an old staging supply yard...

392
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:13,477
near the quarry at Mount Airy East.

393
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,200
How long till we're there?

394
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:18,484
At this rate, 40 minutes.

395
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,078
But the track isn't set
for the bypass.

396
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,522
We switched it this afternoon
for the VIP tour...

397
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,963
so we could take everyone to the end
of the line. What a ride that was!

398
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,400
Can you switch it back?

399
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:32,878
Normally, I'd be able to do it
from here, but the com is out.

400
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:39,040
We'll have to stop at T-38,
and try the computers there.

401
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,200
- Will there be a radio?
- Yes, and a phone.

402
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:46,401
- Can't guarantee they will work.
- Let's go to T-38.

403
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,439
What about your men back there?

404
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,802
- What do you mean?
- What about their bodies?

405
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:53,606
There's no bodies. There's no men.
They're gone.

406
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,803
Think there's any more bugs
ahead of us?

407
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:06,005
Based on the number behind us,
I'd say we stumbled across the nest.

408
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,880
It's a good bet they were down there
because of the water.

409
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,082
What water?

410
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:15,085
The hydrogen fuel cell
creates water, right?

411
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:19,001
Yeah, it converts oxygen and
hydrogen into electricity and water.

412
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,759
Normally, the water is pumped out.

413
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,805
Petronovich never paid to have
the drainage system completed...

414
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:26,640
so we just let it
absorb into the rock.

415
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:29,841
And that's the only source
down there, right?

416
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:33,916
If you're right, the only bugs in
this tunnel are the ones behind us.

417
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,646
Theoretically, but I won't know
until I look at that bug.

418
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:39,958
Can you tell me where these things
came from? What makes them tick?

419
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,557
- How we can kill them?
- I'm on it.

420
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,160
All right. Good.

421
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:48,315
Reynolds, you get us to T-38.
I'll take care of the rest.

422
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:04,595
- Garcia, anything on the com?
- Nothing yet.

423
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,606
Emily, what can you tell me
about this thing?

424
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:12,566
It's very primitive,
almost prehistoric.

425
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:17,039
Jointed legs, segmented body,
tough armour-plate exoskeleton.

426
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,719
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Just cut to the CliffsNotes.

427
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:24,800
Its eyes are underdeveloped, so it
probably can't survive in daylight.

428
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:26,320
It could be easily blinded.

429
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,284
But it is impressively armed.

430
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,844
Look at the extensions
from its claws.

431
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,725
They're razor-sharp,
shaped like a grafting scalpel...

432
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,798
except these are 10 inches deep.

433
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,199
Take a look at this.

434
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:42,317
- What is it?
- Dormant bristles.

435
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:48,358
They're born predators.
And they're also hatchlings.

436
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,565
- We're almost at T-38.
- Right.

437
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,720
What, they're babies?

438
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,318
In some suspended animation.

439
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:02,080
Locusts come out every seven years.
These come out every few million.

440
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,359
It's incredible.

441
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:08,919
Certain organisms can hibernate
for extended periods of time...

442
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:12,044
even reaching a level of stasis
through water depletion.

443
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,038
Didn't you ever have a Sea-Monkey
as a kid?

444
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:17,199
You mean, those little crystals
you add water to...

445
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:19,444
and creatures start floating around?

446
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:21,722
Yes. They can survive
in a package for years.

447
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,843
Just add water, and life.

448
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:27,325
Which would validate your theory
on their quest for water.

449
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:29,875
What sealed them in,
in the first place?

450
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,401
An environmental
or atmospheric event.

451
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,883
What, like a meteorite
hitting the Earth?

452
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,116
That would do it.

453
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,517
So these things wake up
after millions of years, pissed off.

454
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:40,962
And hungry.

455
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:44,116
Yeah. And we're lunch.

456
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:50,843
- So, why did they wake up?
- Something to do with this tunnel.

457
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,360
- Reynolds.
- Yeah?

458
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,598
You know anything about this?

459
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:03,397
We were blasting a section of tunnel
and we hit a pocket of iron ferrite.

460
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,239
Three drills broke
trying to get through.

461
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:08,080
But once we did,
we exposed a fossil bed.

462
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,039
And you didn't report it?

463
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,035
Of course I did.

464
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,437
So what happened? This place should
have been closed up and excavated.

465
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:18,564
- Money happened.
- Come on.

466
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,641
Money changed hands.

467
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,558
Enough to make people
look the other way...

468
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,922
when it came
to the demolition permits.

469
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:26,642
Petronovich.

470
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,044
It's too bad Petronovich
can't buy us out of this mess.

471
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:36,844
- How much further to T-38?
- Five minutes.

472
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:41,046
Let's get ready, team.
We don't have much time.

473
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:44,323
All right, this is the plan.

474
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:46,716
Emily, Bergstein, and Reynolds,
you come with me.

475
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,446
Garcia and Manning, stay by
the train. Keep your eyes open.

476
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,358
- Got it.
- Sir.

477
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,403
Let's concentrate
on getting a message out...

478
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,955
- and switching the track.
- Let's hope the explosions...

479
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,924
didn't take out
these computers as well.

480
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,679
What, you think it went that far?

481
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,883
That's hard to say.
It was pretty big.

482
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,397
Could have shorted
the entire system.

483
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,201
There's only one way to find out.
Team, let's go.

484
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:23,363
- Is this it?
- Yeah, all right.

485
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,245
The computer terminals are here.

486
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,478
You guys hear anything
a little bit suspicious, sing out.

487
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,001
We'll be back in a heartbeat,
all right?

488
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,196
Let's go.

489
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,359
- Where's the generator?
- Down the hall, to the right.

490
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,885
You guys stay here and I'll go.
Bergstein, cover.

491
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,443
- The phone's dead.
- Batteries are low.

492
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,165
We have to wait for the generator.

493
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:54,804
The computers are up,
but the network is down.

494
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,202
Why?

495
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:58,403
There's gotta be something else
we can do.

496
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:09,516
No, this is not working.
This is not working.

497
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:13,640
I'm going to reset the parameters
and override the default.

498
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,961
Why don't we try a different server?

499
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,487
We can use any server
to reset the drives.

500
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,157
I got it. I got the CDC server.

501
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,240
As soon as I can ping the server,
we are there.

502
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,366
We've got company!

503
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:13,761
You all right?

504
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,476
- This is crazy.
- I'm all right.

505
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,206
Let's get out of here.
This place is crawling.

506
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:41,836
God!

507
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:44,765
Get it off me!

508
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,276
Oh, my God!

509
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:18,166
We have to leave now.

510
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:21,037
- What about Bergstein?
- He's dead.

511
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:24,206
He's dead. Let's go.

512
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:28,716
Now, let's go. We gotta leave.

513
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:34,716
Come on.

514
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,156
Let's go.

515
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,436
Hurry.

516
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,800
Where's Bergstein?

517
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:12,005
You said hatchlings
don't venture far from the nest.

518
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,520
These are different.

519
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:17,317
- Scouts, maybe.
- Scouts. That's beautiful.

520
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:19,837
Bergstein is dead
and you come up with scouts?

521
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:22,600
I'm working in a vacuum.
You can't immediately identify...

522
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:25,326
the tendencies
of a 65-million-year-old species.

523
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:28,319
No? I'd say they got the tendency
to kick our ass.

524
00:43:28,407 --> 00:43:30,398
Garcia, that's enough.

525
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,801
- 65 million years old?
- Yeah, the Carboniferous Period.

526
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:42,639
That's the last time
there were bugs...

527
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:44,718
with dormant bristles
in their exoskeletons.

528
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,367
- English, please.
- Wings.

529
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:50,317
You mean these things can fly?

530
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,244
They haven't evolved
to that stage yet...

531
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,477
but they certainly have
the capacity for it.

532
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,161
The news just keeps on getting
better and better.

533
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:58,805
What's the difference?

534
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,003
They can run 20 miles an hour.

535
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:06,639
Keep your eyes on the back.
Shoot anything that moves.

536
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:13,956
- What's wrong? Why did we stop?
- The computer override didn't work.

537
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:18,923
- So what do we do now?
- We change the tracks manually.

538
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:22,407
There's a switch key
just down the tracks.

539
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:23,715
Let's go.

540
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:29,435
Garcia, you and Manning
hold the fort.

541
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:31,597
I want you to set a perimeter
behind the car.

542
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:33,917
Do the best you can
to hold them back, all right?

543
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:36,237
Let's go.
Emily, you stay on the train.

544
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:37,966
Actually, we need her.

545
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,924
It takes two people
just to operate the key.

546
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:41,486
And a third with a flashlight.

547
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,320
- It might go a lot faster.
- Let's go then.

548
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:45,601
Good luck.

549
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:05,324
- Tell me about the key.
- It's a preventative measure...

550
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,398
so no one person
can sabotage the trains...

551
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,682
and cause a head-on collision.

552
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:30,446
When they show up...

553
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,883
we might as well
show them our stinger.

554
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,236
I do love a woman with firepower.

555
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:41,365
- How much more further?
- Shouldn't be too far.

556
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:49,436
Bingo!

557
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,636
So it should be
just around this corner.

558
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,606
Get back.

559
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:07,480
- No, wait.
- What?

560
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,081
They're dead.

561
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,726
How do you know that?

562
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,843
They are not responding
to our presence.

563
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,404
Looks like
they've been dead awhile.

564
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,966
Hope you're right.

565
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:37,196
What is it? The heat? Lack of water?

566
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,120
Maybe both.

567
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:47,161
- Where are you going?
- Give me a hand.

568
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,837
I think they are trying to moult.

569
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:53,602
Remember how I told you...

570
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:55,643
they needed to adapt
in order to survive?

571
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:58,002
- Right.
- They almost succeeded.

572
00:46:58,247 --> 00:46:59,441
Are you kidding?

573
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,085
The bugs will eat
right through that.

574
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,839
Not if it's electrified.

575
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:08,282
Emily, that one looks different.

576
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:15,281
What is it now?

577
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:20,962
It moulted.

578
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,642
Like a snake shedding its skin?

579
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:28,085
Like a caterpillar into a butterfly.

580
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,839
A butterfly from hell.

581
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:33,760
Let's get this thing out of here
quickly and quietly.

582
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,566
- Got it?
- Yeah.

583
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,966
Here, hold this.

584
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:49,642
- All right.
- Yeah.

585
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:52,605
I'll hold the top.
You undo the bracket at the bottom.

586
00:47:55,487 --> 00:47:57,921
Damn it. I dropped the keys.

587
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,036
I nudged it
with my boot accidentally.

588
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:16,922
I'm sorry. They're dead, see?

589
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,280
I'm sorry.

590
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:24,446
All right. Come on.
Let's get this thing out of here.

591
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,165
Get the lift.

592
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,279
Go see if you can run power
from the car to the third rail.

593
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,517
Yell if you see any bugs, all right?

594
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,316
Here?

595
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,883
- Hey, boss?
- Yeah?

596
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,716
Manning and I blocked the tunnel
with a metal fence.

597
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:13,957
If we can get some power
to the third rail...

598
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:16,003
it could keep these suckers away
for a while.

599
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,964
- Is that Garcia?
- Yeah.

600
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:22,521
Garcia, the auxiliary switch
is to the right of the monitor.

601
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,445
But do not switch it on...

602
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:29,396
until we've switched the tracks.
Otherwise you'll fry us.

603
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:31,555
You got that?

604
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,724
- Copy that.
- Right.

605
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,365
Okay, we'll just be a minute.

606
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:43,279
Garcia, we've got company
at 100 metres.

607
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,721
Hurry up, the bugs are coming!

608
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:58,082
- What's wrong with it?
- It's jammed mechanically somewhere.

609
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,597
50 metres. Is there any way
we can speed this up?

610
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:08,367
- Come on!
- Maybe it's the servo unit.

611
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:11,715
20 metres.

612
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,676
10 metres.

613
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:16,361
Hurry up.
The bugs are coming through.

614
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,962
- Ten seconds.
- We don't have ten seconds.

615
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,400
Hold my light.

616
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:22,002
Come on!

617
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:31,243
- Done.
- Okay, switch it!

618
00:50:34,487 --> 00:50:37,047
Keep working. Get more ammo!

619
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:03,676
No!

620
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:12,115
Manning!

621
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,116
Garcia!

622
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:29,960
Don't touch her.

623
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,435
Garcia, we gotta go. Come on.

624
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,199
It's gonna hurt.

625
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:11,400
I'm sorry about the others
and Manning.

626
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:24,999
All right, if you need us,
we'll be up front.

627
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:38,320
- How's he doing?
- Physically, he's okay.

628
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:40,842
Emotionally, I'm not so sure.

629
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,919
- He's a tough kid.
- That's not always enough.

630
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:46,766
- So, how are we doing?
- We're going home.

631
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,478
- Tell us about the staging area.
- It's a large facility...

632
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,603
and it's pretty much shut down...

633
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:55,485
now that the crews have finished
the Westside Terminal. Why?

634
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:59,003
Because these things can't get out.
This has got to end here.

635
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:01,123
What do you have in mind?

636
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,399
I hoped to blow this,
like the other one.

637
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:06,041
But at 50%, it won't be enough
to bring the tunnel down.

638
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:07,924
No, it won't.

639
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:16,957
But despite what we have
been through, Agent Pollack...

640
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:18,766
this may be your lucky day.

641
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:22,044
The staging area is where we store
the demolition surplus.

642
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:24,561
It's where we store the dynamite.

643
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:29,244
- Fuses and blasting caps, too?
- The whole nine.

644
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,559
How about wiring the dynamite...

645
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:34,160
to the fuel cell of this car...

646
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,283
and destroying
everything you've worked for...

647
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:39,006
- for the last five years?
- Okay, but keep in mind...

648
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:41,282
to get this car
back down the track...

649
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:44,484
to meet our friends from the fossil
world, this car needs power.

650
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:47,035
The same power that
the fence behind us is draining...

651
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:48,606
from this fuel cell.

652
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:53,244
So we will have maybe...

653
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:56,120
ten minutes to get back
to the staging area...

654
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:57,959
before we cut the power
to the fence.

655
00:53:58,047 --> 00:54:00,083
Otherwise we won't get the car
into the dump.

656
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,566
The bugs will get through.

657
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:03,478
No doubt.
But how fast do they travel?

658
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:08,083
So, hopefully, we'll have 15 minutes
before they get to us.

659
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:12,360
So if we can pack and wire this car,
and send it in immediately...

660
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:14,722
even if it meets them halfway...

661
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:19,319
We should be far enough away
from the explosion.

662
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:22,001
It sounds good,
but how do we get out of there?

663
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:24,157
We get out at the north end
of the terminal.

664
00:54:24,247 --> 00:54:26,761
There's a staircase
that leads to a Medi-Vac helipad...

665
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,166
and a fire escape route.

666
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:36,082
- Garcia, what is it?
- Something's following us.

667
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:46,124
- There's nothing out there.
- It's back there.

668
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:49,079
Beyond the shadows.

669
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:52,958
Watching. Waiting.

670
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:01,480
If the bugs were close enough
to hurt us...

671
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:03,638
I think we'd see them first.

672
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:08,275
It's there. I can feel it.

673
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:31,523
You're right, Reynolds.
This place is a tomb.

674
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:33,086
The power box is on the way.

675
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,965
This area has its own fuses
and generator.

676
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,921
All right, let's juice this place up
and move fast.

677
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,363
We've only got 10 minutes.

678
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:43,200
When the fence goes down...

679
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:46,359
we send the train
and get the hell out of here. Ready?

680
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:48,556
Set.

681
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:50,806
Garcia, we gotta go.

682
00:55:53,487 --> 00:55:55,762
No, don't. The acid.

683
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:03,880
You go ahead.

684
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:07,322
I'm gonna stay here...

685
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,967
and keep an eye out
for my new friend.

686
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:12,639
All right, we'll be back soon.

687
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:15,605
We need you to help us
load up the train, right?

688
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:19,999
Take your time.
The welcome committee is on the job.

689
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:23,401
Come on.

690
00:56:27,447 --> 00:56:30,962
- Man, he's losing it.
- He's just in shock, don't worry.

691
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:34,962
He's hallucinating, Matt.
His whole team, all of them, gone.

692
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:38,483
He's trained to be an army of one.
He's going on instinct...

693
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,435
which is what guys like him
survive on.

694
00:56:42,447 --> 00:56:45,962
I'm not gonna give up on him yet.
Now show me where it is.

695
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,206
This box.

696
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,887
Pull the ones on the left-hand side.

697
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:08,004
"Let there be light."

698
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:30,285
- Jackpot!
- There's a phone.

699
00:57:37,607 --> 00:57:40,326
- It's not working.
- There goes the distress call.

700
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:41,999
- There's a problem.
- What?

701
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:45,636
At 100 pounds each,
it will be tough moving the crates.

702
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,001
Hold on.

703
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:51,407
- What about this?
- Start it up.

704
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:53,479
Can you drive it?

705
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,041
Great.

706
00:57:58,887 --> 00:58:00,639
The battery is low.

707
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:23,326
- We've got five minutes.
- Okay, that's it.

708
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:28,123
What would you give
to see Petronovich's face...

709
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:29,799
when this whole thing blows up?

710
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:33,598
I'd give $60 million
to keep everything intact.

711
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:35,917
Unbelievable. How'd you get here?

712
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:39,044
Same way that I assume
you're planning on leaving.

713
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:41,436
My helicopter is right outside.

714
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:43,836
I was beginning to worry
that you wouldn't make it.

715
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:46,236
Why does that not sound heartfelt?

716
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,160
You can't buy your way out of this,
like you always do.

717
00:58:49,247 --> 00:58:50,282
How dare you!

718
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,198
I bring you on board
when you're nothing...

719
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,404
and I give you supervision
of the biggest building projects.

720
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:57,079
How can you
point your finger at me...

721
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,362
when I've been
buying your silence for years?

722
00:58:59,447 --> 00:59:03,201
How many times have you looked away
because I said so?

723
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,602
You see, that's the thing
about corporate success, Dave.

724
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:10,765
It trickles down.

725
00:59:13,607 --> 00:59:15,677
You know that all of this
is gonna get out.

726
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:17,837
You're doing what's right.

727
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:23,562
- You can, too, Petronovich.
- $20 million. Each.

728
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:27,083
Everybody walks away happy.

729
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,525
Everybody walks away?
What about the SWAT team...

730
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:35,962
and those people on the train?
They don't walk away.

731
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:38,083
What, you're gonna buy off
their families, too?

732
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:41,364
You can't make an omelette
without breaking a few eggs.

733
00:59:41,447 --> 00:59:43,677
Yeah, arrangements will be made.

734
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:48,403
The four of us walk out of here,
and seal the place up behind us.

735
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:52,276
Dr. Foster of the CDC,
announces that some kind of...

736
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:56,036
pack of rabid, carnivorous animals
attacked those people down there.

737
00:59:56,127 --> 00:59:57,196
Agent Pollack says...

738
00:59:57,287 --> 01:00:00,040
that while there were
multiple human casualties...

739
01:00:01,607 --> 01:00:03,404
the animals were contained
and destroyed.

740
01:00:03,487 --> 01:00:05,717
I send down a team
with heavy-duty chemicals...

741
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:08,879
to exterminate and incinerate
the insects, and bingo.

742
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,644
Before long, we are up and running.

743
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:15,165
What if it doesn't work out...

744
01:00:15,247 --> 01:00:17,522
and you end up
killing another team of men?

745
01:00:17,607 --> 01:00:21,236
That is a risk I'm willing to take
for as long as it takes.

746
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:24,159
No, it ends here.

747
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,241
Nobody walks away, least of all you.

748
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:32,802
Garcia. Stay here. Watch him.

749
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:43,281
Garcia.

750
01:00:49,087 --> 01:00:51,237
We don't have time for this.

751
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:19,919
What are you doing?

752
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:24,161
- It's coming now.
- What is?

753
01:01:26,927 --> 01:01:30,317
- What has been chasing us.
- Have you lost it?

754
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:34,800
I can hear it.

755
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:38,319
I can feel it.

756
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:42,880
I'm not letting it past me
without a fight.

757
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:47,999
I need your help to load up the car.
We're gonna blow up this tunnel...

758
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:50,244
and the fence is coming down
in a minute.

759
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:51,760
Don't worry.

760
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:55,326
I'll protect you
for as long as I can.

761
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,678
- But when it comes for you...
- What are you talking about?

762
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:01,723
When what comes for you?

763
01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:05,876
Death.

764
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:09,479
Don't fall apart on me.
I need you, man.

765
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,520
I'm sorry, sir.

766
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,238
I can't leave my post.

767
01:02:22,327 --> 01:02:23,442
Damn.

768
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,286
Just think.
When my men kill the bugs...

769
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,085
you're gonna have a sample to study.

770
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:03,284
You're gonna be the one who made
the discovery of a new species.

771
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,722
But you'd have to say
it came from another location.

772
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:08,367
Is everything that you do dishonest?

773
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,438
Mr. Reynolds will tell you
I'm not so bad.

774
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,599
I give to lots of charities.
I donate to several institutions...

775
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:15,962
including one with which
you'd be very familiar.

776
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:17,844
Of course, he that giveth...

777
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,316
can easily become
he that taketh away.

778
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:25,523
- Really? What does that mean?
- It means, Dr. Foster...

779
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:27,643
that I am
the largest anonymous contributor...

780
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,001
to your fine university...

781
01:03:29,087 --> 01:03:31,999
and that philanthropy can stop
at any time.

782
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:34,523
You know, you can keep your money.

783
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:37,121
I think you should save it
for lawyers.

784
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:39,477
- What was that?
- What?

785
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:45,760
I thought I saw something
up in the pipes.

786
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:58,486
Oh, my God.

787
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,761
Get under here.

788
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:37,242
What's going on?
We've got to get the train running.

789
01:04:37,327 --> 01:04:40,319
We're not going anywhere right now.
There's something out there.

790
01:04:40,407 --> 01:04:41,556
Bugs?

791
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,679
There was nothing in the tunnel.

792
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:47,964
We only saw one.
But, Matt, this one is different.

793
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:51,198
- Different how?
- It adapted. It flies.

794
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:55,757
- If these things get out...
- Yeah, I know.

795
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:59,157
- We have to leave now.
- Just be quiet. Shut up.

796
01:05:04,007 --> 01:05:06,237
I can't be here.
This cannot happen to me.

797
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:07,919
I cannot die like this.

798
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:09,963
Maybe you should
make the bug an offer.

799
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,405
Both of you, quiet.

800
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:23,323
- I don't hear anything.
- Maybe it flew away.

801
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:26,002
Yes, it flew away. Let's go.

802
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,766
- I don't think it's flown away.
- No, it's right above us.

803
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:36,801
- Garcia was right.
- About what?

804
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:40,841
- Death is coming.
- We're screwed.

805
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:51,005
I think it's gone.

806
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,125
What do we do now?

807
01:05:58,207 --> 01:05:59,526
You okay?

808
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:02,396
How far is the room
with the fuses and blasting caps?

809
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:06,116
It's just across the hall.
Do you think we can make it?

810
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:14,564
Now I'm out. Let's go.

811
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,403
It's locked. Now what?

812
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:27,046
I have a master key.

813
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:29,516
- It's one of these.
- Give it here.

814
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:35,043
- Hurry, please.
- Try another one.

815
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:36,355
Come on.

816
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:37,675
Come on.

817
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:39,396
Done.

818
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:53,077
Get the fuse and the blasting caps.

819
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:56,038
Garcia, do you read me?

820
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:59,405
We need your firepower here.
We're in the dry goods room.

821
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:01,603
It's across the way
from the demolition room.

822
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:05,680
Got it.
Detonator, cable, blasting caps.

823
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,805
I'll load the train with Garcia.

824
01:07:07,887 --> 01:07:09,445
You go to the chopper.
Get some help.

825
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,882
Garcia's lost it
and you know it, man.

826
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:16,006
- You're gonna need our help.
- Go outside and get some backup.

827
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:20,635
Look, I'll load the train.
I know how to rig the fuel cell...

828
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:22,877
set the timers
and then the auto pilot.

829
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:25,435
And I don't have time
to explain it to you, so...

830
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,803
- Don't like the sound of that.
- No!

831
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,037
Petronovich, you son of a bitch!

832
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:42,477
- Keys.
- Damn.

833
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:12,358
You son of a bitch!

834
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:15,638
- Matt, you all right?
- Yeah.

835
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,402
It's time! Bring it on!

836
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:34,156
Bring it on!

837
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:45,201
See you in hell, you son of a bitch.

838
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:48,641
Come on.

839
01:08:56,487 --> 01:08:59,638
- Emily, you all right?
- Guys, we got a bigger problem.

840
01:08:59,727 --> 01:09:01,843
- What bigger problem?
- It's the queen.

841
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:05,602
- What about the queen?
- Once she gets out, she'll multiply.

842
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,279
It just ain't a good day, is it?

843
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:09,881
We have to stop Petronovich
from getting on the chopper.

844
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:11,002
But he's got a lead on us.

845
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:14,045
Don't worry. He only runs fast
when he's chasing money.

846
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,800
Can you get the explosives
on the train by yourself?

847
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:18,240
I'll figure something out.

848
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:20,363
All right, good. Let's go after him.

849
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:39,355
Come on.

850
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:43,601
Damn it.

851
01:10:25,207 --> 01:10:29,325
Wait. Go up here. Take this route.
See if we can cut him off, okay?

852
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:05,402
No!

853
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,684
You had your chance.

854
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:25,599
- Come here.
- Matt!

855
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:28,805
- Get off of me.
- The bug!

856
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:31,321
- Let me go.
- I'm locked in!

857
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:34,556
Bastard. It's your lucky day.

858
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:48,399
Survival of the fittest.

859
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:26,921
Come on.

860
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:43,724
Let's go find Reynolds. Come on.

861
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:40,996
- Reynolds?
- Up front.

862
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:47,237
- Petronovich?
- Didn't make it.

863
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,602
What, he couldn't bribe the bug?

864
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:52,639
So, what's happening?

865
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:57,115
The dynamite's loaded,
and we're all wired up.

866
01:13:57,527 --> 01:13:59,643
We're just about ready to roll.

867
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:03,163
I lightened it up for more speed.

868
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:06,126
That's great.
So when do we get out of here?

869
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,163
- You go.
- What?

870
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:09,601
I can't go yet.

871
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:13,077
- What do you mean?
- It's the auto drive system.

872
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:18,406
It won't run on less than 5% power.
But we've only got 2%.

873
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:23,766
I'm gonna run it manually.

874
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:26,122
No way. You're crazy.
You're not gonna make it out.

875
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,482
Of course I am. Trust me.

876
01:14:28,767 --> 01:14:31,520
After all, I mean,
who built the place?

877
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,519
Wait, I don't believe you.

878
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:36,526
You said that there's
only one way out of here.

879
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,723
There's always another way.

880
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,083
Now look, whatever happens,
we have to make sure...

881
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,636
that they don't get out of here.

882
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:47,602
I don't like it.

883
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:50,675
Come on,
you said it yourself, Matt, right?

884
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:54,439
It has to end here.
It has to end now.

885
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:57,882
Go on, get out of here.

886
01:14:58,967 --> 01:15:00,366
Get out of here.

887
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,839
The high beams
will slow them down...

888
01:15:02,927 --> 01:15:05,919
but it won't be five minutes
before they're here.

889
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:11,839
- You smoke?
- Cigars, once in a while. Why?

890
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:16,675
Keep it. It's my lucky charm.

891
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:20,284
Who knows,
someday you might need a good light.

892
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,959
Thanks, Reynolds.

893
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:21,161
- Let me take a look at that.
- Not now.

894
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:23,477
- It's getting worse.
- Not now, we've gotta run.

895
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:25,558
It'll only take a second.

896
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:29,037
Not now. We've gotta run.

897
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:50,476
All right, I got an idea, okay?

898
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:01,927
- Just stay here, okay?
- No, wait.

899
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,437
Just trust me, stay here.

900
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:33,316
Watch out!

901
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:52,316
It's jammed.

902
01:19:39,247 --> 01:19:42,319
- It's over.
- What about the rest of those bugs?

903
01:19:42,807 --> 01:19:45,446
They can't survive
without the queen.

904
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:49,243
Let's get to the chopper.

905
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:57,324
- Reynolds should be with us.
- We couldn't have stopped him.

906
01:19:57,407 --> 01:20:00,319
He made up his mind when he offered
to take us into the tunnel.

907
01:20:00,407 --> 01:20:03,160
He couldn't have known
what was down there.

908
01:20:03,647 --> 01:20:05,444
He felt responsible.

909
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:07,879
So what happens now?

910
01:20:08,927 --> 01:20:11,282
Lot of debriefing and paperwork.

911
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:13,485
And the tunnel?

912
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:17,526
When the CDC looks at your report,
they'll be down there in no time...

913
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,485
to make sure
we didn't leave any surprises.

914
01:20:40,087 --> 01:20:42,965
So, you're gonna go back
to chasing serial killers?

915
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,720
- I was thinking of a vacation.
- Really?

916
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,799
- Maybe even taking a new hobby.
- Like what?

917
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,084
Maybe snowboarding.

918
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:54,440
It's difficult in the beginning.
You're gonna need some help.

919
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:57,997
- You know anybody who could help me?
- Maybe.
