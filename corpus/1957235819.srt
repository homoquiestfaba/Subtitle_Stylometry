1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,000
(uplifting orchestral music)

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,800
(dramatic jazzy synthesizer music)

3
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,720
(suspense music)

4
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,080
(gunshots)

5
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,910
- File number 13352.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,370
Submitting Agent C. Nelson.

7
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,460
Confidential.

8
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,380
The principles referred to in this report

9
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,700
are listed as Barry Rengler and Tim Gates.

10
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,060
Both top students at the
St. Louis Police Academy,

11
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,330
they were subsequently dismissed for

12
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,880
failing to answer a variety of charges.

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,540
In order to best understand the events

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,550
culminating in last night's
shootout in downtown

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,640
Los Angeles, it's necessary
to go back five days.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,750
(seagulls squawking)

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,000
(dramatic flute music)

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,410
(police radio chatter)

19
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,170
(car pulls in and brakes)

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,270
- Whoa!

21
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,270
(phone beeps)

22
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,100
- Hola.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,520
- Yo, what do you say, your pizza's

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,300
here, where do I bring it?

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,130
- What?

26
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,160
You got the wrong number,
I didn't order a pizza.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,310
- I don't think so!

28
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,560
You Tim Gates?

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,790
- Yeah, I'm Tim Gates.

30
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,120
I'm telling you, I did not order a pizza.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
- That's too bad, my friend, 'cause I

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,830
got a beautiful pepperoni and green pepper

33
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,710
Deluxer Pizza pizzas, now
you know what they say.

34
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,000
- What the hell are you talking about?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,470
- Antonio's knows pizza
like nobody's business!

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,710
- (laughs) I'll be a son of a bitch!

37
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,710
- Hey buddy, how you doing?

38
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,180
- What the hell are you doing?

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,770
- I'm at 414 Clayton
Street, St. Louis, Missouri,

40
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,140
I'm at the phone booth behind
Antonio's, and it's raining!

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,180
- Oh come on, are you still in

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,060
that dump above the restaurant?

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
- Well I'm waiting for my ship to come in.

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,640
- Is that why you're calling?

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,290
- Actually no, I'm coming out to LA.

46
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,990
- I don't believe it.

47
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,210
- You'll believe it when you see

48
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,290
the whites of my beady little eyes.

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,280
Hey listen, you're the one
who told me to come visit.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,780
Now do I need a place to stay?

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,750
Hello?

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,520
The silence is deafening.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,130
Listen, it's no big deal,
don't worry about it,

54
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,550
it's only a couple of
days, I'll get a motel.

55
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,130
- No no no, look, I
just haven't seen you in

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,540
a long time, I just wasn't expecting this.

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,970
- Well I'll tell you the truth, I didn't

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,700
really expect to call,
but listen, I really

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,130
don't wanna put you out,
don't worry about it.

60
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,760
- Hey look, you know what?

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,140
You're staying with me.

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,980
All right?

63
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,530
Not a problem.

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,110
So when's your flight coming?

65
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,870
- Friday, 10:23 AM.

66
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,530
- Okay great, you know what?

67
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,000
Dress casual because the
weather here is spectacular.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,070
- Oh damn it!

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,680
I was hoping it would rain.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,730
(laughs) All right, I'll see you Friday.

71
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,000
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,170
- Hey Tim, listen, I'm really
looking forward to seeing you.

73
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,790
- Yeah, me too.

74
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,710
Me too.

75
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,590
- All right, I'll see you later.

76
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,340
(phone hangs up)

77
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,940
(dramatic jazzy music)

78
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,120
(airplane landing)

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,100
You look good.

80
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,470
- Not as good as you.

81
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,960
What do you do besides run,
are you lifting tall buildings?

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,900
- (laughs) Nah, I just run.

83
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,430
Usually from the landlord.

84
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,910
- All right, well no landlords this week,

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,600
okay, because you're on vacation in

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,280
Southern California and I
am your neo-native guide.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,590
- I am all yours, you lead me, my friend.

88
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,670
- Hey, you know what, I could get into

89
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,430
some serious trouble if
anybody saw me talking

90
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,650
to a guy from St. Louis,
you know that right?

91
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,480
- Why?

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,630
- What do you mean?

93
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,580
Come on, the Rams, the
erstwhile Los Angeles Rams?

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,010
- I didn't get them to move
to St. Louis, are you crazy?

95
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,310
- Have you gone to a game yet?

96
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,460
- No, I can't get a ticket.

97
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,630
- All right, well you can get one

98
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,240
from me 'cause I'm all connected, okay?

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
- Really?

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,910
- My agency, sure.

101
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,290
- That would be great, that
would be great, thank you.

102
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,840
So how's Anita?

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,780
- Over.

104
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,620
Done.

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,450
- Really?

106
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,280
- Yeah, a long time ago.

107
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,250
- You're kidding me, I'm sorry.

108
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,080
- You ready for this?

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,730
No, don't worry about it, she moved to

110
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,880
Chicago with Carlin
Pardowski, can you imagine?

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,710
- What?

112
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,720
- I'm not kidding you.

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,560
- That fat putz?

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,140
- Uh-huh.

115
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,980
- Oh man.

116
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,470
Hey, how's Leon?

117
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,810
- Oh, my old man, he's the same,

118
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,510
he's living about 40 minutes away,

119
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,490
he's drinking cheap beer and cheaper wine.

120
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,540
I see him about every couple of years.

121
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,960
Works best for both of us, hey, let me

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,590
tell you, what do you think, huh?

123
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,420
- This is yours?

124
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,170
- You like?

125
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,230
- Like it?

126
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,320
This is beautiful.

127
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,810
Must've set you back
what, like 70, $80,000?

128
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,760
- I think this was 82-5, but who's

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,630
counting, I had a very good year.

130
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,630
- I guess so.

131
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,190
- Hey.

132
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,020
- What?

133
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,850
- You drive.

134
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,680
- Oh come on.

135
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,620
- Yeah, come on, we'll
do a little sightseeing,

136
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,270
it's all right, we'll settle
you in later, go ahead.

137
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,100
- Man!

138
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,890
Oh this is gonna be sweet.

139
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,980
All right, where to?

140
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,010
(car revs)

141
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,740
- Are you kidding, we're
in Southern California.

142
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,580
Hit it.

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,090
(tires screech)

144
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,630
- Woo hoo hoo!

145
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,970
(upbeat keyboard music)

146
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,290
You know, I can't believe I haven't

147
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,340
come out here before, I must be nuts.

148
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,010
- I'm telling you, you are nuts.

149
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,360
You could've called me anytime.

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,650
- Yeah, you know, but I just wasn't

151
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,730
ready to deal with what
happened yet, you know.

152
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,440
- Oh my God, you take things so hard.

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,370
You know, you should've done
like me, you say screw it.

154
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,570
You move on, there's no percentage

155
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,210
in carrying things with you.

156
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,290
- Yeah, well you know me,
I take things personally.

157
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,190
- Yeah, I know, I understand.

158
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,340
Look, it's been a few years, getting the

159
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,380
bitterness out of my
system, but I gotta tell

160
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,600
you something, that money
makes it a lot easier.

161
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,320
- (laughs) So let me ask you a question,

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,130
is this pretty much what you do all day,

163
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,740
or do you actually work for you money?

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,940
- This is it, I'm my own boss, you know?

165
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,660
If I want a day off, I'm the
only asshole I gotta speak to.

166
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,040
- I tell you, this is paradise.

167
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,950
- Isn't it?

168
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,040
- So what is it that you do?

169
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,780
- I take other people's
money, I invest it.

170
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,560
So if they make money, they share some

171
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
of it with me, the more I make

172
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,820
them, the more I make for myself.

173
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,780
- Simple.

174
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,030
Well not really, so what are you doing?

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,320
- Sell videos.

176
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,480
- Oh, like a distribution company.

177
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,360
- No, I manage a video
store on Clayton and Widen.

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,100
- (laughs) Come on,
Barry, are you serious?

179
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,370
You of all people?

180
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,290
I thought you'd be flying high by now.

181
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,560
- Well I kinda had my wings clipped.

182
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,660
- Oh come on, that happened to both of us.

183
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,480
I mean you can't dwell
on the past anymore.

184
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,600
I thought you'd go back to
law enforcement or something.

185
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
- I tried, believe me.

186
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,600
More places and people
than I can remember.

187
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,430
- And?

188
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,450
So?

189
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,660
- So I'm getting too old to be a rookie.

190
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,670
- Oh come on man, you know what?

191
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm gonna introduce you to some people,

192
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
you're gonna make some connections,

193
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,090
you're gonna find something right here.

194
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,470
- I don't know Tim, I'm a
St. Louis guy, you know?

195
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,610
- (laughs) Come on, don't give

196
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,830
me that Midwestern hayseed crap.

197
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,230
Come on, it's time to get your life back

198
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,960
into gear, that's what
you came here for right?

199
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,020
- No!

200
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,550
No, I came out here for a vacation.

201
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,130
- Oh please.

202
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,140
You could've gone on vacation anywhere.

203
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,820
We haven't seen each other in five years.

204
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,580
You came here to put the past where it

205
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,700
belongs, behind you, and
get on with your life.

206
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,160
Am I right?

207
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,180
- Is it that obvious?

208
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,160
- Yeah it's that obvious,
(mumbles) with the

209
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,750
white, pasty face you're wearing.

210
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,950
(laughter)

211
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,510
I'll tell you something.

212
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,350
Two days out here in California,

213
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,150
man, you're gonna be a different man.

214
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,110
They're not even gonna
recognize who Barry Rengler was.

215
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,760
Trust me on this, pally.

216
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
I know of what I speak.

217
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,730
(synthesizer funk music)

218
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,460
(car door opens)

219
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,900
(shuffling)

220
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,840
- You live here?

221
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,670
- Yeah.

222
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,440
- You kidding me?

223
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,790
Oh my God.

224
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,630
- Huh?

225
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,550
- This should be in a movie.

226
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,920
- It was!

227
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,090
You remember the party scene
in that Tom Cruise picture?

228
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,920
This was this.

229
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,800
- Are you kidding me?

230
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
- No.

231
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,990
- This is not real.

232
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,640
- You know, a friend of mine in a studio

233
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,580
mentioned it to a
location scout, next thing

234
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,350
I know they're paying me big money

235
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,040
to bring gorgeous women here, I thought

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,820
I died, I thought I went to Heaven.

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,250
I met three actresses in that day alone.

238
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,900
- Hey man.

239
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,080
- Deano, baby, hey!

240
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,960
You hard at work, you making me money?

241
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
- That's right.

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,920
- Good.

243
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,700
Dean Kessman, this is Barry Rengler.

244
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
- Hey.

245
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,950
- Dean is my personal techno geek, huh?

246
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,880
- Nice to meet you man.

247
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,780
- My pleasure.

248
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,800
- Hey listen, you know what?

249
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,780
Why don't you take that
bedroom on the left upstairs.

250
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,620
- Okay.

251
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,770
- Get unpacked, get yourself comfortable.

252
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,890
- Hey Dean, nice to meet you.

253
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,810
- Likewise.

254
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,330
- All right, give it to me straight, doc.

255
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,060
- Well I reseated all
the drive connections,

256
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,110
ran a diagnostic on a D-RAM, you had some

257
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,850
kind of conflict that was
corrupting the encoding

258
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,310
every time she tried to run the Bin-X.

259
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,330
(Tim snores mockingly)

260
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,610
- Is my computer working or not?

261
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,120
- Like she was out of the box.

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,290
- Oh baby, Michelangelo's
a chump compared to you.

263
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,890
Hey, one last thing, very important.

264
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,450
My online files, are they secure?

265
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,900
Because I hadn't changed my password

266
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,250
before the damn thing crashed.

267
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,130
- They're fine.

268
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,340
- Yes!

269
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,560
Thanks.

270
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,180
- Fighting broke out
overnight between rival

271
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,100
factions along the Israeli-Syrian border.

272
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,340
- Hey, what are you doing?

273
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,620
- I lost my wallet.

274
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,210
- Oh, man.

275
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,350
Well take it easy.

276
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,170
Where'd you have it last?

277
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,920
- If I knew that, it
wouldn't be lost would it?

278
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,190
- This is true.

279
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,510
- So unbelievable, I have all my

280
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,580
money in there, my ID, everything.

281
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,060
- All right, look, don't go crazy,

282
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,310
just try to think, think, where was it?

283
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,980
- I had it with me when
I got on the plane.

284
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,240
Pretty sure I had it when I got off

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,950
the plane in LA and when I met you.

286
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,740
- You know what?

287
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,580
LAX.

288
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,910
Pickpockets.

289
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,780
- Oh great, this is great,
now what am I gonna do?

290
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,880
You know how long it's gonna take me

291
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,350
to get all that stuff reissued?

292
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,980
Especially from Missouri.

293
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,700
- You know what, don't
even worry about it, okay?

294
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,310
I'll cover you while
you're here for your trip.

295
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,510
- No, no, no, no!

296
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,380
- No, I'm serious, look, I got the cash,

297
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,890
it's not a big deal, you're here anyway.

298
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,470
You just pay me when
you get your stuff back.

299
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,790
- You see, I hate this, I hate being

300
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,710
a pain in the ass right off the bat.

301
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,110
- You're a pain in the ass whether

302
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,230
you have your wallet or
not, what's the deal?

303
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,810
Come on, we're friends, I haven't seen you

304
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,140
in a long time, let me take care of you.

305
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,790
- You know what, I'll
make some phone calls

306
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,410
and try to get the stuff replaced.

307
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,600
- Oh wait a minute, hang on.

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,780
You know what, just leave that

309
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,250
'till the morning, it's no big deal.

310
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,930
Come on, we're going out tonight.

311
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,060
I want you to put on your best threads.

312
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,470
- Well these are my best threads.

313
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,890
- (laughs) This is it?

314
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,860
Oh my God, maybe you'll create
a new look, Midwestern funk.

315
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,530
- Yeah, I doubt it.

316
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,920
- All right, let me help you out.

317
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Nah nah nah.

318
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,650
That's it.

319
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,640
There we go, okay.

320
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,540
All right, that way so you
don't embarrass yourself.

321
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,970
- I'm not gonna embarrass myself.

322
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,400
- Well so you don't embarrass me.

323
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,940
- (laughs) Where we going?

324
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,520
(upbeat synthesizer music)

325
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,040
(hip hop music)
(crowd chatter)

326
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,650
- Here, I'm giving you
my credit card all right?

327
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,500
- Why?

328
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,030
- It would look pretty stupid if

329
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,240
I have to keep giving you money

330
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,510
all night like you're my kid brother.

331
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,860
- Aw come on Tim, I can't (mumbles).

332
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,920
- Oh God, come on, here, look,

333
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,500
just take some cash, okay?

334
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,280
Have some cash, I want you to have it,

335
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,150
use it in case of an emergency, all right?

336
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,260
Listen, Vic's the owner, anything you

337
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,010
want, just put it on my account.

338
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,340
- You know the owner?

339
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,330
- Yeah, actually we're partners.

340
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,760
- In what?

341
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,950
- Come on buddy, what's the matter,

342
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,080
you getting a little slow or what?

343
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,950
- Wait a minute, you
mean you own this place?

344
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,680
- Yeah, I got a little piece.

345
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,500
It's an investment, I got
tight with Vic, hey Vic!

346
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
- Hey Timmy!

347
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,220
- Tim!

348
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,050
- Baby!

349
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,870
(smooching)

350
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,870
- Hey, baby.

351
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,070
How are you?

352
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,250
- Now this must be your
cousin from Milwaukee.

353
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,080
- He's actually a very old friend of mine.

354
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,030
Cat, Bar, Bar, Cat.

355
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,450
- Actually St. Louis, nice to meet you.

356
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,030
- Hey, you've come a long
way from St. Louis, Louis.

357
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,240
That's an old song, in
case you don't know.

358
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,300
- Oh I know.

359
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
- So what's up, are you
just visiting or what?

360
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,590
- Yeah, I'm just visiting.

361
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,440
- Well you've come to the right place.

362
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,540
If you want, I'll show you around.

363
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,210
- Oh come on, it's okay.

364
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,790
- I'm just being friends with the tourist!

365
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,630
- Thank you Cat, see you
later Cat, maybe later!

366
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,190
Hey, is Syd around?

367
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,480
- She's in the back.

368
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,300
- Well send her out, will you?

369
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,220
- All right, bye Louis.

370
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,780
- Be careful of that one, she's a tornado.

371
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,790
- Really?

372
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,170
That's the point isn't it?

373
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,160
- Well I guess it can be.

374
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,660
Hey there you are.

375
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,970
Syd Deshaye, Barry Rengler, he's a

376
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,220
very dear old friend of mine.

377
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,440
- Why didn't you call me?

378
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,920
Joe Millston waited until after 3, Tim.

379
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,000
- (laughs) Syd handles
the PR for the club,

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,240
I guess I missed a meeting or something.

381
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,430
- A meeting we've been trying to

382
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,260
schedule for a month,
why didn't you call me?

383
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,880
- Come on Syd, take it easy, he's an

384
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
old friend, he came to town, I picked

385
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,940
him up, we've just been
visiting, all right?

386
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,300
- You could've called.

387
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,140
- Look, I...

388
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,460
- Wrangler, huh?

389
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,030
Just rode in today.

390
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,260
- Actually it's Rengler, R-E.

391
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,570
- Ah.

392
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,110
How you liking paradise so far, cowboy?

393
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,070
- Well I'll tell you the truth,
I could get used to this.

394
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,650
- Don't do that, it's not a good idea.

395
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,950
Out here you never wanna
take anything at face value.

396
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,540
Just remember that.

397
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,790
- And what, where are you going?

398
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,390
- I've got work to do.

399
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,850
Nice meeting you, cowboy.

400
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,970
- Oh come on now.

401
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,550
Look, I gotta go...

402
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,460
You know what I mean?

403
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,860
I'll be back in a minute, all right?

404
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,020
(hip hop music)
(crowd chatter)

405
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,290
- Are you Tim?

406
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,790
- Excuse me?

407
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,670
- It's my first night,
I was told that this

408
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,790
was the owner's table, so you must be Tim.

409
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,990
- Actually I'm a friend of Tim's.

410
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,580
- Okay.

411
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,540
If you're not Tim, then who is?

412
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,390
- Tim is.

413
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,550
(chuckles)

414
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,390
- Great.

415
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,070
- I'll point him out to
you when I see him, okay?

416
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,470
- Thanks.

417
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,840
Would you like a drink anyway?

418
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,300
- Yeah, can I get scotch and
soda with a splash please?

419
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,960
You know what, he's right there.

420
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,650
- Wow, he has a bit of
a temper doesn't he?

421
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,150
- I don't think that's any
of our business, do you?

422
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,720
- Brooke, Brooke Ashton.

423
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,180
- Hi.

424
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,550
- I'm trying it out for a
while, getting used to it.

425
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,230
What do you think, do you like it?

426
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,100
I thought I needed something
more professional sounding.

427
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,490
Because I'm an actress, but I bet you

428
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,430
already figured that
out because of my name.

429
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,600
Brooke Ashton.

430
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:09,270
I mean Mildred, what the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

431
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,910
- Hey, how about getting
the man his drink?

432
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,910
- Excuse me.

433
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,420
(Vic laughs)

434
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,730
- You don't need to
rescue me, she was cute.

435
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,050
- That's what you think.

436
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,750
I interviewed her for the job.

437
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,300
If you don't stop her, you'll get her

438
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,310
entire life story and no booze.

439
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,520
(laughter)

440
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,590
Vic Pennington.

441
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,740
- Hey, Barry Rengler, nice to meet you.

442
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,750
It's a nice place you got here, Vic.

443
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,040
- You a friend of Tim's?

444
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,530
- Yeah, from St. Louis,
I'm out here just visiting.

445
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,670
- Well if you need anything,
anything at all, just holler.

446
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,750
You're a friend of Tim Gates,
you got carte Blanche here.

447
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,240
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

448
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,480
- Look, we're out of here all right?

449
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,310
- What?

450
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,140
I just ordered a drink.

451
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,480
- Look, you wanna have a drink, stay here,

452
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,150
that's fine, okay, but
I'm leaving all right?

453
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,680
- It was nice meeting you, Vic.

454
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,090
- He'll cool off, just give him a minute.

455
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,110
- Hey.

456
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,860
Hey man, I don't know what
happened, but whatever it was...

457
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,160
- It's no big deal, okay, it's not

458
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,900
your fault, Syd just went off again.

459
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,750
It's no big deal.

460
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,760
- Was she...

461
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,630
- I just said it's no big deal, okay?

462
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,320
- (mumbles).

463
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,870
- Once you jump in the sack with a broad,

464
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,400
don't ever expect to work with them again.

465
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,030
Why don't I learn that?

466
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,190
You know what, I'm sorry, it's just...

467
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,310
- It's cool, forget about it.

468
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,810
- Syd pushes me to a point of distraction.

469
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,420
- Yeah, I could eat.

470
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,860
- All right, you know what, if we were

471
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,930
back home, 2 AM, where would we go?

472
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,440
- Fitz's, right?
- Fitz's, come on.

473
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,110
- Burgers, fries, right?

474
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,920
(laughter)

475
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
Kitchen sauce?

476
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,940
- Yup, absolutely.

477
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,710
- Oh my God, I can taste the
grease, I mean I dream of it.

478
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,810
- It's gone.

479
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,640
- What?

480
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,470
- Gone.

481
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,380
Fitz died, they tore it down.

482
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,230
They put in one of those giant...

483
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,090
You know, those giant drugstore chains.

484
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,420
- Oh my God, that breaks my heart.

485
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,430
- Well there's a lot back
home you wouldn't recognize.

486
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,260
- Jesus.

487
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,680
(laughs) Do you remember that thing that

488
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,480
we used to do that would
drive the girls crazy?

489
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,320
Huh?

490
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,190
- Oh God, you know I forgot about that?

491
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,630
- Come on man, for old time sake,

492
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,910
come on, do it one more time.

493
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,740
- Are you crazy?

494
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,400
- Yeah, come on, give it to me one time.

495
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,950
- (sighs) All right.

496
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,610
(clears throat)

497
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,910
(Barry As Tim) Barbie.

498
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,160
(laughter)

499
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,590
(Normal Voice) Hang on, wait.

500
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,030
(Barry as Tim) Barbie, it's Tim.

501
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,330
(laughter)

502
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,340
Listen honey, can we go out Friday night?

503
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,590
(laughter)

504
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,390
Listen, Barry's the one that suggested

505
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,420
I call you, he knows about this.

506
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,670
(laughter)

507
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,450
- Oh man.

508
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,500
Oh God, I miss those days.

509
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,570
I'm glad you're here.

510
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,400
- Me too.

511
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,030
- All right, man.

512
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,950
(car revs)

513
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,620
(dramatic orchestral music)

514
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,130
Boo!

515
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,700
Rise and shine, campers!

516
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,770
It's gonna be a beautiful
day in the north woods, huh?

517
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,380
Hey, listen, I hate to be a rude host,

518
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,780
but I'm gonna have to
take care of a little

519
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,190
bit of business for the next couple days.

520
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,490
- Oh, okay, I'll be fine.

521
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,980
- Well I mean it's not quite that simple,

522
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm gonna be gone for three days.

523
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,560
- Really?

524
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,400
- Yeah, I got this client
on Catalina Island.

525
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,780
I made him a deal that
I would charter a boat,

526
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,550
I'd motor over, take
him for a little diving,

527
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,320
a little snorkeling,
and a lot of drinking.

528
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,420
- Tough assignment.

529
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,720
Want me to go instead?

530
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,340
- I would love you to,
I mean like I really

531
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,790
wanna pretend to be this guy's best friend

532
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,610
for three days just to lock up an account.

533
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,270
- Ugly job, but somebody's
gotta do it I guess, right?

534
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,940
- You know, I know you don't
believe what I do is work.

535
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,150
- I don't believe it's work.

536
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,590
- Come on man, it is,
it is, but irregardless,

537
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,380
you're gonna be stuck here
alone for the next three days.

538
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,070
- I'll be fine.

539
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,180
- All right, I just wanna give
you a little something, here.

540
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,450
- No no no, come on, no!

541
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,070
- Take it, take it, come
on, live it up, all right?

542
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,250
That's what it's here for, it's here

543
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,930
to enjoy and, you know, protect yourself.

544
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,890
(Barry laughs)

545
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,060
If there's anything else you
need just call Vic, okay?

546
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,120
He'll get it for you.

547
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,530
- Hey, what about Syd?

548
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,030
I can take care of her if you want.

549
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,620
- Please, trust me, stay away from Syd.

550
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,140
She's a nightmare, okay?

551
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,810
- I wasn't asking for that reason.

552
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,170
- Yeah, I'm sure you weren't.

553
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,090
Are you okay with this?

554
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,720
- With this, with this house, the beach?

555
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,580
Beautiful girls, the credit
cards, the car of cars?

556
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,410
- Oh yeah, the car.

557
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,340
(keys jingle)

558
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,200
Here you are.

559
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,100
- There's a car.

560
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,420
- Have a good time, all right?

561
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,250
- Have a good trip.

562
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,250
Thanks, man.

563
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,060
(upbeat jazzy music)

564
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,090
(mumbles).

565
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,340
(car revs)

566
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,810
(funky synthesizer music)

567
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,370
(phone rings)

568
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,180
(answering machine beeps)

569
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,610
- Hola, go ahead at the beep.

570
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,950
Leave the number and I'll get back.

571
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,600
(answering machine beeps)

572
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,400
- Call me, I've got a
client ready to deal.

573
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,230
We're talking 3.5 mill,
can you cover that?

574
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,980
Let me know, this guy's for real.

575
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,840
- Vic, yeah hey, it's me.

576
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,730
Listen, I forgot to mention I'm

577
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,290
gonna be gone for a few days, okay?

578
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,020
Probably getting a couple
of calls, maybe some

579
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,980
visits from some deals
that are still pending.

580
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,040
- Hey now, don't be
putting me into the middle.

581
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,410
- (laughs) Don't worry about it, listen,

582
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,790
I swear to God it's okay, all right?

583
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,270
Just stalling a couple of guys,

584
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,720
you know what I mean, some cashflow stuff.

585
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,580
All right?

586
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,500
Just tell them I'm out and I'll

587
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,210
call them as soon as I'm back in.

588
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,390
- Okay.

589
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,640
- Yeah, oh Vic, hey listen.

590
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,160
You remember that buddy of
mine that was from St. Louis?

591
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,730
You met him the other night.

592
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,560
- Barry?

593
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,260
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, that's him.

594
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,380
Listen man, I'd really appreciate it if

595
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,290
you just let him have
whatever he wants, okay?

596
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,480
I'll cover it.

597
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,100
Yeah, whatever he needs.

598
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,230
Whatever he orders.

599
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,700
That's it, just put it on my ticket okay?

600
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,760
- Got it.

601
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,020
Have a good trip.

602
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,420
- Thanks.

603
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,250
Bye.

604
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,960
- Tim's leaving town?

605
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,550
- You didn't know?

606
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,080
- When is he leaving?

607
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,540
- I don't know exactly, he didn't say.

608
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,710
Just that he'd be away for
a few days on business.

609
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,640
- Business my ass, I wonder
who she is this time.

610
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,210
- Hey Syd, honey, I don't
ask and neither should you.

611
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,040
That way madness lies.

612
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,280
- What did he want from you?

613
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,870
- Give messages if anybody calls him.

614
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,560
And he wants me to give
an open tab to his friend.

615
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,320
- The cowboy from St. Louis?

616
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,460
- Yup.

617
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,660
You know this guy?

618
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,640
- He's an old friend of Tim's.

619
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,970
I guess they have a history.

620
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,580
- Well I gotta get to work.

621
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,340
- What?

622
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,690
- You know Tim's friend?

623
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,860
Not his usual type, is he?

624
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,770
Or yours.

625
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,040
- You know what, he's an old friend.

626
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,460
I guess they have some catching up to do.

627
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,830
- I don't think so.

628
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,620
You know, I saw the way Tim was looking at

629
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,070
him when he brought him
in here the other day.

630
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,520
He wouldn't take that guy to the

631
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,620
supermarket if there
wasn't a deposit on him.

632
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,180
- You know something Cat, I don't

633
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,580
know what goes on in Tim's head.

634
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,340
I just know that I work
here, just like you.

635
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,170
So let's drop it okay?

636
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,240
- Okay.

637
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,670
(gentle jazzy music)

638
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,400
(car revs)

639
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,930
(honking)

640
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,490
Hey, Louis!

641
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,810
- Hey, Cat right?

642
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,320
- That's right, good memory.

643
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,250
So what's up?

644
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,960
Where's your buddy Tim?

645
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,090
- Away on business.

646
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,480
- Awww, and you're filling in
for him while he's gone huh?

647
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Doing a fine job too.

648
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
- Just doing a little shopping.

649
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,540
- Uh-huh, I can see.

650
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,570
(laughs)

651
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,570
- So how long you been
working at the club?

652
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,030
- A couple months.

653
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,040
- Like it?

654
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,290
- Yeah, it's a job for now.

655
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,430
- Let me guess, you're an actress

656
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,500
and being a waitress in the meantime

657
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,970
until the right role comes along, right?

658
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,200
- Well you know, it's
like the big guy said.

659
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,340
Whole world's a stage, Louis.

660
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,320
Everything's just another part.

661
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,940
Even waitressing.

662
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,920
What counts is how you play it.

663
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,170
So you and Tim go way back?

664
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,010
- Far enough.

665
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,300
- You don't exactly strike
me as Butch and Sundance.

666
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,940
Come on, I'm curious, hence my name.

667
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,090
- Well you know what happened

668
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,530
because of curiosity don't you?

669
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,610
- I know, I can't help it, it's my nature.

670
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,020
So you and Gates?

671
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,530
- Well we were good friends
once, a long time ago.

672
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,920
- Uh-huh, I sense melodrama, I'm hooked.

673
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,880
- No no no, now it's your turn.

674
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,170
- (sighs) All right.

675
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,170
- All right.

676
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,860
What's the deal with Tim and Syd?

677
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,720
- Well in this case, what you don't

678
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,820
know just might save
your cute little butt.

679
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,330
- Well I'll keep that in mind.

680
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,500
- All right.

681
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,080
Hey, do you wanna buy me lunch?

682
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,230
- Yeah, okay.

683
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,060
- Okay.

684
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,030
I'm so sorry, I forgot I
can't, I don't have time.

685
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,520
- Oh.

686
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,710
- How about a rain check then?

687
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,830
- Fine.

688
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,040
- All right.

689
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,990
Cool, next time.

690
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,990
- All right.

691
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,320
- Oh, and Louis?

692
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,510
Any friend of Tim's is a friend of mine.

693
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,650
- I'll keep that in mind too.

694
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,480
- You do that.

695
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
- Bye.

696
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,070
- Bye, Louis.

697
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,150
(gentle flute music)

698
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,790
(car lock beeps)

699
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,630
- Hey Tim!

700
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,460
Yo, man.

701
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,050
Whoa man, sorry, I thought you were Tim.

702
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,100
- I borrowed some of his clothes.

703
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,190
- That's right, you don't look too

704
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,780
close you guys could be like brothers.

705
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,620
- You think?

706
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,880
- Absolutely, two of a kind.

707
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,240
Hey listen, my shop's just a few blocks

708
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,430
down so I wanted to drop this off for him.

709
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,460
- Yeah okay.

710
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,640
He's out of town on business, when he

711
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,030
gets back I'll tell him you stopped by.

712
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,930
- He left you in charge of the home front?

713
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,070
- Something like that.

714
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,300
- So while the cat's
away, you're the mouse.

715
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,250
(Barry laughs)

716
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,090
Cool.

717
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,610
(glass shatters)

718
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,230
- You lousy son of a bitch!

719
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,570
- What the hell?

720
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,910
- Oh my God, I am so sorry.

721
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,750
- It's okay, I'm okay.

722
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,490
- No no, I thought you were Tim.

723
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,730
- He's (mumbles) what are you doing?

724
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,750
- Well I saw you from behind,
I saw that jacket and I...

725
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,190
- Well I borrowed it from Tim,
I thought it would be okay.

726
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,160
- No, it is, it's just
I gave Tim this jacket.

727
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,180
- Don't worry about it, I'm fine.

728
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,370
More importantly, what did Tim do to you

729
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,710
to make you wanna throw something at him?

730
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,770
- I planned on doing worse than that.

731
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,070
- (laughs) Well I'll
take your word for it.

732
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,860
- I'm sorry, you know
what, I don't wanna get

733
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,690
you caught in the middle
of all of this stuff.

734
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,730
- You didn't answer my question.

735
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,400
- Oh right, right, what did Tim do.

736
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,860
Well let's see, what didn't he do?

737
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,030
Your friend's a real son of a
bitch in case you didn't know.

738
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,710
- Is this a scorned woman talking,

739
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,880
or is this a business associate talking?

740
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,890
- No, no, this is a human being talking.

741
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,540
Somebody who is sick and tired of

742
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,250
being treated like a stray dog.

743
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,210
You know, petted, fed,
loved, then ignored,

744
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,610
kicked around and finally
locked out of the house.

745
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,610
You getting the picture?

746
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,700
- Well he's gone for a couple of days,

747
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,460
went to Catalina, rented a boat, said he

748
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,880
had to lock down an account or something.

749
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,450
- And you believed him.

750
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,050
- Why wouldn't I?

751
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,780
Hey, you don't have to go,

752
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm not gonna call the cops on you.

753
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,350
- Oh thank you, but I have
work to do back at the club.

754
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,770
- You want me to tell him you stopped by?

755
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,140
- You know, if you wanna tell Tim

756
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,020
something you can tell him he's a bastard.

757
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,470
You can tell him that we've reached the

758
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,970
proverbial end of the road, he and I.

759
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,330
You can tell him adios.

760
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,710
You can tell him to crap out and die.

761
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm just getting warmed up.

762
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,000
- Will do.

763
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,840
(loud explosions)

764
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,470
(beeping)

765
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,670
- Trucker strike, (mumbles)
scheduled to resume tomorrow.

766
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,510
Meanwhile, here in Southern California,

767
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,200
a mysterious explosion has rocked

768
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,280
the waters off of Catalina Island.

769
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,600
Chuck Williams has more
from Marina Del Ray.

770
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,390
- Well the search continues for survivors,

771
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,430
but so far none have been found.

772
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,990
Coast Guard authorities say it would be

773
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,250
something of a miracle were anyone

774
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,830
to be rescued now, but they'll

775
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,080
keep searching until all hope is gone.

776
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,810
And, they admitted, they may never

777
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,960
know what caused this explosion.

778
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,130
This is Chuck Williams reporting

779
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,630
live from Marina Del Ray for KLAAY News.

780
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,220
(ominous orchestral music)

781
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,490
(phone rings)

782
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,310
- Marina Charter, this is Gordy.

783
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,790
- Yeah, hi, I'm interested in a boat

784
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,140
you have for rent named Papa's Joy.

785
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,360
- That craft's not available,

786
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,950
can I help you with something else?

787
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,780
- Well I'll tell you, I'm
really kinda interested in

788
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,960
that one, my friend told
me it was a great boat.

789
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,890
- Sorry, I got others though.

790
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,940
- Well is it just out, or
is it unavailable, or what?

791
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,950
- Who is this please?

792
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,450
(phone rings)

793
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,530
- Yeah.

794
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,470
- Hey, that you?

795
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,060
Your voice sounds a little off.

796
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,400
- Sorry, I caught a cold.

797
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,830
- Drink a lot of juices.

798
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,310
- Yeah, right, thanks.

799
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,600
- The deal's on, 3.5
in your account today.

800
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,020
Usual percentage.

801
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,740
- I'm not so sure.

802
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,570
- Oh come on champ, you can do it.

803
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,590
- Well I wouldn't expect too much.

804
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,160
- Only perfection as always.

805
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,580
I'll be in touch.

806
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,370
(hip hop music)
(crowd chatter)

807
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,400
- Hello, handsome.

808
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,320
How about that rain check?

809
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,020
- Not right now, Cat.

810
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,330
- Come on, I'm just trying to

811
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,610
spice up your dull Midwestern life.

812
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,010
- Well my dull Midwestern life

813
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,360
doesn't need any spicing, I need

814
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,010
to speak with Syd, have you seen her?

815
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,610
- I know that you're trying to look

816
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,910
like Tim and dress like Tim and all that,

817
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,130
but seriously, what has
she got that's so special?

818
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,010
- You know what, give me
another chance, next time

819
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,860
I'll give you my
undivided attention, okay?

820
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,040
Hey Vic!

821
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,090
Vic!

822
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,490
Excuse me.

823
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,320
Vic!

824
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,180
- Why don't you get a friggin'

825
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,740
handicap space pal, you're in my spot!

826
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,030
- I'm sorry, I just need one second, Vic!

827
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,260
- Oh is that so?

828
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,460
How about if I just shove one of

829
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,060
these bar stools down your throat?

830
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,100
- You know what, I don't want
any trouble, my friend, okay?

831
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,730
- Oh, you don't want any trouble?

832
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,850
- Vic!

833
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,440
- Well how about I blow your stupid

834
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,380
brains all over this nice clean bar?

835
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,800
- Come on, take it easy, man.

836
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,870
Take it easy.

837
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,300
- What the hell, where's my gun?

838
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,550
- That's enough pal, time to head home.

839
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,460
- Sorry about that, man.

840
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,570
You looking for Tim?

841
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,730
- No, Syd.

842
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,160
- Hey, I'm right here, cowboy.

843
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,950
- Can we talk in private?

844
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,040
- Yeah, sure.

845
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,090
- Oh, uh...

846
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,620
You might wanna hold onto that,
that guy might want it back.

847
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,450
- How did you do that?

848
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,940
Wow, that was quite a trick up in here.

849
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,780
Did you learn that in the academy?

850
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,300
- So you do know about me and Tim.

851
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,890
- I've heard stories, but the way Tim

852
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,730
tells it, you would've made quite a cop.

853
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,220
- That's something we'll never know.

854
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,640
I have to ask you a question.

855
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,300
How much do you really
know about Tim's work?

856
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,460
- Enough, why?

857
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,880
- What is it?

858
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,570
Is it drugs?

859
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,740
- Get to the point, Barry.

860
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,300
- Tim was supposed to rent
a boat and go to Catalina?

861
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,720
- Yeah, whatever, yeah, yeah.

862
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,080
- Well I think somebody killed him.

863
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,370
It was reported in the news that a

864
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,050
boat out of Marina Del Ray blew up off the

865
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,690
coast of Catalina and
there were no survivors.

866
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,330
- That's crazy, I mean come on,

867
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,690
there's a zillion boats that go

868
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,400
off the coast of Catalina every day,

869
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,060
what makes you think this was Tim's boat?

870
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,450
- Have you heard from him?

871
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,570
- Well no, I haven't heard from him,

872
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,790
but that's normal, I don't hear

873
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,920
from him for days and it's normal.

874
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
- Yeah, well somebody called the house

875
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,250
and said that the money was put into

876
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,240
Tim's account and that the deal was on.

877
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,860
He thought I was Tim.

878
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,190
What's the deal?

879
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,580
- Tim can't be dead, Barry.

880
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,140
- I'm not saying he is dead.

881
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,780
The Coast Guard won't tell me anything,

882
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,110
but when I was at his house the other day

883
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,090
I found information on chartering boats

884
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,670
and I think it's the same boat.

885
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
- Okay.

886
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,440
What do you want from me?

887
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,070
Tim and I...

888
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,240
- Whatever your relationship with

889
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,120
Tim is, I really don't care.

890
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,290
If the boat that exploded was his,

891
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,870
then somebody killed my friend.

892
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
- I don't know anything.

893
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,490
You don't believe me do you?

894
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,650
Barry, I really wish I did,
but I don't know anything.

895
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,300
- I gotta go.

896
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,550
- I'll walk you out.

897
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,250
Where are you going?

898
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,650
- I'm gonna go back to the house, get some

899
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,320
sleep, and try to figure all this out.

900
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,180
- Okay, but do you feel
like taking a walk?

901
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,490
I mean you've borrowed
everything else, you might

902
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,500
as well take a stroll
with his ex-girlfriend.

903
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,560
- Sure.

904
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,390
- Okay.

905
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,310
So tell me about you
and Tim in the academy.

906
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,790
- He never told you?

907
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,540
- No, he did, I just
wanna hear your version.

908
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,230
- 16 kilos of heroin disappeared from the

909
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,960
evidence lockup the
week we were (mumbles).

910
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,730
I didn't do it, but I
didn't have an alibi.

911
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,510
They suspected Tim and they squeezed me to

912
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:15,150
testify against him, but
I refused to do that.

913
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,840
So to get rid of the smell, they just

914
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,650
swept everything and
everybody under the carpet.

915
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,700
- Well at least you didn't let
them turn you into a snitch.

916
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,530
- Yeah, real noble.

917
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,840
Now I sell videos for a living.

918
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
- Why can't you just go to

919
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,540
another town, another police force?

920
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,330
- Can't do that because something like

921
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,090
that goes on your
permanent record, and once

922
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,670
it's on your record,
no one will touch you.

923
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,870
Funny thing is my father was a cop.

924
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,590
I always wanted to be just like him.

925
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,160
That's corny, isn't it?

926
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,700
- No.

927
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,620
Not at all.

928
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,440
- All right, enough about me.

929
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,540
What's in the bag?

930
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,370
- This?

931
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,920
This is how I unwind.

932
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,420
(circus melody organ music)

933
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,090
(laughs) Are you impressed?

934
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,200
- Very.

935
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,030
- Oh yeah?

936
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,760
Why don't you come and join me?

937
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
Come make a fool of yourself.

938
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
- No, no no no no no, I've made a

939
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,030
fool of myself enough in my life.

940
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,520
No, come on, go on.

941
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
- All right.

942
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,860
Well I was Dean's List at UCLA, Poly-Sci.

943
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,430
My dad was in politics in Washington

944
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,260
he wanted me to join him there.

945
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,510
Then I met Tim.

946
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,200
- Well he has a way of
changing life paths doesn't he?

947
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,420
- Yeah, he does.

948
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,370
He got me an apartment and he got me

949
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,260
a job at Vic's and, I don't know, he has

950
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,350
a way of coming into your life and...

951
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,390
Putting you off balance, you know?

952
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,040
Well anyway, one day I woke up and

953
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,560
I realized that my life was so hooked into

954
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,120
Tim's that I didn't have
one of my own anymore.

955
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,210
And I wondered if I could start over.

956
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,530
I didn't know if I had enough
raw materials to do that.

957
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,000
So are you gonna call
the cops about the boat?

958
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,140
- No, not right away.

959
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,570
I mean if Tim was on that boat they

960
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,860
would've contacted one of us by now.

961
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,220
And besides, you have to be missing

962
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,640
48 hours before they'll even talk to you.

963
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,570
- So you'll call me if
anything turns up right?

964
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,410
- Yes.

965
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,180
- You sure you don't wanna come out here?

966
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,020
- Yes.

967
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,810
(Syd laughs)

968
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,890
- Okay, well get out of here then.

969
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,730
- All right.

970
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,570
- Okay.

971
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
- Goodnight.

972
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,330
- Hey!

973
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,060
This was nice, cowboy.

974
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,720
(circus melody organ music)

975
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,730
(police siren wails)

976
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,510
- Hey Tim, you're home!

977
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,140
Jesus man, you had me worried,
I thought you'd bought it.

978
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,970
Hey...

979
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,680
(loud smack)
(dramatic sting)

980
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,850
(Barry groans)
(punching and kicking)

981
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,270
(phone rings)

982
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,310
Hello?

983
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,250
- Still no Tim, huh?

984
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,100
- How did you know I wasn't him?

985
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,910
- Tim always answers the phone in Spanish.

986
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,650
You know, hola.

987
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,510
Signals the party on the
other end that it's him.

988
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,840
- I'll try to remember that.

989
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:36,220
- You know, I was thinking
I had done the rudest thing.

990
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,540
I told somebody to call me and

991
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,560
then I didn't give him my number,

992
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,470
so I figured would
cowboy be smart enough to

993
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,360
go through that entire
house to find my number?

994
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,320
Probably not, so here I am ready

995
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,640
to give you my number so you don't

996
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,390
think I was yanking your chain.

997
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,390
Are you ready?

998
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,800
- No, listen Syd, somebody broke in here.

999
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,360
- Are you okay?

1000
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,970
- (groans) Yeah.

1001
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,970
I surprised the guy and he took off.

1002
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,880
Course he hung around
long enough to introduce

1003
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,700
my ribs to my spine, but nothing serious.

1004
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,430
- Oh my God, is anything missing?

1005
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,590
- Well I really haven't
had a chance to check.

1006
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,510
- Did you call the cops this time?

1007
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,840
- No, I'm a little worried to call them.

1008
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,320
I mean the burglar can
certainly come up with

1009
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,760
a better excuse than I
could for being here.

1010
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,870
At least he could...

1011
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,760
(uplifting jingle)

1012
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,780
He could prove who he is.

1013
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,190
- What are you talking about?

1014
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,120
- I lost my wallet the
first day I got here.

1015
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
My ID, cash.

1016
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,020
Everything.

1017
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,510
Other than the clothes on my back,

1018
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,660
everything that I've been using is Tim's.

1019
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,590
That might look a little
strange to the cops.

1020
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,990
- Yeah, especially if he washes up

1021
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,110
off the shore of Catalina tomorrow.

1022
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,060
Nice vacation.

1023
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,510
- Hey listen, I gotta put
this place back together.

1024
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,340
- Okay.

1025
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,160
Well get some sleep, cowboy.

1026
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,480
Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow and

1027
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,770
find out this is all just a bad dream.

1028
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,560
- At this rate I'm lucky if I wake up.

1029
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,450
- Another beautiful day in paradise.

1030
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,450
- All right.

1031
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,150
- Goodnight, cowboy.

1032
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,370
- Bye.

1033
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,950
(Syd hangs up)

1034
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,210
Hey!

1035
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,100
Hey...

1036
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,850
Shit, I forgot to get the number.

1037
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,730
Oh what a headache.

1038
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,810
(gentle jazz and wind chime music)

1039
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,130
- 555-3319.

1040
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,700
But I'm not there right now.

1041
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,750
(kissing)

1042
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,230
(waves crashing)

1043
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,580
- Morning.

1044
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,420
- Good morning.

1045
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,490
- Don't forget to roll over.

1046
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,570
- (giggles) I won't.

1047
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,410
(kissing)

1048
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,770
Wake me at noon, okay?

1049
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,430
- Okay.

1050
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,400
(shuffling)

1051
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,170
(kitchen appliance whirring)

1052
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,110
(paper crinkling)

1053
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,850
(ominous music)

1054
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,410
(shuffling)

1055
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,180
Hey.

1056
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,430
What are you doing?

1057
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,090
- Oh, making coffee.

1058
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,680
Tim was a drug dealer.

1059
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,720
Now he's a dead drug dealer.

1060
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,200
- Tim wasn't a drug dealer.

1061
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,400
- "Investment banker" you
call it what you want.

1062
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,260
He didn't push on street corners,

1063
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,840
but he was definitely involved.

1064
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,310
- You have no idea.

1065
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,020
- Yeah, I have an idea.

1066
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,820
See, Tim moved money, he brokered deals.

1067
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,730
My hunch is he did it all on the phone,

1068
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,690
this way there'd be no personal contact.

1069
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,530
- Go on.

1070
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,530
- Mr. A's got money to spend.

1071
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,380
Tim finds Mr. B who's got
drugs or whatever to sell.

1072
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,180
Money gets put into Tim's account,

1073
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,470
they transfer good, money passes, Tim gets

1074
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,700
a percentage, no fuss, no muss, he's out.

1075
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,080
- Wow, you're a lot
smarter than Tim thought.

1076
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,500
- Only thing is I don't know

1077
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,420
what the hell his latest deal is.

1078
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,590
- Something weird?

1079
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,320
- Yeah, somebody broke in here and

1080
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,070
trashed the place looking for something.

1081
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,940
Our boy was not on good
terms with these people.

1082
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,430
I don't know who he was involved with

1083
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,730
or what he was up to, but it doesn't

1084
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,960
take a lot to figure out that it had

1085
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,070
something to do with that boat blowing up.

1086
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,800
- So what are you gonna do?

1087
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,800
- They still think I'm Tim.

1088
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,200
- And they'll still think you're

1089
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,010
Tim when they blow your head off.

1090
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,480
Listen to me cowboy, get
out now while you can.

1091
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,540
That's the best advice
you'll ever get from me.

1092
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,760
- And what happens to you?

1093
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,490
- Forget about me, okay?

1094
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,770
Because if you go through with

1095
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,090
this deal they're going to kill you.

1096
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,250
You're a nice guy.

1097
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,970
Don't follow in Tim's footsteps.

1098
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,760
- So you think he's dead.

1099
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,210
- After what you told me at the

1100
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,210
club that was my first thought, yes.

1101
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,090
Then I realized that I had to
start thinking about myself.

1102
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,220
- So you're involved in this?

1103
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,010
- I was involved, but I'm not anymore.

1104
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,370
- If I were you, I'd go to the feds.

1105
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,800
I mean you have enough
information, they'll just

1106
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,070
let you, they'd let you
walk, they love you.

1107
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,760
- Wait a second, you are
suggesting that I become a snitch?

1108
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,320
I can't do that.

1109
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,160
I can't trust anybody.

1110
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,630
- Is that why you slept with me?

1111
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,470
- No.

1112
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,550
I slept with you because I wanted to.

1113
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,010
This is crazy, cowboy, don't do it.

1114
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,770
- You gonna help me or not?

1115
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,000
- All right, if you are determined

1116
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,160
to do this, this is my advice.

1117
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,610
I would lay low for a couple
of days, get the cash,

1118
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:46,390
dish it out, and then
get the hell out of town.

1119
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,510
You don't owe them anything,

1120
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,560
they're not gonna come after you.

1121
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,940
Maybe I can get out of here too.

1122
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,940
- Is that what you want?

1123
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,550
- I'll see you at the club.

1124
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,840
- Okay.

1125
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,370
(dramatic flute music)

1126
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,910
(hip hop music)
(crowd chatter)

1127
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,310
Hey, Vic!

1128
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,920
- Hey, Tim's friend, how's it going?

1129
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,640
- Well I'm not so sure.

1130
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,930
Things have been a little strange

1131
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,190
since Tim left on business.

1132
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,280
- Yeah?

1133
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,990
Well he told me to give
you whatever you needed.

1134
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,300
So what do you need?

1135
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,780
- You heard from him?

1136
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,160
- Not since he left.

1137
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,420
That's not unusual.

1138
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,640
Hey man, look, let me
talk to you in a minute.

1139
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
- All right.

1140
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,160
- Hey Tim.

1141
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,640
- Barry.

1142
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,150
Tim's friend, remember?

1143
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,590
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1144
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,930
So where is he anyway?

1145
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,590
I haven't got the chance to meet him.

1146
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,590
- He's away on business.

1147
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,020
How about a drink?

1148
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,300
- I'm sorry, I can't.

1149
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,300
I'm on duty.

1150
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,520
- For me.

1151
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,340
- I'm so dumb sometimes.

1152
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,100
- (laughs) Don't worry about it.

1153
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,930
Scotch, rocks...

1154
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,280
- With a splash, I remember now.

1155
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,690
- Very good.

1156
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,390
Hey, how's the acting?

1157
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,910
- I have an audition.

1158
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,720
- Good for you, for what?

1159
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,300
- Video I think.

1160
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,000
Anyway, there's not a lot of
words, so I should be okay.

1161
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,100
- (laughs) Well good luck.

1162
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,980
- You're not supposed to say good luck.

1163
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,210
You're supposed to say break a leg,

1164
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,930
I mean why anyone would wanna see

1165
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,810
someone break someone's leg is...

1166
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,640
- Brooke.

1167
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,610
- Thank you.

1168
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,780
(jazzy hip hop music)

1169
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,850
- Hey cowboy.

1170
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,590
- Hey.

1171
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,300
- You sure look at home.

1172
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,050
- How you doing since last night?

1173
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,010
- Oh I'm doing good.

1174
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:08,850
- Good.

1175
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,940
- I get off at 2.

1176
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,190
- I'll be here.

1177
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,150
(jazzy hip hop music)
(crowd chatter)

1178
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,600
Hey Vic, listen, I think that Tim, I think

1179
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,080
he was involved in a boating accident.

1180
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,830
- You wanna explain what the
hell you're talking about?

1181
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,110
- Did you see on the news where

1182
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,140
that boat blew up off Catalina?

1183
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,670
I think that's the boat
that Tim chartered.

1184
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,210
I think somebody killed him.

1185
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,210
You guys were partners right?

1186
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,320
- We're partners only in this club.

1187
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,200
I sold him a piece of the action.

1188
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,210
- But you knew what deals he was into.

1189
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,540
Drugs maybe?

1190
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,170
- Everybody's got their own opinions.

1191
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,640
I keep mine to myself.

1192
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,930
Maybe you oughta do the same.

1193
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,150
- Yeah, well somebody broke into

1194
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,630
his house while I was in it.

1195
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,990
- Maybe you oughta just pack
up and go back to St. Louis.

1196
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,830
- Maybe.

1197
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,280
- Well hey man, I don't know
anything, so I can't help you.

1198
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,890
- Look, Vic, if you hear anything, or if

1199
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,310
anything occurs to you, will you call me?

1200
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,130
Hey, Tim said if I needed anything right?

1201
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,310
- I'll think about it.

1202
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,310
- Thank you.

1203
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,290
(gentle synthesizer music)

1204
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,790
(Syd giggles)

1205
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,510
Does this seem a little strange to you?

1206
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,870
- What are you talking about?

1207
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,870
- You know, me and you in Tim's bed.

1208
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:51,230
- Oh you're more provincial
than I thought, cowboy.

1209
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,890
I told you Tim and I are no longer.

1210
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,190
Would it mean anything less if

1211
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,600
we did it on the kitchen floor?

1212
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,110
- It might be more fun, but...

1213
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:00,990
- Oh no.

1214
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,800
- Depending on what tools you got.

1215
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,630
(laughter)

1216
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,920
Why don't we go to your
house once in a while?

1217
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,760
- Sure, sure, whenever you'd like.

1218
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,570
- How was he?

1219
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,570
- You did not just ask me that question.

1220
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,650
- What's the big deal?

1221
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,720
- That is so stupid.

1222
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,560
- No it's not.

1223
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,600
- Why do men always have to...

1224
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,560
Who am I here with right now, huh?

1225
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,400
You.

1226
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,730
Isn't that enough?

1227
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,040
(increasingly tense flute music)

1228
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,110
(shuffling)

1229
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,100
(phone rings)

1230
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,300
- Who the hell's this at 4 o'clock?

1231
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,780
- You know what, this
might be the last time

1232
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,860
for you to make this
deal, do you wanna do it?

1233
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,520
- Yeah.

1234
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,900
(ominous music)

1235
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,230
- (Barry As Tim) Hola.

1236
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:33,030
- Where you been, you
didn't answer last night.

1237
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,080
- I'm sick, what's up?

1238
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
- You wanna do business?

1239
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,900
- What do you want?

1240
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,630
- You tell me, amigo.

1241
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,480
I got if you got.

1242
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,670
- I got.

1243
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,110
3.5

1244
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,160
- I can cover it.

1245
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,700
- How soon?

1246
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,240
- You in a hurry?

1247
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,880
- The opposite.

1248
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,980
I need time.

1249
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,350
- Time I don't got.

1250
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,180
- It came up unexpected.

1251
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,760
I wasn't sure I could do it.

1252
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,850
- Then why didn't you call?

1253
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,600
- Having a problem with my computer.

1254
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
How soon?

1255
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,040
- Two days.

1256
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,680
- Three.

1257
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,700
- You know, some days I
wish I was a lettuce picker.

1258
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,420
Okay, put it in the account.

1259
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,570
- I told you, I got a
problem with my computer.

1260
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,070
(Seller laughs)

1261
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,430
It's not that funny.

1262
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,100
- You live by the computer,
you die by the computer.

1263
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,840
Me, I'm a little old fashioned.

1264
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,110
I don't like to use anything I

1265
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,870
don't understand how it works.

1266
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,890
- Well I can't get the money

1267
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,020
until I get things working again.

1268
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,620
- Sometimes I worry about you, man.

1269
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,130
- I need more time.

1270
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,130
- You try anything funny,
you know what happens.

1271
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,390
(Barry hangs up)

1272
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,780
- Well that was very impressive.

1273
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,740
How'd you learn to do
that with your voice?

1274
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,930
- (Normal Voice) Well...

1275
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,440
Me and Tim used to mess
with girls' heads, we used

1276
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,320
to make believe we were each
other, drive them crazy.

1277
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,900
- Oh, how charming.

1278
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:01,010
Well congratulations, you're now a dealer.

1279
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,710
- Drugs?

1280
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,230
- Merchandise.

1281
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,320
That's the way Tim liked it.

1282
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,820
It didn't matter what got traded.

1283
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,480
I'd stick to that point of view.

1284
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,780
- The point of no return, huh?

1285
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,590
- Yeah, I'd say so, I mean if you

1286
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,030
backed out now you might make a

1287
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,610
whole lot of people really mad.

1288
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,540
- I need to get the money.

1289
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,900
I know that it's in Tim's computer,

1290
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,230
but I can't access without the password.

1291
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,840
When it's time to make this
deal, what the hell do I do?

1292
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,700
- Call Dean, he'll know what to do.

1293
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,780
- And what if he doesn't?

1294
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,130
- Then it was nice knowing you, cowboy.

1295
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,550
(dogs barking)

1296
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:58,300
- Dean?

1297
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,070
Hey.

1298
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,240
- Oh hey, man.

1299
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,210
- I got a question for you.

1300
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,040
- Shoot.

1301
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,390
- The other day you dropped off

1302
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,790
some software programs for Tim.

1303
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,680
- Yeah, I promised to
clean them up for him.

1304
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,160
- Do you know what was on them?

1305
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,130
- Spreadsheets.

1306
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,700
Online banking stuff.

1307
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,230
I set up his whole system.

1308
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,280
I set up his PC, he gives me stock tips.

1309
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,700
- You think you could
retrieve his password?

1310
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,940
- Highly illegal.

1311
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,880
- Listen, you gotta
trust me on this, okay?

1312
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,190
- Yeah, why's that?

1313
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,110
- Remember the other day
when that, on the news,

1314
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,950
that boat exploded off
Catalina, you remember that?

1315
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,160
- Yeah, what about it?

1316
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,070
- Tim was on that boat.

1317
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,600
I think Tim is dead and I
think somebody killed him.

1318
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,430
- Whoa.

1319
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,900
I don't want no part of this.

1320
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,270
- Look, I need to find out
who killed Tim and why,

1321
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,060
but I can't do that unless
I get into his files.

1322
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,020
- Go to the cops.

1323
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,660
- No, not yet.

1324
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,160
Look, you can stand by me, you can look

1325
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,460
over my shoulder and see that I won't

1326
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,240
take a friggin' dime, okay, but I have to

1327
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,840
know what he was up to so I can maybe

1328
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,060
help him, or at least
find out who killed him.

1329
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,910
- Maybe somebody did kill him.

1330
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,060
Maybe they'd be after us next.

1331
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,980
- All I'm asking is is it possible?

1332
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:12,100
- It's there, on the hard drive somewhere.

1333
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,730
The key is figuring out how to expose it.

1334
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,760
- Like a needle in a haystack.

1335
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,990
- Not that bad.

1336
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,400
We'll use the power of the processor

1337
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,780
to help us find the needle.

1338
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,450
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1339
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,240
Let me clean this stuff
up and I'll go with you.

1340
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,360
- All right, cool, thanks.

1341
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,360
(tense jazzy music)

1342
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:38,960
Anything?

1343
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,450
- Nothing yet, but not to worry.

1344
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,540
(typing)

1345
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,470
(phone rings)

1346
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:58,960
- (Barry As Tim) Hola

1347
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,130
- That you?

1348
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,480
I thought you were still away.

1349
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,740
- I'm back, what's up?

1350
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,530
- Your buddy was in here.

1351
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,600
Said he thought you were dead,

1352
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,680
something about a boat blowing up.

1353
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,320
What the hell's going on, Tim?

1354
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,720
- I don't know, he's a little wacky.

1355
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,590
Forget about him, why'd you call?

1356
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:17,190
- Told me you were stalling
on some payments, right?

1357
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,150
Guy was in here looking for you.

1358
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,120
- Really?

1359
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,370
- If I had to bet, I'd say this

1360
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:24,200
guys was used to collecting debts.

1361
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,380
- What did you tell him?

1362
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,680
- Nothing.

1363
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,310
But Timmy, if I was you
I'd stay on my toes.

1364
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,270
This guy looks like he may eat
small children for breakfast.

1365
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,540
- All right Vic, thanks.

1366
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,370
- Sure thing.

1367
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,250
- I'll get back to you later.

1368
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,080
Oh, Vic.

1369
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,760
My friend Barry Rengler.

1370
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,670
- You still want me to
give him an open tab?

1371
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,750
Think the guy's a little too
nosy if you want my opinion.

1372
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,830
- He's a good friend of mine,

1373
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,800
you give him whatever he needs.

1374
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,340
- Whatever you want.

1375
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,310
- Thanks, bye.

1376
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,680
(Barry hangs up)

1377
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,930
(dramatic jazzy music)

1378
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,070
- What do you want?

1379
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,480
Get the hell out.

1380
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:18,360
- Leon.

1381
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,630
- I'm not buying nothing.

1382
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,400
And I'm not signing nothing.

1383
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,240
- Come on, you don't remember me?

1384
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,710
- No.

1385
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,540
Should I?

1386
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,800
Who the hell are you?

1387
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,050
- Leon, it's Barry Rengler.

1388
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,510
- Jesus.

1389
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,560
It's been a long time.

1390
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,480
- I know, since you left St. Louis.

1391
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,780
You heard from Tim recently?

1392
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,690
- I told him I don't have room

1393
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,610
for all that stuff he's keeping here.

1394
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,110
Not a friggin' storage locker.

1395
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,280
You come all the way out to LA to

1396
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,830
have to come to me to find him?

1397
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,820
- Not exactly.

1398
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,090
I've been with him.

1399
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,690
Matter of fact, I'm staying at his place.

1400
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,120
Only thing is he had to go out of town

1401
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,590
on business and I was wondering if...

1402
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:13,720
- Hasn't he given you
enough trouble already?

1403
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,900
- Come on Leon, that was a long time ago.

1404
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,350
It wasn't his fault.

1405
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,520
The academy made scapegoats of all of us.

1406
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,020
- You were always a smart kid.

1407
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,340
Smarter than him.

1408
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,510
Well I thought.

1409
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,290
Maybe not.

1410
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,980
- Leon...

1411
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,690
There's a good possibility Tim is dead.

1412
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,260
He rented a boat and was going to

1413
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,260
Catalina and there was an explosion.

1414
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,170
- Accident?

1415
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,000
- Maybe.

1416
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,900
Maybe not.

1417
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,250
I'm not sure.

1418
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,030
- Figures.

1419
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,230
All the crap he was into.

1420
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:14,350
Wallow in the mud, you
make enemies with the pigs.

1421
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:18,510
- Just wondering if there
was anything you've heard.

1422
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,090
- No.

1423
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,030
- That's it?

1424
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:27,300
- What do you want?

1425
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,470
You want me to fall apart?

1426
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:38,050
- Is there anything you
need, anything I can get you?

1427
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,130
- Nothing you can get me.

1428
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,570
- Well if you do hear anything,
I'd appreciate a phone call.

1429
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,710
I'll be at his place.

1430
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:58,340
(dramatic flute music)

1431
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,110
- Excuse me.

1432
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,580
You live here?

1433
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,250
- What can I do for you?

1434
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,530
- You know someone by the
name of Barry Rengler?

1435
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:23,300
R-E-N-G-L-E-R, Rengler.

1436
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,210
- Barry Rengler?

1437
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,500
- Yeah, do you know him?

1438
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,780
- Yeah.

1439
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,170
- Well he was involved
in a boat explosion.

1440
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,700
- The one that I saw in the news?

1441
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,890
- Yeah, the charter operator said

1442
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,970
he was the one who took out the boat.

1443
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,160
- How'd you end up here?

1444
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,820
- Mr. Renger's from St. Louis, and the

1445
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,370
record shows that there was a phone call

1446
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,130
made from here last week to the

1447
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,130
Missouri DMV requesting a reissue of his

1448
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:52,560
driver's license, how well
did you know Mr. Rengler?

1449
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,630
- You ask me that like
you think he's dead.

1450
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,630
- Well I'm afraid that
he probably is, Mister...

1451
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,220
- Gates, Tim Gates.

1452
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,830
I knew him very well, he
was a good friend of mine.

1453
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,840
- Yeah, well Mr. Gates,
I'm afraid it's very

1454
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,680
likely that you friend
died in that explosion.

1455
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,840
Now anything you can do to help

1456
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,840
us out would be greatly appreciated.

1457
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,850
- Well he came here to visit.

1458
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,720
He's got some stuff in the
house if you wanna check it out.

1459
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,600
You know something, he told me that

1460
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,080
he lost his wallet, but I never

1461
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,010
really thought anything of it.

1462
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,760
- Well that's another
odd fact because we found

1463
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,840
a wallet in the debris
after the explosion.

1464
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,800
- You found his wallet?

1465
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,950
- Yeah, that's how we identified

1466
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,560
him as the person who paid for the boat.

1467
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,280
- He told me he lost it.

1468
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,580
- So then I assume you know
nothing about any of this.

1469
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,490
- No, nothing.

1470
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:53,160
- Well you call me at this
number if anything comes up.

1471
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,110
- Yeah, sure.

1472
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,160
- Thanks very much.

1473
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,030
- You're welcome.

1474
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:56,870
- Okay.

1475
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,630
(dramatic trumpet music)

1476
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,030
(toilet flushes)

1477
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,780
(dramatic sting)

1478
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,520
- Sense of tension in the air.

1479
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,340
Don't you think?

1480
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,230
All right, here's the thing.

1481
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,940
I know there's a young lady
asleep in the next room.

1482
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,800
I would hate to wake her.

1483
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,640
You agree?

1484
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,980
I think you do.

1485
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,760
Because if she wakes up,
I'll have to kill her.

1486
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,620
I know you don't want that, right?

1487
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,140
(muffled grunting)

1488
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,140
Do we have an agreement?

1489
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,860
(dramatic sting)

1490
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,610
(glass shatters)

1491
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,140
I think you know why I'm here.

1492
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,880
(mumbles).

1493
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,350
You've been holding onto cash that

1494
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,440
belongs to someone else, haven't you?

1495
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,950
Okay, I understand you're concerned

1496
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,850
about not making any noise.

1497
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:46,020
The least you could do is
nod, I mean just to be polite.

1498
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,820
Good.

1499
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,700
There's a growing concern gnawing at

1500
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,960
my clients, Mr. Gates, that's perhaps

1501
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,320
you do not intend on ever paying them.

1502
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,160
They're worried that because you normally

1503
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,960
deal with sedate
professionals, that you feel

1504
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,550
that you can do this
with a sense of impunity.

1505
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,560
He has asked me to impress upon you

1506
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,200
the extent to which that (mumbles) is

1507
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,710
an error and that he expects his

1508
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:15,380
money within a matters of hours.

1509
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,760
It's actually good that
you're so uncommunicative

1510
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,820
because I'm not here to discuss the

1511
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,060
relative points of the issue, I'm simply

1512
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,270
here to deliver a message through

1513
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,520
the impressive use of multimedia tools.

1514
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,850
Such as this one.

1515
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,440
(cranking)

1516
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:47,130
(Barry groaning)

1517
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,920
(coughing)

1518
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,840
That was your ear drum.

1519
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,560
A little bit further and you wouldn't

1520
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,270
be hearing at all on that side.

1521
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,720
Fortunately, God in His infinite

1522
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,560
redundancy has given
you another over here.

1523
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,730
So if I ever decide to come
back, you're not totally deaf.

1524
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,760
I'm glad we could have this talk.

1525
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,930
I've enjoyed it immensely.

1526
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,270
I look forward to our next visit.

1527
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,430
(dramatic sting)

1528
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,700
- God you're a mess.

1529
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,570
- What?

1530
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,110
- I said I think I'm
falling in love with you.

1531
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,030
Get out now cowboy, please.

1532
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,180
This isn't high school anymore.

1533
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,130
- What about me and you?

1534
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,080
- You're not much good to me dead.

1535
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,440
Go home, let the dust settle,

1536
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,770
you know how to get in touch with me.

1537
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,560
- Can't do that.

1538
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,710
- God you're as bad as he is, why not?

1539
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,870
- 'Cause a guy just tried
to shove a pencil in my ear!

1540
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,620
This is personal now.

1541
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,910
- It's stupid, why do I always have to get

1542
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:28,150
myself involved with
guys like you and Tim?

1543
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,500
- I've got to find out exactly what Tim

1544
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,180
was up to and how I fit into all this.

1545
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,350
I don't wanna spend the next

1546
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,950
five years of my life wondering.

1547
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,430
- That's what this is all about isn't it?

1548
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,670
- Partly.

1549
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,260
- That happened a long time ago Barry,

1550
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,010
it's not worth getting dead over.

1551
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,800
- He used my name to rent that boat.

1552
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,430
I didn't lose my wallet, he stole it.

1553
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:01,200
Then he switched the pictures
on the driver's license.

1554
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,540
He was skimming.

1555
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,590
God knows how much, but
he owed somebody big time.

1556
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:11,760
And he decided to let me
take the punishment for him.

1557
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:16,200
It's an old familiar trait of his.

1558
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,120
I forgot how much it pisses me off.

1559
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,980
- Okay, say that they killed
Tim on the boat right?

1560
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,100
Why would they be coming after you now?

1561
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,690
- I haven't figured that out yet.

1562
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,840
What were the return in his investments?

1563
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,930
- He'd give out 90, take 10 as a fee.

1564
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:39,900
- 10%?

1565
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,000
So three and a half million
dollars, he'd make 350,000.

1566
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,120
Wow.

1567
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,030
- That's the way Tim
liked it, work a couple of

1568
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,320
weekends, then take the
rest of the year off.

1569
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,060
He thought it was a nice lifestyle.

1570
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,310
- Who wouldn't?

1571
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:57,550
Unless you get blown
into a million pieces.

1572
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:00,450
- I'm gonna ask you one more time, okay?

1573
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,560
Let's start over again,
let's leave this place,

1574
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,200
let's go someplace together,
take me to St. Louis.

1575
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,610
- Syd, what you're
looking for doesn't exist.

1576
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:13,570
There's no house with a white picket fence

1577
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:16,970
and two and a half kids, golden retriever,

1578
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:20,170
I mean aren't you the one who told me

1579
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,930
don't take anything
out here at face value?

1580
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,750
- All I know is that Tim is dead

1581
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,410
and I don't wanna lose you too.

1582
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,240
- It's one final deal.

1583
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,210
- One final deal that's
gonna get you killed,

1584
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:37,450
why the hell would you wanna do that?

1585
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,740
- Because for the past five years

1586
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,410
I've watch my life go down the toilet.

1587
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,170
If I don't put the past behind

1588
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:44,670
me now, I'm never gonna do it.

1589
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,880
(dramatic trumpet music)

1590
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,220
- What can I do?

1591
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,230
(door opens)

1592
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,070
- Back again?

1593
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:02,240
- Yeah.

1594
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,820
- I told you I don't hear from him.

1595
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,380
- I talked to the authorities.

1596
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:10,120
As far as they're concerned
it wasn't Tim on the boat.

1597
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,290
Can I come in?

1598
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:18,420
(door closes)

1599
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,590
You said Tim wanted to move
some things out, what things?

1600
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,780
(Leon sighs)

1601
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,200
Hey come on, Leon, talk to me.

1602
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,240
Leon!

1603
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,270
- Come in about a week ago, put a

1604
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,250
bunch of stuff here in the extra bedroom.

1605
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,310
Clothes, supplies.

1606
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,040
Boxes full of stuff.

1607
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,440
- He told me that he
hadn't seen you in years.

1608
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,050
- Hadn't.

1609
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,120
'Till he come over to
store all that stuff here.

1610
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,580
I told him I didn't want it here, but he

1611
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,170
said it would only be
for a couple of days.

1612
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,650
Can I get you a beer?

1613
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,500
- No thank you, he stole my wallet

1614
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,500
and he used it to charter that boat.

1615
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,320
Then he switched the pictures and

1616
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,990
pretended to me and I'd
be mistaken for him.

1617
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:22,860
- What do you want from me?

1618
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,320
- He owed somebody a lot of money, Leon.

1619
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,390
He tried to get away, but he

1620
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,640
couldn't make it, they were onto him.

1621
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,740
- You still haven't answered my question.

1622
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,070
What is it you want from me?

1623
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:43,020
- I wanna know what
happened back in St. Louis.

1624
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,800
- His mother used to say you

1625
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,550
two boys were just like brothers.

1626
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,190
- No, we were never like brothers.

1627
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,230
Not Tim.

1628
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,010
He used me to cover his tracks because

1629
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:09,910
he knew that I would be
the last guy to tell.

1630
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,550
He used me, didn't he?

1631
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:14,970
- You were the top recruit in that class.

1632
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,800
He could never be what he knew you were.

1633
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,900
He figured if you were under suspicion

1634
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,080
he'd confuse their investigation.

1635
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,160
Throw them off the trail.

1636
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,560
And he was right.

1637
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:39,700
- And nobody said a word.

1638
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,450
Just left me hanging,
swinging in the breeze.

1639
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:45,850
- Oh I tried.

1640
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,930
But his mother, she was gonna
protect him no matter what.

1641
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:53,750
You didn't matter, I didn't matter.

1642
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,080
It was only Tim.

1643
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,940
Why now?

1644
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,270
After all these years, what difference

1645
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:06,060
could it make to you now?

1646
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,750
- Because history's
about to repeat itself.

1647
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,060
I'll tell you what Leon, I really don't

1648
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,710
feel like being dragged along this time.

1649
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:14,790
I'll see you.

1650
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,340
(door opens and closes)

1651
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:25,340
(janitor vacuuming)

1652
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,860
- What's the problem, Louis?

1653
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:37,380
Look like you're trying
to drown something.

1654
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,460
- Vacation's almost over.

1655
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,340
- That's too bad.

1656
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,510
I'm gonna miss you, Louis.

1657
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,800
Things have gotten a lot more

1658
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,500
interesting since you come to town.

1659
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,330
- Thanks.

1660
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,350
- Hey.

1661
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,100
- What are you doing?

1662
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,030
What's this?

1663
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,860
- That's your ticket to St. Louis.

1664
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,120
- What are you talking about?

1665
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,930
- I used Tim's credit card.

1666
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,200
For once in my life I'm gonna take

1667
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,720
advantage of the
opportunities presented to me.

1668
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,520
- I don't understand.

1669
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,230
- This is what you wanted, isn't it?

1670
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,480
The picket fence, the whole nine yards?

1671
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,180
Here's your chance.

1672
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,680
(phone rings)

1673
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,040
(Barry as Tim) Hola.

1674
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,020
- Who is this, Barry?

1675
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,720
- (Normal Voice) Yeah,
hey, did you get in?

1676
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,040
- Oh yeah, that part was easy, but you're

1677
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,360
not gonna believe what I
found once I logged on.

1678
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,770
- Don't tell me over the
phone, I'll be right there.

1679
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,440
- This stuff's gonna blow you away.

1680
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,270
- Okay.

1681
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:58,100
That was Dean, he's got Tim's password.

1682
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,650
This whole thing's gonna
be over by tomorrow, okay?

1683
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,450
I want you to go home, pack,
and I'll meet you there.

1684
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:06,980
- Barry, don't go to Tim's house, okay?

1685
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,040
Forget about me, forget about the deal,

1686
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,390
forget about everything and

1687
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:13,140
just get out while you can, okay?

1688
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,190
- It's gonna be okay.

1689
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,160
All right?

1690
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,590
Don't worry about it.

1691
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:23,840
(dramatic jazzy music)

1692
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,880
Hey, hey how's the...

1693
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,800
(computer beeping)

1694
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,000
Oh God.

1695
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,620
(doors slam open)

1696
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,570
What the hell?

1697
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:39,400
Hey.

1698
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,120
(groaning)
(scuffling)

1699
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,340
- I didn't think we'd see each other again

1700
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,340
so soon, but I guess
circumstances have changed.

1701
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,220
My orders have changed.

1702
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,770
I thought I'd let you know
that before I carry them out.

1703
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,100
(Barry grunts)

1704
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,440
I wouldn't do this unless it was

1705
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,760
necessary so you'll forgive me.

1706
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,840
(sounds of struggle)

1707
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:20,450
I can't believe you did that!

1708
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,420
Where do you think you're gonna go?

1709
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,840
(loud smack)

1710
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:33,470
I can keep doing this as long as you like.

1711
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,510
(Barry groans)

1712
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:41,740
I should thank you, I
was getting complacent.

1713
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,940
A little bored with the
job, you know what I mean?

1714
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,750
(strong punch)

1715
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,330
(Barry groans)

1716
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:56,410
Nothing like an asshole to get
the ol' juices flowing again.

1717
01:19:56,410 --> 01:20:00,360
I'd like to keep visiting like
this, but it's time to play.

1718
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,970
(handcuffs snapping)

1719
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:03,240
(mumbles).

1720
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,490
(gunshots)

1721
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:16,790
(loud thud)

1722
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:26,090
(Barry breathing)

1723
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:36,180
(dramatic flute music)

1724
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:59,020
(apartment intercom buzzes)

1725
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:01,670
- Who is it?

1726
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,500
- It's Barry, open up.

1727
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,970
(apartment door buzzes)

1728
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:16,140
Dean is dead.

1729
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:20,260
I was supposed to be next.

1730
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,190
What's going on?

1731
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,160
- Barry, please...

1732
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,490
- I just killed a man, goddammit,

1733
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,070
now what the hell is going on?

1734
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,220
- Barry, I told you to get out

1735
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,330
of this and you would not listen.

1736
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,740
- He cleaned out his entire account!

1737
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,830
- Barry, please...

1738
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:36,510
- You've been lying to me haven't you?

1739
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,760
From this beginning this has all been

1740
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,750
a lie, it's all been a setup, am I right?

1741
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,670
He's been using me to rip them off.

1742
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:47,980
Jesus Christ I don't get
this, I don't get it,

1743
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:50,780
they killed him once, they
blew him up in the boat.

1744
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,020
Why, why...

1745
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,630
- I'm impressed!

1746
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:55,870
(chuckles) You know?

1747
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,570
You figured it out.

1748
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:01,650
I really wasn't sure that
you would, but you did.

1749
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:05,790
I gotta say it's been
entertaining as hell.

1750
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,410
- You son of a bitch.

1751
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,350
- I know, I know, yeah, it's me.

1752
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,580
Hey listen, you called, you were the one

1753
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,500
that said you wanted to
come to sunny LA, okay?

1754
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,270
- Is that when all this started?

1755
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:20,100
- Sure.

1756
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,170
Look, I wanted to get out of the business.

1757
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,080
I couldn't figure out how.

1758
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,950
Then your call comes, and as

1759
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,780
they say, the penny began to drop.

1760
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:35,540
- So this has all been an act right?

1761
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,250
- Come on, I could always
count on you in a pinch!

1762
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,230
As a matter of fact, Bar, I always

1763
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:45,060
know exactly what you're gonna do.

1764
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:49,410
You know what, that's
your fatal flaw, Bar.

1765
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:52,410
You're just too goddamn predictable!

1766
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,940
- So all that crap about you and him

1767
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,460
being finished, that was just a lie right?

1768
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,290
- Oh, her?

1769
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:03,820
She's a hell of an actress.

1770
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,480
I'm telling you, huh?

1771
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,060
She missed her calling, right?

1772
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,660
(kisses Syd) Hollywood, babe.

1773
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:11,740
That's her ticket.

1774
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,980
You wanna know something?

1775
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,490
She made me nervous as
hell because I actually

1776
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:18,660
thought she was starting
to fall in love with you.

1777
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,720
- Just out of curiosity,
who hired the hitman?

1778
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,410
- Come on, that was them!

1779
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,130
I took the money, they got pissed!

1780
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:31,880
These guys play rough,
especially if you rip them off.

1781
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,700
But I knew that going in.

1782
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,640
See, this is the beauty of it, the guy

1783
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,060
who thought that you were me, he was just

1784
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,850
trying to scare you so
you'd give the money back.

1785
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,410
But I gave him a little more, so he

1786
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:49,370
did a little something extra for me.

1787
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:50,760
He didn't care!

1788
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,920
I mean they're all in it for the

1789
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,340
money, he was so easy to buy.

1790
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,400
- He's not doing anything now.

1791
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,930
I killed him with your gun.

1792
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,770
- You did?

1793
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,710
That's beautiful, that's beautiful!

1794
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:08,070
I mean what, the one under the table?

1795
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:10,920
(laughs)

1796
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,010
Oh man, I mean you could imagine how

1797
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,840
surprised I was to see
you show up here right?

1798
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,180
I mean because let's face
it, this was a great plan.

1799
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,960
It had everybody thinking that you're me.

1800
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,410
Then I got Barry out on the boat, in the

1801
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:31,340
explosion, chaos ensues,
everyone's running

1802
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,970
around like rats in a maze, gives me

1803
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,830
perfect time to do a nice clean

1804
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,390
little departure with Syd here.

1805
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,630
The only thing I didn't
figure on, the only

1806
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:45,810
thing, is I thought you'd be dead by now.

1807
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,480
I really thought that that guy

1808
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,250
would've done his job, but as they

1809
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,080
say, you just can't get good help.

1810
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,640
Anyway, listen, the time is ticking.

1811
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,080
I think it's time that we get moving.

1812
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,290
- Where are we going?

1813
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,210
- We?

1814
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:07,650
No no no no, there is no we.

1815
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:09,740
Syd and I are gonna take all that money,

1816
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,890
12 million in case you're interested,

1817
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:14,290
and we're gonna go down to South America.

1818
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:17,040
And just so you know, dear friend

1819
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:21,210
of my heart, you're staying right here.

1820
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:22,180
- Tim, no!

1821
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:25,140
(gunshot)

1822
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,560
(Syd groans)

1823
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,520
(strong punch)

1824
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,520
(suspenseful music)

1825
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,420
(gunshot)

1826
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,230
(gunshot)

1827
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,720
- Come on, Barry!

1828
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,850
Hey, come out come out wherever you are!

1829
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,420
She took a bullet for you,
you stupid son of a bitch!

1830
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,510
How do you think that
makes me feel, huh Barry?

1831
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:45,770
You think I'm gonna let you walk away now?

1832
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,320
Man, I had this all worked out to a T!

1833
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,820
You screwed it up!

1834
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:55,410
I mean my woman falls in
love with you, and then

1835
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,800
you kill my hitman, I mean
what the hell is that?

1836
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,970
Can't you get anything right?

1837
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:06,140
(sounds of struggle)
(suspense music)

1838
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,450
(gunshots)

1839
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:27,590
- That's enough, Barry!

1840
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,180
That's enough.

1841
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,260
You don't wanna kill him.

1842
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,480
- Good work, Agent Nelson.

1843
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:48,360
- Aren't you forgetting something?

1844
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,220
- Three people are dead, Catherine.

1845
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,240
All deals are off.

1846
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,210
- You can't do that.

1847
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,560
This wasn't his fault, he did

1848
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,550
everything we asked and then some.

1849
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:02,710
Sir, we went to him, we
enlisted his help, we owe him!

1850
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,500
We can't go back on that now.

1851
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,230
- Hey Cat, I didn't know you were back.

1852
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:10,960
I have the budget documents you requested.

1853
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,350
- Hey Paula, yeah, I
got back this morning.

1854
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,440
How have you been?

1855
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,700
- I'm fine, I'm just trying to put

1856
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,410
up with the ol' grizzly bear here.

1857
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,640
- You two mind?

1858
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,560
You can swap stories later.

1859
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,360
Right now, Paula, Agent Nelson's gonna

1860
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,940
dictate a letter to you that...

1861
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,380
I will then sign.

1862
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:33,520
You can word it anyway you
want, we'll make it official.

1863
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,520
- Thank you.

1864
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,960
- You're welcome.

1865
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,350
(cars honking)

1866
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,960
- There you go.

1867
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,500
Past is off the books.

1868
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,000
It never happened.

1869
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,840
(Barry sighs)

1870
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,980
- You know, when one of your friends

1871
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,480
at the agency came to see me in St. Louis,

1872
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,460
he told me what a big target Tim Gates was

1873
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,460
and how my past with him helped them

1874
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:36,940
get him and his whole operation.

1875
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,530
- You had given up on yourself.

1876
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,120
- I just didn't think it was possible

1877
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,890
to erase the past, I didn't believe it.

1878
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,610
- Well believe it.

1879
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:52,440
What happened at the
academy no longer exists.

1880
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:56,710
(dramatic trumpet music)

1881
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:02,060
- Five years, I dreamed about this.

1882
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:08,230
I thought this was what I wanted, but...

1883
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,900
Now I'm not so sure.

1884
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:16,630
- You know, what happened to
Syd wasn't your fault, Barry.

1885
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:18,080
If you still plan to be a cop, you have

1886
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,710
to know that it's never going to be easy.

1887
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,070
It's never going to be clean.

1888
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:24,570
People get killed.

1889
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,630
That's right, you know
that now you can apply

1890
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:33,080
to any law enforcement
agency in the country.

1891
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,120
They would be proud to have you.

1892
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,910
Of course you could do a lot
worse than join us with us.

1893
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,680
- Are you offering me a spot?

1894
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,950
- (laughs) I can't exactly
offer, but I'd back that idea.

1895
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:46,530
- You think we'd made a good team?

1896
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:50,120
- (laughs) Louis, I think could be

1897
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,450
the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

1898
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,350
- It's Barry.

1899
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,600
(laughter)

1900
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,050
(dramatic jazzy synthesizer music)

1901
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:03,340
(uplifting orchestral music)
