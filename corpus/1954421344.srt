1
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,998
Cut, great.

2
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,272
That's a wrap, everyone!

3
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,856
Great job, fantastic!

4
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,530
Fantastic!

5
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,148
That was amazing!

6
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:52,111
Nice. Beautiful job.

7
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:55,106
That was glorious. Thank you.

26
00:04:57,332 --> 00:05:00,498
From here you can see the
whole of Monaco, Mr Hitchcock.

27
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,023
Yes, I know.

28
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:11,956
You are to refer to
her as Your Highness.

29
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:15,572
Or if you speak French,
you can call her Votre Altesse.

30
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:23,365
Just Altesse is also acceptable,
but Highness is not. Nor is Princess.

31
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,815
Are you coming or not, Mr Hitchcock?

32
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,581
Remember to nod your head when you
first make her presence, but do not bow.

33
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,106
She's not the Queen of England.

34
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:52,915
Oh! You've grown so big!

35
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:57,027
This is for you. First prize of
the Monaco Young Poets' society.

36
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,248
Oh!

37
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,498
Ma'am, you can't bend down.

38
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:03,023
Oh... Pardon.

39
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:06,331
Hitch!

40
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,568
This is the part where I say, "Cut!"

41
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,155
Marnie.

42
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,317
Marnie?

43
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,915
So who's the leading man?

44
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:24,248
I don't know. Cubby Broccoli just made
a spy movie with some Scottish fellow

45
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,165
he's raving about.

46
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,234
We go into production in spring.

47
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:33,231
And Universal will
pay you $1 million.

48
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,528
Well, it's not about
the money, Hitch.

49
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:40,275
It's going to be the role
of a lifetime, Gracie.

50
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,981
Do I look that unhappy?

51
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,065
You look tired.

52
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,441
Where's Rainier?

53
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,998
We rarely see each other.

54
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,570
He er... He works a lot.

55
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,623
We've prepared a room at the
palace for you. You'll stay?

56
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,790
- I have to get back to LA.
- Oh, please!

57
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,915
I'm sorry, I left Evan
alone with Cary Grant.

58
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,123
And goodness knows what
they've done to my Birds script.

59
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:17,706
How is Cary?

60
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,540
Cary's great.

61
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,456
But his wife still sticks pins
in your effigy every night.

62
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:25,998
You're still an artist, Gracie.

63
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,748
Don't forget it.

64
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,941
Hitch!

65
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,649
I'm fine.

66
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,315
Doesn't get better than this.

67
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,822
Highness.

68
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,581
Hey, when I screw a woman,
I'm in it for the long haul, so to speak.

69
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:23,831
That's what I said to Maria.
Hey, be proud of your scandals.

70
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:26,556
What else are they gonna write
about when you're gone?

71
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:31,740
- That's not how it happened at all.
- No.

72
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,748
I was hoping we could talk privately.

73
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:37,540
President De Gaulle is
worried for French jobs.

74
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:41,206
We have to do something.
Our treasury is practically empty.

75
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,165
So you steal our taxes...

76
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,706
to pay for all of this?

77
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,790
This is all an image,
Monsieur Denard.

78
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,873
Your president knows that.
This is all we have left to sell.

79
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:55,373
Madam, did you know you are sitting
on the world's largest penis?

80
00:08:56,274 --> 00:09:00,206
- My bar stools, made from whale's scrotum.
- Ari! Please!

81
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,290
It's all right, Antoinette.
Mr Onassis was joking.

82
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,194
Ari, would you like me
to confiscate your boat?

83
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,706
I'd like to leave now.

84
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:11,231
You're his sister, you have to stay.

85
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:15,706
Are any of your
Hollywood friends here?

86
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:18,331
Uh... no. No. This is
Mr Onassis's party.

87
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:21,271
He likes to be the biggest
drunk on the boat.

88
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:25,290
Well, our point is, the British will
always side with the Americans.

89
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,608
Their Atlanticism will be
the end of our culture.

90
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:33,248
President de Gaulle believes we must pool
our wealth and finance a third pillar,

91
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,498
between the Soviets and
the United States.

92
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,774
That's what Europe must become.

93
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,706
- What should I do about my children?
- About what?

94
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,540
Well, they're Monegasque
and they're American.

95
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,072
Perhaps I should drop them
in the middle of the ocean?

96
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,415
France is stuck in a terrible
war in Algeria, Your Highness.

97
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,456
Many lives have been lost.

98
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:59,237
The very stability of our
country is under threat.

99
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,739
That means the stability
of Europe is under threat.

100
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:06,900
One would ask why you are
fighting a war in Africa.

101
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:10,873
Conflict is often a necessary evil.

102
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:13,232
Especially in the colonies.

103
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:16,776
Oh, but colonialism
is so last century.

104
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:24,315
I suspect one shouldn't occupy
a princess with such... matters.

105
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:28,331
I was brought up to participate.

106
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:31,956
My father would have been most upset
to see someone without enthusiasm.

107
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,831
Of course.

108
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,706
It is the American way.

109
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:39,831
Perhaps if it was the European way,
we wouldn't have had Fascism, Communism

110
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:43,364
or the need for your
president's third pillar.

111
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,898
This is not America, Grace!

112
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,998
- People don't just speak their minds.
- And why not?

113
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,790
Because that man is the
chief treasury agent...

114
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,623
That man is a bully!

115
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,248
He's the chief treasury
agent to Charles de Gaulle!

116
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,290
The most powerful voice in Europe.

117
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,790
And I need him on my side if I'm
ever to modernise this country.

118
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,248
- So what did you expect me to say?
- Say nothing! Say nothing!

119
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,873
Because everything you
say has consequences.

120
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:15,398
Not now, Madge. Not now.

121
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:21,646
Isn't this what you wanted me to
teach Caroline and Albert? Isn't it?

122
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,315
Never be afraid to speak your mind?

123
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:27,820
That's what you said
you loved about me.

124
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,025
Madge said...

125
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:47,106
Hitchcock came to see you.

126
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,697
Madge said that?

127
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,023
Yes, he came to see how I was.

128
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,440
He was passing through, and...

129
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,273
It was nice to see him.

130
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:05,106
I wish you told me.

131
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:08,606
I'd like to have seen him.

132
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:14,248
This hospital's been
abandoned for years.

133
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,081
We don't even know if
the floors are sound.

134
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:20,365
Ma'am, we simply cannot
justify these repairs.

135
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:24,731
The hospital already accounts
for most of our spending.

136
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,248
How about the palace
gives you an endowment,

137
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,331
and the Red Cross
Committee matches it?

138
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:31,165
If you pay to expand the orphanage,

139
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,331
the retirement homes will expect you
to do the same, and then the schools.

140
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,373
And you don't have the funds.

141
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:41,485
My dear Countess, it's really
very, very simple and necessary.

142
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:46,607
All we have to do is convert this
space into an open dormitory.

143
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:51,898
And then we put partitions and each child
will have their own separate living area.

144
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,819
Simple.

145
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,165
Maybe we can vote for it in
our plenary session tomorrow.

146
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,665
But now we must get back,

147
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,123
there's the small issue of the
Annual Red Cross Ball to organise.

148
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,956
But that's not due until October.

149
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:12,572
It's the most important event
in our social calendar.

150
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:18,110
Besides, you just don't have the
money for renovations right now.

151
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:22,748
I'm sorry, Countess, I mistakenly thought
we were here to repair a hospital.

152
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:07,956
103 new companies registered offices
in Monaco in the last two years.

153
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,956
90 per cent of them
relocated from France.

154
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,481
All of them came for your zero-tax.

155
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,540
And what do you want
us to do about it?

156
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,774
- Stop courting them.
- Oliver, come here! Come on!

157
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,081
- Casinos.
- Come here, now!

158
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,123
That's what I've inherited, Emile.

159
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:29,331
Good dog!

160
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:31,290
A playground for French aristocrats.

161
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,831
And that's a problem?

162
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,206
Oh, for the 10,000 people
who live here, yes.

163
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:38,146
Ordinary people need
schools, hospitals.

164
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,581
We make nothing, we export nothing.

165
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,706
If France is going to drain
Monaco of all she has,

166
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:47,415
it's not unreasonable to expect
French businesses to pay for it.

167
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,698
We find ourselves at an
impasse, Your Highness.

168
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:55,165
Because the President wants you to
not only impose income tax in Monaco,

169
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,331
but to pay the proceeds to France.

170
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,790
You want us to pay tax to France?

171
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,206
This is a French protectorate

172
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:08,940
which has only ever existed
because of French good will.

173
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:13,481
This is a sovereign nation.

174
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,790
Oliver, come on, boy.

175
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:26,948
My peers in Paris are not
as understanding as I am.

176
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,566
I'm to return tomorrow
with your full acceptance.

177
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,648
Please work with me, Your Highness.

178
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:40,123
Does de Gaulle really want
the children of Monaco

179
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,706
to grow up to be croupiers?

180
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:44,540
Some would say that
would be an improvement.

181
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,206
Some of Monaco's children are
running around like their mother,

182
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,071
the offspring of a
Philadelphia bricklayer.

183
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,646
Let me go.

184
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:01,738
- Let me go.
- Mr. Pelletier...

185
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:05,779
May I, Mr. Pelletier?

186
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,873
He slapped a French representative?

187
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:12,943
<i>Yes, he sent me away,
expelled me from Monaco.</i>

188
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:17,654
<i>Tell De Gaulle he's becoming
dangerously anti-French.</i>

189
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,498
<i>You've been the principality
priest for a long time.</i>

190
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,081
You must know how complicated
things are here, Tuck.

191
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,706
- Yes, I know, Gracie.
- I feel I made a mistake.

192
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,231
What kind of mistake?

193
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:03,398
Everything I do or say is wrong.

194
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,823
Everything.

195
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:10,230
Do you know how I spent my afternoon?

196
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:14,415
I was trying to persuade the
good ladies of the Red Cross

197
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,123
that repairing a hospital wing

198
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:21,484
might just be more important
than... planning a ball.

199
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:25,106
You're in Monaco, Grace.

200
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,523
I know I'm in Monaco.

201
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:39,439
What do you think would happen
if I went back to making movies?

202
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,775
What's it about?

203
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,565
A frigid, compulsive thief.

204
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:48,456
Really? Hm.

205
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,498
But it's a great role.

206
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,525
I'm sure it is.

207
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,481
Have you spoken to Ray about this?

208
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,790
What do you think?

209
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,831
Of course not, it's always...

210
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:02,570
I don't know, it's always
politics with him.

211
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,706
Ray is never gonna accept
the idea of his princess

212
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:09,108
going back into the movies,
you know that, Gracie.

213
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:19,373
<i>After 7 years of conflict in Algeria,
disorder reigns in France.</i>

214
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,498
<i>To consolidate power and
secure her borders,</i>

215
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>the government must
finance the war effort.</i>

216
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,706
<i>In its sights, Monaco.</i>

217
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:32,290
<i>Mr. Denard spoke to the French
this afternoon from the Elysée.</i>

218
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,998
<i>On the orders of the
French President,</i>

219
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:40,165
<i>Monaco has a 6-month ultimatum
to begin taxing her citizens</i>

220
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,230
<i>and cease her open courting
of French companies.</i>

221
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,654
<i>Unless they stop scheming
to steal French revenue,</i>

222
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:54,290
<i>and demand that Monaco
become part of France.</i>

223
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,998
Our food, our water, our power,
everything runs through France.

224
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,206
We'd be squashed in an instant.

225
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,731
Ray, you don't have an army.

226
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,565
You're in no position to
hardball the French President.

227
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,206
It's so nice to have a real
family meal for a change.

228
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:15,521
I only wish I could stay and enjoy it.
I have a meeting with Onassis.

229
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:18,823
What if de Gaulle doesn't
accept your apology?

230
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:22,248
Then we'll have the shortest
war in the history of mankind.

231
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,581
What happens in a war, Maman?

232
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:28,165
Oh... Big bad men decide
that they're tired of talking

233
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,456
and so they er...
pull each other's noses.

234
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,981
Someone once asked my father,

235
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:39,404
"If you could be any monarch,
which monarch would you be?"

236
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,358
He said...

237
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,123
"The Tsar of Russia,
or the Prince of Monaco.

238
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,415
The Tsar, because he knows the
name of none of his subjects,

239
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,456
- the Prince of Monaco...
- Thanks.

240
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,331
...because he knows all of them."

241
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:55,568
- Why don't you just pay him?
- How?

242
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,290
We could mortgage some of the estate.

243
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,815
It's already mortgaged.

244
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,206
How did it go with the Red Cross?
Will they pay for the orphanage?

245
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,831
The treasury'll put up a share, which
leaves Countess Baciochi no choice

246
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,456
but to match it with her funds.

247
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:18,623
You're forcing her to do something
other than for her own benefit?

248
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,665
You should see the conditions, Ray.

249
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,611
These children, they can't
live like this. It's appalling.

250
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,815
Well, don't upset her too much, OK?

251
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,081
I need her husband's
political support.

252
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:36,281
We're running out of money
and he has a lot of it.

253
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,898
Hitchcock offered me a role.

254
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,608
I think it might be
inappropriate to accept it now.

255
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:59,540
Were you considering accepting?

256
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,065
I wanted to ask you.

257
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:06,196
Well, if you really can't do without it,
I won't stand in your way.

258
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,498
But would it be appropriate?

259
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:11,956
I don't want people saying that I'm
running away or abandoning you.

260
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,481
Why would they say that?

261
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,280
The only thing I ask is,
you manage the publicity.

262
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,442
Really?

263
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,831
It's a risk. But take it if you must.

264
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:27,356
I miss it.

265
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:31,356
I can't stand it, I'll die!

266
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:33,665
I'll die!

267
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,190
If you touch me again, I'll die!

268
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,248
I can't stand it, I'll die!
If you touch me again...

269
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,773
If you touch me again, I'll die!

270
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,939
I can't stand it, I'll die.

271
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,938
If you touch me again, I'll die!

272
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,456
<i>Gentlemen, I have wonderful news.</i>

273
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,740
I am going to make a film
for Mr Alfred Hitchcock.

274
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,415
And I'd like to introduce
to you Rupert Allan,

275
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,235
my publicist from Hollywood.

276
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,356
Try not to look too astonished.

277
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:30,915
No Princess of Monaco has ever
taken to the stage before, Altesse.

278
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,290
It's not the stage, it's the screen.

279
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,915
There is a first time for
everything, Mr Delavenne.

280
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,873
Yes, what about your duties,
ma'am, and the crisis?

281
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:42,998
As your press officer, I don't know how
to present this without causing outrage.

282
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,581
Monsieur Cornet!
I can be a mother and a wife,

283
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:49,081
and hold down two jobs without the
people getting too upset, can't I?

284
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:52,456
- But what about the Prince?
- The Prince is very supportive.

285
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:56,522
As the Minister of the Interior,
it is my duty to protest.

286
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,706
What if the studio
wants to publicise it?

287
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,498
It'll cause unrest.

288
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,706
Mr Hitchcock has
agreed to be discreet.

289
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,873
Yes, they will not publish
until the palace publishes.

290
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,248
Which won't be until
this crisis is over.

291
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,540
<i>Making her return to Hollywood,</i>

292
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,956
<i>her Serene Highness
Princess Grace of Monaco</i>

293
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:18,331
<i>has accepted to appear
for Mr Alfred Hitchcock</i>

294
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,856
<i>in Universal Pictures' Marnie.</i>

295
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,395
Good.

296
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,040
And this is the only
copy of the release?

297
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,565
Yes.

298
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,831
And action!

299
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:45,331
I'm gonna be the queen
of the all Western...

300
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:49,415
Phyllis, the microphone's in film.

301
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,040
We're going to be famous!

302
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,415
- I'm John Wayne!
- No, I'm John Wayne!

303
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,123
- Ha ha!
- Action!

304
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,648
Yes, that's it.

305
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,831
Spare me the indignation, Madge.

306
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,623
- We're just playing.
- Maman is an actress!

307
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:06,610
One more time before bed. And action!

308
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,248
It's a good likeness, no?

309
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:11,706
Yeah.

310
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:16,566
Our readers want to know, how important
has the hospital project been to you?

311
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:18,790
I think that people have
to work hard enough

312
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:21,998
to make sure that the standards
for those who aren't as privileged

313
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:24,290
are no different than
from those who are.

314
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,815
Wherever in the world they may be.

315
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,123
Not everybody is lucky
enough to marry a prince.

316
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:33,498
Au revoir!

317
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,236
Move back, guys, move back.

318
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,290
Will you let President
de Gaulle's ultimatum

319
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,581
affect your philanthropic
work, ma'am?

320
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:45,081
Oh, I think we'll all find out it's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

321
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:47,855
When will you start on
Marnie, Your Highness?

322
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:49,998
I'm sorry?

323
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,623
Look magazine.

324
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:55,623
We received a copy of your press
release today from Universal Pictures.

325
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:57,831
"Princess Grace has
accepted to appear

326
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,623
during her summer vacation
in the motion picture Marnie,

327
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:04,735
to be made by Mr Alfred Hitchcock
and shot in the United States."

328
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,781
Are you going back to
Hollywood, Your Highness?

329
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,748
No, no.

330
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,623
<i>Hollywood rocked,
and the world as well,</i>

331
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,331
<i>as Academy Award-winning
actress Grace Kelly</i>

332
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:21,373
<i>has been announced to star in Alfred
Hitchcock's new picture, Marnie.</i>

333
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:24,415
<i>Fans of the silver screen
are sure to be delighted,</i>

334
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,081
<i>but what does this mean
for the State of Monaco?</i>

335
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:32,108
No, no, no. Focus on
the bloody birds.

336
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,693
Hello?

337
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:39,689
Yes, of course. Put her through.

338
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,498
Grace?

339
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,290
Hitch! The studio said
they would wait. That...

340
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,028
The press release
came from the palace.

341
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,706
The studio only published a response.

342
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,748
Are you sure?

343
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,123
Yes, I told Wasserman
I'd leave Universal

344
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:58,648
if there was any monkey business.

345
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,623
It's going to be tricky now.

346
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:04,665
I'll need some more time.

347
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,415
Can you wait?

348
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,456
Of course, darling.

349
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:13,565
The world needs Grace Kelly
back on the big screen now.

350
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:16,941
Hitch, thank you.

351
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,206
"The fact that wife Grace Kelly
is returning to her movie career,

352
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:27,831
no matter what the reason,

353
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:32,229
is indicative that in some ways, something
has gone wrong with her marriage."

354
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:34,540
Why do they write such lies?

355
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,998
Try to avoid what Hedda
Hopper's been writing.

356
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,831
I think she's been after your
obituary for a while, now.

357
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:43,873
The bigger question... is how did the
release get out from Mr Cornet's office?

358
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,206
Yes.

359
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,373
Well, I have the only
key to the bureau.

360
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,081
And only one other person
knew where I put the release.

361
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,748
- How dare you, Mr Cornet?
- A mistake may have happened.

362
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:55,748
There are certain things about
which I do not make mistakes.

363
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:57,623
Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

364
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,915
Don't play that game
with me, young lady.

365
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,440
OK, that is enough. Thank you.

366
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:08,030
I really don't think this was an
accident, Tuck. Somebody leaked it.

367
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,748
- Why would they do this to me?
- This isn't about you, Grace.

368
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:15,040
Somebody is using you to light
a fire under Ray's problem.

369
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,606
This is all about how
de Gaulle reacts.

370
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:20,373
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

371
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,447
Listen to me.

372
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:27,415
In 15 minutes, Ray is going to ask de
Gaulle to come to the negotiating table.

373
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:31,331
If he even suspects there's
a French spy in the palace,

374
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:36,357
he's going to reach into the phone and
punch de Gaulle right on the nose.

375
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:40,206
Is there anybody on your
staff you trust unequivocally?

376
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:43,311
Phyllis. I hand-picked her.

377
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:47,081
All right, get her and conduct
your own investigation.

378
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,248
At all costs,
Ray mustn't be troubled.

379
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,188
Ray mustn't be troubled by what?

380
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:56,206
Altesse was wondering whether
we should fire Mr Cornet.

381
00:28:56,207 --> 00:29:00,706
It seems the Press Department's rather
messed up the Hitchcock announcement.

382
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,748
Well, I did say it was a risk.

383
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:05,273
You did say you'd manage it.

384
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,731
You should see to the children.

385
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,581
- Hold on tight, Oliver!
- Giddy up!

386
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:14,831
Come on, push!

387
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,439
I got you!

388
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,790
Giddy up!

389
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,373
Hey, Mommy, look at me!

390
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:22,980
Everybody in!

391
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,415
...a ball in the middle of the pool.

392
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,915
You're gonna dive in and get it.

393
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,706
The first one to catch
it is the winner.

394
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:31,123
- Yes.
- Off you go.

395
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:32,498
Right.

396
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,040
Here we go.

397
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,748
Christian!

398
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:38,190
I told you to stop doing that.

399
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,498
You'll hurt yourself!

400
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:41,748
Come here.

401
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,206
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yes?

402
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:45,415
- There we go.
- Sure.

403
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,498
- Look happy now.
- Cheese!

404
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,748
Look at me! I'm swimming!

405
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,581
- Mommy!
- Over here!

406
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,165
Christian, get your cousins
and get ready for lunch.

407
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:57,331
<i>...in the next film by
director Alfred Hitchcock.</i>

408
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,456
<i>Here are a few reactions to
the American plans of former</i>

409
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:00,248
Phyllis!

410
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:01,706
Happy!

411
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:02,998
<i>Grace Kelly.</i>

412
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:05,915
<i>We're in a crisis and she's
leaving for Hollywood!</i>

413
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:09,956
<i>She'll never be one of us.
She's not from here.</i>

414
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:13,498
<i>What if the princess
must kiss another man?</i>

415
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,998
<i>They do that in films.</i>

416
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,605
Oh, just ignore them.

417
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,831
You're married to my brother.

418
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:22,439
Family is all that matters.

419
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:27,483
Your children...
you must protect them.

420
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,956
Nothing else.

421
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,540
It doesn't ever get easier, does it?

422
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:34,081
This is supposed to be
a summer break! Oh...

423
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,938
Politics is never on
vacation, Miss Callas.

424
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,748
Oh, please, it's been two hours.

425
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:42,190
And they are still holed up in there.

426
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,405
Oh...

427
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,165
I noticed you've got stables.

428
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,581
Why? Do you ride?

429
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,206
Do I ride?

430
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:22,483
- Grace!
- Grace!

431
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,290
- Grace!
- Grace!

432
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:30,415
Do you know Ari tried to get
me to quit singing, huh?

433
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,498
He did?

434
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,665
But I'm an artist.

435
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:38,695
Who can't expect to be
adored and left alone.

436
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,248
Who can't hide.

437
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,248
Who can't give up.

438
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:44,540
I haven't given up.

439
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,498
I know.

440
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:48,498
Grace Kelly can quit.

441
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:51,105
Princess Grace can quit.

442
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,022
But what's inside...

443
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,813
Mr President, I've already
given our allegiance.

444
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,415
We'll match your French rates.

445
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,915
What your companies want to
do after that is up to them.

446
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:08,123
<i>No! You will tax all of Monaco.</i>

447
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:10,165
<i>You will pay the proceeds to France.</i>

448
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,998
That's not negotiation,
that's... extortion.

449
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,081
<i>You've made a fool of me.</i>

450
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:18,498
<i>How will it look to
Kennedy and Khrushchev?</i>

451
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,998
<i>We noticed you gave
Rainier an ultimatum</i>

452
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:23,248
<i>and all I read in the newspapers</i>

453
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,581
<i>is that Grace Kelly is
going back to Hollywood!</i>

454
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:32,790
<i>You agree to my terms by tonight, or I'll
send Monaco back into the Dark Ages.</i>

455
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,581
What happens now?

456
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:45,581
He waits until tomorrow
and executes a blockade.

457
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:49,398
And we are not in the UN,
so we have nobody to turn to.

458
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:52,040
Why don't you call Kennedy?

459
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,331
The Americans are calling
it a French matter.

460
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:56,456
OK, so let's make it more than that.

461
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:59,915
You have European neighbours.
They can put pressure on de Gaulle.

462
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,373
Let's make Monaco's security
a threat to Europe.

463
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:04,331
Arrange a summit.

464
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,373
Make them choose sides.

465
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:10,190
Bring Rupert Allan to
work exclusively for you.

466
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:15,498
You seem very eager to send
Europe into war, Mr Onassis.

467
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:18,105
I have investments to protect.

468
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:23,026
And you, you have the
Princess by your side.

469
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:26,331
A damsel in distress, huh?

470
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:30,040
Some would say she's more
hindrance than benefit.

471
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,240
Then maybe it's time you
brought her into line.

472
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:38,067
Hey, come on, man, you're her
husband. Take a firmer hand.

473
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,581
It's all just so unfair.

474
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:47,040
Antoinette, we don't talk
state affairs over lunch.

475
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,647
My love, your stepmother's right.

476
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,040
Let's forget our troubles
for an hour or two.

477
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,540
Who put out white lilies?

478
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,373
I did.

479
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:01,355
Oh, white lilies are only supposed
to be for funerals, Grace.

480
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,790
Well, I asked Madge and she said
that it would be acceptable.

481
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,748
I only said white flowers, ma'am.

482
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,498
- I didn't say white lilies.
- Madge,

483
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,998
you knew they only had lilies
when I placed the order.

484
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,854
I suppose your hair
was Madge's fault too.

485
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:16,873
What time? 7.30?

486
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,290
My hair?

487
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,998
Who told you to cut it that short?

488
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,623
I'm not gonna hang
around much longer.

489
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:24,998
We are still in 1962, right?

490
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,665
The year has nothing to do with it.

491
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,998
What? I think Grace's
hair looks very elegant.

492
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,790
- It looks dreadful.
- It's the model look.

493
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,998
- She's a modern woman.
- She isn't. She's the Princess of Monaco.

494
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:38,373
Oh, come on, Ray! You can't be
the great moderniser one minute...

495
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:40,040
Call Hitchcock!

496
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,998
Turn him down publicly.

497
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,331
We'll make a show of how
happy you are here.

498
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,581
That you're permanently
retiring from acting.

499
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:49,248
- Why? Because de Gaulle says so?
- Because I say so.

500
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,873
- That's not your decision to make.
- I'm your husband.

501
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:54,480
I won't do it, Ray.

502
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:59,748
I didn't make you marry me.

503
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:02,248
- I didn't make you come here.
- Ray, this is absolutely...

504
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:05,165
What is it that Hollywood
can give you that I can't?

505
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,123
Ray, it's just a movie.

506
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:09,730
You were just an actress.

507
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:17,540
Have you thought that this
might not be about a movie?

508
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,581
Have you? Have you thought that de Gaulle
is looking for any excuse to take Monaco?

509
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:23,623
Even if it means turning
you against me?

510
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,123
Have you? No! Because you
don't listen and you don't think.

511
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,998
Everybody tip-toes around you while you
blow this way and that with indecision,

512
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,665
too afraid to say how you really feel

513
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:35,197
and too paralysed with the fear you
might just be in over your head.

514
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:38,737
- Oh!
- Oh!

515
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,831

- Do you believe in fairy tales, Tuck?

525
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,123
No.

526
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:48,276
I believe in "happily ever after".

527
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:55,821
When I won my Oscar, do you know
what my father told the press?

528
00:36:56,624 --> 00:37:00,290
"I always thought it would be her sister
Peggy because anything Grace could do,

529
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,897
Peggy could do better."

530
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,730
Deep down he was furious.

531
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:13,316
That I'd rather be an actress
than be his ticket in.

532
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:19,938
Every achievement...
was a disappointment.

533
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:26,023
So I never thought that living
with Rainier would be any easier.

534
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:29,361
Well, of course it isn't any easier.

535
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,123
- But he does love you.
- Oh...

536
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,730
He loves an image of me.

537
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,814
Do you love him?

538
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:44,730
Tuck...

539
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:50,151
What happens if I get a divorce?

540
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,165
Well, I...

541
00:37:56,166 --> 00:38:01,206
I think we both know that you'd never
be able to come back here and...

542
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:03,814
Your children would suffer the most.

543
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:08,440
They are heirs to a
European throne, Grace.

544
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:16,030
And add to that the fact that you would
have been a failure as a Princess.

545
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,522
I don't want to say no to the movie.

546
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:25,415
I don't.

547
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,331
Well, don't.

548
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:29,939
Let's see what happens...

549
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,480
There's consequence.

550
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,415
When people dream of
marrying royalty,

551
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:42,864
they very rarely comprehend
what it really means.

552
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,748
And you have to add to that

553
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:50,228
a culture that's one million miles
away from anything you know.

554
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:51,831
I know.

555
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,706
I know very well.

556
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,314
I've been here 15 years.

557
00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:59,480
And you're still here.

558
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,998
This is a heartless kingdom.

559
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,731
Ray needs me and he needs you.

560
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,814
It doesn't feel that way.

561
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,490
You scare him, don't you?

562
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:20,498
You give a damn, and you're forcing
him to step out of his uniform.

563
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:23,105
He's just not ready yet.

564
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:29,206
Tuck...

565
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:31,581
I don't know how I'm gonna
keep living with him.

566
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:33,915
I don't know how I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

567
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,819
in this place where I can't be me.

568
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,522
And who is that?

569
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:43,730
Grace Kelly, movie star?

570
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,665
You invented her.

571
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:52,331
You learned a certain kind of walk and
you perfected a certain kind of accent.

572
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:54,290
And you did it beautifully.

573
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,956
But now you're just a housewife
with two bratty kids

574
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:00,812
watching a rerun of your wedding day.

575
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:04,314
It's not why you came here, Grace.

576
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:14,025
You came here to play the
greatest role of your life:

577
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:19,858
Her Serene Highness
Princess Grace of Monaco,

578
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,040
Duchess of Valentinois,

579
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:27,331
and 137 more titles
that come with it.

580
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:29,939
God help you.

581
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,772
You make it sound so easy.

582
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,956
Look...

583
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:45,456
That's a fantasy.

584
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:49,356
That's a fairytale, Grace.
It's not real life.

585
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:52,165
And it's not real love.

586
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:56,775
Real love is... is obligation.

587
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,858
At some point every
fairy tale must end.

588
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:06,581
But you mustn't do this for
your father or for me,

589
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:11,061
you must do it for yourself,
Ray and the children.

590
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:22,331
<i>Kelly residence.</i>

591
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:24,165
Hello, Ma.

592
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,581
<i>Gracie?</i>

593
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,873
<i>My goodness.</i>

594
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:31,480
<i>I thought about you last week.</i>

595
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:36,072
Do you remember our Labor Day
weekends at the Jersey shore?

596
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,456
<i>Of course I do.</i>

597
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:42,064
The Ocean City barbecues.

598
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,939
Do you remember that?

599
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:51,498
Wh-When Daddy tried to teach Kell-Bel
and I to spit watermelon seeds, and...

600
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:54,438
And I managed to spit
farther than Kell-Bel did.

601
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,395
<i>Your father hated Ocean City, dear.</i>

602
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:03,040
<i>Are you all right?</i>

603
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,623
<i>I've been reading some worrying news.</i>

604
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,373
Did you get my letters?

605
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:10,989
<i>Of course. I've been telling
everybody your stories.</i>

606
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:15,189
<i>Did you really meet General Franco?</i>

607
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:18,623
Why didn't you write back?

608
00:42:18,624 --> 00:42:21,859
<i>What would I have to tell
the Princess of Monaco?</i>

609
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:28,404
<i>You're not seriously thinking
about coming back, are you?</i>

610
00:42:29,624 --> 00:42:31,873
<i>Gracie?</i>

611
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:35,405
<i>You know what your father
would have said about this.</i>

612
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:37,748
<i>Hollywood?</i>

613
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:40,486
<i>You're not an actress
any more, Gracie.</i>

614
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:43,605
<i>He'd be spinning in his grave.</i>

615
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:49,030
I was just hoping we could
have a normal conversation.

616
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,498
<i>Gracie, dear,
you're a Philadelphia girl</i>

617
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:57,165
<i>who did far better than any girl from
Philadelphia could ever dream of.</i>

618
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,139
<i>And I think...</i>

619
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,522
Mommy, why are you crying?

620
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,655
Cos speaking with my mother
makes me happy, silly.

621
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:26,790
See you next week.

622
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,361
- Thank you, Father Tucker.
- Thank you.

623
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,623
Oh, my goodness, Madame,
in my humble home.

624
00:43:55,624 --> 00:43:58,942
Count Fernando D'Aillieres,
at your service.

625
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:01,855
A marriage in crisis...

626
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:06,531
A princess far away from
home faces challenges

627
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:09,956
that are usually
impossible to overcome.

628
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:12,248
Well, that's very reassuring, Count.

629
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,609
I'm a protocol expert,
not a marriage counsellor.

630
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:22,271
But my duty is first and
foremost to Monaco.

631
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,290
Well, the um...

632
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:27,194
the customs, the history,
the protocol...

633
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,081
I want to know it all.

634
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:31,873
You mean you're not
familiar with them already?

635
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:35,322
Nobody gave me a handbook
when I got married, Count.

636
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,063
It's not just a question
of knowing it. I...

637
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,956
Well, really, I want to become it.

638
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:43,651
Ah...

639
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:47,415
Count, public opinion is
completely against me.

640
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,915
The people of Monaco don't
see me as their Princess.

641
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:53,456
I made a commitment with the whole world
watching, and for the sake of my children,

642
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,064
I will not be called a failure.

643
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,373
He's raised wire across
the entire border,

644
00:44:59,374 --> 00:45:01,831
his warships are stationed
on the edge of our waters

645
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,998
and we've been cut off
from Nice airport.

646
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:08,313
We have perhaps two months before
we run out of essential supplies.

647
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,397
De Gaulle's running down the clock.

648
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,123
Do you think he'll invade?

649
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:15,623
By October.

650
00:45:15,624 --> 00:45:17,623
Which means...

651
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:21,772
Whatever we have up our sleeve,
we'd better pull it out fast.

652
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:42,956
Where have you been?

653
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,915
The Vatican is hounding
me over this crisis.

654
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:49,897
I've had to reassure His Holiness
that you are still in control.

655
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,248
How's Grace?

656
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:56,623
Why don't you call on her, Ray?

657
00:45:56,624 --> 00:45:59,230
I wouldn't know what to say.

658
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:01,855
I feel awful, Francis.

659
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:07,331
Well, if it wasn't for this Hollywood
nonsense, we wouldn't be in this mess.

660
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,665
Ray, come along,
just talk to the woman.

661
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,040
You're nothing but silent and angry.

662
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:15,248
I don't know how... I don't
know how to speak to her!

663
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:17,665
You know I've never been
good at this sort of thing.

664
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,331
She's your wife.

665
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:21,939
Well, that was your idea.

666
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,248
You vetted her. I needed a Princess.

667
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,873
She gave up her way of life for you.

668
00:46:27,874 --> 00:46:31,654
- Whose side are you on, Francis?
- There are no sides, Ray.

669
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:42,498
Now, there's the protocol office,

670
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,748
the chamberlain,

671
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:45,581
the aide-de-camp

672
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:48,915
and of course your
lady-in-waiting, Madge,

673
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,706
the Prince's inner circle.

674
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:55,373
Now, you must know exactly where
to place each of these individuals

675
00:46:55,374 --> 00:46:57,790
in the pecking order

676
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:04,831
because almost every single one of them
makes a profession to flatter and deceive.

677
00:47:04,832 --> 00:47:06,456
So, how will I know who to trust?

678
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,665
You won't.

679
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:11,040
You're the Princess in
Europe's oldest court,

680
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:16,990
the target of all those hidden agendas
that come with such a privilege.

681
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:20,694
It's another role for you to play.

682
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:32,081
Thank you.

683
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,915
<i>For almost a thousand years,</i>

684
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:37,415
<i>Monaco has stood as a
symbol of personal liberty.</i>

685
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:41,748
<i>The House of Grimaldi has been
responsible for protecting that ideal.</i>

686
00:47:41,749 --> 00:47:44,081
<i>Since 1297.</i>

687
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:45,956
<i>Francesco Grimaldi...</i>

688
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:48,873
<i>Known as "Il Malizia",
"The Cunning One".</i>

689
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,956
<i>Very good.</i>

690
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:54,665
<i>...and his men captured the fortress
protecting the Rock of Monaco</i>

691
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,652
<i>while disguised as Franciscan monks.</i>

692
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:02,896
<i>Louis XIV tried to take
Monaco, but failed.</i>

693
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,145
<i>French Revolutionary
forces actually succeeded,</i>

694
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:11,853
but only until 1814,
when Napoleon was driven out.

695
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:20,320
Monaco, protected by the oldest of
weapons, guile and determination.

696
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,540
- Good boy.
- Now, you.

697
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,567
Me?

698
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:34,155
Mademoiselle Paget, French professor,

699
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:38,605
et Madame Leclerk,
your movement teacher.

700
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:43,939
Bonjour.

701
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:46,290
The red dress...

702
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,748
Rosalie's red dress is ravishing.

703
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:51,290
Your Highness, you have
to be careful with your "R".

704
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,415
It's at the back of the tongue.

705
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:54,831
Rrr... Rrrrah!

706
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,563
- Rrrah!
- Go.

707
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:03,081
- ...Est ravissante!
- Ravissante!

708
00:49:03,082 --> 00:49:04,790
Ravissante!

709
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,373
Pompeux. Be careful: pompeux.

710
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:08,456
Pompeux.

711
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:12,123
- Le pas Pompeux.
- Le pas Pompeux.

712
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:16,206
<i>The thrill of this moment keeps me
from saying what I really feel.</i>

713
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:18,790
You see, you look like
a nervous schoolgirl.

714
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,415
When you move, you expend
energy, you lose control.

715
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,706
You must centre.

716
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,415
Let me show you.

717
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,373
You centre, here.

718
00:49:27,374 --> 00:49:30,857
Economy of breath. Serenity.

719
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:41,110
The Germans say they'll only attend
the dinner if the Italians do.

720
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,123
Get Fanfani on the line.

721
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:45,612
What? Now? I've got London.

722
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,355
- OK.
- Pad re, from America.

723
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:51,956
Mr Allan, can we invite
people during the blockade?

724
00:49:51,957 --> 00:49:56,650
Sure. Hey, de Gaulle can't stop foreign
envoys from entering the country.

725
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,165
<i>You've been a father
figure to both of them.</i>

726
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,081
<i>Which is why they must
not find out I have to leave,</i>

727
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:07,081
<i>especially at such a time.</i>

728
00:50:07,082 --> 00:50:08,956
Onassis has persuaded the Prince

729
00:50:08,957 --> 00:50:12,706
to host a state reception for our
European neighbours next month.

730
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:17,815
He plans to make a case for
military support against de Gaulle.

731
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:19,873
And she needs to be ready by then.

732
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:23,290
This isn't just about a
marriage, is it, Father?

733
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,165
Well, I'm afraid it is.

734
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:28,946
Without their union,
Monaco is finished.

735
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:32,498
How is she doing, Fernando?

736
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,290
She lacks confidence.

737
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,873
She sells seashells
by the sea shore...

738
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:39,956
Again!

739
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:45,040
So difficult!

740
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,665
- Oh!
- Please...

741
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,290
Try again, Madame.

742
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,040
Courage.

743
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:56,611
Anger.

744
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,566
Good.

745
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:29,688
- May I help you, Madam?
- Your Highness!

746
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:54,148
<i>I need to see you right away.</i>

747
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:56,731
<i>I think she's onto me.</i>

748
00:52:56,749 --> 00:52:58,831
<i>Yes, but I can't come to you.</i>

749
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:02,897
<i>I can't leave here,
they'll know something's going on.</i>

750
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,481
Phyllis, how do I look?

751
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:10,065
Great. You look great.

752
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:42,815
What does she want?

753
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:46,526
Hello.

754
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,734
- Your Highness.
- Princess.

755
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:53,873
Would you like a little
something to eat?

756
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:57,915
<i>Never before have
journalists seen a princess</i>

757
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:01,415
<i>breach the protocol imposed
on persons of her station.</i>

758
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:04,956
<i>Unless it's a new
American-style publicity stunt.</i>

759
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,290
<i>Is it a dress rehearsal
for Hollywood?</i>

760
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,540
<i>Is she practicing a
scene for Hitchcock?</i>

761
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,531
<i>So many questions...</i>

762
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,706
What does she think she's doing?

763
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:16,790
If we can get the media on our side,

764
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,123
we can turn public opinion
against the French.

765
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:21,915
De Gaulle doesn't give a
shit about public opinion.

766
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,151
But he does care about
what the Americans think.

767
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,831
Hello, sir. Your papers.

768
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:40,581
<i>I'll arrange for you to
cross the western border.</i>

769
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:42,331
Go ahead, sir.

770
00:54:42,332 --> 00:54:45,706
<i>The road passes through a pine-forest.
I'll meet you by the small cross.</i>

771
00:54:45,707 --> 00:54:47,415
<i>You'll have to pay more.</i>

772
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,706
<i>Any idea who you're speaking to?</i>

773
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:52,112
<i>Money is not a problem.</i>

774
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:55,415
She's meeting with a
French private detective.

775
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,940
She's working for someone.

776
00:55:00,457 --> 00:55:02,981
Do what you need to do.

777
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:19,150
I think we have some talking to do.

778
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,614
Tuck?

779
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,900
Tuck?

780
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:38,275
Tuck?

781
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,987
You really shouldn't be reading
my private mail, Gracie.

782
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:10,023
Who is that from?

783
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:14,581
Who is it from?

784
00:57:14,582 --> 00:57:18,197
Six years ago,
I promised you a new home.

785
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,315
And I've done what I set out to do.

786
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:26,150
I've asked the Vatican for
a new post in the States.

787
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:29,524
I'm going home.

788
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:37,956
And you're just...

789
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:41,903
You were just going to leave?
You weren't gonna tell me?

790
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:45,040
Ray doesn't need me any more.
Neither do you.

791
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,983
I do need you.

792
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:50,940
I'll always need you.

793
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:55,692
Madge is betraying us.
She's working for someone.

794
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:58,898
I don't know who else is involved.

795
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:01,290
You can't leave me.

796
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,373
I'm a bad priest here, Gracie.

797
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:10,165
Maybe I can be a good priest now but
at least I'll be home where I belong.

798
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:13,873
- And you belong here.
- I can't do this without you.

799
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:17,790
If your family is to survive, you need
to give them an ideal they can protect.

800
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:20,231
And you need to do it alone.

801
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:43,816
Dear God, we thank you
for the food before us.

802
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:49,206
We thank you for the family beside us,
we thank you for the love among us.

803
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:51,447
<i>Amen.</i>

804
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:57,523
How have you been?

805
00:59:58,499 --> 01:00:00,490
Busy.

806
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,233
You?

807
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:05,358
Busy.

808
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:10,581
I suppose that's what happens
when you live in a big palace.

809
01:00:10,582 --> 01:00:13,106
Yes, one can get lost for days.

810
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:34,149
Well...

811
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,862
Shall we?

812
01:00:48,374 --> 01:00:50,498
<i>At the state dinner,</i>

813
01:00:50,499 --> 01:00:53,023
<i>Ray will need you by his side.</i>

814
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:57,771
<i>If Madge is betraying us,
she will not be acting alone.</i>

815
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,068
My family...

816
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:39,498
my country, has known conflict.

817
01:01:39,499 --> 01:01:41,373
And we've chosen to reject it

818
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:44,905
because that is not the
future of Europe, gentlemen.

819
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:50,529
The future is... business,
for the sake of business.

820
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,581
Not for the sake of government

821
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:56,983
and certainly not for the
sake of de Gaulle's empire.

822
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:02,148
If you value your liberty,

823
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:04,980
then you too should understand that.

824
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:13,485
All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is
for men of conscience to remain silent.

825
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,165
If de Gaulle is giving
me the choice...

826
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,998
What she wants is impossible!
And what's more it's dangerous for Italy!

827
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,873
Please wait, please...

828
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:27,456
Defending Monaco means
declaring war on France.

829
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,981
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

830
01:02:36,874 --> 01:02:39,665
Bad news. Somebody just
tried to kill De Gaulle.

831
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,706
Oh, my goodness! What happened?

832
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:44,915
French right wing is claiming
responsibility over Algeria.

833
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:47,456
It's going to be impossible
for Ray to get any support.

834
01:02:47,457 --> 01:02:50,444
Now, nobody in Europe
will cross de Gaulle.

835
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,521
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
please calm down.

836
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,248
- Ari?
- What?

837
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,873
- We're done for.
- What are you talking about?

838
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:21,196
What happened?

839
01:03:28,874 --> 01:03:30,498
It's over, Grace.

840
01:03:30,499 --> 01:03:33,023
Louis XIV failed to take Monaco,

841
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:37,165
Napoleon failed to take Monaco,
de Gaulle will fail to take Monaco,

842
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,290
no matter what happens here tonight.

843
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:42,739
Stop drinking, you need to
keep your wits about you.

844
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:48,331
- So you're going to support us?
- That's not quite clear yet.

845
01:03:48,332 --> 01:03:51,947
You have to make it clearer.
We have to decide tonight.

846
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,190
No one will help us.

847
01:03:58,332 --> 01:04:00,498
If only Rainier wasn't so pig-headed.

848
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:02,540
What choice does he have?

849
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,581
Give de Gaulle what he wants.

850
01:04:04,582 --> 01:04:08,665
I can bring de Gaulle to the negotiating
table. He's not that unreasonable.

851
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,498
But Rainier won't listen to me.

852
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:12,040
Maybe...

853
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,290
Maybe you can talk
some sense into him?

854
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,815
Before we lose everything!

855
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:26,165
You've done very well tonight, dear.

856
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,581
Now Robert wants you
to meet a few people.

857
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:31,106
Everyone is anxious to meet you.

858
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,652
What?

859
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,481
What is that?

860
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,948
Madge?

861
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:23,275
Grace?

862
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,239
Grace?

863
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,274
What is this?

864
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:48,981
Did you tell Antoinette to
meet with de Gaulle's people?

865
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,415
Where did you get these?

866
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,904
Madge hired a detective.

867
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:22,530
Your sister made a deal with
France to deliver Monaco.

868
01:06:22,832 --> 01:06:25,356
In return for taking the throne.

869
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:32,233
Leave us, please.

870
01:06:45,582 --> 01:06:48,106
You want me to accuse my sister?

871
01:06:49,332 --> 01:06:51,856
They're trying to topple you, Ray.

872
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,145
Her son is next in line.
That makes her regent.

873
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:11,440
My own sister.

874
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:20,523
Why are you still here, Grace?

875
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:25,565
Because we have children together.

876
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,690
Because I still love you.

877
01:07:32,624 --> 01:07:36,025
And I refuse to let somebody
take my family from me.

878
01:07:47,499 --> 01:07:50,023
So what happened tonight?

879
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:54,290
They all walked out.

880
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:58,154
The assassination attempt has
stopped the whole process.

881
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:01,790
And when de Gaulle rolls his
tanks through Monte Carlo,

882
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,445
we'll have lost everything to France.

883
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,608
Oh, Ray.

884
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:14,565
I don't know what to do, Grace.

885
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,873
I'm your wife...

886
01:08:25,874 --> 01:08:28,398
for richer or poorer.

887
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,123
So...

888
01:08:30,124 --> 01:08:33,623
what's the worst that can happen...
we lose a stupid old throne?

889
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:35,864
Who cares?

890
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:39,564
We buy a nice farmhouse
in Montpellier.

891
01:08:40,874 --> 01:08:43,196
We watch each other grow old.

892
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,315
Hand in hand.

893
01:08:56,791 --> 01:09:00,820
This... This wasn't
what I wanted for you.

894
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,123
Grace, I...

895
01:09:03,124 --> 01:09:06,359
- I know.
- I never meant for you to be unhappy.

896
01:09:07,374 --> 01:09:09,317
I know.

897
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:04,373
Hello?

898
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,898
<i>Hitch? It's me.</i>

899
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:10,123
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

900
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:11,456
No.

901
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,318
Oh.

902
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:16,773
I've reached my decision. I've...

903
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,565
I've thought about it and...

904
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:25,733
you'll have to find somebody
else to do the role.

905
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,581
Is everything all right, Gracie?

906
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:30,573
<i>Yes.</i>

907
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:32,982
<i>Yes, everything's fine.</i>

908
01:10:35,249 --> 01:10:37,489
I'm sorry.

909
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,123
And...

910
01:10:40,124 --> 01:10:42,165
good luck.

911
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,690
<i>Just remember, darling...</i>

912
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:49,730
don't stand too close
to the edge of frame.

913
01:10:50,374 --> 01:10:52,649
Thank you, Hitch.

914
01:11:25,624 --> 01:11:28,148
Tuck's gone.

915
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:32,108
I know.

916
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:35,898
If I had a solution to our problem...

917
01:11:37,374 --> 01:11:39,415
Would you let me try something?

918
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,525
Like what?

919
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,690
Will you let me try something?

920
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:56,359
We can't let her think
we're at her beck and call.

921
01:11:58,999 --> 01:12:01,248
Hello, ladies!

922
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:04,665
Thanks for coming on short notice.

923
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:07,439
So sorry to trouble you.

924
01:12:08,249 --> 01:12:11,790
Our country needs you,
and there's no time to waste.

925
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,206
Yes, but why?

926
01:12:13,207 --> 01:12:16,456
We need to get the ball
back on track for October.

927
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,206
Oh, le bal!

928
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:20,945
I am a princess after all,
n'est-ce pas?

929
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:24,748
You think we can throw a party
a few days from an invasion?

930
01:12:24,749 --> 01:12:26,123
Come on!

931
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:27,936
Start shooting!

932
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:34,231
Where are you going?

933
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:39,857
To Paris.

934
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,998
Londres...

935
01:12:42,999 --> 01:12:45,040
Lisbonne... Madrid...

936
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,081
Vienne... Copenhague...

937
01:12:47,082 --> 01:12:48,873
Amsterdam...

938
01:12:48,874 --> 01:12:50,915
Oslo... Washington...

939
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,956
La Valette... Saint-Marin...

940
01:12:52,957 --> 01:12:55,197
Paris...

941
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:05,831
Please, stand aside.

942
01:13:05,832 --> 01:13:07,873
- Stand aside.
- Everybody, leave room.

943
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:10,232
Grace Kelly!

944
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:13,653
Photo, please, Miss Kelly, over here!

945
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:17,248
There's Grace Kelly!

946
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:18,831
What about Marnie?

947
01:13:18,832 --> 01:13:20,373
When does the shoot begin?

948
01:13:20,374 --> 01:13:25,232
I spoke to Mr Alfred Hitchcock a few days
ago and I informed him of my decision.

949
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,915
I will not be returning to Hollywood.

950
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,123
Why?

951
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:33,290
I left Grace Kelly behind
when I married Prince Rainier

952
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:35,649
and that has not changed.

953
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:40,946
Now, I will hopefully be
focusing on my family

954
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,331
and my humanitarian work.

955
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:45,248
This is Countess Baciochi.

956
01:13:45,249 --> 01:13:49,906
She has an announcement that she
would like you to listen to very closely.

957
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,748
I'm pleased to announce
that on 9th October,

958
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:54,665
the Prince's Palace of Monaco

959
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:57,915
will host the Annual Ball for
the International Red Cross.

960
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:01,290
- Who's going to attend?
- Everybody, I hope.

961
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,447
Has President de Gaulle been invited?

962
01:14:14,124 --> 01:14:16,115
What is this invitation?

963
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,831
All of Europe has turned
their back on him.

964
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:22,831
- Thank you so much.
- Your Highness...

965
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:23,956
Au revoir.

966
01:14:23,957 --> 01:14:26,149
Turned their back on Rainier...

967
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:30,279
Not Grace.

968
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:37,231
The Princess needs to see you.

969
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:48,774
Grace?

970
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:51,441
Family is all that matters?

971
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:57,939
So what did de Gaulle promise you
to sell out yours, Jean-Charles?

972
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:01,733
Was it money?

973
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,400
The throne?

974
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:07,581
That's preposterous, Grace.

975
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:10,106
"Altesse" when you address me.

976
01:15:10,999 --> 01:15:13,523
Where's my brother?

977
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:19,498
Ray, this is a terrible
misunderstanding.

978
01:15:19,499 --> 01:15:21,655
Then tell me it isn't true.

979
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:27,983
Ray...

980
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:31,690
This is not what it seems.

981
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:35,322
- I just...
- You just what? Hm?

982
01:15:39,207 --> 01:15:42,608
You are to leave Monaco
and you are never to return.

983
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,856
You can't banish me.

984
01:15:50,249 --> 01:15:51,831
Rainier?

985
01:15:51,832 --> 01:15:54,206
- It was decided...
- I will not!

986
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:57,904
She will not tell me what to do!

987
01:15:58,124 --> 01:16:00,695
It was decided by
council this morning.

988
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:16,235
And how long do you think
that you're going to last here?

989
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:20,440
Long enough to see the back of you.

990
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:26,873
But before you go, you will
perform one final act of state.

991
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,915
And why would I do that?

992
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,790
Because if you do,

993
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:34,405
I will make sure that your
son is taken care of.

994
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,915
<i>Are you absolutely sure?</i>

995
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:48,115
The Red Cross means a
lot to her, Mr President.

996
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,064
She's keeping herself
busy, that's all.

997
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,814
<i>Do we have Rainier
where we want him?</i>

998
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:57,948
Oh, he's just about ready
to agree to anything...

999
01:16:58,124 --> 01:17:00,956
including handing over
Monaco's sovereignty.

1000
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:05,498
<i>Good. Your loyalty to France won't
go without reward, Jean-Charles.</i>

1001
01:17:05,499 --> 01:17:08,402
Thank you, Mr President.

1002
01:17:15,082 --> 01:17:18,040
Shouldn't we shun this ball?

1003
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:22,081
If America supports Monaco,
things will get complicated.

1004
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:26,331
I've survived an assassination attack.
I'm not afraid of an actress.

1005
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:28,081
Pelletier,

1006
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,831
call Rainier and tell him that...

1007
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:33,652
I accept his invitation.

1008
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:20,540
Kennedy has sent his
defense minister, General.

1009
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,271
McNamara's here!

1010
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:25,081
Mr McNamara! This way,
sir, for the Chronicle!

1011
01:18:28,624 --> 01:18:30,456
Mr McNamara?

1012
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:32,946
Sir, one for the camera?

1013
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:42,396
- I wanna take a picture too.
- Now, hold on.

1014
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,206
Let me through, here, let me through.

1015
01:18:47,207 --> 01:18:49,861
Highness, picture over here, please.

1016
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:12,485
Grace, Grace?

1017
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:25,155
Your Highness. Thank you, thank you!

1018
01:19:25,332 --> 01:19:27,607
- Princess.
- Princess.

1019
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:45,523
We love you, Princess!

1020
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,190
Stand round here, please, Grace.

01:23:26,249 --> 01:23:30,148
the President of the
Monegasque Red Cross,

1036
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:34,230
Her Serene Highness,
Princess Grace of Monaco.

1037
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:17,665
We are truly touched that
you would all honour

1038
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:20,948
our tiny corner of the
world with your presence.

1039
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:25,998
Goodness, we've, well...

1040
01:24:25,999 --> 01:24:27,915
We've had a spot of trouble lately.

1041
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:38,105
When I was acting in New York,

1042
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:44,489
my uncle, a wonderful playwright,
told me that I should pray.

1043
01:24:45,082 --> 01:24:47,040
The same prayer, every night.

1044
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:51,733
That should I ever... should I ever
make it, I would never be ungrateful.

1045
01:24:52,374 --> 01:24:55,165
That should I ever be in
a position of influence,

1046
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:57,772
I would have it in me
to use it for good.

1047
01:24:58,874 --> 01:25:01,647
Now, some of you ask,
why did I leave Hollywood?

1048
01:25:02,332 --> 01:25:04,939
Well... I left because...

1049
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,645
because I fell in love
with a charming prince.

1050
01:25:09,374 --> 01:25:16,040
A man who has inspired me to see
the world with enough compassion

1051
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:20,568
that I may want to do something about
all of the unfair things that I see in it.

1052
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:24,363
And that is why we are
honouring the Red Cross.

1053
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:29,650
A force for good that is...
that is very close to my heart.

1054
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:38,106
One of my dearest
friends once told me...

1055
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,623
"that when people dream
of marrying royalty,

1056
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:45,906
they rarely comprehend
what it actually means.

1057
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:51,780
It means...

1058
01:25:53,457 --> 01:25:55,956
It means having to choose.

1059
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:59,856
And... I chose the House of Monaco.

1060
01:26:02,582 --> 01:26:05,569
It may not seem a noble
place, it may seem...

1061
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:10,498
Well, it may seem pompous and
it may seem circumstantial,

1062
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:14,647
and... I may not speak
its language and...

1063
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:16,815
Oh...

1064
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:22,186
It frustrates me at times, but...

1065
01:26:24,457 --> 01:26:26,290
it's my home.

1066
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:29,831
And these are my people.
And they are good people.

1067
01:26:29,832 --> 01:26:34,821
And they're trying to do what's right,
in their own small corner of the world...

1068
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,481
in the best way that they know how.

1069
01:26:40,582 --> 01:26:44,564
And those of you who are married
will know exactly what I mean.

1070
01:26:45,749 --> 01:26:50,774
Maybe I'm naive but...
I believe in fairy tales.

1071
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:55,165
I do. I believe that they can
exist if we really want them to,

1072
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:59,645
if we are prepared
to work hard enough.

1073
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:02,206
I believe that the...

1074
01:27:02,207 --> 01:27:08,156
that the world will not always
be full of hatred and conflict if...

1075
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:15,147
if we're willing to sacrifice enough.

1076
01:27:16,457 --> 01:27:18,123
And that is what...

1077
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:20,648
That is what Monaco means to me.

1078
01:27:21,082 --> 01:27:23,606
And in a way that is why...

1079
01:27:24,582 --> 01:27:27,106
That is why I am Monaco.

1080
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:31,981
I have no army, I...

1081
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:36,190
I wish ill on no one.

1082
01:27:38,582 --> 01:27:41,686
I bear no resistance to
aggression, I just...

1083
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:45,956
I'm here.

1084
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:49,873
I'm here doing what I do,

1085
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:54,732
trying to make a little difference in the
world in the best way that I know how.

1086
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:01,540
But it wouldn't be real life,
or it wouldn't be the fairy tale,

1087
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:04,831
if there wasn't someone trying
to destroy it, or crush it,

1088
01:28:04,832 --> 01:28:08,415
simply because it doesn't please them,
or simply because they can.

1089
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:11,864
And I know some of you think
it's their right to do so.

1090
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:14,540
But I don't think anyone
should have the right

1091
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,645
to crush happiness or
beauty when they see it.

1092
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,498
Well, it's...

1093
01:28:21,499 --> 01:28:23,540
It's not how I was raised.

1094
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:26,195
And it's not the world
that I wish to...

1095
01:28:26,582 --> 01:28:29,236
It's not the world I
wish to be a part of.

1096
01:28:30,374 --> 01:28:34,248
I would rather that the...
that the tanks roll through my lawn,

1097
01:28:34,249 --> 01:28:36,831
I would rather that the
bombs fall on my house

1098
01:28:36,832 --> 01:28:39,915
than know I live in a world
where love doesn't conquer all.

1099
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:41,693
Because...

1100
01:28:42,749 --> 01:28:45,273
Because I believe in love.

1101
01:28:46,082 --> 01:28:50,581
And... I believe that it's love
that has brought us here tonight.

1102
01:28:50,582 --> 01:28:52,774
And it's love...

1103
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:57,456
It's love that will make us put
away our guns and our politics

1104
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,498
and our fears and our prejudices,

1105
01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:03,943
and it's love that will
eventually make everything right.

1106
01:29:04,957 --> 01:29:08,275
And that is why tonight I
am going to celebrate it,

1107
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:11,778
and I'm going to be
willing to defend it.

1108
01:29:13,374 --> 01:29:17,024
And I hope that you will all do
the same in your own way...

1109
01:29:19,999 --> 01:29:22,523
out there in your own lives.

1110
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:40,123
American Aphrodite...

1111
01:30:40,124 --> 01:30:44,733
You're not really gonna drop a bomb
on Princess Grace, are you, Charles?

1112
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:00,481
I love you.

1113
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,856
<i>Long after I'm gone,</i>

1114
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:50,068
<i>long after the House of
Grimaldi has fallen,</i>

1115
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:55,567
<i>the world is going to remember
your name, Your Highness.</i>

1116
01:31:56,916 --> 01:32:02,236
<i>You are the fairy tale...
the serenity to which we all aspire.</i>

1117
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:08,024
<i>And peace will come when you embrace the
roles you have been destined to play...</i>

1118
01:32:08,249 --> 01:32:13,072
<i>devoted mother, loyal wife,
compassionate leader.</i>

1119
01:32:13,999 --> 01:32:18,608
<i>Up against the task, larger than
yourself, you will overcome your fear.</i>

1120
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:23,151
<i>Those that preceded you
will be forgotten.</i>

1121
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:29,736
<i>Those that follow you will be inspired
by your strength and endurance.</i>

1122
01:32:30,832 --> 01:32:34,529
<i>For no matter where
you are, in years to come,</i>

1123
01:32:34,874 --> 01:32:40,645
<i>they will continue to whisper
your name: The Princess Grace.</i>

1124

<i>"For all one can wish for in
life is a place to belong,</i>

1125

without judgment, without condition.</i>

1126
01:33:19,124 --> 01:33:21,648
