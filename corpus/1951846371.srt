1
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,238
Ey, you see that van
over there?

2
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,681
Chechen extremists.

3
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,373
Van is full of explosives.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,712
They burnt down a hardware store
for no reason.

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,354
That's what we're dealing with.

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,282
That's right.
it's a war zone, my friend.

7
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,655
And war costs money.

8
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,202
Yeah, we need money to fight
these fucking bastards.

9
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,074
So everyone's payment
doubles this week.

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,305
It's in my pocket.

11
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,007
Hey, hey.
That's what I'm talking about.

12
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,416
All right. I'll catch you later.
Thank you.

13
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,997
Pu? What's Pu?

14
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,269
If you don't know,
then it's probably not for you.

15
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,396
Help me.

16
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,466
Can you please open the door?

17
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,102
No.

18
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,283
Can I see my badge, please?

19
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,349
There was a criticality. I saw it.

20
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,493
I need to know my rems.

21
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,791
I need to know my rems.

22
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,160
Radiation is all around us.

23
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,402
it is measured in rems.

24
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:38,976
A person living in Denver receives
0.05 rems a year due to the altitude.

25
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,843
A patient receiving a chest x-ray
absorbs 0.01 rems.

26
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,883
My watch.
It was my father's watch.

27
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,953
in Hiroshima, where people
received doses...

28
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,181
...of 600 rems after the bomb
was dropped...

29
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,121
...most died within a month.

30
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,133
Papa, help.

31
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,143
Tolya, I'm coming.

32
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,839
- Tell me, what do you need?
- I can't get this one. It's impossible.

33
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,008
- When I get out.
- You've been there forever.

34
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,380
Ask your mother.

35
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,785
- Is there anything I can do?
- Help him with the knot.

36
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,686
No, what about for you?

37
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,719
I'll be fine in a minute.

38
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,195
- I need help. I have a knot.
- I see.

39
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,428
Now, you know who taught your father
about untying knots?

40
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,266
I did, when we were studying...

41
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,399
...at the Technical Institute
for Knot Untying...

42
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,459
How do you feel?

43
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,492
I'm going to get you
a glass of water.

44
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,262
Right.
What do we have here?

45
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,247
Come in here.
More light where I can see.

46
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,921
My last day at the facility,
you remember?

47
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,650
The day my badge
had a small reading.

48
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:12,731
You took me home
and you made me a bowl of soup.

49
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,198
Because we all know that the best cure
for radiation sickness...

50
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,997
...is a big bowl of soup.

51
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,737
I think a person gets more radiation
from flying across the Atlantic...

52
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,103
...than I did on that day.

53
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:29,013
And besides,
that soup was terrible.

54
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,515
Way more dangerous than anything
on the periodic table.

55
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,594
You'll be fine, Timofey.

56
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,371
Can we put my badge in the dosimeter
to get a reading?

57
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,679
A physician examined your badge
this morning...

58
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,655
...and submitted a report
of 100 rems.

59
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,053
As you can see.

60
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,220
Although serious,
this is not considered a lethal dose.

61
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,126
A full recovery is possible.

62
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,030
Short-term, there may be some
symptoms, nausea, diarrhea.

63
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:28,299
However, the long-term effects
are specific to the individual.

64
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,410
So we are placing you
on indefinite leave...

65
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,911
...pending an investigation
into this alleged accident.

66
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,709
I don't understand.

67
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,445
A man goes into a secure chamber,
without authorization...

68
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,148
...when the gauge reads normal,
and somehow a pipe ruptures?

69
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,451
A hearing will be set
for six weeks from now...

70
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,119
...at which time you will be allowed
to present your version of the events.

71
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,130
I already told you my version.

72
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,963
There was a blue flash
and a leak that caused damage.

73
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,605
There are failing welds,
we have no backup systems...

74
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,037
Or you can sign this statement
that entering the chamber...

75
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,836
...was an error in judgment.

76
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,415
In the end...

77
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,953
...no one is served
by placing blame.

78
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,490
Calling in an international team
to investigate.

79
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,754
Shutting down while
tests are conducted.

80
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,955
All that means is what?

81
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,131
- A loss of revenue, jobs.
- And what will they find?

82
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,102
Whatever the people
who are paying them tell them to find.

83
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,206
And if I sign, what sort of
compensation could I expect?

84
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,810
Compensation?

85
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,143
I have worked here
at Skotoprigonyevsk for 12 years.

86
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,012
I have a boy and a wife.

87
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,315
It appears that the discharge in Unit 6
was a result of either incompetence...

88
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,617
- what provisions can be made...?
...or deliberate malfeasance...

89
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,160
- what provisions will be made for...?
...resulting in financial damages...

90
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,991
...for Skotoprigonyevsk...

91
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,655
...and forfeits you of any benefits...

92
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,063
...effective immediately.
- We kept your rubles in a box.

93
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,600
We held on to them.

94
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,603
- Now it takes 5000 to make one dollar.
- Until that time...

95
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,241
...the employee is suspended
without pay.

96
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,808
- Hello.
- We got you.

97
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,243
- Hello?
- We got you.

98
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,514
- What are you talking about?
- We got you.

99
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,181
- Guys. No, you did not get me.
- We're sitting here and you answered.

100
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,380
We watched you answer.

101
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,024
- We got you.
- No, no, no.

102
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,126
Do you understand the game?
Do you?

103
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,359
- We sneak up on you and before...
- Do you know what the game's called?

104
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,692
- The game's called tag.
- Okay. Here is problem.

105
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,392
The game is not called tag.
The game is called car tag.

106
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,869
You're in your car and you sneak up
next to the person, then you got me.

107
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,407
Not driving your chair
in the fucking lobby.

108
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,476
- I didn't know this.
- It's not made clear.

109
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,375
- I think he changes the rules.
- Hey, come here. Come, sit.

110
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,072
Let me go.

111
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,081
Okay. Guys, it's Tusk.

112
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,950
- I want you to give me money.
- I'm not doing it.

113
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,385
- Yes.
- I know you have it. It's in your bag.

114
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,683
I know it's in your bag.

115
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,485
- I'm not doing it.
- Of course I can.

116
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,059
- Absolutely.
- I'm not doing it.

117
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,522
- Okay.
- No, I want you to give it to me nicely.

118
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,225
Remember this address,
57 Pioneerski Prospect.

119
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,900
Remember. Can you remember?

120
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,771
- Get a pen, write it down.
- We don't work for you.

121
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,770
Okay, okay.
Nobody works for anybody.

122
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,136
I am vice president
of talking on the phone...

123
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,177
...and you're vice president
of remembering fucking address.

124
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,678
Here, let me help you.

125
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,181
Fuck me.

126
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,397
Was that a fucking American?

127
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,462
You won't buy our boy Big Macs...

128
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,539
...with money you get from Americans.

129
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,835
When you can afford
to put food in his mouth...

130
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,875
...then you can decide
what goes in mine.

131
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,380
Look, you do not fuck the British
or the Americans. Do you understand?

132
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,541
The British fuck
like they have an audience.

133
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,950
Like they have something
James Bond to prove. Okay?

134
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,683
And the Americans, they...
Oh, they have to save you.

135
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,293
They're screwing you to save you
from having to fuck.

136
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,021
They have a magic wand
for a dick.

137
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,825
Screw the French. They screw like
they have something better to do.

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,628
- You're such a man of the world.
- No, you know what?

139
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,237
I've traveled, I've done business.

140
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,872
You picked up a suitcase.

141
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,632
Maybe you changed planes in Kiev.

142
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,939
Yes, and I used the money I made
to buy a place for us.

143
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,879
It's a necklace. Not an apartment.

144
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,349
- It's Tiffany.
- It's a fake.

145
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,025
Hold these.

146
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,524
- This isn't what we're doing now.
- I know someone who can move them.

147
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,794
Pick that up.

148
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,304
- Guys, we have business now.
- Pick it up. It's money.

149
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,938
Don't say "fuck you" to money.

150
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,773
Otherwise, money will say
"fuck you" to you too also.

151
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,149
If I pick up
this one wiper blade...? Okay.

152
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,013
- I'm going in.
- Hey.

153
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,982
- Where you going?
- What?

154
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,455
This way.

155
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,184
That's why you write things down.

156
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,733
It's cheaper down the street.

157
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:12,844
- Hey, how much for this one?
- This? It's a Gessl.

158
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,385
Manufactured in Frankfurt
by Imperial Gessl...

159
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,955
...but why is your friend
driving away my customers?

160
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey, Vladimir. Why are you driving away
this man's customers?

161
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,396
You will pay for that.

162
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,295
See? There's where you're wrong.

163
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,936
You pay Tusk for protection,
and this will not happen.

164
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,698
No, I don't pay Tusk.
I call for protection.

165
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,066
You fucking pay us.

166
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,238
Hey, Vlad. I bet you a dollar
you can't guess which color they are.

167
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,246
- Get away from her.
- Pay us and he'll get away.

168
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,782
Daddy, I want to come down.

169
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,356
What is wrong with you?

170
00:14:55,628 --> 00:15:00,361
And what's wrong with you?
For $100 you're gonna stab us all?

171
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,061
Where are the hammers?

172
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,101
We'll be back in a couple of weeks.

173
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,871
Hopefully we can get through it
without any loss of blood.

174
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,540
Help your father.

175
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,142
Put it back!

176
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,149
What? I work for you now?

177
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,755
I'm asking you to put it back.

178
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,661
You have a knife.
Maybe you should use it...

179
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,224
...or put it back.

180
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,733
Got you.

181
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,084
- How are you feeling?
- One hundred rems.

182
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,125
Could have been worse.

183
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,364
They put me on indefinite leave.
No pay.

184
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,368
I suppose we are all on indefinite leave
in that case.

185
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,640
Did they say anything else?

186
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,473
There's an investigation.

187
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,407
After 12 years, they're saying...

188
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,245
...l'm the kind of man who
would cause a work stoppage.

189
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:32,290
- That's who they say I am.
- I am sorry, Timofey.

190
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,853
This is for you.

191
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,634
An element loses a particle
and becomes unstable.

192
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,034
A chain reaction
is set in motion.

193
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,147
Pulsing waves of desperation
in every direction.

194
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,944
Perhaps the lost part
is clarity or hope.

195
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,316
in the fall out,
the man-made elements appear.

196
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,151
isotopes of fear and anger.

197
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,793
They cannot be handled safely
or burled in the ground.

198
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,663
They take the shape
of a mushroom cloud.

199
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,495
Started above a desert
that circles the globe...

200
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,160
...and shadows us all.

201
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,797
What did they say?

202
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,739
They want me to sign a report
saying it was nothing.

203
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,469
They put me on unpaid leave.

204
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,777
I see.

205
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,408
- And did they have you see the doctor?
- It wasn't necessary.

206
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,780
They should've reinforced
the welds after Tomsk.

207
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,785
No. You were their redundancy.

208
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,982
"Timofey will fix the leak.
Timofey will put out the fire."

209
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,425
- Anyone would have gone in.
- Anyone would have run the other way.

210
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,496
Papa.

211
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,733
I'm sorry. It's...

212
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,700
we need to know your rems.

213
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:42,169
The doctor examined my badge
and submitted a report of 100 rems.

214
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,714
Well, then...

215
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,515
...this can be survived.

216
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,723
What do they expect us
to do for money?

217
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,095
- What if the boy gets sick one day?
- No. Nobody's getting sick.

218
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,731
- Who will pay for that?
- You work in the garden...

219
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,459
...and I will go and get my job back
in the facility.

220
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,193
- No.
- We will have enough.

221
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,668
There is no job there anymore.

222
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,606
I told them.
For years, I told them.

223
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,245
- Backup systems...
- Listen, listen.

224
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,172
I went to the library today,
to look in the medical journals.

225
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,545
And they said that with a dose
up to 100 rems...

226
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,745
...it could be years
before the effects are felt.

227
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,660
Never go back there.

228
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,331
Promise me you'll never
go back there.

229
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,866
I'm going to put him in a jar!

230
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,073
Coming.

231
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,547
What hurts more?
The jar or the pins?

232
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,778
I think only a butterfly
knows the answer to that one.

233
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,925
Did they build that
to keep us in?

234
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,154
No, I think they built that
to keep everyone else out.

235
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,764
They wanted to keep
this place a secret.

236
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,197
Do you know any other secrets?

237
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:20,674
Well, you see this flower?
See how it's blue?

238
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,413
But if it gets exposed
to certain levels of radiation...

239
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,848
...it turns yellow.

240
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,648
Will you turn yellow?

241
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,592
Come on.

242
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,390
Let's go home.

243
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,995
Did you hear that?

244
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,637
- Did you hear the door?
- Who would come over now?

245
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,277
What you did there,
that was uncalled for.

246
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,646
- You could get the door for your mother.
- I'm not expecting anyone.

247
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,725
Maybe it's your girlfriend, the prostitute,
come to give you money.

248
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,521
Ukrainian slut.

249
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,788
That's somebody's mother
you're talking about.

250
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,958
What do you want
at the fucking door?

251
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,510
What does that look like to you?

252
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,207
- Fifty-seven.
- It's seven or one?

253
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,079
- Seven.
- I thought a seven has a line through it.

254
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,447
- Sometimes.
- Some...? What the fuck is sometimes?

255
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,249
- Either it has a line or it doesn't.
- Ask your mother.

256
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,860
Eight. Eight is always eight.
There is no sometimes with eight.

257
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,887
51 Pioneerski Prospect
is already paying protection...

258
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,295
...to Starkov.
It's not Tusk's territory.

259
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,867
We burnt down the wrong store.

260
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,906
- Come. Come.
- Drei, go to bed, all right?

261
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,800
What did Tusk say?

262
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,436
It is financial problem, and it will remain
financial problem for 72 hours.

263
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,312
- Then it will become personal problem.
- What is, "personal problem"?

264
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:11,047
That we have to find
$6000 in 72 hours.

265
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,557
Is it 72 hours before the time of the call
or from the time of the fire?

266
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,093
This is vague in my mind.

267
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,994
He says it is an insult.
That it is damaging to his reputation...

268
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,260
...and that he has lost face.

269
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,904
Tusk wants to send a girl
from the hotel to Starkov.

270
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,430
Did you send one?

271
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,131
- Yes.
- Yes.

272
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:36,042
You see? This is what I'm talking about.
That's why Tusk is who he is. He thinks.

273
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,626
Fucking Red Army drunk.
Lying in the middle of the road.

274
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,729
- I didn't see him.
- You were driving!

275
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,355
- He distracted me.
- There something wrong with my face?

276
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,195
It's fucked up.

277
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,427
Who are you calling?

278
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,061
We're not leaving the guy
lying in the middle of the road.

279
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,603
Where are you going?

280
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,086
- There's blood on the car.
- She's alive.

281
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,848
- Fucking bitch.
- Is she...?

282
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,187
Oh, my God. How old is she?

283
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:37,640
- It's got a name, an address.
- So have I.

284
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,372
It's somebody's dog.

285
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,443
Somebody's fucked-up
in-the-middle-of-the-road dog.

286
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,287
Yeah? Oh, my God.

287
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,198
- Your dog hit our car.
- Fucked up my face.

288
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,029
Fucked up his face
and damaged my car.

289
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,899
- Guys, forget about this.
- No, I won't forget about it.

290
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,064
Fucking dog wandering around
in the night...

291
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,574
...almost kills three people.

292
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,508
I don't understand.
What do you want from me?

293
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,012
- We don't have time.
- What's the damage to the car?

294
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,707
Thousand dollars? And your face?

295
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,909
Thousand dollars.

296
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,919
You hit our dog, and then
you come in here and want money?

297
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,257
Call your father. Go.

298
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,891
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

299
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,392
Hey. What are you doing?
Wha...? What...?

300
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,929
We don't have
that kind of money in the house.

301
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,760
Look. Let's just take the clock.

302
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,402
- I don't want the clock.
- You know what we don't have.

303
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,403
We don't have a kid. Maybe we
take the kid, come back later.

304
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,063
Look...

305
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,241
Please take... Take this.
It's all I have. Please.

306
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,039
It's all I have.

307
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,075
Good.

308
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,591
Sorry about your dog.

309
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,201
Today, we learn Thai.

310
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,683
- Excuse me?
- Repeat after me:

311
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,249
The number 57.

312
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,360
The number 51.

313
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,822
As in "the one." The path.

314
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,793
The seven levels of consciousness
in the enlightened man.

315
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,704
Have you been to Bangkok?

316
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,937
Do you know how many businessmen
are in Patpong on a Friday night?

317
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,545
Ten thousand.

318
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,307
I wouldn't have thought that many.

319
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,647
Ten thousand men paying $100 for
some slippery-suds massage...

320
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,018
...with a bean-snap happy ending,
you know:

321
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,783
You know?

322
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,756
- And you know what?
- What?

323
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,259
No Russian girls.

324
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,159
- Just one flavor of pussy.
- Just one flavor?

325
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,994
That is what you need
to be able to see in the world now.

326
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,501
A Baskin-Robbins of pussy.

327
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,868
That is capitalism.

328
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,102
You see that?

329
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,682
- You know what that is?
- French fry.

330
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,882
An opportunity.

331
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,749
I also thought it was a french fry.

332
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,692
There is a McDonald's policy...

333
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,695
...that the fry can only be
in the Frialator for six minutes.

334
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,358
So after that,
they must be thrown out.

335
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,801
I mean, six minutes
is the lifespan of a french fry.

336
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,669
So, what would you do?
What would you do?

337
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,612
- Order McNuggets chicken instead.
- Chocolate milkshake.

338
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,849
You pay the assistant minister of
french fries to let six minutes elapse...

339
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,582
...and then he pays
the assistant minister of garbage...

340
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,248
...to let you wait by the back door.

341
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,327
Then you take
seven-minute french fries...

342
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,487
...to the end of the line,
and you sell them french fries...

343
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,691
...for one kopeck less
than they pay inside. You see?

344
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,495
- Yeah.
- You see how the world works?

345
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,436
- Yes.
- Yes? Yes? No, no. How could you?

346
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,940
You'd have to know the difference
between a one and a seven...

347
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,376
...you stupid fucking piece of shit.

348
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,184
We'll get it, we'll get the money.

349
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,979
Yes, an ogkaat.
I think, for sure...

350
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,384
...we're very close to ogkaat.
I'm concerned of the time.

351
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,819
- No, no, no.
- The 72 hours...

352
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,788
No, no, no. Time is not money.

353
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,019
You know why?
You can always make more money.

354
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,165
So, no, please. I mean...
I want you all to tell me...

355
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,766
...what a seven-minute french fry
tastes like.

356
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,860
Go ahead.

357
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,475
Have a bite of capitalism.

358
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,987
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

359
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,438
Light is a particle and a wave.

360
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:47,574
This is hard to understand,
how a thing can be two things at once.

361
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:52,355
But a woman is also
both a particle and a wave.

362
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,492
She's a wave when you see her
reach down...

363
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,320
...to pull a she`ll from the sea...

364
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:00,794
...and you feel her beauty
pass through you like electrical current.

365
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,559
She's a particle when her hair
brushes your face...

366
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,635
...and her hands push into yours.

367
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,736
And the child s also
a particle and a wave.

368
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,707
Els a wave when the sound
of his pain shoots through you...

369
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,971
...and twists you away
from yourself.

370
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,207
And he is a particle
when the doctor hands you a baby...

371
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,851
...a small mirror.

372
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:26,214
Women, children, and light
can be two things at once.

373
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,183
A particle.

374
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,656
A wave.

375
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,164
They ricochet off the hard surfaces
and illuminate the corners.

376
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,734
Without them,
it would be far darker.

377
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,043
Mina.

378
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,115
Wake up.

379
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,515
What?

380
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,588
What are you doing?

381
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,657
Prusokov said
there might be a job in Moscow.

382
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,420
- He got a letter from Orlov.
- Jobs?

383
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,223
No. There are...
There are no jobs.

384
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,093
Everywhere on the news
they're saying there are no jobs.

385
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,700
Well...

386
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,531
...a French company
is looking for a technician.

387
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,764
He says there might be a position.

388
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,737
When are you planning on going?

389
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,505
They're only seeing people today.

390
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,271
I'll take Tolya to school,
get the train.

391
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,211
No. You feel well enough to go?

392
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,641
It's a job.

393
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,788
If they can pay me, you and Tolya
can come in a couple of days.

394
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,425
Timofey.

395
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,221
Are you going to kiss me goodbye?

396
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:54,605
I hear that in instances
of contamination over 600 rems...

397
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,480
...close physical contact
is discouraged.

398
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,881
You read too much.

399
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,121
I thought that's why you liked me.

400
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,059
I never said I liked you.

401
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,929
I said I loved you.

402
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,437
When did you say that?

403
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,869
Before I ever knew your name.

404
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,008
First day I saw you at the institute.

405
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,705
I tried to say it with my eyes.

406
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,279
On the day I married you in Tula.

407
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,854
And every day since.

408
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,023
- Don't go.
- It's just sometimes I said it to myself.

409
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,161
Please...

410
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,524
...don't go.

411
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,059
Come here.

412
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,892
I'll call you from Moscow.

413
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,042
Tell me about butterflies.

414
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,748
Do you know that monarch butterflies
have a compass in their head...

415
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,325
...that uses the sun to tell them
where they are going?

416
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,895
And that Costa Rica
has more butterflies...

417
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,498
...than any country on Earth?

418
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,964
No, I had no idea.

419
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,764
And butterflies have eyes
that allow them...

420
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:06,433
...to see what's happening in front
and behind them at the same time.

421
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,942
I didn't know that.

422
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:11,013
But I do know your mother
will be waiting for you after school.

423
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:15,118
So don't be late. Never keep
any of the genus woman waiting.

424
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,291
Remember
when you were very young...

425
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,123
...and your mother was sick,
we made her soup?

426
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,932
And then we came out here...

427
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,466
...and we picked flowers for her.

428
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,036
- Do you remember?
- I remember.

429
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,866
And do you remember
what happened...

430
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,838
...when we gave her the flowers?
- She cried.

431
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,604
And have you ever seen her
cry again since?

432
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,614
No.

433
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,545
No.

434
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,617
There's something
I want you to do for me.

435
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,783
If you ever see your mother
cry again...

436
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,319
...and I am not there to stop her...

437
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,128
...I want you to bring her here.

438
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,962
Right here, and dig this up.

439
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,460
You don't need the watch anymore?

440
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,945
Come on.

441
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,485
The hands on the clock
are waving goodbye.

442
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,053
It was my grandfather's watch.

443
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,824
The dial was painted by hand
in America during World War 1.

444
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,698
The brides of soldiers
seated at long tables...

445
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:45,036
...dutifully making luminous little sixes
and eights to help keep the world free.

446
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,805
The eights were particularly
hard to make...

447
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,109
...so the women sucked
on the tips of the paintbrushes...

448
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,945
...to bring them to a fine point.

449
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,281
One by one, their mouths began
to fill with cancer.

450
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,653
The radium-based paint
they had swallowed...

451
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,063
...bombarded their brains and bones
with alpha and beta particles.

452
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,269
The women who painted
the watch faces...

453
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,570
...sued the U.S. Radium Corporation
of West Orange, New Jersey.

454
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,243
Ad the trial been at night...

455
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,317
...the breath they used
to say goodbye to the world...

456
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,680
...would have glowed
like moonlit fog.

457
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,384
They were given $10,000
for their lives.

458
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,557
What is wrong with you?

459
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,325
Fucking idiots!

460
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,128
There are kids playing here!

461
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,201
- What is that?
- Eight hundred dollars.

462
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,398
Maybe a little over.

463
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,410
Guys, at least go to neighborhood
where you don't know everybody.

464
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,514
- Go to rich-people neighborhood.
- How much money you make today?

465
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,707
Six thousand dollars?

466
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,451
We'll increase collections.
I figured it out.

467
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,714
Fuck you figured it out.
We figured it out.

468
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,551
We come up with 3000,
you come up with $3000.

469
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,320
What...? No!
I didn't burn down the store.

470
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,759
- Besides, there's two of you.
- There's two of us?

471
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,560
- There's two of you. You both get paid.
- We're not talking about getting paid.

472
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,999
It was my understanding
we're paying other people.

473
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,229
No, I'm saying a third,
a third and a third.

474
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,637
Fifty-fifty. Come on.
Even Andrei knows this.

475
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,245
- Andrei, what's 6000 divided by three?
- Now we're involving Andrei?

476
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,211
You want to talk about our problems
with children?

477
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,916
- Guys...
- Three thousand dollars, Shiv.

478
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,348
At the hotel.

479
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,115
Come on. Please.

480
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,202
I have been thinking about
what hurts more...

481
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,709
...the jar or the pins.

482
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,441
And i think i can tell you
that it is not the pins.

483
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,211
Because the monarch in the jar
is already dead...

484
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,445
...when it comes to the pins.

485
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,918
At some point,
things stop hurting.

486
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,393
And from inside the jar,
with eyes that see in all directions...

487
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,362
...maybe it is possible
to look in to the future...

488
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,434
...well beyond the pins...

489
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,504
...to where the compass in your head
tells you that you need to go.

490
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,316
How much for the butterfly?

491
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,427
- Which one?
- That one.

492
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,460
The monarch.

493
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,068
- Fifteen thousand.
- Thank you.

494
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,646
Drei.

495
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,782
You know who wore hat like this?

496
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,784
- No.
- Jesse James.

497
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,923
- Jesse James.
- Jesse James.

498
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,488
He wore a hat just like this.

499
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,423
He only stole from rich people,
so he really wasn't a thief.

500
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:02,692
He'd go into a rough place
like Chicago or Brooklyn, do business.

501
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,232
Like you?

502
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,203
The CIA chased him for years.

503
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,863
Whenever Jesse Jackson
needed a car... he stole one.

504
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,543
Jesse James.

505
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,713
- What did I say?
- Reggie Jackson.

506
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,850
It's Jesse Jackson.
Jesse Jackson.

507
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,416
- Jesse Jackson.
- Yeah.

508
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,019
He could have been
president of the United States...

509
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,157
...but they don't respect the black man,
so he went underground.

510
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,952
Was he good at sports
like Michael Jordan?

511
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,893
Michael Jackson.

512
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,892
Michael Jackson.

513
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,363
Michael, Reggie, Jesse...

514
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,130
...and two other brothers,
The Jackson 5.

515
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,000
The most powerful family
in America.

516
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,665
Hey, what bill
is Andrew Jackson on?

517
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,970
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

518
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,343
Hey, respect the Jacksons.

519
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,084
Like the way
you respect your mother.

520
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,447
Sorry. I'm late.

521
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,251
So, what did you learn today?

522
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,554
About Yuri Gagarin,
first man in space.

523
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:09,062
What did you learn about?
Visa and American Express?

524
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:13,260
I want to change my name
to Jackson.

525
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,932
I have to talk to you.

526
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,235
I met someone.

527
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,039
Good.
It's your job to meet someone.

528
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,808
Just as long as someone's
not British or American.

529
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,144
This is different.

530
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,049
Everything has to change now.

531
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,355
Since yesterday,
you met someone?

532
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,721
What kind of som...?
Please, don't fuck with me.

533
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,558
- I'm not having a good day.
- He wants me to take tennis lessons.

534
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,962
He wants me to travel with him.

535
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,796
Does he want
the kid to travel with him?

536
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,840
Does he know you have a kid?
Yeah, you're somebody's mother.

537
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,536
I am somebody's mother walking home
from the hotel at 3 in the morning...

538
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,274
...with barely enough money
to buy more condoms.

539
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,511
Tell me you wouldn't
take a way out.

540
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,984
And Mr. Way Out is some fucking
British guy with sideways teeth...

541
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,487
...who can't get laid
in his own country. Come on.

542
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,250
What about Andrei?

543
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,394
My mother can take care of him
when I have to leave town.

544
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,830
- What the fuck? Leave town?
- I don't want to be here anymore.

545
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,636
What about me and Drei?

546
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,708
You don't even know if he's yours.

547
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,945
I wasn't very careful then.

548
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,050
Mr. Jackson...

549
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,350
...tell your mother
to work on her backhand.

550
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,297
I think he will break
into a million pieces if we hit it.

551
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,567
Nobody's going to pay
for a dead animal.

552
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,608
Go. Get the dog.

553
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,883
Hi.

554
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,577
You like chocolate?

555
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,450
I like chocolate.

556
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,852
Here.

557
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:21,359
- Today, Yegor. Today.
- You are beautiful.

558
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,466
Yes, you are.

559
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,983
What, you decided to spend
your last day...

560
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,311
...stealing windshield wipers?

561
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,246
Come here.

562
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,014
Repeat after me:

563
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,858
In Thai, that's the word for respect.

564
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,523
In Chiang Mai...

565
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:01,030
...women wash the feet of their men
as a show of respect, you see?

566
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,799
So as a show of respect,
I want you to wash my car.

567
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,668
The car looks good.

568
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,473
Get in.

569
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,778
Fuck!

570
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,817
Now, get in the fucking car.

571
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,155
You know what that is?

572
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,762
That's debt.
You're sitting in a pool of debt.

573
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,459
- We'll get the money.
- That's debt in the back seat...

574
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,231
...and over here
we have earning potential.

575
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,897
Now, last week...

576
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,135
...I see her ass standing on the corner
two blocks from here...

577
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,676
...and it invades my brain.

578
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,809
No matter where I go, all I can think of
is her corner-standing ass.

579
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,748
So I put her ass on a billboard...

580
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,651
...and now her ass
reached right into my wallet.

581
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,853
You see?

582
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,234
So, what I'm asking is...

583
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:10,101
...how will you climb from the back seat
and into the front?

584
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,709
Most people, they don't know
when they're going to die, but you...

585
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,369
...you know that
it's sometime tomorrow.

586
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,958
I'm sure you've heard.

587
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:40,526
A Chechen gang lobbed a grenade
into a hardware store yesterday.

588
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,695
Burned a little girl's face.

589
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,866
We're collecting money to send her
to a specialist in Prague.

590
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,112
Okay. Thank you so much.
God bless you.

591
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,448
You fought in Afghanistan,
didn't you?

592
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,481
Yeah, we need money to fight
these fucking bastards.

593
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,420
So everyone's payment
doubles this week.

594
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,582
It's in my pocket.

595
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,321
Hey, hey.
That's what I'm talking about.

596
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,989
All right. I'll catch you later.
Thank you.

597
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,907
Pu? What's Pu?

598
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,145
If you don't know,
then it's probably not for you.

599
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,641
I don't care what it is.

600
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,184
If you're going to stand here and sell it,
pay me for protection, $100.

601
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,787
I don't need protection.

602
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,888
I need someone who understands
what it is I am offering.

603
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,922
Would anyone like to buy some Pu?

604
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,258
He has Pu. Anyone want some?

605
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,831
Not your lucky day.
One hundred dollars for protection.

606
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:50,497
I don't have a hundred dollars.
I have only a few rubles.

607
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,198
Then get the fuck out of here.

608
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,241
Take your Pu and your rubles
and get out.

609
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,402
You find a hundred dollars,
then we'll talk.

610
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,344
Hey, Sasha.
Sasha, I need to talk to you.

611
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,842
What if I had a way for you
to make a hundred times that?

612
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,059
Who the fuck are you?

613
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,127
Recently, there was an accident.

614
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,671
You may have heard
of Skotoprigonyevsk 16.

615
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,800
It's a center for the manufacture
of nuclear material.

616
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:31,641
It was built in 1949
for scientific research.

617
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,710
Never heard of it.

618
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,284
They didn't put it on the map.

619
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,013
Not even the military were aware
of the city's function.

620
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:44,818
So you're from "not on the map."
So far this is bullshit.

621
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,190
Look at my ID.

622
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,695
Look at my picture.

623
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,834
Read what it says
about my level of access.

624
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,663
Yeah, I'm reading here,
and it says you are full of shit.

625
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,431
And I don't have much time.

626
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,032
What the fuck is that?

627
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,606
Oh, boy. All right, if you're interested
in some kind of man-love...

628
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,341
...there's a Romanian gymnast
in lobby who bites pillow.

629
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,281
My unit's principal task
is to turn Pu-239...

630
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,582
...it's a man-made isotope,
for manufacture into warheads.

631
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,918
Like I said,
I'm not interested in your unit.

632
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,089
I need money
for my wife and child.

633
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,253
Fuck your wife and child.

634
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,089
You don't think I have a child?

635
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,395
I'm businessman.
Get to the part where it's my lucky day.

636
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,902
Here's what you need
to understand.

637
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:33,338
I've diverted a quantity
of fissile material, Pu-239.

638
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,774
Weapons-grade of the highest purity.

639
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,811
I want $30,000.

640
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,913
Okay, let me just check my wallet.

641
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,082
Do you think I'm joking?

642
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,016
Do you understand any of this?

643
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,588
Pu-239 is a man-made isotope...

644
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,455
...transmuted from uranium-238
in a chain reaction.

645
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,096
Okay, and that costs $30,000?

646
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,859
I have little more than
a hundred grams in this canister.

647
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,027
A hundred grams for $30,000?

648
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,263
In a place like Afghanistan
or North Korea...

649
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,534
...where they have a nuclear agenda,
you could sell it for 100 times that.

650
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:07,870
We're not in North Korea.

651
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,105
I'm talking about
enriched fissile material.

652
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,977
Most of it is well-guarded
in France or the United States.

653
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,779
They use it in nuclear bombs.

654
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,621
This is a nuclear bomb?

655
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,452
This is a bomb you're selling?

656
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,299
Perhaps I should find someone else.
I have very little time.

657
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,163
I have less time than anyone
you have ever met.

658
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,828
- Do you have contacts?
- Yeah. I need to see the shit.

659
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,095
You don't understand.

660
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,435
Fuck you. Let me see it.
I want to see it.

661
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,874
Are you aware of the radiological
effects on living organisms?

662
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:48,146
Protons cut through your DNA,
rewriting your genetic code.

663
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,879
The instructions for teeth
become the recipe for cancer.

664
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,554
Your marrow dies inside your bones,
taking with it your immune system.

665
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,388
The next coughing person
or common infection...

666
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,729
...the smoke from your cigarette
becomes lethal as a bullet.

667
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,992
A thousandth of a gram
can change a life.

668
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,762
Okay, I'll put the cigarette out.

669
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,938
There is a right way
to open this canister.

670
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,943
No fewer than 20 wrong ways.

671
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,446
Open it the wrong way,
the material spills out.

672
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,143
It costs $30,000
to learn the right way.

673
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:38,061
Go outside.
Go wait for me outside.

674
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,530
What are you doing?

675
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,834
What are you doing?

676
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,489
Marina.

677
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,219
- You shouldn't have come here.
- You told him Orlov had a job for him.

678
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,488
There are men
from the facility in my house...

679
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,498
...tearing things apart.
- I haven't spoken to Orlov in years.

680
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,398
He left this morning for Moscow.
He said you told him.

681
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,836
A hundred grams of plutonium
are missing.

682
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,301
No, he would never do that.

683
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,245
- You know he would never do that.
- Who knows what a person might do...

684
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,578
...in his position.
- What position?

685
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:34,253
We can't talk about this.
Please. You have to go.

686
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,085
Where do I go?

687
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,128
Where?

688
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,891
Where do I go?

689
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,633
This man who you think
may be interested...

690
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,004
...why is he called Tusk?

691
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,739
About two years ago...

692
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,247
...he walks into the Central Bank
of Moscow, right?

693
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,582
Tells them he needs $750,000
for elephants.

694
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,318
Elephants.
Indian elephants for the Moscow Zoo.

695
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,085
He's got a business plan, right?

696
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,560
You see, elephants
live like 80 years...

697
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:18,223
...and you get the people who come
to see them to feed them peanuts?

698
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,426
So you don't pay much for food.

699
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:24,665
Thousand people a day at, like,
a dollar and a half a person...

700
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,537
Forty-three million
eight hundred thousand dollars.

701
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,502
What's that?

702
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,773
The amount the elephants
will earn over 80 years.

703
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,112
- Not counting interest.
- You did that in your head?

704
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:37,844
Yes.

705
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,154
Wow, that's cool.

706
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,319
You gotta teach me
how to do that.

707
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,292
But Tusk has an even better idea.

708
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,056
No elephants.

709
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,063
How are no elephants better?

710
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:55,261
He tells the bank that the elephants
froze to death crossing the Himalayas.

711
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,905
The money's gone.

712
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:01,209
Then he should have
taken them another route.

713
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,709
No...

714
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,679
There never were any elephants.
This is the genius.

715
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,345
And you work for him?

716
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,580
Everybody does.

717
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,155
Even her.

718
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,156
The bank never came back
for their money?

719
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,426
Paid one official off.

720
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,001
And when that guy's boss
came around looking for more...

721
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,766
...he left him hanging from
an elephant tusk in an antique store.

722
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,571
The guy stayed alive three days
hanging from the wall.

723
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,847
Okay.

724
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,007
- Wait here.
- Who will explain the material?

725
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,248
You can't go in there.

726
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,684
Perhaps you're right.

727
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,090
Just don't fuck with the stereo.

728
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,457
VIP only.

729
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,432
Gun, I need to talk to Tusk.

730
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,302
Come on. You guys know me.

731
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,339
- Go.
- Thank you.

732
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:45,243
Excuse me, sir.
I know I'm getting you at a bad time.

733
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,509
- You have my money?
- Look, I'm in possession of something...

734
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:49,743
- what are you...?
- Sorry.

735
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,650
I'm in possession of something
that I think will be of great interest.

736
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,450
An oglekatt.

737
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,684
You need to work
on your pronunciation.

738
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,022
Would you like to get high,
dying man?

739
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:03,188
All I want is a way
to even things out.

740
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,858
To make my way into the front seat,
like you said. The front seat.

741
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,834
I don't want to discuss
business now.

742
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,303
Please, please.
The deal has to be made tonight.

743
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,136
The shit won't keep.
It has to move. Move.

744
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,300
The shit.

745
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:19,005
- A little over a hundred grams.
- Hundred grams of what?

746
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,343
Weapons-grade plutonium.

747
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,116
- What?
- Plutonium!

748
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,247
What are you talking about?

749
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,826
The seller wants 75 grand.
I think I can get it for 50.

750
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,395
He's from Skotopigneski 15,
the secret city...

751
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,532
...and he has access to Pu-55.

752
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,524
You have seen this plutonium?

753
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,069
No. He says
it's a bad idea to look at it.

754
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,149
He's waiting outside in the car...

755
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:07,319
...which is looking good, clean, nice.
It smells like pine trees.

756
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:17,669
Listen, if we play this thing right,
I think we can get an atomic bomb.

757
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,071
- Maybe more than one.
- Where's he from?

758
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,971
It's not on the map.
Nobody's ever been there.

759
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,479
So you want 50,000 for some plutonium
that you have never seen...

760
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,846
...from a guy who says he's from
a place nobody has ever been to.

761
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,112
He himself is not here.
And you want it now.

762
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,846
He's outside.

763
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,886
Move.

764
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,907
This will only take one second.
I know you're very, very busy...

765
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,539
...but I think you will like this
very much.

766
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,955
What the fuck happened in there?

767
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,985
The guy has a stomach thing.

768
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,529
What guy?

769
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:16,995
The guy with the shit.

770
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,334
What guy?

771
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,130
The guy with the bomb shit.

772
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,276
The car and the money.

773
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,970
Drop them off at my house,
midnight, understand?

774
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,144
Car, money, midnight.

775
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,785
- I'll be there. I'm on it.
- Or maybe...

776
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,322
Maybe you can make
a deal with Starkov.

777
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,483
Maybe you
and your imaginary friend...

778
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,186
...can trade him some plutonium
nobody has ever seen...

779
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:50,127
...and he'll only shoot you
with invisible bullets.

780
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,203
I want you to take
the nail of your thumb...

781
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:02,401
...and press it very hard
against my arch.

782
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,376
Harder.

783
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,439
Good.

784
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,815
It's my phone.

785
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,955
Answer.

786
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,963
You can do two things at once.

787
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,531
- Hello.
- Hey, baby.

788
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,399
No, Shiv. I need to call you back.

789
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:35,143
You looked...
You looked so beautiful today.

790
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,170
So who's Shiv?

791
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,076
I really need
to call you back, okay?

792
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,847
Well, listen, I think...
I think I found a way out for us.

793
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,749
There's this deal
that I've been putting together...

794
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,085
...and I need a little bit of cash
to set the wheels in motion.

795
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:52,524
- Say "Goodbye, Shiv."
- Goodbye, Shiv.

796
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,928
So...

797
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,761
...who's Shiv?

798
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,562
My nephew.

799
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,034
Baby?

800
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,900
Hello?

801
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,074
Where the fuck were you?

802
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,235
I was sick. I needed some air.

803
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:15,749
You... I had the guy
sitting right there.

804
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,285
He comes out here, okay?
He's got the money.

805
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,321
He wants to see some plutonium.
Where the fuck are you?

806
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,755
You're in the bathroom
shitting all over me.

807
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,221
Get him to come out again.

808
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,796
What, so you can do a striptease
on the sidewalk?

809
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:32,731
Freak him out into giving us
the money? Come on.

810
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,839
Where are you going?

811
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,407
- To find another buyer.
- What? You can't do that.

812
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,512
I'm sure there are other people
interested.

813
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,111
You're right. There are.
I was just on the phone with one.

814
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,115
Just now.

815
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,686
So all you have to do
is get your ass in the car...

816
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,880
...and I'll take you
to go meet him.

817
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,385
Hey, look.

818
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,791
You want $30,000?

819
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,138
They say he left.

820
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,330
With a man.

821
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,031
Hours ago.

822
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,178
I have never seen a dog like this.

823
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:17,670
It's like a woman.

824
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,247
Which fucking man is he with?

825
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,150
So...

826
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,049
...we do it alone.
No problem.

827
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,485
- Who fucking needs him?
- I call her Sheba.

828
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,384
She looks like a Sheba,
doesn't she?

829
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,686
We go to the door.

830
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,421
We say, "Your animal
was in the middle of the boulevard.

831
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,861
We swerved to avoid it
into oncoming traffic.

832
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:40,935
There was much damage, casualties,
and we have witnesses."

833
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,004
And you be the owner
of the other car.

834
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,605
Feel how soft her fur is.

835
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,038
You say your face got fucked up
in the accident...

836
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,576
...and as a result of this, Mr...

837
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,805
what's the name of the owner?

838
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,443
- Starkov.
- No.

839
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,611
Starkov is the man we owe
the money to. The owner of the dog.

840
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,086
It says Starkov.

841
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,383
Number 28.

842
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,297
- We have to take her back.
- Can't we keep her?

843
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,464
No. We have to take her back.

844
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,975
We have the wrong dog.

845
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,838
Let's go, girl.

846
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,447
Yegor.

847
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:34,149
Come on, girl.
It's time to go home.

848
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,591
How much chocolate
did you give the dog?

849
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,532
It was not my fault. I was not...

850
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,118
- Is that a one or a seven?
- Seven.

851
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,981
Maybe she should have your job.

852
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,349
We had a problem with a couple
of our employees.

853
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,683
It's being dealt with.

854
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,725
It's dealt with when
Mr. Starkov gets his money.

855
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,122
It's not that simple.

856
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,158
I brought him something
that's better than money.

857
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,959
You brought him a larger dick?

858
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,163
Fantastic.

859
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,065
You see this man?

860
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,432
This guy?

861
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,642
This is the vice president
of Skrotoponsky 17.

862
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:35,614
I have in my possession a quantity
of Pu-239 of the highest purity.

863
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,051
If someone could transport it
out of the country...

864
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,588
...I have no idea
how much it could bring.

865
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,823
Yeah. That's right.

866
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,593
So look, if all your boss wants
is 6 grand...

867
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,394
...we'll give it to him right now.
But if he wants the good shit...

868
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,696
...that's what I'm talking about.

869
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:01,575
It's unlikely he will get
this opportunity again.

870
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,443
Stay here.

871
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,651
Nice. That was great.

872
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,518
- We go in together.
- Look at you. You're a fucking mess.

873
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,421
You go in there, throw up all over,
we get $10,000, maybe.

874
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:22,559
I go in there, work a little magic,
we get more.

875
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,895
- I need $30,000.
- Right.

876
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,002
There are things
that my family require.

877
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,806
My son and my wife.

878
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,168
- It's not for me.
- Right.

879
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,472
Okay, I got it. Is it gone?
The lipstick?

880
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,437
Okay.

881
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,016
I'm expecting
a very important phone call.

882
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,674
It's from a girl, Oksana.

883
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,820
Do not move,
don't get up from the table...

884
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,353
...do not go
to the fucking bathroom, okay?

885
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,785
Let's go.

886
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,921
Fifty thousand dollars.

887
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,656
Tusk will give me 60.

888
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,495
Remember Roscoe Tanner?

889
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,864
I don't follow tennis.

890
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:05,007
What do you mean
you don't follow tennis?

891
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,109
Tennis is like sex.
You like sex, then you like tennis.

892
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,507
Hey, bring over the ball.

893
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,742
No, you have to be a man.
It's a man's game.

894
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:17,249
Tennis is good for you.
It's strong, you know. I like this.

895
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,253
This I like so much.
When you:

896
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,015
- That whoosh.
- Yeah?

897
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:26,025
It's nice, huh? You like that, right?
It's very exciting, huh?

898
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,493
Oh, smell that.
What does it remind you of, huh?

899
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,331
What? What? What? Come on.
What does it remind you of?

900
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,163
- It's nice...
- Yeah, nice. Of course, nice.

901
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,738
Of course, nice. Yeah.
You're right.

902
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,738
Sir, it's weapons-grade.

903
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:44,312
- Pure. My associate is major dealer...
- Roscoe Tanner, 140 miles an hour.

904
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,574
His ground strokes
were not all that good...

905
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,948
...but he had a serve... like a bazooka.

906
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,948
What happened to your hands?

907
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,606
- Hello.
- Shiv, we have a problem.

908
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,511
No Shiv right now.

909
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,242
I need to speak with Shiv.

910
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,942
He's in a meeting.

911
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,513
- What kind of meeting?
- A business meeting.

912
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,354
You see, I find that very strange,
as we're in business together.

913
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,792
So who the fuck are you?

914
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,595
It's not important who I am.

915
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,729
No, that's right.
You are not important.

916
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:44,100
What is important is that you tell Shiv
that we have a new problem...

917
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,606
...with a guy called Starkov.
He'll know who that is. Starkov.

918
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,369
He's with him now.

919
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:51,905
What?

920
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,242
What do you mean he's with Starkov?
What is he doing with Starkov?

921
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,886
Made some kind of deal, yes?

922
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,189
You tell him when I take
the Gessl knife out of my back...

923
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,521
...l'm gonna stick it right up his ass.

924
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,633
Hey.

925
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,864
Bring the dog here.

926
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,528
Twenty thousand.

927
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,203
Fourteen?
Fourteen thousand dollars seems fair.

928
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:27,043
- We'll, take 14.
- Minus the 6000 you already own me.

929
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,150
- Nine thousand?
- Eight!

930
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,214
Eight thousand dollars seems fair.

931
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,533
- Hello.
- Hello?

932
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,301
Have I spoken you?

933
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,070
No.

934
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,771
When I left this morning...

935
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,952
...I wasn't thinking too clearly.

936
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,789
I think if should tell you
why i came here.

937
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,357
To St. Petersburg, for the position.

938
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:17,489
I know it might mean leaving here, but
I've already spoken to Tolya about it...

939
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:21,932
...and he knows he might have
to say goodbye to his friends.

940
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:26,532
I told him that St. Petersburg
is beautiful this time of year.

941
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,337
Just like it was
on our wedding day.

942
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,848
Is everything all right with you?

943
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,915
You have to tell me
if anything has happened.

944
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,479
What could happen in one day?

945
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,418
Has it only been one day?

946
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:51,325
I didn't think it was possible to miss
someone this much after one day.

947
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,034
Tomorrow...

948
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,604
...when you speak to Orlov
about the position, just come home.

949
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,301
Yes.

950
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,272
Yes, I will try to come home.

951
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:15,516
There is one tired boy here
who wants to say good night to you.

952
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,219
It's your papa.

953
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,887
They broke my butterfly.

954
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,189
It's fine.

955
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,161
I will get you another one.

956
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,824
- I have a monarch for you.
- Is that her?

957
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:31,233
Baby, baby, I just got you
a locket with a bathroom.

958
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,432
Hello?

959
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,739
Okay. Let's go sell some Pu.

960
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:42,807
Hey, for a guy who just made a deal,
you look like shit.

961
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,612
Let's go.

962
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,349
I'm back.

963
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,050
Okay, listen. We have a deal.

964
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,958
Eight thousand dollars.
We split it fifty-fifty.

965
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,031
That's not the amount
that we discussed.

966
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,267
All right. Okay, let's make a deal.
Come on, come on.

967
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,167
Take off your shirt and show
them we have a fucking deal.

968
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,309
I don't want to see his tits.
I want to see the plutonium.

969
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,444
If I want to see tits,
I'll call ball girl.

970
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,443
No. You have to see
this thing he has.

971
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,377
It's... Come on, open up. Open up.

972
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:17,485
I think it's important you understand
the ramifications of what is contained...

973
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,120
I think maybe this is too small.

974
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,882
No, I think it's too big.
Now, go pick up some balls.

975
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:25,515
Why don't you do something
with your fucking life?

976
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,286
This?

977
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,698
This is Mr. Way Out?

978
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,528
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Shiv, you shouldn't be here.

979
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,170
What? What'd you call him? Shiv?

980
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:40,399
This is Nephew Shiv?
This is telephone Shiv?

981
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,668
Nephew?

982
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,505
Fuck you. Fuck you.

983
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,907
It's another Shiv.

984
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,876
Right.

985
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,414
Right. I'm the other Shiv.

986
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:53,084
The one in the locket with the little boy.
The picture in the locket.

987
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,416
What's our son? What is Andrei?

988
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,057
Your brother?

989
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,591
It might not be his son.

990
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:02,162
It's mine. It's mine.
Look at the picture. It's mine.

991
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,561
You know, I never hit my first wife.
No, never.

992
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,496
You know what happened?
One day...

993
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,662
...she screwed the guy
who came to fix the satellite dish.

994
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,240
- I'm not his wife.
- Wife, nephew, brother, sister.

995
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,072
Plutonium. Bullshit.

996
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,940
Sir, I just want to make the deal.

997
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,606
There's no fucking deal.

998
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,948
This is Wimbledon,
and you are a Jimmy Connors.

999
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,425
I'm not gonna hit her.

1000
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,572
If you won't hit her, then I will.

1001
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,536
Fuck you. Fuck no. Fuck you.

1002
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,471
You touch her,
you won't get one gram...

1003
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,905
Fuck you.

1004
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,407
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Speak to Starkov like that.

1005
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,640
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1006
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,223
Okay.

1007
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,951
Okay.

1008
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:08,120
New deal.

1009
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,527
New fucking deal.

1010
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:15,494
You give me $10,000 and the girl.

1011
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,730
Or we take our business to Tusk.

1012
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:21,842
Ten thousand grand and the girl.
Final fucking offer. Right?

1013
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,980
- Tim?
- No, Nephew Shiv.

1014
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,842
Here is the deal.

1015
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,415
You give me the fucking money.

1016
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:52,936
Hey.

1017
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,837
Come on. Get in.

1018
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,376
Come on. Get in.

1019
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,208
Come on.

1020
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,381
Where you going?

1021
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,444
- Come on.
- I'm going home.

1022
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,784
We're still in this.
It's all negotiation.

1023
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,458
Come on. Just...

1024
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,224
Look, what about this?
This belongs to you, right?

1025
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,764
Come on.

1026
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,399
Look, he was only gonna give us
$4000. we can do better than that.

1027
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,838
Free-market system.

1028
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:32,811
If you are going in the direction
of a train station...

1029
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,245
...I would appreciate a ride.

1030
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,009
I have a few rubles I can pay you.

1031
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,417
No, keep your rubles.
I'll give you a ride, okay?

1032
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,015
Come.

1033
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,271
How old is your son?

1034
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,911
Tolya is 7.

1035
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,772
Seven.

1036
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,044
Andrei is 6.

1037
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,547
He looks like me.

1038
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,693
You got any pictures?

1039
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,856
No.

1040
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,536
I have one of me and Andrei.

1041
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,366
Oksana, she took it.

1042
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,067
We were at the new McDonald's
on the Arbat.

1043
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,508
Every time
a new McDonald's opens...

1044
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,672
...Drei always has to go see
if the Big Mac stays the same.

1045
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,184
He's a little businessman.

1046
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:51,886
I used your phone
to say good night to my family.

1047
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,354
I don't know what the charges are.

1048
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,036
No charges.

1049
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:07,468
No charges for a man
saying good night to his son.

1050
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:17,015
I know we owe you more,
but it's a start.

1051
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,747
I don't know what kind of deal
Shiv offered you, but it was bullshit.

1052
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,391
- There was no plutonium?
- What plutonium?

1053
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,153
And the thing in the store
with the fire.

1054
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,796
- Uncalled for.
- He started the fire?

1055
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,525
- You're lying.
- And you're an expert on the subject.

1056
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,467
Drop the balls
and you pick them up again.

1057
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,474
A man must separate
business and pleasure.

1058
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,307
She's a beautiful woman,
but beauty can make a man stupid.

1059
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,110
Makes me stupid. I admit it.

1060
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,419
And when we saw
what he did with your dog...

1061
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,215
That beautiful animal.

1062
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,249
What about the dog?

1063
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,430
Chocolate is very bad for dogs.

1064
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:06,568
I think the chocolate was for Oksana.

1065
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,101
Shiv dies...

1066
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,713
...or your boy dies.

1067
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:43,233
- This isn't the way to the train.
- No. No, it's not.

1068
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:47,205
- You said you'd take me to the train.
- And you said this was my lucky day.

1069
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,376
So bring on the luck.

1070
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,536
A hundred grams of luck.

1071
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,180
You don't understand.

1072
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,211
This was a mistake.

1073
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,445
No, you don't fucking understand.

1074
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,078
You don't understand.
I don't have any fucking time to waste.

1075
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:05,124
So why don't you give me
whatever it is you say you have...

1076
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,263
...and I let you be lucky enough
to walk home still breathing.

1077
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,931
Can be your lucky day.

1078
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,032
Or is it bullshit?

1079
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,396
Is that what you have strapped
to yourself? A tube full of bullshit?

1080
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,201
- You should have killed me at the hotel.
- Don't tell me when to kill you.

1081
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,503
- I'm already dead.
- Does your wife and kid know that?

1082
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,705
Or are they waiting for you
to come home with $30,000?

1083
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,675
I can't be around my son
for more than a few hours...

1084
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,787
...without risking every cell
in his body.

1085
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,851
My saliva could kill my wife...

1086
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,084
...in another 10 years.

1087
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,955
My dead body is more dangerous
than anyone you have ever met.

1088
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:45,224
And I have a fucking knife
to your throat.

1089
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:49,899
It's a Gessl, from Gessl of Frankfurt.
They use these to skin moose.

1090
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,469
And I'm a mushroom cloud,
and you have a knife.

1091
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,007
I'm warning you
for the last fucking time.

1092
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,611
- Are warning me...
- Hand the shit over.

1093
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,309
Do it for your kid.

1094
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,581
You do it for your kid.

1095
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,230
For Drei.

1096
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,668
For Andrei.

1097
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,301
I'll tell you
what I will do for Andrei.

1098
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,874
You see that house?

1099
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,940
Your $30,000 is in that house.

1100
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,138
Your $30,000...

1101
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,106
...and my lucky day.

1102
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,555
My lucky day.

1103
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,883
Am I invited to this house?

1104
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,685
To this party with these people?

1105
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,590
No, I wash their cars.

1106
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,558
But for Andrei, I will go,
and I'll knock on the door.

1107
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,633
If they don't open,
I'll jump the fence.

1108
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,066
I'll run across the field.
I'll shake my ass.

1109
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,696
I'll do whatever I have to do
so I can see Andrei tomorrow.

1110
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,840
I'll do that for my son.

1111
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,750
You can stay here and play
with your butterfly if you want.

1112
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,582
You know, we could move
a hundred grams a week, easy.

1113
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,015
Maybe I go back
to Skotoprignomac with you, huh?

1114
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,453
Set things up?

1115
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,785
What do you think?

1116
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,091
First we take this money, okay?

1117
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,422
We go to a beach...

1118
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,657
...take the boys, get some Versace,
get a tan, come back...

1119
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,927
...hit it hard.

1120
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,261
Okay, here we go.

1121
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,866
- Private party.
- Yeah.

1122
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:15,275
I know.
Just call up Tusk and tell him...

1123
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:19,887
...that Shiv is out front
ready with the bean snap.

1124
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:22,679
- You don't have to...
- There's no Shiv on the list.

1125
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,917
I know.
This is what I'm saying, you see?

1126
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,424
I'm probably not on the list.

1127
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:32,295
Just... Okay, just call up to the house
and tell Tusk that Mr. Plutonium...

1128
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,363
...that guy, is out front
knocking on his door.

1129
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,732
Go. Call.

1130
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,170
- Step away from the gate.
- Guys.

1131
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,106
Okay. Look, we're here, okay...

1132
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:49,080
...with 100 grams
of unsullied plutonium...

1133
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,446
...first class,
frequent-flyer quality, baby.

1134
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,980
It's the recipe for teeth.

1135
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:57,922
The Americans, they rub it on their
little dicks, they fuck all night long.

1136
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,253
Make the pussy glow.

1137
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:03,092
Come on. Please. Be a hero, okay?
Be a hero. Call him.

1138
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,327
Yes. Thank you. Okay.

1139
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,062
All right.

1140
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,669
Just tell him we're here.

1141
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,830
You know what the North Koreans
would pay for this?

1142
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,702
You know?

1143
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:17,500
You don't know.

1144
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:19,707
Hey.

1145
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,285
You got a problem here.

1146
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,014
Got a big problem.

1147
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:33,924
Uranium, neptunium, plutonium.

1148
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,995
They came from space.

1149
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,429
Found their way here
by comet and meteorite.

1150
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:42,161
No child ever wished this from a star.

1151
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,671
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl.

1152
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:50,710
Problems with half- lives
40,000 years long.

1153
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,608
All of life.

1154
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:56,217
Time takes half of us away
and comes back later for the rest.

1155
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,944
We are children...

1156
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,020
...and then we are parents.

1157
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,448
We are long division.

1158
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,093
Slowly we decay in to memory.

1159
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,996
Here he comes. Here he comes.

1160
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,825
Yes. Okay. Here it is.

1161
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,230
Around 40,000 years worth,
right here.

1162
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,391
My car is clean?

1163
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:19,068
Yes, but this is the guy I was
telling you about. Timofey Berezin.

1164
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,936
- Where's my money?
- Here's the thing.

1165
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,236
All we have to do
is give him $30,000, right?

1166
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:25,811
No, no, no.
We don't give him money. Please...

1167
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:29,178
No. It's just at the beginning.
Then we get our money back later...

1168
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,943
...from the North Koreans.

1169
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,213
Look, no. This is him.
This is the seven-minute french fry.

1170
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,947
Remember? He is money.

1171
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,786
No, he is not the money.
This is the money, you know?

1172
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,894
- Show him, please.
- And this is the money.

1173
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,552
Please, please show him.

1174
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,289
Show him.

1175
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,941
So you have something for me?

1176
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:10,455
I have nothing.

1177
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,816
You have nothing?

1178
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,662
So, what, he was lying
about the plutonium?

1179
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,827
I think he just wanted
to come to the party.

1180
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,314
Get your dead friend out of my sight.
We have to park cars here.

1181
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,678
Come on.

1182
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,016
Who are you?

1183
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,522
It's not important who I am.

1184
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,754
You are not Shiv.

1185
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,559
- Shiv is gone.
- Wait, didn't l...?

1186
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:03,670
Yes, I spoke to you before,
when you were not important also.

1187
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,432
Something about the deal
with Starkov and Shiv.

1188
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,074
I have to get to the train.

1189
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:14,011
So, what are you doing getting
a package out of Tusk's car, huh?

1190
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:15,708
It's for my son.

1191
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:20,514
So I'm supposed to believe that your
son keeps a package in Tusk's car?

1192
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,655
Where is this son you speak of?

1193
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,351
Hey.

1194
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:29,054
- I think you should come back here.
- He's not listening.

1195
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,461
In the end, everything decays to lead.

1196
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,727
Number 82 on the periodic table.

1197
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,599
- Give me the package.
- Why won't you tell us...

1198
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:40,764
...what's in the package?
- I need to go home.

1199
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,604
All of the brilliant things
born in the center of stars...

1200
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:46,110
...will have turned cold and gray.

1201
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,112
You keep walking that way,
my friend...

1202
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:51,150
...I promise you will not
make it to the train station.

1203
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,855
Everything is moving
in that direction.

1204
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,957
Are you going to look for Shiv?

1205
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,025
Toward lead.

1206
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,989
Listen to me. Stop.

1207
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:04,597
Impossible to stop.

1208
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,290
Check his pockets.

1209
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:40,198
Vlad, there's something
underneath his shirt.

1210
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,805
What is that?

1211
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,089
Look.

1212
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,827
A butterfly.

1213
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,365
I find them very upsetting,
butterflies.

1214
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:33,412
No wonder our guy
was out buying butterflies.

1215
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,047
See?

1216
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,823
Bad judgment.

1217
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:42,258
Fucking cocaine thinking.

1218
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,732
Long night.

1219
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,007
Harsh blow.

1220
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,847
It's bullshit.

1221
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,511
We can't give this to Starkov.

1222
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:48,819
What I would like
is two tickets to Costa Rica...

1223
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:53,059
...and $50,000 compensation.
- But no plutonium is missing.

1224
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:54,922
Only your husband is missing.

1225
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:59,726
Then you have nothing to fear from
a badge or a contaminated watch...

1226
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:04,064
...showing exposure
of up to 1000 rems.

1227
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:08,909
Now, I am told that the plutonium
in this facility has its own signature...

1228
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,568
...and can be traced.

1229
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,878
But if, as you say,
there is no plutonium missing...

1230
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:20,384
...then it will not concern you when
an autopsy in some faraway place...

1231
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:23,718
...reveals that my husband's body
is so toxic...

1232
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:27,189
...that it must be entombed in lead.

1233
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:31,321
Perhaps we could arrange a meeting
in St. Petersburg with your husband...

1234
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:34,400
...and a severance package
could be discussed in person.

1235
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,838
I said St. Petersburg.

1236
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:41,406
Maybe I mean London.

1237
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:44,169
Or maybe New York.

1238
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,841
I think I have made myself clear.

1239
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:53,715
What about a confession...

1240
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:57,790
...stating that your husband stole
100 grams of plutonium...

1241
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:02,429
...and that it was safely recovered
by officials from this facility?

1242
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:08,397
And what about you send it to me
in Costa Rica?

1243
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,564
Thank you for your time.

1244
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:46,173
At some point,
things stop hurting.

1245
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,506
And from inside the jar...

1246
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:50,735
...with eyes that see
in all directions...

1247
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:55,045
...maybe it is possible
to look into the future...

1248
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:57,747
...well beyond the pins...

1249
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:02,149
...to where the compass in your head
tells you that you need to go.

1250
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,754
Past the fields and fences...

1251
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:08,020
...and the flowers.

1252
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:09,021
