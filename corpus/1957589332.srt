00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,621

00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,272
What's going on?

46
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:13,514
Emily:Well, kind of been
going down that path.

47
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,151
I was an actor in New York.

48
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,177
Amy:Well, yeah of course.

49
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,275
You were doing that in
high school and stuff.

50
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,050
Emily:Yeah, yeah. So I
continued it in New York.

51
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:24,656
That's over now so I was happy to be back.

52
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,696
Amy:Were you like on
Broadway and stuff like that?

53
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,839
Emily:Um, I didn't quite
make it that far, but -

54
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,820
(laughing)

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,783
Amy:Oh whatever.

56
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,484
Emily:Oh my God. We have to hang out

57
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:33,751
all the time and catch up.

58
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,820
Amy:I know. I know. Um, are
you available right now?

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,142
Are you open?

60
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,241
Emily:Um, yeah well I
just got back a week ago,

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,794
and I've just been
trying to get acclimated.

62
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,297
So, it's so good to see a familiar face.

63
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,872
Amy:I know. I know. I'm so glad.

64
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,033
And you e-mailed me your number.

65
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,221

00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,335
(phone ringing)

67
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:49,643
Emily:No. No problem. You're busy.

Hello? Thanks for holding.

90
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,627
Hello? I can't - I can't hear you.

91
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,623
Hello?

92
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,737
(thud)

93
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:42,246
(moving papers around)

94
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:42,751
(music)

95
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:43,726
(squeaking chair)

96
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:06,698
(flipping through book)

97
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,301
Amy:Oh, ow.

98
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,833
Do you know who I saw a year ago?

99
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:23,030
Emily:Who?

100
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,354
Amy:Coach Jared.

101
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,288
Emily:Wait, how do I know that name?

102
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:28,868
Amy:B-ball baby.

103
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,220
Emily:I knew it.

104
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,570
Oh my God. What is he doing?

105
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,102
Amy:Well, not saying b-ball baby anymore.

106
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:35,975
Remember he used to say that.

107
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,824
Amy & Emily:It's b-ball baby.

108
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,684
(laughing)

109
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:40,909
Amy:It was so cute.

110
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:42,995
Like, thinking about it
now it was really, really

111
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:45,551
cheesy, but that was so cool.

112
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,612
It got me so -

113
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:47,089
Emily:Pumped.

114
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:47,961
Amy:It got me so excited.

115
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:48,520
Emily:Yes.

116
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,417
Amy:And I was like,
"Yes, it is b-ball baby."

117
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,563
Yes.

118
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:52,524
(laughing)

119
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,540
It was so fun.

120
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,332
Emily:Oh my God.

121
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,783
I have not played since I left.

122
00:04:58,326 --> 00:04:59,518
Amy:Yeah, same here.

123
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,066
I'd be really rusty.

124
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,489
Emily:Me too.

125
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,304
Amy:But he's kind of lost his damn mind.

126
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,407
So, I feel like we
should practice a little,

127
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,855
call him up and be like -

128
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,211
Emily:Are you crazy?

129
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,266
Amy:Am I crazy?

130
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,562
Emily:Watch us play?

131
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,415
Amy:Get those gym shorts out.

132
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,477
Get your water bottle.

133
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:20,383
(music)

134
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:29,982
(shuffling papers)

135
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,759
(closing drawer)

136
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,599
(people talking)

137
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,634
Amy:Down it girl.

138
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,697
Emily:Yeah.

139
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,308
Uh-oh.

140
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,778
Amy:I'm going to do my Emily impression.

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,045
(laughing)

142
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,619
It's you. You're so serious.

143
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,127
Emily:And I'm going to
do Emily's boyfriend

144
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,740
impression just grab your ass.

145
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:48,654
(laughing)

146
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,103
Amy:Stick into the back pocket.

147
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:50,735
(laughing)

148
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:51,652
Emily:Yes.

149
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,163
Amy:Looking for spare change.

150
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,909
Emily:I know. (laughing)

151
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,475
(laughing)

152
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,665
Oh, those days.

153
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,164
Amy:You look really good.

154
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:02,998
Emily:Awe, thanks lady.

155
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:04,029
So, do you.

156
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:06,391
Amy:Well thanks. You do though.

157
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:07,744
You're so pretty.

158
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:09,707
Emily:Girl you got rhythm.

159
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,187
Amy:This song is so good.

160
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,322
Emily:Too bad I took my heels off because

161
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,437
I used to be taller than you.

162
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,504
Amy:I know. This is natural though.

163
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,652
Emily:Oh yea.

164
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,389
Amy:Hey you want to take a nap?

165
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,842
Emily:Okay, I'll take a nap.

166
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,372
Amy:Let's take a nap. There we go.

167
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:25,370
Emily:Oh man, I wish like
Boyz II Men was playing

168
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,123
or like K-Ci and JoJo.

169
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:28,067
Amy:Oh my gosh.

170
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,552
Emily:Then it'd be real.

171
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:32,908
Amy:This is real baby.
This is real right here.

172
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,288
Emily:Then it'd be perfect.

173
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,927
(laughing)

174
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,875
Oh that's right. Sorry. We got too close.

175
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:41,945
Amy:Oh gosh.

176
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,365
Emily:Hands on the collarbones.

177
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:45,056
(laughing)

178
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,316
Amy:And then there was this.

179
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:49,612
Emily:Oh yeah. (laughing)

180
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:50,752
Like all of a sudden you're like,

181
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,528
"But I don't want to
be that close to you."

182
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,199
Amy:I feel your boner.

183
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,980
(laughing)

184
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,439
And it's weird.

185
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,637
Emily:And it's weird.

186
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,452
Luckily we won't have
that problem tonight.

187
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,353
Amy:Oh gosh I thought
[unintelligible]. Sorry.

188
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,637
(laughing)

189
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:08,411
Emily:Okay. (laughing)

190
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:18,143
(light music)

191
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,398
(phone vibrating)

192
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,693
(phone vibrating)

193
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:22,582
(phone vibrating)

194
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,742
(phone vibrating)

195
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,478
(phone vibrating)

196
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,461
(phone vibrating)

197
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,654
(phone vibrating)

198
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,741
(phone vibrating)

199
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,658
(phone vibrating)

200
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,630
(phone vibrating)

201
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,617
(phone vibrating)

202
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,605
(phone vibrating)

203
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:57,321
(light music)

204
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:00,299
Amy:Oh. Hey.

205
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,203
Emily:What?

206
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:02,714
Amy:Baby called.

207
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,194
Emily:33 missed calls?

208
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,662
(sighs)

209
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:20,907
(birds)

210
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,936
It's just amazing because
it's just like we're

211
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,528
best friends all over
again after being best

212
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,411
friends 10 years ago.

213
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,372
Charlie:Okay, that's great.

214
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:33,774
Listen, I know you ignored my phone call.

215
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,120
Emily:What?

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,856
Charlie:Because I called
and it only rang twice.

217
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,092
Emily:So?

218
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,865
Charlie:So that means you pressed ignore.

219
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,831
You ignored Charlie's phone call.

220
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:43,825
Emily:I did not.

221
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:44,840
Charlie:Yes, you did.

222
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,043
Poor Charlie, sitting
at home in my underwear,

223
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,324
doing nothing, had nobody to play with.

224
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:51,578
Emily:Babe, we were just out having fun.

225
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:52,948
Charlie:I called you like 33 times.

226
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,591
I don't care if you were having fun.

227
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,928
I was scared. I was nervous.

228
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,510
I don't know. Maybe -

229
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,757
We're close to the ocean,
maybe you could have -

230
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,680
Maybe some Somalian
pirates docked you know

231
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,429
and they took you hostage.

232
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,878
How am I supposed to know?

233
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,084
I'm sorry. I just -

234
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,637
I'm glad you met your
friend again. That's good.

235
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,022
(kiss)

236
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:32,585
(light music)

237
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,826
Emily:Baby, can you put
this one on the top one?

238
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,445
Charlie:Yeah, of course.

239
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,164
That's what you keep me around for, huh?

240
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,592
Emily:And this one too?

241
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:43,193
Charlie:For, uh, the
high shelf and changing

242
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:44,192
the light bulbs.

243
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,293
Emily:That's true.

244
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,824
(kiss)

245
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:47,656
Charlie:Our house is coming together.

246
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:48,605
Emily:I know.

247
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:49,534
Charlie:I love it.

248
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,708
Emily:I love it too.

249
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,226
Charlie:Wish it wasn't
light blue, but uh -

250
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,145
Emily:(laughing) We can always paint it.

251
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,878
Charlie:I'm not painting it.

252
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,614
I'm way too lazy for that.

253
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,139
Emily:You'll get over it.

254
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,121
At least we have a house right?

255
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:04,724
Charlie:Yeah.

256
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,204
Emily:I never thought I'd say that.

257
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,712
Charlie:You've got to thank
your dad for that one.

258
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:08,632
Jesus.

259
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:09,652
Emily:I know.

260
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:13,556
Charlie:Um, so Amy, tell me about Amy.

261
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,813
Amy:Who's Amy? I'm Amy.

262
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:28,861
I live with my dad, still, after 26 years.

263
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:33,286
(light music)

264
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm an artist.

265
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:43,287
I sell my art, and my dad is a historian.

266
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,801
He loves history of everything.

267
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:55,822
He knows the history of
our neighbors, ancestors.

268
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,667
He knows the history of
the school down the street.

269
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:06,126
He knows everything about everything.

270
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:12,476
And he definitely knows the
history of me and Emily.

271
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:18,167
(light music)

272
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:24,281
I remember seeing Emily
in class and not knowing

273
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:28,859
who she was, and it was
art class and we had

274
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:38,278
to draw our pets and she
felt really awkward because

275
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,570
she didn't have any pet to draw.

276
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:46,216
And, you know, I told her
that she could, she could

277
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:53,684
draw my cat Lady who
had run away and when I

278
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:58,392
described what she
looked like Emily drew it

279
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:04,286
so perfectly it looked just
like her and that's when

280
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:05,836
we became friends.

281
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,499
She kind of brought my cat back.

282
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:17,119
(light music)

283
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:24,798
I remember Mrs. Allen,
she would get so mad at

284
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,977
us though because we
started to draw these really

285
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:34,527
really graphic stupid things
on the side when we were

286
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:38,544
supposed to be working
on our planet project

287
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:42,195
and we really just did
not want to draw planets.

288
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:46,554
We wanted to draw funny,
gross things in our little

289
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:52,509
journals, and we would
be laughing so hard.

290
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,574
We would be crying and
shaking and we'd get

291
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,234
in so much trouble.

292
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,170
I mean really, who is Emily?

293
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:07,987
Who is she now?

294
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:16,867
(siren)

295
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:34,289
(light music)

296
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:40,037
(street sounds)

297
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:47,693
(light music)

298
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,763
Emily:You know what my mom told me about

299
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,775
Bank of America?

300
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,900
Amy:Hmm?

301
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:52,300
Emily:Well, first of all
you know how they got

302
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,199
bailed out?

303
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,784
Amy:Mm-hmm.

304
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,953
Emily:So, they got
bailed out but still only

305
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:58,031
pay their tellers like
$8.00 an hour, something

306
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:59,076
like really low.

307
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:03,124
Then, they found this
loophole where the health

308
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,889
insurance that their
employees get is the Husky

309
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:11,034
Program in Connecticut
so it's tax payer funded.

310
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,480
So Bank of America found a way to not pay

311
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,562
for their employee's health insurance.

312
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,946
Like the taxpayers are paying for it.

313
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:19,115
Amy:Are you serious?

314
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,005
Emily:Yeah, so my mom's union, she works

315
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,190
for the State of Connecticut
for the Education

316
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,046
Department.

317
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:24,576
Amy:Right.

318
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:26,395
Emily:Her union is like,
they're all getting together

319
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,707
and they're like withdraw
your accounts from

320
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,023
Bank of America.

321
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,683
My mom's like, "Well,
Bank of America always

322
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,649
worked for me, but ..."

323
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:37,047
Like, knowing that makes me sick.

324
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,156
You know?

325
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,566
Amy:Oh my God.

326
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,221
Emily:It's just like the
things that are going on now -

327
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,419
And these companies that
got bailed out, there's

328
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,669
no what's the word?

329
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,155
Restriction or -

330
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,194
Well there's like no
restrictions on them at all.

331
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:54,684
No rules. They can just
do whatever they want.

332
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:56,109
They can find loopholes everywhere.

333
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,401
It's really frustrating.

334
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:08,978
(light music)

335
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:20,462
(fire)

336
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,370
I mean it's tough. Local
elections are tough.

337
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,256
Not a lot of people vote.

338
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,477
Amy:That's true.

339
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,057
Emily:But you know it makes me think that

340
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:30,331
now that I'm back here,
maybe that was kind of

341
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:33,166
a sign that I saw that today.

342
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,793
Because it's like the
first thing since I've

343
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:36,917
been back that really inspired me and like

344
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:41,282
if this is where I've chosen
to live then I should be

345
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:45,780
involved, and yeah the
acting thing didn't work out

346
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,582
but I can be passionate
about something else.

347
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:52,196
And there's just so much
going on in this country

348
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:55,188
right now that it's like
why not start locally?

349
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:59,143
Amy:Well, okay. Would you be interested

350
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:00,550
in working for my dad?

351
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:02,707
Emily:Your dad?

352
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:03,283
Amy:Yeah.

353
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:04,442
Emily:Wait, at the museum?

354
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,993
Amy:Yeah. Yeah.

355
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:09,421
I think I could totally
land you a job there.

356
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:10,633
Now, I don't know -

357
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,093
I feel really bad that I didn't think

358
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:14,810
of this sooner, but I think
they're definitely looking

359
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,592
for an intern and a paid intern probably.

360
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:19,758
Emily:Really?

361
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,741
Amy:Yeah.

362
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,341
Absolutely. I'll let him know.

363
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,056
I mean I can't promise anything, but I'm

364
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,780
pretty sure that they're looking for that.

365
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,766
I mean that would be a
really great opportunity

366
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,817
for just being involved
in something that isn't so

367
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:36,682
corporate or something
stale like working at

368
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:37,982
a grocery store.

369
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:39,323
You know?

370
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:53,052
(fire crackling)

371
00:16:53,052 --> 00:17:01,342
(light music)

372
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,452
Dad:So, this painting
behind you by Childe Hassam,

373
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:07,398
he's an example of an
American impressionist.

374
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,401
So, he's painting at the
same time that Cezanne,

375
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,243
Degas, Monet, Manet, all
those people are painting

376
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:19,192
in Europe, but he painted
at the Isles of Shoals.

377
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,908
You know Appledore Island out there and

378
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,393
Celia Thaxter had that artist colony and

379
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:25,904
that's a particularly beautiful one.

380
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:29,826
My brother bought it in
Boston, gave it to my mother

381
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,622
and she died 20 years ago.

382
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,661
She was the founder of the
Rye Historical Society.

383
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,941
So, he let me have it to bring it up here.

384
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:41,564
And it's served many
purposes up here, but it just

385
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:42,715
reminds me though, losing my mother the

386
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:47,964
Society almost died after
she died in the early 90s

387
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,850
and then Bonnie Goodwin
who is a charter member of

388
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,969
the Society -

389
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,904
This picture was taken in '85.

390
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:57,410
She and I kind of worked
together and we just kept

391
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,180
plugging away, did a few
programs in the library,

392
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,666
and then finally this
building became available

393
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,717
and it was from like 1995.

394
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,890
Got moved in '97 over here
and it finally opened in

395
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,929
'02.

396
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:15,137
So, it took me seven years
from the first idea that we

397
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,001
were going to get it
until we actually opened.

398
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:19,420
But she oversaw the
whole thing, you know and

399
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,056
got the people to come in and do the work

400
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,219
and what a difference that made.

401
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:27,375
But then we lost her
early. She was only 66.

402
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,605
About five years ago and then her husband

403
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:33,362
who was a big help to us, he died in '08

404
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,616
and then we lost our
treasurer and our secretary.

405
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,031
So, we need you Emily.

406
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:38,900
Emily:Oh gosh. Okay.

407
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,438
Dad:We need you because there's -

408
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,770
You know, so -

409
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,031
So, how do you think you could help us?

410
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,684
Emily:Well, I'm very good in the office.

411
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:46,388
Dad:Good.

412
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:49,084
Emily:Good, I can type 50 words a minute.

413
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:49,924
Dad:Okay.

414
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,911
Emily:And I know Excel
and Word and Outlook,

415
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:55,458
and so I definitely am good at data entry

416
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,310
so if that's what you're
looking for, like I'm great

417
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,076
at that.

418
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,856
Dad:We have a special
software called Past Perfect,

419
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,000
which is unique for museums.

420
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:04,978
So, if you know how to
do all that then you can

421
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,461
learn how to do this.

422
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:07,713
Emily:Okay. Okay great.

423
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,826
Dad:Because I'm a Luddite.

424
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,004
I just send e-mails and
write Word documents,

425
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:14,101
but that's why we need somebody who

426
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,895
could go in and -

427
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,170
I can actually pull it up on the computer,

428
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,457
but to actually scan
things in and organize it

429
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:25,040
and you have to put session numbers and

430
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,671
all this stuff, you know.

431
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,085
Emily:All right.

432
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:28,940
Dad:I don't know, but you'll figure it out

433
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,468
and there are a lot of
resource people to call upon

434
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,631
to do it.

435
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,874
Emily:Oh good. Okay.

436
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:34,819
Dad:Anyway.

437
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:35,813
Emily:Thanks.

438
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:36,750
Dad:I'm just trying to think.

439
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,730
Yeah, this is just
business stuff and then -

440
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,575
Yeah, I've got to clean up the mess.

441
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:43,111
(laughing)

442
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,588
(footsteps)

443
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,099
(opening fridge)

444
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:11,005
(pouring)

445
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,481
Dad:So, we thought it
would be cool when people

446
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,631
came into the museum if
they would have something

447
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:52,565
interesting to see rather
than just that logo

448
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:53,486
over there.

449
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:56,758
So, we have this wonderful
old cradle, and you can

450
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:59,179
tell that somebody has,
for a long time, been using

451
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,378
their foot because this is so worn.

452
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:05,081
So, they could sit and
read, talk and rock the baby

453
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:08,529
by just going like this
and came from a house

454
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,516
right up here so that's
got real Rye significance

455
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:13,079
and these dolls came
from Rye in the 1800s.

456
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,451
So we've got the cradle
thing, you know birth,

457
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:16,923
beginning of life and then we thought

458
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:19,094
well what the hell, cradle to grave.

459
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:24,383
This is the entry gate
to one of the old 60 plus

460
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,872
graveyards of Rye, and
Louise Tolman one of our

461
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:31,879
great town historical workers
she rescued it from this

462
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,272
falling down graveyard
and I don't know how.

463
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,178
She must have pushed it end over end,

464
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,545
got it into somebody's
barn and then my wife

465
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:42,686
and I rescued it and we
got it to our place and she

466
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,880
oiled it up and I got my carpenter friend

467
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,277
and we put it up here.

468
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:47,040
Emily:Wow.

469
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,597
Dad:So, you come in and in this museum

470
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:50,261
you're going to get everything
from cradle to grave.

471
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,055
(laughing)

472
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:59,024
Charlie:Hey. Hi. Yeah. No
I'm just having a glass

473
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:00,063
of water.

474
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,492
What are you doing?

475
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,778
Cool.

476
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,594
Where's Dad at?

477
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,049
Oh. (laughing)

478
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:17,472
That's good. I guess you
know we should all be

479
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,149
on the diabetes diet.

480
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:23,974
No, she's out.

481
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,149
Yeah. She's -

482
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,912
Well she's at her new job.

483
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,427
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

484
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:35,136
Yeah she's got this friend
Amy, her dad hired her.

485
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,444
He works at a museum.

486
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:38,441
Yeah, I don't know.

487
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,502
I'm not going to work at
the same place she does.

488
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,751
No.

489
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,325
That's ridiculous.

490
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,588
I don't think I'd get sick
of her, but I just think

491
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:48,724
it would be weird.

492
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:51,911
Uh, God.

493
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:54,073
Listen, no. It's fine.

494
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:56,500
I have some money saved up anyway.

495
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:57,679
I -

496
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,776
Before we left I went to Atlantic City.

497
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:05,328
I took my last $100 and I
made $300 so I have $400.

498
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,403
So I'm not worried for
the next week or two.

499
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:11,860
Things are cheaper here anyway.

500
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:15,008
Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:16,151
I know. I know. I'm going to get a job.

502
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:18,482
Anyway, hey, hey.

503
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,436
I've got to go.

504
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:23,811
There's this light bulb's
making a weird noise

505
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:28,756
above me. Yeah. I'm going to try to fix it

506
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:31,325
before Emily gets home.

507
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,491
Yeah, this house, I tell
you what, this house

508
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:35,571
is beautiful but it gives
me the heebie jeebies.

509
00:23:45,386 --> 00:24:14,156
(light music)

510
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:24,675
(chair creaking)

511
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:34,447
(phone vibrating)

512
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:39,647
Emily:Hey. Yeah, good. How are you?

513
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:42,869
Good, thanks yeah I'm still here.

514
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:47,693
Um, I'm probably going
out with Amy tonight.

515
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:52,515
Yeah. Well there's stuff in the fridge.

516
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,293
Okay, well I'm at work
so I should go. Okay?

517
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,541
All right. Yeah, love you too. Bye.

518
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,713
Amy:Hello?

519
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:32,053
Hey. How's it going?

520
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:34,989
Emily:Good. Uh, what are we doing tonight?

521
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,565
Amy:Um, I'll be out -

522
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:39,205
I'll be out in a little bit.

523
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:40,700
You want to meet me down here?

524
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,076
We'll go to the Pressroom or something.

525
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:44,508
Emily:Oh, okay. Yeah, that's great.

526
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:46,567
Okay, what time?

527
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,260
Perfect.

528
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,426
Amy:All right. I'll see you later.

529
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:54,072
Okay, bye.

530
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:01,351
Dad:So Emily how are things going?

531
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:02,990
Emily:Oh, pretty good thanks.

532
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,230
Dad:Good. Good.

533
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,518
Emily:Yeah.

534
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,345
Dad:Oh, burnt house.

535
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:08,848
(laughing)

536
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,527
Yeah, we document everything in Rye.

537
00:26:13,262 --> 00:26:14,327
Emily:Amazing.

538
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,650
Dad:Yeah.

539
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,061
She's the head of the
friends of the library

540
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:21,109
and so she tore that
house down after it burned

541
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:24,195
and built a beautiful bigger house.

542
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,564
(laughing)

543
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:28,525
Emily:Jeeze. Wow. That's huge.

544
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,702
Dad:Yeah.

545
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:30,826
Emily:I can't believe
she built a bigger house.

546
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,314
Dad:Yeah, that's on the
most exclusive road in town.

547
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,394
Sea Road.

548
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:37,953
(laughing)

549
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,160
Emily:I got it.

550
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,545
This is my house.

551
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,114
(footsteps)

552
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:47,782
Oh my God. I have to take these heels off.

553
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:48,634
Amy:Let me get them.

554
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:49,861
Emily:Oh thank you.

555
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:50,940
Amy:Let me get it.

556
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,597
Emily:Don't fall.

557
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:54,909
No, I got the other one.
I got the other one.

558
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:55,890
Just go ahead.

559
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,400
Go ahead. Okay.

560
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,067
(thud)

561
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:12,003
(light music)

562
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:20,213
(creaking floor)

563
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:35,020
(light music)

564
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,345
Charlie:Oh, hey. Hi. Um, I'm sorry.

565
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,261
Did I wake you up?

566
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,887
Amy:No, no. Just heading out.

567
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,478
Charlie:Oh okay. You're Amy right?

568
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,212
Amy:Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:47,762
Charlie:Amy, hi.

570
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:48,563
Amy:Hey.

571
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:49,273
Charlie:Charlie.

572
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:50,218
Amy:Charlie, nice to meet you.

573
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,355
Charlie:Yeah. Nice to meet you too.

574
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,934
Amy:Great. I'm sure I'll see you again.

575
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,645
Charlie:Would you like mint tea?

576
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:58,135
Amy:No, I'm set. Thank
you though. Appreciate it.

577
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,911
Charlie:We have coffee or -

578
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,655
Amy:I'm all set. Thank you. I'm good.

579
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,602
Charlie:Well, drive safe.

580
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,226
Emily:I'm going to kill myself.

581
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,385
Charlie:Don't do that.

582
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:21,084
Emily:Will you rub my head, babe?

583
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,463
Charlie:Yeah, sure.

584
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,892
Emily:Why do I do this to myself?

585
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:28,209
Charlie:You're a boozehound.

586
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:29,792
Emily:(groan)

587
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:30,815
(kiss)

588
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:34,492
Emily:Where's Amy?

589
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,883
Charlie:Oh you mean
that weirdo that darted

590
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,792
out of here the minute she saw me?

591
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:41,177
Emily:You're talking very loudly.

592
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:42,374
Charlie:Sorry.

593
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,496
(laughing)

594
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:46,369
She left at like 8:30 or something.

595
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:49,833
Emily:Wait was she weird? What happened?

596
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,364
Charlie:I lost my page.

597
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,348
Emily:You're supposed
to be rubbing my head.

598
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:56,229
Charlie:Oh, sorry. Okay. Here you go.

599
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:57,587
Emily:Thank you.

600
00:28:57,587 --> 00:28:59,543
Charlie:No, I don't know.

601
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,806
I just was like, I asked
if she wanted some tea

602
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,183
and she like threw her
clothes on and left.

603
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,494
Emily:Oh, well she probably
felt as shitty as I do.

604
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:11,786
Charlie:Yeah, I thought
maybe she was embarassed

605
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,226
I was in my skivvies.

606
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,692
(laughing)

607
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,346
(jumping)

608
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:21,954
(panting)

609
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:22,928
(belch)

610
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,888
Emily:Oh my God.

611
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:24,465
Charlie:Don't puke.

612
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,638
Emily:That's Chinese.

613
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:30,547
(panting and jumping)

614
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:31,984
Charlie:Is it better to go slow?

615
00:29:32,193 --> 00:29:33,773
Emily:Go at your pace.

616
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,347
I mean you go your own pace.

617
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:38,780
(laughing)

618
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,218
(panting)

619
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:47,896
(jumping)

620
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:50,225
Charlie:See, all it
takes is like ten minutes

621
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:53,556
of missionary position and that would have

622
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,257
been a better workout.

623
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:56,102
Been a lot more fun.

624
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,317
Emily:(negative sound)

625
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:57,874
Charlie:Yeah.

626
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,307
Emily:We would not burn
this many calories.

627
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,632
Charlie:Want a bet?

628
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:03,024
We could - Come on.

629
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,414
Emily:I'm getting a cramp.

630
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,642
Charlie:Yeah, me too.

631
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:11,260
(footsteps)

632
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:18,453
Charlie:Here you go.

633
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:19,446
Emily:Thank you.

634
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:21,795
Emily:Hey.

635
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,638
Charlie:Oh, how embarrassing.

636
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:28,202
Emily:Okay, to our new house.

637
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:30,831
Charlie:Our new house, which we still need

638
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,702
to christen with sweet love.

639
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:35,497
Emily:That's what this is for.

640
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:36,387
Charlie:That's what this -

641
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:37,844
(laughing)

642
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:38,757
Perfect.

643
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,718
You have to be drunk to
make sweet love to me?

644
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,311
Emily:You know that's not true.

645
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,244
(laughing)

646
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,306
Emily:All right, and our future.

647
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,214
Okay, we're drinking.

648
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:47,710
Charlie:I'm drinking.
I already got started.

649
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,991
Emily:Ah, New Hampshire wine.

650
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:54,770
Charlie:Yeah, it's good.

651
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,248
Emily:Not bad. Could get used to it.

652
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:58,760
Charlie:Yeah.

653
00:30:59,017 --> 00:30:59,730
(laughing)

654
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,207
Think we're going to be here for a while?

655
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:03,494
Emily:I don't know. What do you think?

656
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,716
Charlie:I don't know. I hope so.

657
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,703
I like it. It's nice.

658
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,602
Emily:Good.

659
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,222
Charlie:I think I should
become a sailor or something.

660
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,650
Emily:Yeah.

661
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,794
Charlie:Wouldn't that be cool?

662
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:13,306
(laughing)

663
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,538
I don't think I could do any
actual, like manly sailing,

664
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:19,228
but maybe if I did
something like with a whale

665
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,930
watching tour guide or something.

666
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,740
Emily:Oh, that'd be so cute.

667
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,474
(kiss)

668
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:25,415
Charlie:Don't be so sensitve.

669
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:26,743
Emily:Your a little whale watcher.

670
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,454
Charlie:Yeah.

671
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,459
(sighs)

672
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,755
Emily:I can't believe we own a house.

673
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:36,713
Charlie:Yeah. I know.
We are going to be in a

674
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:40,625
lot of debt, if the bank
doesn't take it away

675
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,293
from us before we finish unpacking.

676
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,362
Emily:My dad took care of a lot of it.

677
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,658
Charlie:I know.

678
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:48,620
That was really nice of him.

679
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:58,653
Well, your mom said when
we were leaving their

680
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:01,941
place, she was asking me about grandkids.

681
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,313
Emily:Oh yeah?

682
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:04,339
Charlie:Yeah.

683
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,358
Emily:Of course she was.

684
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:07,374
Charlie:Yeah. She definitely wants some.

685
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,317
(laughing)

686
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:11,505
Emily:In our own time mom.

687
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,584
Charlie:I know that's what I was thinking.

688
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:15,717
We can practice right?

689
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,080
(laughing)

690
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,829
Emily:Yeah.

691
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:25,576
(kissing)

692
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,813
Thanks for coming here with me.

693
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:30,948
Charlie:Of course.

694
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,665
Thanks for sticking by me.

695
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:38,361
(laughing)

696
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:43,745
I'm just a jobless outdoor stage crewman.

697
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:46,719
(laughing)

698
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,343
Emily:Who I love very much.

699
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:50,461
Charlie:What the hell kind of job am I

700
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:51,481
going to get?

701
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,658
Emily:I don't know. The future is yours.

702
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,359
Charlie:Yeah, I guess so.

703
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,633
Emily:A whole new place, a whole new plan.

704
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:03,263
Charlie:To the future.

705
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,609
To the future.

706
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,732
I wish we were European.
We'd be so much cooler.

707
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:09,780
Emily:I know.

708
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:19,753
[unintelligible].

709
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,802
Amy:Please. Thank you
very much. Please do.

710
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,102
What were you saying?

711
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:31,324
Emily:Oh, I was going
to say you met Charlie

712
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:32,945
at my house the other day?

713
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:37,696
Amy:Yeah, I guess. Kind
of an informal meet.

714
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:39,708
Emily:I should have probably warned you.

715
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:44,076
Amy:No. Oh no I mean I knew he like -

716
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,793
I mean I heard someone
clearing their throat

717
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,053
and moving around and
it clearly was not you.

718
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:52,926
Emily:I'm sorry I put
you in that position.

719
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:57,321
Amy:Oh, I didn't mind.
I just felt bad because

720
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,966
I was hopping out in my
wifebeater without my bra.

721
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:03,072
(laughing)

722
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:04,383
Emily:Well you probably
didn't expect a guy to be

723
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:06,252
in the house, so I'm sorry about that.

724
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:07,707
Amy:No, I didn't mind.

725
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:09,841
It was actually very funny.

726
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,152
Emily:Okay.

727
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:13,819
Amy:More so afterwards
when I'd had a coffee.

728
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:15,034
Emily:Okay.

729
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,262
Amy:Why do I have to keep processing which

730
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,378
number is bigger?

731
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:18,533
What is going on with me?

732
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:20,121
Emily:Hopefully he was cordial.

733
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:21,642
Amy:He was.

734
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:22,663
Emily:Not too -

735
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:23,927
Amy:He offered me tea or something.

736
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:25,013
Emily:Oh he did?

737
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,100
Amy:Yeah, it was really sweet.

738
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,721
Emily:Good. I was hoping he wouldn't get

739
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:30,585
like neurotic or anything.

740
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:31,823
(laughing)

741
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:32,996
Amy:Well he seemed -

742
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:35,394
I felt that because I
had to scoot out of there

743
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:39,124
and he was just, he was funny.

744
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,669
He seems like a nervous guy.

745
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:41,839
(laughing)

746
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,273
Emily:He's nervous yeah.

747
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,293
Amy:He's cute.

748
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,294
Emily:That's a good word for it.

749
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,536
Amy:How long have you guys been together?

750
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:51,001
Emily:Oh God, like two years.

751
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,405
Amy:Wow. That's a long time.

752
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:55,601
Emily:I think he's doing okay up here.

753
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:56,913
Amy:Yeah?

754
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,574
Emily:Yeah, I don't think
it really mattered to him

755
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:03,140
where we lived, but I don't know.

756
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:05,556
He just got a job the
other day so I think that

757
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:06,445
will help.

758
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,620
Amy:Yeah, that's good.

759
00:35:08,978 --> 00:35:12,312
Emily:Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.

760
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:16,961
So, is everything okay with him lately?

761
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:20,129
Amy:Mm-hmm. He's good.

762
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,471
Emily:Good.

763
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,854
Amy:He really likes you a lot.

764
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:24,242
Emily:Good.

765
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:26,838
Amy:He was talking and he was like -

766
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:30,157
He's like she's just so grown up.

767
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:32,906
I'm like well yeah it's been 10 years.

768
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,146
Emily:That's so cute.

769
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:37,585
Amy:It is really cute.

770
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:41,959
I was like I know dad
she's blossomed to a woman.

771
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,461
Emily:Oh.

772
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:45,839
Amy:You have. It's so amazing.

773
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:47,294
Emily:He looks good though.

774
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,117
I haven't seen him in 10 years and

775
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,200
he looks almost the same.

776
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,067
Dad:Oh this is what we do.

777
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,330
We'd stop and buy wine and then all the

778
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,705
different cheese and vegetables and bread

779
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,305
and we would stop and have a picnic.

780
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,575
Picnic.

781
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:12,917
Amy:Picnic.

782
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:14,491
Dad:It was your typical road.

783
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:15,831
You'd have to wait for the cows.

784
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:17,546
(laughing)

785
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:20,401
Look at that countryside
it's just beautiful.

786
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,979
Amy:That looks good. Look
at all the brie cheese.

787
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:23,256
Dad:Oh yeah.

788
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:24,714
Amy:Oh!

789
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:27,497
Dad:Oh, that's the best picture of you

790
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,925
in France. Look at that.

791
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:29,867
(laughing)

792
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:30,987
That nailed it.

793
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:34,500
(people talking)

794
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:52,920
(light music)

795
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,784
Paul:How you doing guy?

796
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,271
Charlie:Hey man. I'm Charlie.

797
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:56,412
Paul:How's it going?

798
00:36:56,412 --> 00:36:57,653
Paul.

799
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:58,451
Charlie:Oh, hey Paul.

800
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,616
Um, do you think my coats okay out there?

801
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,136
Paul:Yeah, sure.
Everybody keeps their coat

802
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:01,784
out there.

803
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:03,089
Charlie:There's like
this - I don't know if

804
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:03,954
he's a fisherman or something.

805
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:05,145
He's kind of a shifty guy.

806
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,293
Paul:That's Ted. He's our security guy.

807
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,504
Charlie:Oh, all right
cool. Um, hey could I

808
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,668
get a vodka tonic?

809
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:11,956
Paul:Sure, yeah no problem.

810
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:13,069
Charlie:Thank you.

811
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,862
Paul:So you live around here? What's -

812
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:18,782
Charlie:Oh, yeah. Yeah. We just moved here

813
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:19,836
my girlfriend and I.

814
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,209
Paul:Oh, yeah? From where?

815
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,370
Charlie:From New York actually.

816
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,597
Paul:Oh, nice.

817
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,957
Charlie:Yeah.

818
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,901
Paul:How's it up there?

819
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,566
How's the weather?

820
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,024
Charlie:It's good. It's good.

821
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,576
Hey, do you know who those girls are?

822
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:36,953
Paul:Oh that's Amy. Amy and Kristen.

823
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,254
Charlie:Yeah?

824
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:39,180
Paul:They're around here a lot.

825
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,636
Charlie:Shh, don't say it so loud.

826
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,774
Lesbians?

827
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:44,951
Paul:Yeah.

828
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:49,703
Charlie:Oh. The blonde is Amy?

829
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,636
Paul:Yeah, that's Amy.

830
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:56,073
Charlie:Hm, uh, hm. What do I owe you?

831
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:57,963
Paul:That'll be $10.

832
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,780
Charlie:Okay. $10?

833
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:01,100
For this thing?

834
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,708
Paul:Yep.

835
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,768
Charlie:Are you serious?

836
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,117
Paul:It's a vodka soda.

837
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:06,429
Charlie:Is there some
local fee or something?

838
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:09,228
Paul:Yeah, if you were here
earlier for happy hour.

839
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,802
Charlie:I've got $8.00. Is that okay?

840
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:13,656
Paul:No, it's $10.

841
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:15,141
Charlie:Oh, wait hold on another $5.

842
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,283
Okay.

843
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:17,633
Paul:All right.

844
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,006
Charlie:Charge less,
maybe you'll get a tip

845
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:21,336
next time, huh?

846
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:47,012
(light music)

847
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,572
I don't think girls should
wear all that makeup.

848
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:02,976
Emily:I don't wear a lot of makeup.

849
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:05,828
Charlie:I know.

850
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,680
I just don't think girls
should wear any makeup.

851
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,212
Emily:Well, I agree with
you, but society thinks

852
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:14,213
otherwise.

853
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,536
Charlie:So, who cares?

854
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,228
Facebook cares?

855
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:23,906
Emily:Hollywood cares.

856
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:25,236
Charlie:Hollywood.

857
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:31,541
I get all my fashion tips from Bollywood.

858
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,432
(laughing)

859
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:34,836
Emily:That's clear.

860
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,840
Charlie:Where you guys going?

861
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:42,360
Emily:I don't know yet.

862
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,285
I think we're going to decide
when we get down there.

863
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:53,951
Charlie:I want to make a baby with you.

864
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:56,408
Like, I think we should have a baby.

865
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,809
Emily:Yeah?

866
00:39:59,111 --> 00:39:59,981
Charlie:Yeah.

867
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,803
Emily:Hmm. How long you
been thinking about this?

868
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,295
Charlie:I don't know.
I guess I don't know.

869
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:08,653
I just decided.

870
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:09,776
Emily:Just now?

871
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:10,805
Charlie:Yeah.

872
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:12,111
Well, you know I was thinking about it

873
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:14,660
and I thought well, I'd
like to have somebody

874
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,580
to hang out with here that I know.

875
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,363
I'm going to know my own baby.

876
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:20,639
(laughing)

877
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,819
Emily:I'm not enough for you?

878
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:23,543
Charlie:No, you're fine,
but you're always out.

879
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:24,876
You've got friends here you know?

880
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,739
Emily:Well, you can come too.

881
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,575
Charlie:I'm not going to go out.

882
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:29,970
Emily:Why not?

883
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:31,855
Charlie:Because I'm
going to be home thinking

884
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:34,623
about making a baby with you. Baby.

885
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:36,073
Emily:So you can have a little friend?

886
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:40,225
Charlie:Don't you want to make babies

887
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:41,097
with this body?

888
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:42,017
Emily:Of course I do.

889
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:43,043
Charlie:Look at these genes.

890
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:43,976
Emily:Look at them.

891
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:44,931
Charlie:Come on.

892
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:45,992
Emily:Right now?

893
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,073
Charlie:Right now.

894
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:50,861
(moaning)

895
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:52,261
I want to have a baby with you.

896
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,789
I do.

897
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,211
Emily:We'll talk about it later.

898
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:56,741
Charlie:I think we
should talk about it now.

899
00:40:57,008 --> 00:41:08,751
(moaning)

900
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,076
Amy's a lesbian.

901
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:18,244
Emily:What?

902
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:20,082
Charlie:Your friend Amy is a lesbian.

903
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:22,727
Emily:How do you know that?

904
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,381
Charlie:I saw her at the bar
last night with some girl.

905
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:28,567
They were making out.

906
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:33,137
So, I asked the bartender if he knew them.

907
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,458
I asked him, I said, "Is that Amy?"

908
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,793
You know? Is that girl Amy?

909
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:41,102
And he said, "Yeah."

910
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:45,705
So then they were leaving
and so I decided to follow

911
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:51,985
them, and I followed
them out near their car

912
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,335
and they were kissing
some more and they got

913
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:55,796
in the car and left.

914
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,086
I don't know what's going on with you,

915
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:04,640
and with her or whatever,
but I just thought you

916
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,063
should know that.

917
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,113
I'm sorry.

918
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:13,998
Blonde woman:So how've you been?

919
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,627
Amy:I'm okay.

920
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:17,520
Blonde woman:I've been thinking about you.

921
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,757
Amy:Awe, that's sweet.

922
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:21,384
Blonde woman:Oh, I mean
I just want to make sure

923
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,480
you know, you're good and
everything and I kind of

924
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,524
wish I was there with you
just to keep you company.

925
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:28,801
Amy:I know. I know. I
wish you were here too.

926
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:33,255
Yeah, I mean it's pretty much the same.

927
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:34,880
Blonde woman:Yeah?

928
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,368
Amy:Like what? I think I
talked to you last week

929
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:37,962
sometime. Yeah.

930
00:42:38,544 --> 00:42:39,785
Blonde woman:Yeah, I don't -

931
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:41,640
I mean I just don't like
that because then it just

932
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,484
makes it harder for
both of you to move on.

933
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,327
You know and it's just
got to be hard, still

934
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,480
talking to her.

935
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,834
Like, do you guys act like
nothing's really different

936
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,060
or is she sad?

937
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:55,967
Amy:Yeah. I mean she -

938
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,052
Blonde woman:Hard man.

939
00:42:57,052 --> 00:43:05,455
Amy:I try to act really
normal and she is just -

940
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,565
It's just, you know, she's sort of needy.

941
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,260
Blonde woman:Yeah?

942
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,215
Amy:Yeah. I mean you
remember. She was always

943
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,249
kind of like that, but
now it's just heightened

944
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:17,535
because I've made myself
slightly unavailable.

945
00:43:18,271 --> 00:43:20,478
I feel like I'm juggling
a bunch of bitches.

946
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:24,599
Blonde woman:(laughing)
Oh my sis. The pimp.

947
00:43:24,957 --> 00:43:27,507
Amy:I know. The pimp. I
don't really mean that.

948
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,595
That sounded bad.

949
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,060
Blonde woman:No it didn't.
It sounded awesome.

950
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:32,154
Amy:Okay good.

951
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:32,878
(laughing)

952
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:35,054
Blonde woman:I'm juggling bastards.

953
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:36,459
Amy:Baskets?

954
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:39,859
What'd you say? (laughing)

955
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,250
Blonde woman:Not baskets. Bastards.

956
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,672
(laughing)

957
00:43:43,672 --> 00:44:00,394
(light music)

958
00:44:00,394 --> 00:44:03,094
Emily:Oh my God. [unintelligible].

959
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,843
Why do you walk so fucking fast Amy?

960
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,310
Amy:I'm not walking fast at all.

961
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:10,524
Emily:Amy!

962
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:11,540
Amy:What?

963
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,720
Emily:You walk so fast.

964
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,186
Amy:No. What are you doing?
No. Whoa. No. No. No.

965
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:19,884
Emily:Let's go. Open the door.

966
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:22,767
(flipping door handle)

967
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:25,088
Amy:You're going to have to hold on. Okay?

968
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,247
Emily:It's fucking cold.

969
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:28,672
(sighs)

970
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:30,932
Did you see the lobsters?

971
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:33,378
They're hilarious.

972
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:43,967
(light music)

973
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,271
(laughing)

974
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:46,380
Emily:I got it.

975
00:45:46,870 --> 00:46:30,926
(light music)

976
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:31,874
Amy:What?

977
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:44,716
(kiss)

978
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:29,862
(footsteps)

979
00:47:37,775 --> 00:47:40,163
(sliding door)

980
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:03,918
Amy:Hey did I wake you? Okay.

981
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,708
I just wanted to say goodnight.

982
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,540
You going to bed?

983
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:14,655
Okay.

984
00:48:17,702 --> 00:48:20,799
All right. Have a good day tomorrow.

985
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:25,261
Okay. Thanks.

986
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,734
All right. Soon. Okay.

987
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:33,407
(laugh)

988
00:48:35,606 --> 00:48:40,241
Okay. All right. (laugh)

989
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:46,122
Okay bye.

990
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:37,202
(windchimes)

991
00:49:41,637 --> 00:50:33,191
(light music)

992
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:36,789
(water running)

993
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:57,017
(brushing teeth)

994
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:27,422
Emily:Hey.

995
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:33,686
Amy:Hey.

996
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:38,866
Emily:Um, I'm going to
go so I just wanted to

997
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,958
say goodbye.

998
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,773
Amy:All right. See you.

999
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:49,540
Emily:Okay, I'll see you later.

1000
00:51:53,002 --> 00:52:03,255
(hammering)

1001
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:30,969
(windchimes)

1002
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,817
Dad:What you're looking
at is the beginning

1003
00:52:55,817 --> 00:52:59,311
of the 1600s and so obviously those aren't

1004
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:01,928
photographs there, but
they're paintings of

1005
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,088
some of the people who
would have been here,

1006
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:07,824
old maps and aerial photos
and so those are kind

1007
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,974
of the 1600s and then you
get over in here maybe

1008
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:12,609
into the early 1700s and
they're just artifacts

1009
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:17,576
and stories which I wrote
a couple of years ago

1010
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:19,926
and then we found the
images to put with these

1011
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:23,225
stories, and some people
actually stop and take

1012
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:26,087
the time to read them,
but the project that

1013
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:28,915
you could work on is we
need to make a catalogue

1014
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,704
of this because people are
more likely to read these

1015
00:53:30,704 --> 00:53:32,382
if they could buy it.

1016
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:33,448
Emily:Oh, okay.

1017
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:35,163
Dad:Take the stories with
them with some pictures.

1018
00:53:35,257 --> 00:53:36,104
Emily:Perfect.

1019
00:53:36,104 --> 00:53:37,326
Dad:So, there's another project.

1020
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:38,941
Emily:Okay, great.

1021
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,125
Dad:And which, you couldn't put all these

1022
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,475
pictures in, but you could
put selective pictures.

1023
00:53:43,492 --> 00:53:45,983
Maybe figure out which images.

1024
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:47,541
Obviously you want to try to -

1025
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:49,234
We could reduce these maps here.

1026
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,133
Emily:Right, yeah.

1027
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:53,220
Dad:They might be able
to fit in, and then -

1028
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:54,882
But there's no reason
why we couldn't put all

1029
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:56,043
those stories in because
they don't take up that

1030
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,118
much room.

1031
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:57,745
Emily:Okay.

1032
00:53:57,745 --> 00:54:00,229
Dad:And then just certain
selected images that

1033
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:03,322
we think would be cool to
have with it and we have

1034
00:54:03,322 --> 00:54:06,745
the introduction around
the corner, which says

1035
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:08,043
Rye on the rocks.

1036
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:10,166
So, that could be the
front page or something

1037
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:10,935
like that.

1038
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:11,439
Emily:Okay.

1039
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:12,106
Dad:Yeah.

1040
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:13,024
Emily:Oh great. That will be fun.

1041
00:54:13,024 --> 00:54:14,522
Dad:Yeah.

1042
00:54:14,744 --> 00:55:30,277
(solemn music)

1043
00:55:30,277 --> 00:55:32,901
(people talking)

1044
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:34,358
Kristen:Your hair is getting so long.

1045
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:37,987
Amy:I know, I need to trim
it. It's all in my face.

1046
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,072
You look really nice.

1047
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,150
Kristen:Thanks.

1048
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:56,785
Um, so can I take you
to dinner on Thursday?

1049
00:55:57,872 --> 00:56:01,655
Amy:Oh wow. That's really nice.

1050
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,297
Um, I don't see why not. Sure.

1051
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:08,525
Kristen:Cool.

1052
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:11,784
Amy:I don't really know
if I'm working, but

1053
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:15,026
I don't think I would be.

1054
00:56:15,302 --> 00:56:16,525
I don't usually work on those nights, but

1055
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,181
I just want to double check.

1056
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:19,472
Kristen:Yeah, I mean whatever.

1057
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:22,630
Whatever. Next week.

1058
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:25,685
Amy:Next, next Thursday.

1059
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:27,324
Kristen:I mean this Thursday or -

1060
00:56:27,324 --> 00:56:29,692
Amy:Oh, this - Yeah. Right.

1061
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:30,877
(laughing)

1062
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:37,488
Amy:That'd be nice. Oh where do you -

1063
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:39,622
Do you have a place in
mind? Did you want me to

1064
00:56:39,622 --> 00:56:41,230
think of a place or -

1065
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,491
Kristen:Whatever you want.

1066
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:43,693
Wherever you want. You pick.

1067
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:47,325
Think about it. Think. Think
about it and let me know.

1068
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:48,134
Amy:Okay.

1069
00:56:48,547 --> 00:56:49,520
(laughing)

1070
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,666
Kristen:I'll make a reservation.

1071
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,302
Amy:That sounds good,
thank you for doing that.

1072
00:56:59,735 --> 00:57:01,134
That would be fun. Yeah.

1073
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:05,620
I'll let you - I can let
you know like tomorrow or

1074
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,325
something if I can do that.

1075
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:09,518
Kristen:Okay.

1076
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:10,636
Amy:Okay.

1077
00:57:52,664 --> 00:57:54,854
(phone vibrating)

1078
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:59,169
Kristen:Uh, so -

1079
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:09,157
I had fun last time I saw you.

1080
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:10,806
(laughing)

1081
00:58:11,638 --> 00:58:16,158
Amy:Oh yeah. Wow. I had fun too.

1082
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:25,192
Kristen:I mean I did too, but whatever.

1083
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:31,077
Amy:Yeah. Okay that was strange.

1084
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:47,967
No, but - Yeah it was a
night. It was like old times.

1085
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:57,519
Kristen:Like old times.

1086
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,811
Not that old.

1087
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:05,870
Amy:Yeah I know. We sound like geezers.

1088
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,108
Dinner should be fun though.

1089
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:10,900
That will be good.

1090
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:13,312
Kristen:Yeah.

1091
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,398
Amy:I'll have to think of a fun place.

1092
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:17,720
Kristen:Somewhere cozy.

1093
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,799
Amy:Cozy?

1094
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:26,337
Kristen:Do you need to
step outside and make

1095
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:27,385
a call or something?

1096
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,201
Amy:No. No I'm sorry.

1097
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:30,664
Kristen:Okay.

1098
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:31,973
Amy:My sister, she keeps writing me.

1099
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:33,422
Kristen:How's Shannon?

1100
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:35,499
Amy:She's good.

1101
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:36,590
Kristen:Yeah?

1102
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,109
You just seem distracted.

1103
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,662
Amy:I know. It's really
rude of me. I'm sorry.

1104
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:55,218
Is that new?

1105
00:59:55,256 --> 01:00:01,317
Kristen:Yeah. Um, look at me.

1106
01:00:01,408 --> 01:00:02,684
I feel like -

1107
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:04,214
I feel like we're not on
the same page or something.

1108
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,330
Amy:No I'm here. I'm listening.

1109
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,476
I'm sorry about the phone.

1110
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:14,119
I'm sorry.

1111
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,129
Kristen:That's fine.

1112
01:00:15,162 --> 01:00:15,738
Amy:I'm here.

1113
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:16,648
Kristen:Okay.

1114
01:00:16,648 --> 01:00:17,529
Amy:I'll let you know about dinner.

1115
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:18,266
Kristen:Yeah.

1116
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:19,428
Amy:I'll think of a place.

1117
01:00:20,629 --> 01:00:21,667
That will be good right?

1118
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:24,477
Kristen:Yeah, maybe we
can dress up or something.

1119
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:26,584
Amy:Mm-hmm.

1120
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,850
Emily:Amy it's me, can you please just

1121
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,343
call me back? Please,
soon when you get this.

1122
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:58,455
Okay, bye.

1123
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:30,369
(solemn music)

1124
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:31,452
Dad:What's going on?

1125
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:36,825
Amy:Not much really.

1126
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,760
Just talking.

1127
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:40,966
Dad:Yeah?

1128
01:01:40,966 --> 01:01:44,192
Amy:Mm-hmm. That's pretty much it though.

1129
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:45,874
Dad:Hmm.

1130
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:48,844
Amy:That's pretty much
how I'm going to keep it

1131
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,062
for a little bit.

1132
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:57,980
Dad:So, nothing else about Kristen, huh?

1133
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:00,076
Just yacking?

1134
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,556
Amy:Just yacking. That's it.

1135
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:03,699
Dad:That's not very interesting.

1136
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,007
It certainly isn't informative.

1137
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:08,324
(laughing)

1138
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,475
I mean what the hell?

1139
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:10,258
Amy:I know.

1140
01:02:10,258 --> 01:02:11,393
Dad:That was a nonanswer.

1141
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:12,428
Amy:I know.

1142
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:13,853
Well, I don't know what to say.

1143
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:15,859
There's nothing. Nope. That's it.

1144
01:02:15,928 --> 01:02:16,902
Dad:Okay.

1145
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,459
Dad:You haven't responded to this.

1146
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:21,722
Amy:I want your pistachios.

1147
01:02:21,722 --> 01:02:22,982
Dad:Oh, I thought you
wanted to hold my hand.

1148
01:02:22,982 --> 01:02:23,980
You wanted a pistachio.

1149
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,813
Here you go.

1150
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:25,682
(laughing)

1151
01:02:25,682 --> 01:02:27,961
This is really what I wanted to show you.

1152
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:29,050
Check this out.

1153
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:30,734
Amy:That's not me is it?

1154
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,997
(laughing)

1155
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:35,445
Dad:That's a card you can send somebody

1156
01:02:35,445 --> 01:02:36,978
but you don't think I'm going
to send that to anybody.

1157
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,266
That's too cool.

1158
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:39,801
(laughing)

1159
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:41,459
Amy:Oh my God. That's so wrong.

1160
01:02:41,573 --> 01:02:43,381
(laughing)

1161
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:44,399
Where'd you get this?

1162
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,025
Dad:Oh, I don't know but
when I saw it, I said that's

1163
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:46,971
a keeper.

1164
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,268
Amy:Little chubby feet.

1165
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:52,057
Oh that is. Oh my God.
I can't look at that

1166
01:02:52,057 --> 01:02:53,039
for very long.

1167
01:02:53,117 --> 01:02:54,457
(laughing)

1168
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:55,583
That makes me uncomfortable.

1169
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:56,581
(laughing)

1170
01:02:56,581 --> 01:02:58,025
Dad:Oh, they're little
kids. They're innocent.

1171
01:02:58,553 --> 01:03:00,292
Amy:Yeah, but still.

1172
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:01,986
Dad:Yeah, but before long
they won't be innocent.

1173
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:02,648
Right?

1174
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:03,618
Okay. Yeah I know.

1175
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,312
Amy:I think those little
kids are big kids now.

1176
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:15,459
(shower)

1177
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:18,065
(squeaking knobs)

1178
01:03:40,728 --> 01:03:42,005
(trash can opening and closing)

1179
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:49,565
(running water)

1180
01:03:49,752 --> 01:03:50,754
(shower curtain)

1181
01:04:01,575 --> 01:04:02,497
(kiss)

1182
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:24,333
(solemn music)

1183
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:35,448
(footsteps)

1184
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:44,257
(creaking floorboards)

1185
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:54,277
Emily:Charlie. I kissed Amy.

1186
01:05:11,698 --> 01:05:12,881
Charlie:You kissed her?

1187
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:17,385
(laughing)

1188
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:18,802
Emily:I just wanted to tell you.

1189
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:21,574
Charlie:Did you have sex with her?

1190
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,833
Emily:No. No.

1191
01:05:23,017 --> 01:05:24,658
(laughing)

1192
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:25,988
Charlie:Don't act so shocked.

1193
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,953
I saw her. She has an exgirlfriend. Okay?

1194
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:30,013
It's a perfectly legitimate thing to ask.

1195
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,278
Emily:Okay well. No.

1196
01:05:31,399 --> 01:05:32,462
Charlie:But you kissed her.

1197
01:05:32,999 --> 01:05:33,656
Emily:Yeah.

1198
01:05:33,656 --> 01:05:34,847
Charlie:You sure you
didn't have sex with her?

1199
01:05:34,942 --> 01:05:35,714
Emily:Yeah.

1200
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:36,526
Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her?

1201
01:05:36,526 --> 01:05:37,834
Emily:Charlie stop it.

1202
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:38,783
I told you I kissed her. That's it.

1203
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:39,990
Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her?

1204
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,114
Answer, just answer me.

1205
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:42,187
Did you want to have sex with her?

1206
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:43,607
Emily:Stop asking me that.

1207
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,938
Charlie:Well just say yes or no.

1208
01:05:44,938 --> 01:05:46,135
Clearly I want to know.

1209
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:46,801
Look at me in the eye. Yes or no.

1210
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:48,036
Emily:I don't know.

1211
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:49,369
Charlie:You don't know
if you had sex with her?

1212
01:05:49,986 --> 01:05:51,304
Or if you wanted to have sex with her.

1213
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:53,481
That's a huge difference right there.

1214
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:54,449
Emily:Stop it.

1215
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:55,802
Charlie:Tell me. No, tell me. Yes or no?

1216
01:05:55,936 --> 01:05:58,304
Did you want to have sex with her?

1217
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:03,034
Did you have sex with her?

1218
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:03,754
Emily:No!

1219
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:05,058
Charlie:Okay, you had sex with Amy. Great.

1220
01:06:05,058 --> 01:06:05,770
Emily:No I didn't!

1221
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:06,561
Charlie:You had sex.

1222
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:08,102
Emily:No I didn't. I
kissed her that was it.

1223
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:09,341
Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her?

1224
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,359
Emily:I don't know!

1225
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:11,491
Charlie:You don't know
if you wanted to have sex

1226
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:11,942
with her?

1227
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:13,467
That's huge. That's crazy.

1228
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:19,141
It's one thing if you kissed her. Okay?

1229
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,251
That's one thing.

1230
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:22,498
But if you don't know if
you wanted to have sex

1231
01:06:22,498 --> 01:06:23,750
with her -

1232
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:27,519
When you were kissing her
did you think about me

1233
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:28,358
at all?

1234
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:30,227
Emily:Oh, God. Stop it.

1235
01:06:30,227 --> 01:06:31,081
Charlie:No, tell me. I want to know.

1236
01:06:31,081 --> 01:06:33,780
Did I run across your
mind or did you forget

1237
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,772
about little Charlie and
his little light blue house?

1238
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:38,657
Just hanging out by himself.

1239
01:06:38,657 --> 01:06:39,865
Did you forget about me?

1240
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:40,901
Emily:No.

1241
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:42,405
Charlie:Did you forget about me?

1242
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:46,362
While you were
contemplating whether or not

1243
01:06:46,362 --> 01:06:47,632
you wanted to have sex with her.

1244
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:51,062
Did I exist in your mind at all?

1245
01:06:53,704 --> 01:06:55,325
You know, it's not the
fourth grade anymore.

1246
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:56,830
She's not your little friend.

1247
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,118
You guys are big girls now.

1248
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:15,094
(door creaking)

1249
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:20,693
(footsteps)

1250
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:42,585
(door opening and closing)

1251
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,156
(footsteps)

1252
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:49,846
Emily:Amy. I've been calling you all week.

1253
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:51,293
What's the deal?

1254
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:54,221
Who's that girl?

1255
01:07:55,657 --> 01:07:56,911
Who's the girl?

1256
01:07:58,382 --> 01:07:59,669
How could you hide her from me?

1257
01:07:59,669 --> 01:08:00,669
Just tell me.

1258
01:08:01,774 --> 01:08:03,182
Amy, tell me.

1259
01:08:04,258 --> 01:08:06,042
Amy. Come on.

1260
01:08:12,757 --> 01:08:13,687
I know okay. Just tell me.

1261
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:31,909
Who is she?

1262
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:39,105
Amy:So, after you left
I came out of the closet

1263
01:08:39,105 --> 01:08:40,935
to everybody but you weren't here.

1264
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:47,147
Two weeks ago I broke
up with my girlfriend of

1265
01:08:47,147 --> 01:08:49,410
three years, Kristen.

1266
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:54,283
That's that. Do you want dates?

1267
01:08:54,283 --> 01:08:56,955
Do you want?

1268
01:08:56,955 --> 01:08:58,081
Emily:No, I want to
know why you didn't tell

1269
01:08:58,081 --> 01:08:59,137
me before.

1270
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:00,623
Amy:I don't know. I can't answer that.

1271
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,087
I didn't. I didn't.

1272
01:09:06,099 --> 01:09:07,424
Emily:What? You don't trust me?

1273
01:09:07,597 --> 01:09:08,863
Amy:It's not that I don't trust you.

1274
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,115
I haven't seen you in 10 years.

1275
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:14,118
A lot has happened, and
I'm telling you now.

1276
01:09:19,686 --> 01:09:21,299
Emily:So, what am I supposed to do now?

1277
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:28,913
(talking to dog)

1278
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:47,051
(bouncing ball)

1279
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:48,129
(groan)

1280
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:57,444
(bouncing ball)

1281
01:10:57,444 --> 01:10:59,137
Amy:Oh. Ow.

1282
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:14,156
(bouncing ball)

1283
01:11:14,156 --> 01:11:15,542
(groan)

1284
01:11:19,995 --> 01:11:36,168
(laughing)

1285
01:11:49,330 --> 01:12:00,828
(footsteps)

1286
01:12:00,828 --> 01:13:22,410
(light music)
