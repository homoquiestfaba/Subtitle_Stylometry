1
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:06,653
Did you make
your list of amends?

2
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,657
Yeah, yeah.

3
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,597
Got 'em right here.

4
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,537
-Here you are.
-No, please, read aloud.

5
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,663
Number one,
to see my daughter,

6
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,499
get her to talk to me again.

7
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,137
How long has it been now?

8
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,716
Eight years.

9
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:42,459
Number two,
get my gig back at the club.

10
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,263
Playing piano down at Drake's?

11
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,966
Yeah.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,603
Number three,

13
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:51,611
get my family
to forgive me.

14
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,618
-Which are you doing first?
-My daughter.

15
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,424
What are you going to do?

16
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:02,335
I got a plan.

17
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,975
You have
one unheard message,

18
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:46,448
sent today
at 9:35 A.M.

19
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:48,352
Hello, Othell.

20
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:52,393
I got your voice message,
and my answer is no.

21
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,534
No, I will not
help you see Nima.

22
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:59,977
<i>She doesn't want to see you.
She doesn't need to see you.</i>

23
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,945
She's good now.

24
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,484
And I'm...

25
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:05,688
I'm good, too.

26
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,858
Don't call me again.

27
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,997
And don't contact Nima.

28
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,581
Hey, baby.

29
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,550
What are you working on?

30
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,454
Just some new projects.

31
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,993
What are you up to?

32
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,697
Here's your lunch I promised.

33
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,876
Did you make this?

34
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,850
I did. Try it.

35
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,527
Turkey. That's good.

36
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,064
Do you think I'm thoughtful?

37
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:46,404
I was reading this article
on perfect partnerships,

38
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:49,577
and it says that a good
partner is always thoughtful.

39
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,414
That's why I'm asking you
if you think I'm thoughtful.

40
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:52,784
Yes, I think you are
very thoughtful.

41
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,589
Absolutely.

42
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,693
You know, I think about all
the thoughtful things you do

43
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,028
and the thoughtful
person you are,

44
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:59,498
and I just...
I get misty-eyed.

45
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:00,868
Stop it.

46
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,905
Go on, eat.

47
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,543
Eat it right now?

48
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,646
With you watching me?

49
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,983
Just take a bite,
I want to see if you like it.

50
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,052
Yeah.

51
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,775
I was thinking...

52
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,547
Do you think having your father
walk me down the aisle

53
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,550
is going to look weird?

54
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,655
<i>Would you rather
your father do it?</i>

55
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,894
Not unless there was
a firing squad at the other end.

56
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,733
Okay.

57
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,704
Are you picking me up
for dinner?

58
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,776
-Absolutely.
-I'm gonna go finish up

59
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,180
the music for my concert.
How's that coming?

60
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:41,118
It's good.

61
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,191
I'm just a little bit nervous.

62
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:46,595
It's the first time
I'm composing several pieces.

63
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,107
Don't be.

64
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,877
You're great.

65
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,648
You are talented.

66
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,185
You're beautiful.

67
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,900
I'll see you tonight.

68
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,236
Absolutely.

69
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,909
Eat all your lunch!

70
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:13,083
-Bye-bye
-bye!

71
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,049
How can I help...

72
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,619
you.

73
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,591
-No, there's no need for that.
-Security.

74
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,294
I need you in here right now.
You don't need to do that.

75
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:40,863
I just want to talk to you
for a few minutes.

76
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:41,666
I know how it looks.

77
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:43,804
Just wait right there.
Security!

78
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,573
I know you're thinking
it's something else,

79
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,111
but I just need
a few minutes of your time.

80
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,681
-Security!
-You think you can give me

81
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:49,949
a few minutes
of your time, sir?

82
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:51,886
You don't really know me,
you know,

83
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,222
but you do kind of know me.

84
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,927
-Come with me, sir.
-Look, I'm Nima's father!

85
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,295
We got a breach.

86
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,033
Nima Simone Babineaux,

87
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,172
born September the 20th, 1985.

88
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:04,212
She has a scar on her knee
that she tells people

89
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,985
comes from climbing a tree
when she was 8.

90
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:10,825
I mean, that girl's never
climbed a tree in her life.

91
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,163
-He's okay.
-You sure?

92
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:15,101
Yeah, that girl
don't climb no trees.

93
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,646
I'll be right outside.

94
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,616
Mr. Babineaux.

95
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:33,172
So you're Nima's father.
Yes.

96
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,345
Well...

97
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,184
What can I do for you?

98
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:41,189
I need you to help me

99
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,127
find a way
that I can see Nima.

100
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,134
You know, I really wish
I could help you,

101
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,007
but I don't think
she wants to see you.

102
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,952
I need you to make it
so that she does.

103
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,058
Mr. Babineaux...

104
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,796
I'm just meeting you
for the first time,

105
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,833
and Nima
barely mentions you.

106
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,604
Let's say...

107
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,374
I'm dying.

108
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,652
Are you dying,
Mr. Babineaux?

109
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,389
A little.

110
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:16,727
You're dying a little.

111
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,432
I don't follow.

112
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,737
My counselor told me

113
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,712
that I could have died
if I didn't stop drinking.

114
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:27,852
You could have died.

115
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:30,891
Did you stop drinking?
Yes.

116
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,294
But...

117
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,300
<i>I could have died.</i>

118
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,770
Can we play that up?

119
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,106
No, I'm sorry.

120
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,109
I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.

121
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,881
My counselor...

122
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,025
Wanted me
to work on this list.

123
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm sorry, I...

124
00:10:58,113 --> 00:10:59,951
I wish I could help,
I really do.

125
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:02,824
I just have way too much
on my plate right now.

126
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,730
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,812
Babe, how was your day?

128
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,984
Interesting.

129
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,154
Why? What happened?

130
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,362
Nothing, just had to
turn down a project.

131
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:24,502
Busy with more important things.

132
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:30,748
Well, don't be mad.

133
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,417
I paid for the flowers today.

134
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:38,061
I just wanted it done.
No, you just...

135
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:40,500
You just didn't trust me to do
what I said I was gonna do.

136
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,404
I told you I was gonna
take care of the flowers,

137
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,475
and you decided
to handle it yourself.

138
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:48,417
Spence, let's not get in
an argument over calla lilies.

139
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,024
It's not about the flowers,
it's never about just flowers.

140
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,963
It's... I told you I was...
Hey, Nima.

141
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,539
Mr. Babineaux,
what are you doing here?

142
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:00,742
I thought maybe
we could talk.

143
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:08,324
Right now probably isn't
the best time.

144
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,795
Nima?

145
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,402
Geez. Nice.

146
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,807
Nima!

147
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,886
How do you know him?

148
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,260
I don't.

149
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,365
He showed up at my office today.

150
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,971
-Did you invite him?
-No.

151
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,442
He came by to ask
if I could help him talk to you.

152
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,049
You just listened to
what he had to say?

153
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,451
I mean, yeah.

154
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,461
After everything
I've told you.

155
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:01,534
Baby, all you ever said
was that he wasn't around.

156
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:03,372
Any time his name comes up,
you get so angry,

157
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,908
we can't even have
a conversation.

158
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,944
What else
would I have to say?

159
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,549
What did you expect me to do?

160
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:10,421
Can you please take me home?

161
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,844
Are you mad at me?

162
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,346
Just take me home.

163
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,859
Mr. Babineaux.

164
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,311
Well, y'all will never believe
who I saw yesterday.

165
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,313
Who?

166
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,117
My father.

167
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,621
What?

168
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,158
Yes.

169
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,192
My father.

170
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,899
Did you shake him?

171
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,635
Did you toss hot grease
in his lap?

172
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,372
Did you open-palm slap him?
I need details.

173
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,444
Okay, Rochelle,
she would never do that.

174
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:57,116
I would absolutely do
all of that, Tiffany.

175
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,221
All right...

176
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,359
But I didn't.

177
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,229
I just left.

178
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,435
Why was he there in the first
place?

179
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:10,109
Spence claims that
he came by the office to see him

180
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,682
and he asked for his help
in repairing our relationship.

181
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:14,618
Cute.

182
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:17,124
No.
Exactly.

183
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,896
Nima, it's... it's time for
you to fix things with him.

184
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,332
Sweetie, you're getting married.

185
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,239
What does getting married
have to do with any of that?

186
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:25,640
Because you're starting
a new life,

187
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:27,912
and, typically, you want
all to be well in your world.

188
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,015
All is well.

189
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,356
You know, you just...
You don't understand.

190
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,058
Okay, I see.

191
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,929
It's because I have a dad,
right?

192
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,165
Is that what it is?

193
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,635
-Yes.
-Okay.

194
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,371
You two, I...

195
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:42,142
But Rochelle and I have
the better version of dads.

196
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,243
Okay, what's that?

197
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,412
They're called moms.

198
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,082
Whatever.

199
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,452
You know what?

200
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:00,211
Boo!

201
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,088
Othell Babineaux.

202
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,125
Come here, man!
Benny Mitchell!

203
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,264
How you doing, brother?
What's happening, cat daddy?

204
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,240
Man, I ain't see you in what,
five years?

205
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,310
We were in that Mexican jail.

206
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,481
<i>You were in
that Mexican jail. Stop.</i>

207
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:18,483
You playing anywhere?

208
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,688
Well, you know, I'm...

209
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,060
I fix cars.

210
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,199
All that talent
and you changing oil?

211
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:29,105
You got something here
for me, Benny?

212
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:33,346
Man. I can't...

213
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,023
Not after the missed practices,
showing up to gigs drunk.

214
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,995
I mean, you punched a guy
in the audience, Othell.

215
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:44,136
He was heckling me, man.

216
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,174
He was clapping, o.

217
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,692
Look...

218
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:00,736
I need this, Benny.
I'm clean.

219
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,572
How long?

220
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:07,217
Two months, four days,
and seven and a half hours.

221
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,759
O...

222
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,733
I'm rooting for you
more than anybody.

223
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:19,241
But you gotta prove you can be
a reliable musician, man.

224
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,513
Yeah, we got another spot
for a piano player,

225
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,383
but I can only
give it to someone

226
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,719
who's gonna show up on time,

227
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,258
come to rehearsal
without a bottle in his hand,

228
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,329
and not throw up during a set,
brother.

229
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,166
That happened once.

230
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,506
It was on the bass player.

231
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,447
Jimmy's still mad
about that?

232
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,152
The suit was new.

233
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,562
Look...

234
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,368
If you can stay clean
another month,

235
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,673
come back and see me.

236
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,245
You know, I can look at you
and tell you ain't ready yet.

237
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:58,422
Let me introduce you to my wife,
Martha, while you're here.

238
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,126
Hey, baby.

239
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,720
You have got to be
kidding me.

240
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:14,822
You still stalking me?

241
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,594
I want you and Nima
to come to

242
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:20,601
my mama's 80th birthday party
in Savannah.

243
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:22,705
Yeah. Well, good-bye,
Mr. Babineaux.

244
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:25,611
Wait, wait, wait, Spence,
please, just give me a minute.

245
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,317
You know, I made it
very clear to you before...

246
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,285
I can't help you.

247
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,261
And instead of sitting down
and figuring out

248
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,831
what you could do
for your daughter,

249
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,865
the first thing you do

250
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:37,669
is ask her to do
something for you.

251
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:41,276
You're everything
she always said you were.

252
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,081
You're selfish.

253
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:47,156
Then don't do this for me.
Do it for Nima.

254
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:50,496
Come on, Spence,
you're a good man,

255
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,535
but we both know
that deep down inside,

256
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,608
Nima wants to fix this, too.

257
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,815
You're a psychologist now?
No, no.

258
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:05,159
But I let my issues
with my daddy ruin my marriage.

259
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,466
Well, I'm not gonna let that
happen to ours.

260
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:15,381
You can't control
how people respond to pain.

261
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,526
I don't want to hurt her again.

262
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,236
I just want a chance.

263
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,141
Will you give me that?

264
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:35,187
Are you gonna...

265
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,659
Finish this?

266
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:51,655
Baby, you want a drink?

267
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,559
No, I'm fine.

268
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,212
Babe...

269
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:21,617
What's the story
with your dad?

270
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,328
I need to know.

271
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:29,834
You know what?
I don't like talking about him.

272
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,440
Not even for me?

273
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:38,552
Please?
Why this sudden interest?

274
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:40,655
It's not sudden.

275
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,727
I always wanted to know.

276
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,266
Baby, that's in the past.

277
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:47,904
That has nothing to do
with you and me.

278
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,508
Mwah.

279
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:54,718
Except that it has
absolutely everything

280
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,356
to do with you and me.

281
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,865
What does that mean?

282
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,937
Baby, you don't trust me.

283
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,740
Yes, I do.

284
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,946
Not with your whole heart.

285
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:11,787
You remember
when your grandfather

286
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,558
was terminally ill?

287
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,396
You didn't tell me
for two weeks,

288
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,801
and you claimed it was
'cause I was busy at work,

289
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,939
but I'm never too busy for you.

290
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:24,614
You don't trust me
emotionally.

291
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,985
Okay. Wait.

292
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,961
Where is this coming from?

293
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,001
Did you talk to him again?

294
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,106
A little.

295
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,842
You talked to him a little?

296
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:41,382
Look, he came by my job today
when I was having lunch,

297
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:45,657
and we talked.

298
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:48,062
He's actually getting to you.
These are my feelings.

299
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,731
They're not his.

300
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:53,873
He's a conniving liar,
Spence.

301
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:56,579
What did he say?

302
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,420
Okay, I know this is

303
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,758
out of nowhere
and it's last-minute,

304
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,864
but he said he wants us
to go with him to Savannah

305
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,540
for your grandmother's
80th birthday party.

306
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,410
No!

307
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,818
Do you know how selfish that is
for him to even ask me that?

308
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,559
But I want to fix this.

309
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:24,002
I want to fix this.
No, no, no, no.

310
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,471
You're trying to fix me.

311
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:29,748
Yeah.

312
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,090
I'm gonna go.
I have to leave.

313
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,526
-Babe.
-Okay? Good night.

314
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:36,595
Baby?

315
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:43,009
Where are my shoes?

316
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,820
I live here.

317
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:52,494
You go.

318
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,636
Okay.

319
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:02,815
I knew you lived here.

320
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,020
I didn't know
what you were doing.

321
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,385
Did you think about it?

322
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,030
Yeah.

323
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,702
And?

324
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,914
Yeah, you know, I just...

325
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:37,955
I don't... I don't want to.

326
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:42,131
I have no desire to mend
my relationship with him.

327
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:48,074
I know that sounds horrible,
but it's true.

328
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:51,583
-Baby, he stalked me.
-I know.

329
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:52,852
No, I want you
to think about that,

330
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,221
almost to the point
of getting arrested.

331
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,693
He stalked me for three weeks.

332
00:22:57,862 --> 00:23:02,238
Baby, he wanted me to lie
and tell you he was dying.

333
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,009
He's crafty.

334
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,648
No, baby, he's desperate.

335
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,529
So maybe you could
look deep inside

336
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,134
that beautiful heart
of yours

337
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,141
and do this
because he needs it.

338
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,779
Not because you do.

339
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,570
Look at these.

340
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,748
It's pretty.

341
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:42,988
What you reading?
My favorite magazine.

342
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:51,071
Are you really ready
to do this, Nima?

343
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:54,312
I thought about it all night.

344
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:59,891
But I've decided
I'm going to go to Savannah.

345
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:02,062
It should earn me
double heaven points.

346
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,098
-Heaven points?
-Yes.

347
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,936
When you perform selfless acts,

348
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:08,707
you get points
that help get you into heaven.

349
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,245
Everyone knows that.

350
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,219
Who's here?
I'm not expecting anybody.

351
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,191
It's probably Charles.

352
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:18,861
Charles? Charles who?

353
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:21,033
He's just a friend of mine.

354
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,672
Why is Charles at my door?

355
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,610
He doesn't live far from here,

356
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,780
and since I was coming
to see you...

357
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:30,955
Well, it didn't make sense
for him to drive across town.

358
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:40,974
You are looking
too good today.

359
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:47,888
Good afternoon!

360
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:51,296
You must be Nima,

361
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:55,370
the beautiful daughter
of this beautiful woman.

362
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:56,941
And you are?

363
00:24:56,973 --> 00:25:00,114
Charles, Covington,
Dr. Charles Covington.

364
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:02,920
You work with my mom
at the hospital?

365
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,157
Yes, yeah.
I'm a gynecologist.

366
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:08,030
Of course you are.

367
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:11,672
Where are you taking my mother?

368
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:16,347
I've had the finest
restaurant downtown shut down

369
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,953
just so we could dance alone.

370
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:22,695
Romantic?

371
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,363
Sounds like a waste of money.

372
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:28,038
My dear,

373
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,842
nothing is a waste of money
when you have enough.

374
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:35,353
Yeah, you're like the p. Diddy
of reproduction.

375
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:36,755
Diddy?

376
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,194
Yeah, I like that!
No.

377
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:43,803
Could you wait right here
one minute?

378
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,142
Maybe.

379
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,282
What is wrong with you?

380
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,054
Mama, who is that crazy dude?

381
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,992
He's my date.

382
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,939
He is a bad decision.

383
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:06,651
Yeah.

384
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:22,218
I'll be right with you.

385
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,656
Can I help you?

386
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,930
Yeah, I want to use
one of the pianos.

387
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes.
Just sign in right here.

388
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:02,824
Miss Babineaux.

389
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:05,128
What are you doing here?
I thought it was your day off.

390
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:06,865
It is.

391
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,434
Did I leave
my music sheets here?

392
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:11,842
-Yes, you did.
-I think.

393
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,011
Thanks.

394
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,157
Does that say
"Othell Babineaux?"

395
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,498
Spence told me
to give you this

396
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,167
whenever you found out.

397
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:28,108
He paid for some gentleman
to use the extra piano

398
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,113
to practice for some gig.

399
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,950
Of course he did.

400
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:35,124
He was only supposed
to be here on your day off.

401
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:44,724
Hey! Mr. Babineaux.

402
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,393
You know, I thought I said
I could come get you.

403
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,497
Well, you know,
I wanted to show you this.

404
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:51,404
Okay.
I guess that saves time.

405
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:57,048
Othell?

406
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,458
Well, you're looking better.

407
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,728
You look
really nice yourself.

408
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,799
It's really good
to see you again.

409
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,537
I gotta go.

410
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:12,446
Hi.

411
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,999
Hello, Nima.

412
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,113
It's gonna be a long trip.

413
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,398
Finally getting on the road.

414
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:41,207
Would anyone like
a Lancaster soft cream?

415
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,810
You used to love caramel, Nima.

416
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:46,083
I love these things.

417
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:49,458
Yeah, I used to...

418
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,343
Okay.

419
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:53,254
Is he okay?

420
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:56,294
-Mama! Mama!
-Hey!

421
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:57,664
Mama!

422
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:06,581
You made it!

423
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:09,888
Go on back to the table,
Melinda.

424
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,626
All these extra people.

425
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:14,732
I'm so happy to see you!

426
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:19,443
How are you?

427
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,380
Well...
I'm doing fine, mama. I'm fine.

428
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,385
You put on a few extra pounds
there, son.

429
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,358
Yes, I have. I have.

430
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,529
Well, who are these
young, attractive people

431
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:30,464
you got with you?

432
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,735
Mama...

433
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,507
That's Nima...

434
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,178
And her fiancé, Spence.

435
00:33:38,948 --> 00:33:42,523
My granddaughter.

436
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:47,298
Baby! Honey!

437
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:53,211
I been waiting my whole life
to meet you.

438
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,523
Well...
Please, go on in.

439
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:02,265
Y'all just in time for dinner.

440
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,787
Look who's here!

441
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,596
Hey, everybody.

442
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,869
Y'all not gonna say hello?

443
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:24,408
-Hello.
-Hey, bro.

444
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:27,582
Well, o brought his daughter,
Nima.

445
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:29,387
And her fiancé, Spence.

446
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,500
Well, this is your uncle James
and his wife, Denise.

447
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,374
People used to always say
that James and Othell

448
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:40,676
looked the most alike.

449
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,816
This is your uncle Joseph
and his wife, Nancy.

450
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,453
Joseph is
the quiet one of the bunch.

451
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:49,494
And this is my second oldest,
Melinda.

452
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,799
And my youngest, Marvin.

453
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,538
His family couldn't make it.

454
00:34:57,277 --> 00:34:59,549
Well, y'all go on and sit down.

455
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:01,687
His family never makes it.

456
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:07,964
Well, y'all know

457
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:12,040
that I'm not much for words.
Right, mama.

458
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:15,348
But I just wanted to say
thank you, all of you,

459
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,985
for coming out to my
80th birthday party.

460
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:21,860
I want to thank my second-eldest
Melinda.

461
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:25,267
She did a beautiful job
with this party.

462
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,770
Thank you.

463
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:30,312
And I want to thank
James and Joseph for the cake

464
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,786
and the lovely portrait
for the living room.

465
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:36,592
But I am most excited

466
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:41,468
that Othell
and my granddaughter Nima

467
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:46,011
are sitting at this table
together.

468
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:51,422
Nima and Spence,
I'm so glad to have you here.

469
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:53,593
Let's eat!
Yes!

470
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:58,402
Mama, did James tell you
about his good news?

471
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,541
No, baby, what happened?

472
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:04,448
Well, mama, I was offered
a position at hennig and white.

473
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:06,987
My baby brother now works for

474
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:10,562
<i>the largest law firm
in the country.</i>

475
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:14,569
Soon to be walking in
his father's footsteps,

476
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:16,004
becoming a judge.

477
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:18,610
Well, congratulations, baby.

478
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,582
Joseph has good news, too.

479
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:21,784
Go ahead, Joseph.

480
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:23,488
Go on, tell her.

481
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,659
I passed the bar.

482
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,433
Congratulations,
baby brother.

483
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,338
Now, let's see.

484
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,912
Dad, god rest his soul,
was an esteemed judge.

485
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,015
Mama, a retired nurse.

486
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,818
I'm a doctor.

487
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:40,856
We have two lawyers.

488
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:45,500
And, Marvin,
he's a top financial advisor.

489
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:47,603
Yes.

490
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:49,841
Good.

491
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,613
Othell, what do you do?

492
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,617
Your brother's fine, Melinda.

493
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:55,387
Mama, I know he's fine.

494
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:56,756
It's just been such a long time.

495
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,025
I haven't seen him in years.

496
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:00,664
I don't remember what he does.

497
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:06,609
I have a...

498
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,414
A car repair shop.

499
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:10,584
You have, or you had?

500
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,689
-Melinda!
-No, mama.

501
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:16,831
This is a special day
for family.

502
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:19,336
Not for a man
who was too drunk

503
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:20,939
to attend
his own father's funeral.

504
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,044
Would you shut up?

505
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,515
How could you ruin
my birthday party

506
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,719
with this your stupid,
stuck-up ways?

507
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:30,426
-I'm sorry, mama. I'm sorry.
-Shut up!

508
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,635
Just shut up.

509
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,596
Hey, what do you say
we take a walk,

510
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:50,133
check out the pond?

511
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:52,637
Now, I haven't seen the pond
in years.

512
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:55,510
Sure.
It's still there.

513
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:57,614
All right, I'll get something
out of the car.

514
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,653
I'll catch up with you.
All right.

515
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:11,209
-A lot of memories down here.
-Yeah, yeah.

516
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,387
Yeah, there is.

517
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:21,063
What you been up to, man?

518
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,834
I tried to...

519
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,603
I tried to call you
a couple of times.

520
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,173
Your number keeps changing.

521
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,746
Well, I ain't been doing
nothing, man.

522
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:33,989
Did you ever get your...
Your gig back at the club?

523
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,828
No.

524
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:40,637
I got a promotion on Friday.

525
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,813
$10,000 raise.

526
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:47,885
My wife...

527
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,859
She's pregnant
with our third child.

528
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:56,636
Good things are happening.

529
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,041
And I... I hate it.

530
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:07,692
I... I hate my life, Othell.

531
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,597
What?

532
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,200
I hate my job.

533
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,070
I hate...

534
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:21,019
I don't like my wife...

535
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:24,628
Very much.

536
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:29,905
I'm living a life
I ain't choose.

537
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:32,577
That's 'cause
daddy chose it for you.

538
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,518
I... I didn't like it, but...

539
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:38,624
I understood
why you didn't come

540
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,526
to the funeral, you know.

541
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:44,001
I mean, you were
the only one out of all of us

542
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:45,703
who ever went after your dreams

543
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:48,143
instead of just doing
what senior told us to do.

544
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:52,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and he hated me for it.

545
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,759
Y'all all did.

546
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,095
I don't.

547
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,135
You... you shut me out.

548
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:09,119
I was always envious of you.

549
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:16,268
You know, I can't keep a job
to save my life.

550
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:21,110
I'm an alcoholic.

551
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:29,562
I lost my wife...
My best friend.

552
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:36,877
And my daughter wishes
that I was dead.

553
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:40,049
You envious of that?

554
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:45,627
Yeah.

555
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,201
At least you chose your misery.

556
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,915
Man.

557
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:59,255
You're crazy, man.
You're crazy.

558
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:00,926
Daddy, he...

559
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,802
He just didn't
understand you, Othell.

560
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:08,808
You scared him.

561
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,046
He was a man of routine.

562
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,052
He knew one way
to get to success.

563
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:18,695
We all just fell in line.

564
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,233
You refused.

565
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,739
You know, the day he died...

566
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:27,848
I started rummaging through...

567
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,918
Through his closet
in the library.

568
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:32,357
Remember, he didn't let anybody
go into it?

569
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,296
He kept these.

570
00:41:57,408 --> 00:42:00,148
Those are the playbills, man.

571
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,857
He was proud of you, brother.

572
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,400
He just didn't know
how to show it.

573
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,125
Thank you.

574
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:25,165
Thank you, man.

575
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:32,714
Come on, now!

576
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:33,916
Wait, wait!

577
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,290
Come on, man.

578
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,761
Are you out of your mind?

579
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:40,797
What's going on?
What's going on?

580
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,300
What's going on, Nima?

581
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:43,502
Your daughter slapped
Melinda.

582
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,274
-She did?
-Yes.

583
00:42:45,307 --> 00:42:47,212
Say something else about
my mama and I will do it again.

584
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:49,482
You better get this
little illegitimate cheat

585
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:50,952
out of my
mama's house!

586
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,156
Illegitimate?

587
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,830
Enough! Enough!
Enough, enough!

588
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:58,834
Quit yanking on me, James.

589
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,441
Lord, have mercy.

590
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:05,113
You want to kill me
on my birthday?

591
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:06,350
No, ma'am.

592
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,256
Now, quiet, Melinda.

593
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,094
Now, this...

594
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,933
Is your brother.

595
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:16,070
This is your blood.

596
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:18,508
He is family.

597
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:22,316
Well, where was family
during daddy's funeral?

598
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,820
Melinda...

599
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,191
-Where was blood then, mama?
-Melinda.

600
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:30,301
Where was he when daddy
kept calling for him

601
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,804
when they took
him off that machine?

602
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:35,342
Melinda, it is over.

603
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:38,818
This is done now.

604
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:44,930
Melinda...

605
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:51,477
not a day goes by...

606
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:56,520
That I don't regret...

607
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:59,860
Not coming to
daddy's funeral.

608
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:02,099
O, you don't even
have to do that.

609
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:04,336
No, mama, mama, please.

610
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,408
Let me say this.

611
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:14,156
I should have been there.

612
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:20,169
But I let my pride...

613
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:25,246
And my anger...

614
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:26,282
Stop me.

615
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:36,203
I let my pride
ruin a lot of things.

616
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,550
James...

617
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,020
Joe...

618
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:48,427
Marvin...

619
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:52,870
Melinda...

620
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:55,542
Man, I was so foolish.

621
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:00,652
And I'm sorry.

622
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:03,090
I'm really...

623
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:05,295
I'm really, really sorry

624
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,468
that I hurt my family
like that.

625
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:10,172
That's enough, o.

626
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,644
O, that's enough, baby.

627
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:15,048
That's good.

628
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:20,360
Now, we gonna put
all of this behind us!

629
00:45:20,393 --> 00:45:21,529
Now, Nima and Spence,

630
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,633
y'all gonna stay
in the guest rooms.

631
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,469
No, no.

632
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:27,274
We made a reservation
at a hotel.

633
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:28,978
-Good.
-Not anymore.

634
00:45:31,483 --> 00:45:33,120
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:35,357
Now...

636
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:40,435
Who is gonna have
some cake with me?

637
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:48,617
Today was a mess, Spence.

638
00:45:48,651 --> 00:45:50,287
Tell me about it.

639
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,060
I can't believe you smacked
that woman in the mouth.

640
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:55,432
She earned that slap.

641
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:59,341
You know, it's funny
how the remark

642
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:02,212
that preceded the slap
was about Othell, not your mom.

643
00:46:02,245 --> 00:46:04,183
No, it wasn't.

644
00:46:04,216 --> 00:46:05,586
Yeah, it was.

645
00:46:05,618 --> 00:46:07,256
Yeah, I was standing
right there,

646
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,294
and she said that
Othell was worthless and...

647
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:11,264
You know, it doesn't matter.

648
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,976
Came up with some new names.

649
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,285
They better be good
this time.

650
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:25,593
Kennedy for a girl
and Josiah for a boy.

651
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:28,667
I actually love those.

652
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,271
Yeah?

653
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:33,009
Well, I think we should
get started on them

654
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,513
right during the honeymoon.

655
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,148
Hey, no!

656
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,651
We said two years, remember?

657
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,288
I don't remember saying
two years.

658
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,559
I think that's something
we should start right now.

659
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:41,461
What do you think?

660
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:46,303
Yeah, we should start on that
right away.

661
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:55,488
Spencer,
your room is upstairs.

662
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,635
-But, see, we usually...
-Not in my house.

663
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:06,646
Yes, ma'am.

664
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:08,115
I'll pack my stuff.

665
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:10,587
I'm gonna go upstairs.

666
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:27,387
I thought we made up.

667
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,325
No, we haven't.

668
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,633
When are you gonna
get over this?

669
00:47:32,665 --> 00:47:36,740
Yeah, you gave me money
to start my car repair shop,

670
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:39,078
and it failed.

671
00:47:40,346 --> 00:47:43,355
Businesses fail every day.

672
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:45,324
<i>No, you fail every day.</i>

673
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,731
You know, you hated me
since we were little.

674
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:50,201
Yes, I have.

675
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:52,774
I got straight "as."
I got awards.

676
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:54,377
I got accepted into

677
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,618
one of the finest medical
institutions in this nation,

678
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:02,159
and my father complained
the whole time about you.

679
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:04,531
He couldn't even acknowledge
our accomplishments

680
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:06,168
without saying that he was glad

681
00:48:06,201 --> 00:48:07,804
that they were not
your failures.

682
00:48:07,837 --> 00:48:10,243
You were his beloved project.

683
00:48:10,275 --> 00:48:14,484
He reveled in your dysfunction,
the tortured artiste,

684
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,622
while we worked hard
for his love,

685
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,626
and he showered you with it.

686
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,400
Daddy hated me,
and you know it!

687
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:22,802
He didn't hate you!

688
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:25,239
You always opted
to go to the pain,

689
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:26,609
to go for the darkness.

690
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:30,217
You know,
you lived in that space.

691
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,222
Was it easier?

692
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,093
Is it easier than trying?

693
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,664
Is it easier
than being successful?

694
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:39,269
Is that easier than being loved?

695
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:41,539
I try, Melinda.
I try, I try.

696
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:43,444
You tried?

697
00:48:43,478 --> 00:48:45,182
What about
when I paid for you

698
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,817
to go back to school
10 years ago

699
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,786
and you quit?

700
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,593
What about when I paid
for your first car?

701
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,465
You were too cheap
to pay for the insurance.

702
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,138
What about when I paid
for the bulk of

703
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,474
your wedding
to my best friend?

704
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:02,719
Jeannette was my best friend,
and you ruined it!

705
00:49:02,752 --> 00:49:06,259
I've...

706
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:11,402
Already apologized
for all that.

707
00:49:11,435 --> 00:49:14,843
Yes, but you still refuse
to do anything with your life!

708
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:19,720
You look.
I'm through talking about this.

709
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:34,616
Nima?

710
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:38,724
Nima?

711
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:40,529
Little boy...

712
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:45,506
What do you need at this hour?

713
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:49,615
I... I left my toothbrush in...

714
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,852
I left my toothbrush
in Nima's bag.

715
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:53,322
I packed it in there.

716
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,797
Just a minute.

717
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:10,590
Toothbrush.

718
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,528
You know, mine,
it has the little...

719
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:13,698
Good night, Spence.

720
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,866
This will work.

721
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:35,676
Come in!

722
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:42,690
Well...

723
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,595
Since you're up...

724
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:47,600
I thought maybe we could talk
for a minute.

725
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:53,647
Yes, Ms. Babineaux.

726
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,386
You can call me grandma
if you want.

727
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:03,299
We love you, Nima.

728
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:06,440
I wish you had answered
one of those letters I sent you

729
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:08,945
when you was in college.

730
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:12,619
I understand.

731
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,765
When your parents split up,

732
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:22,438
Othell came
and lived with us.

733
00:51:22,472 --> 00:51:24,543
And he tried.

734
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,281
He really did.

735
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:29,619
He tried so hard.

736
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:31,824
But then he just...

737
00:51:31,857 --> 00:51:34,597
He gave up.

738
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:37,303
Then...

739
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:39,608
My husband
just kicked him out.

740
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:44,551
But we should have...

741
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,589
We should have tried harder.

742
00:51:48,058 --> 00:51:50,931
We should have forced our way
into your life.

743
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:59,548
And for that,
I am very, very sorry.

744
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:23,465
Thank you, baby.

745
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,787
Now y'all get home safe, now.

746
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:38,896
You take care of yourself, son.

747
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:40,132
I will, mama.

748
00:52:40,164 --> 00:52:43,771
And take care of Nima, too.

749
00:52:43,804 --> 00:52:46,545
Thank you for the...
Hospitality, Mrs. Babineaux.

750
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,850
You're welcome any time,
Spence.

751
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,754
Bye, everyone.

752
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:53,861
Nima, can I talk to you
for a moment?

753
00:53:00,574 --> 00:53:03,547
I wanted to make sure
you had these before you left.

754
00:53:08,457 --> 00:53:10,461
He spent his whole paycheck
on them

755
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:12,666
on your 10th birthday.

756
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:15,739
But he just didn't make it
to your party.

757
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:20,616
I've had them here ever since.

758
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:22,652
Sapphire.

759
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:23,754
It's my birthstone.

760
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:28,164
I'm sorry, I can't...

761
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,134
Take these.

762
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:31,939
But they're yours.

763
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:33,675
They're from your dad.

764
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:35,378
I know.

765
00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:40,823
I can't. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

766
00:53:42,192 --> 00:53:44,029
Okay.

767
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:52,848
You make it home safe, now.

768
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:54,653
Okay.

769
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:10,552
Listen...

770
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:12,923
I know I told you
I needed to see more,

771
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:15,829
but the owner want to fill
this spot as soon as possible,

772
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:17,901
so I'm putting myself
on the line here, o.

773
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:19,937
Look, Benny, man...

774
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:25,515
I ain't played in a long time,
you know?

775
00:54:26,784 --> 00:54:29,690
Man, I'm still practicing.

776
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,597
It's like
riding a bike, baby.

777
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,169
You got this, you know?

778
00:54:35,201 --> 00:54:37,207
Yeah, I know, but...

779
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,816
See, if I had known
you were gonna...

780
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,588
Hey.

781
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:48,898
I'm Othell Babineaux.

782
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:51,670
All right.
Let's go.

783
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,781
It's been a, you know,
it's been a while.

784
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:20,061
See, most of the time, I like,

785
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:22,167
you know, fix cars and...

786
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,108
So it's been a while.

787
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:54,700
Stop wasting my time.

788
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,906
Damn.

789
00:56:15,207 --> 00:56:17,745
Jeannette...

790
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,650
It's o.

791
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:21,053
Can we talk?

792
00:56:30,006 --> 00:56:33,279
Hey.
Hello.

793
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:35,850
You look beautiful, as usual.

794
00:56:35,883 --> 00:56:37,653
You have 10 minutes.

795
00:56:39,058 --> 00:56:41,795
Jeannette,
can't we chat a minute?

796
00:56:41,828 --> 00:56:44,101
Now you have nine.

797
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:49,278
Well, Nima hates me
a little less after Savannah.

798
00:56:49,311 --> 00:56:51,851
Perhaps.

799
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:56,760
Did she tell you
that she slapped Melinda?

800
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,298
Yes.

801
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,136
How is Melinda?

802
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:03,808
She misses you.

803
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:05,711
Still no drinking?

804
00:57:05,745 --> 00:57:08,986
This is water.

805
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:11,858
Almost three months.

806
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:16,601
Well, actually, it's been
two months, 12 days,

807
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,674
and three and a half hours.

808
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:22,680
You cannot mess this up.

809
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:28,125
You've never even given me
a chance to mess up.

810
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:32,869
What about the club?

811
00:57:35,306 --> 00:57:40,151
I went to get my gig back
and froze up.

812
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:44,960
What did you want to show me?

813
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:48,232
I know it's Nima's birthday
Tuesday.

814
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,870
Yeah?

815
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,677
What is this?

816
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,415
I want to do
something special.

817
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:59,188
You want to take her
to the bistro?

818
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:00,959
You think she'll go?

819
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:06,803
I'll see what I can do.

820
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:43,346
Nima?

821
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,954
Nima, I thought we were
meeting at the restaurant.

822
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:56,908
You remind me
so much of your mother.

823
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:04,291
I know you want to know
why I wasn't there

824
00:59:04,324 --> 00:59:06,927
and why it seems
like I didn't try,

825
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,732
but...

826
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:12,040
I don't have those answers.

827
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:18,886
I ask myself
the same thing every day.

828
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,163
I always...

829
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:26,835
thought you
deserved a father.

830
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,978
Just one much better than me.

831
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:35,187
I know this...

832
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,024
Won't be worth
much to you,

833
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:41,533
but you're
the kind of daughter

834
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:44,505
a father
would dream of having.

835
00:59:48,147 --> 00:59:50,817
Smart...

836
00:59:50,851 --> 00:59:52,824
Talented.

837
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,824
Just...

838
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:13,466
Just some things...

839
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,539
I needed you to know.

840
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:38,952
Have a seat.

841
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:41,122
What's up, man?

842
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:42,994
Well, I called you down here
because...

843
01:00:43,026 --> 01:00:45,131
I thought about it
a lot.

844
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,970
I talked to Jax.

845
01:00:48,002 --> 01:00:51,910
I let Jax know that
you're working on being clean,

846
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,582
and you're succeeding.

847
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:56,053
So I got you
another audition tomorrow.

848
01:00:57,389 --> 01:01:00,395
Come on, man.
We go way back.

849
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:02,599
We done played
hundreds of gigs together.

850
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:04,670
It's just
a walk down memory Lane,

851
01:01:04,705 --> 01:01:07,043
except you're clean
this time.

852
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:11,385
Well...

853
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:16,895
I... I am clean, you know,
I'm clean, I'm clean.

854
01:01:16,929 --> 01:01:20,904
No shakes, no nothing, but...

855
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:23,309
Ain't no buts, brother.

856
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:25,447
Tell me you got it.

857
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:30,090
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow, 10:00.

858
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:37,071
All right, I'll be ready.

859
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:39,109
Why can't they sit
next to each other?

860
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:41,980
Trust me, they shouldn't.

861
01:01:42,013 --> 01:01:44,319
Has your boss rsvp'd yet?

862
01:01:44,353 --> 01:01:47,525
Yeah, they're right here.

863
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:50,131
They want fish and steak.

864
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,002
Good job!

865
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,318
-We're done?
-We're done.

866
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:02,522
-All done?
-All done!

867
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:05,998
Finally!

868
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:10,205
Excited?

869
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:14,315
Did you finish the music
for your concert?

870
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:16,019
Yes.

871
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:19,191
I did.

872
01:02:19,223 --> 01:02:21,194
And you're inviting your dad?

873
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:24,102
No.

874
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:26,639
I'm not inviting him.

875
01:02:28,643 --> 01:02:30,715
Okay.

876
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,119
Don't even think about
doing that.

877
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:34,422
What? What did I do?

878
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:37,229
I know you.
Just don't.

879
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:40,468
I'm not gonna
invite your dad.

880
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:43,574
No, I mean it.

881
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:05,687
Benny?

882
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:07,625
It's Spence.

883
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,495
Right, yeah.
It's good to hear.

884
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,632
Hey, listen,

885
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:13,268
Nima's doing a small performance
for friends and family.

886
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:15,339
It would mean a lot
if you were there,

887
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:17,110
but I need you
to wear a suit.

888
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:22,555
Yeah.
Yeah, between you and me.

889
01:03:22,588 --> 01:03:23,657
All right.

890
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:28,301
You ready?

891
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:31,440
Time to shine, baby.
All right.

892
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,709
Thank you, man.

893
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,312
Don't thank him yet.

894
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:15,129
Looks like we found
our new piano player.

895
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:16,432
That's right!

896
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:18,203
Congrats, baby boy,
you're back!

897
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:20,074
But they didn't do
a good job.

898
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,610
No, I know.

899
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:23,112
-Hey, babe.
-Hey, ladies.

900
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:24,648
Hey, how are you?

901
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:25,818
That's my seat.

902
01:04:25,852 --> 01:04:27,254
You were late.

903
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:28,591
Sit right here, hon.

904
01:04:28,624 --> 01:04:30,729
Snooze you lose, I'm sorry.

905
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:33,300
I get the nice view for once.

906
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:35,370
So...

907
01:04:35,403 --> 01:04:38,610
She was telling me that
she likes her father again.

908
01:04:38,643 --> 01:04:40,783
Okay, no, she's not saying
that she likes her father,

909
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:42,585
she's saying
that she's trying.

910
01:04:42,618 --> 01:04:44,389
Okay, don't do that.

911
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,892
She needs to reconcile with him.

912
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:48,198
This is a good, mature decision.

913
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:49,266
-No.
-Yes.

914
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,570
He had his chance.

915
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:52,506
Why does he get
the best part of her now?

916
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:53,842
He missed the teenage attitude,

917
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:55,613
and the impoverished
college years.

918
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:57,852
She's all
shiny and grown-up now.

919
01:04:57,884 --> 01:04:59,589
All right,
maybe you didn't hear that,

920
01:04:59,622 --> 01:05:01,290
but Nima told us
his whole life story.

921
01:05:01,324 --> 01:05:02,427
The man is damaged.

922
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,496
That accounts for his absence.

923
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:05,233
Come on, now, he's trying.

924
01:05:05,265 --> 01:05:06,903
I think she's setting
herself up to get hurt again.

925
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,706
Okay, you are such
a hypocrite.

926
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,212
You spoke to your father,
remember?

927
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,882
Yeah. Because he was dying.

928
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:15,454
Othell still has some time
to suffer.

929
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:16,589
Okay, the point is, okay,

930
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:18,727
she's making some huge
emotional strides in her life,

931
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,899
and we need to be there for her,
okay?

932
01:05:20,931 --> 01:05:22,502
Well, is he coming to
the wedding?

933
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:28,614
I'm permitted to speak?

934
01:05:28,648 --> 01:05:29,684
Yeah.

935
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,189
No, he's not.

936
01:05:32,222 --> 01:05:34,226
It would be weird.
Okay.

937
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:35,695
Fine by me.

938
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:38,368
Now, can we talk about
something less depressing?

939
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,575
-Like boys?
-No, I said less depressing.

940
01:05:41,607 --> 01:05:42,910
Okay.

941
01:05:57,339 --> 01:05:58,878
Come on, man.

942
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,312
I...

943
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:03,219
I thought I had a suit
in here.

944
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:06,758
-Thank you.
-Hey. Sweetie, how are you?

945
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:14,676
-Well, hello.
-Hey.

946
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:15,944
I can't wait to hear
your music.

947
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:18,718
I can't wait, either.

948
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:23,894
Before you get started,
I got something to tell you.

949
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:25,831
What?

950
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:28,304
I...

951
01:06:28,337 --> 01:06:30,475
I invited your father.

952
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,757
He said he was coming.

953
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,429
Okay.

954
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,968
I guess that's okay.
Yeah?

955
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:45,439
Okay.

956
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,783
You'll do great.

957
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,297
Shoot!

958
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:13,832
I want to thank you all
for coming.

959
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,404
It means so much.

960
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:19,601
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

961
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:22,906
I'm sorry!

962
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:25,378
I'm sorry.

963
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:28,049
It's okay.

964
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:31,725
Could everyone please
give us a minute?

965
01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:44,417
Nima, listen, I...

966
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,754
Shut up.

967
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:48,392
Just shut up!

968
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:52,066
I'm tired of talking about
what you don't do.

969
01:08:52,099 --> 01:08:54,873
Let's talk about what you did.

970
01:08:57,577 --> 01:09:02,656
I'm a mess because of you.

971
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:05,059
I can't love my fiancé
the way I want to

972
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:08,133
because of you.

973
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:13,411
I am curt, I'm mean,
and I'm dissatisfied with life

974
01:09:13,443 --> 01:09:15,481
<i>because of you.</i>

975
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:22,931
I so desperately wanted
to be a daddy's girl.

976
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:28,775
I clung to my mother's father
for dear life.

977
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:33,585
And when he died,
so did a piece of me.

978
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:36,825
I've put the burden on my mother

979
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:40,901
to be my everything
because of you,

980
01:09:40,933 --> 01:09:42,838
and you know what kills me?

981
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:45,677
I keep waiting
for Spence to leave.

982
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:51,724
Because I can't possibly
wrap my mind around

983
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:54,161
why he would stay!

984
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:57,702
Because you didn't!

985
01:09:57,734 --> 01:10:01,042
You're my dad!

986
01:10:01,075 --> 01:10:04,682
Dads are supposed to be there.

987
01:10:04,716 --> 01:10:06,753
Because I'm yours!

988
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:19,614
<i>Don't ever contact me again!</i>

989
01:10:23,822 --> 01:10:27,730
Jeannette...

990
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:30,835
You're never going to tell her,
are you?

991
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:42,962
I'm okay.

992
01:10:45,099 --> 01:10:47,505
I just had to get that out.

993
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:53,316
You sure?

994
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,754
I don't want to
talk about it.

995
01:10:55,788 --> 01:10:58,226
But aren't you, like, at
least a little concerned

996
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,897
about why he didn't show up?

997
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:04,639
Are you serious?

998
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:07,312
Why don't you ever take my side?

999
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:09,883
It's not about taking sides.
I'm not taking anybody's side.

1000
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,656
It's just that we were making
some really good strides,

1001
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,893
and all of a...
"We"?

1002
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:16,764
The last time I checked,

1003
01:11:16,798 --> 01:11:19,670
<i>I was the one who was given
the ultimatum</i>

1004
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:23,846
about getting to know my dad
or losing my fiancé.

1005
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,116
I never said that.

1006
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:26,684
I didn't...
I never said those words.

1007
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,991
Spence, look,
I grew up without a father.

1008
01:11:30,023 --> 01:11:34,668
And surprise, surprise,
it has affected me negatively.

1009
01:11:34,702 --> 01:11:37,341
Do you know
how many books I've read?

1010
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:40,045
How many articles
I have combed through

1011
01:11:40,078 --> 01:11:41,347
trying to be better?

1012
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,186
I have made peace
with the fact

1013
01:11:43,218 --> 01:11:45,725
that I am not gonna be the girl
who has a dad!

1014
01:11:45,757 --> 01:11:47,227
You haven't made peace.

1015
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,033
You're the opposite of peace.
You make war, Nima.

1016
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:54,776
You make war with me every day,
you make war with yourself.

1017
01:11:54,808 --> 01:11:56,580
You're not at peace.

1018
01:11:57,281 --> 01:11:59,719
Spence, I am broken.

1019
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,700
I didn't ask for you
to make me whole.

1020
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,941
I just want you to love
the pieces.

1021
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:13,983
You think I don't?

1022
01:12:17,456 --> 01:12:19,761
But you... you can fix
those pieces.

1023
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,764
You could fix them
if you chose to.

1024
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:27,711
I don't even know why
we're getting married.

1025
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,649
What did you say?

1026
01:12:30,682 --> 01:12:33,056
-What did you say?
-You heard what I said.

1027
01:12:33,088 --> 01:12:36,328
I don't think
we should be getting married.

1028
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:38,933
I mean, look at us!

1029
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:40,236
You don't want
to get married?

1030
01:12:40,268 --> 01:12:41,739
No, I don't want
to get married.

1031
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:43,177
You don't want
to get married to me?

1032
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:45,247
Look at us! I don't want
to get married like this.

1033
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,884
-You don't even like me.
-Fine, fine!

1034
01:12:47,918 --> 01:12:50,090
Fine. Fine.

1035
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:52,428
Can you please just stop
the car so I can get out?

1036
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,864
No, I'm not stopping, no.

1037
01:12:53,898 --> 01:12:55,868
No, you're not gonna
run away from me.

1038
01:12:55,902 --> 01:12:59,109
Stop the car
so I can get out!

1039
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,879
Can you stop the car now?

1040
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,629
Hey, what can I get for you?

1041
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:33,915
I'll be back with you in a sec.

1042
01:13:49,345 --> 01:13:51,449
What in the world
are you doing

1043
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:52,953
in a place like this?

1044
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,841
I should knock you out,

1045
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:05,780
right here in this bar, man.

1046
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:12,025
You... You ruined
my relationship...

1047
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:15,031
Just like you ruined yours.

1048
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:17,803
I missed
the performance tonight

1049
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:20,341
because
if she does forgive me,

1050
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:23,148
I ain't got nothing
to give her.

1051
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,054
I don't care anymore!

1052
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,893
Everything all right?

1053
01:14:31,465 --> 01:14:32,902
So what you having, man?

1054
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,739
Nothing.

1055
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:38,381
He's an alcoholic.

1056
01:14:58,321 --> 01:14:59,557
Hey, get off me!

1057
01:14:59,589 --> 01:15:02,095
You're not going anywhere
like this!

1058
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:03,565
You're not driving anywhere
like this.

1059
01:15:03,598 --> 01:15:05,136
I said... I said get off me!

1060
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:08,041
You're not driving anywhere
like this.

1061
01:15:08,073 --> 01:15:10,077
Now, give me them keys.

1062
01:15:10,111 --> 01:15:11,948
Give me the keys!

1063
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:18,963
I'm taking you home,
and you're gonna sober up...

1064
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,976
and go apologize
to your future wife.

1065
01:15:26,878 --> 01:15:29,251
Now, you come on.

1066
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:30,954
Come on, son.

1067
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,761
Come on.

1068
01:16:00,314 --> 01:16:01,984
Rough night?

1069
01:16:07,898 --> 01:16:08,967
Rum.

1070
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:12,106
I think I had too much rum.

1071
01:16:14,276 --> 01:16:15,613
It's not funny.

1072
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:23,996
Baby, I'm sorry.

1073
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,603
I'm sorry.

1074
01:16:26,635 --> 01:16:29,008
Spence, I don't want to be
in a marriage

1075
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,077
where you won't let me
be my true self.

1076
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:33,884
I know, me, too.

1077
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,254
And giving you my everything...
It isn't hard,

1078
01:16:36,288 --> 01:16:38,294
but it's scary.

1079
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:46,276
It takes courage for you
to love me the way you love me,

1080
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:50,085
and I always
want to reciprocate that.

1081
01:16:50,118 --> 01:16:52,155
You do, and I'm sorry if I...

1082
01:16:55,159 --> 01:16:57,566
if I don't make
you feel like that.

1083
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,437
I'm so happy.

1084
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:01,341
You have to know that.

1085
01:17:01,373 --> 01:17:04,079
But you have to let me...

1086
01:17:04,113 --> 01:17:06,017
Let me do things on my own time.

1087
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:07,221
Okay.

1088
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:12,030
Baby, do you still
want to marry me?

1089
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:13,933
Yes.

1090
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:30,466
How much rum did you have?

1091
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,703
A lot.

1092
01:17:44,997 --> 01:17:48,973
This is so nice!

1093
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:51,645
It actually is, mama.

1094
01:17:51,677 --> 01:17:54,349
There is no way
that I would ever

1095
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,989
come to my grandbaby's
wedding without you.

1096
01:17:57,657 --> 01:17:59,995
You need to be here.

1097
01:18:09,514 --> 01:18:11,551
Let me look at you!

1098
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:14,591
Look at you!
You haven't aged a day!

1099
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,094
Well, neither have you.

1100
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:17,630
Look at you!

1101
01:18:17,663 --> 01:18:20,471
My goodness.

1102
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:28,186
I'm just here because...

1103
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,993
You are her father.

1104
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:37,672
Jeannette and I,
we had a long talk last night.

1105
01:18:39,242 --> 01:18:42,048
She's gonna make it right.

1106
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,418
Today.

1107
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,223
I am.

1108
01:19:02,724 --> 01:19:03,993
Hi, baby.

1109
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,199
Hi, mama.

1110
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:09,037
Come here, sweetheart.

1111
01:19:09,069 --> 01:19:11,208
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

1112
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:17,756
What's wrong?

1113
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,433
This is so hard for me to say.

1114
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:29,579
I've been lying to you
about your father.

1115
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:34,256
What do you mean?

1116
01:19:34,289 --> 01:19:37,563
I know I've made it seem like
he never tried to...

1117
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:39,701
To see you or call you

1118
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:43,407
or send you cards
on your birthday.

1119
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,346
But he did.

1120
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,752
He sent you letters for years...

1121
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:52,626
along with...

1122
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:55,499
Little gifts on your birthday.

1123
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:08,092
And he sent you money,
whatever he had at the time.

1124
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,737
Mama, why would you
hide this from me?

1125
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:19,447
I loved your father so much,
Nima.

1126
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,122
And when he left,
he took my heart with him.

1127
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:24,460
I was just so mad.

1128
01:20:25,928 --> 01:20:27,532
All I wanted was him.

1129
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:30,271
I didn't care about the money
or any of that.

1130
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,710
I just wanted him,
but he never got it.

1131
01:20:32,743 --> 01:20:35,415
So when he left,
I just decided

1132
01:20:35,448 --> 01:20:39,389
that I would make him feel
the same pain that I felt

1133
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:40,893
by keeping you away.

1134
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,450
You tell me this
on my wedding day?

1135
01:20:52,484 --> 01:20:54,221
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1136
01:20:54,253 --> 01:20:56,792
I just want you
to have a fresh start.

1137
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:08,616
Thank you.

1138
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:13,426
You know, one day,
you just wake up

1139
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,598
and you decide
not to be mad anymore?

1140
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,609
Today is that day.

1141
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,583
Sweetheart, he's here.

1142
01:21:25,784 --> 01:21:27,320
It's Mrs. Parcell.

1143
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:29,827
Nima, are you ready yet?

1144
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:32,398
You have to help me
fix my face.

1145
01:21:32,432 --> 01:21:33,435
Okay.

1146
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:40,649
Today is your day to make
the memories that you want.

1147
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,844
Who gives this woman away?

1148
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:45,583
She does.

1149
01:22:49,023 --> 01:22:51,294
Well, I mean, I do,

1150
01:22:51,327 --> 01:22:53,399
but, mainly, her.

1151
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:55,804
<i>We do.</i>

1152
01:22:57,975 --> 01:22:59,712
Okay.

1153
01:23:19,084 --> 01:23:20,989
Sheila!

1154
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:34,484
This...

1155
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:36,788
This is really
a beautiful wedding.

1156
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:39,328
Yeah, it actually is.

1157
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:44,905
You look wonderful.

1158
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:46,976
Thank you.
You do, too.

1159
01:23:47,008 --> 01:23:48,747
I love that dress.

1160
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,483
You always did
look good in pink.

1161
01:23:50,516 --> 01:23:53,023
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1162
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:58,799
I've really missed you.

1163
01:24:01,638 --> 01:24:04,079
Well, I missed you, too.

1164
01:24:07,818 --> 01:24:09,421
Girl!

1165
01:24:09,455 --> 01:24:12,527
I'm so happy for you.

1166
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,736
She's gorgeous...
And feisty, too!

1167
01:24:15,769 --> 01:24:18,674
Do you know that she hit me?
I heard!

1168
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,010
My god!

1169
01:24:20,043 --> 01:24:21,948
I told her, too, I said,
"I'm gonna get you!"

1170
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,487
I could not believe that
when they told me.

1171
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,057
I am so sorry.
God, that's okay.

1172
01:24:27,091 --> 01:24:28,996
It's quite all right.

1173
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:32,002
It's so nice
to get to talk to you again.

1174
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:33,973
I know, you, too.

1175
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,590
We have a last-minute
surprise for the happy couple.

1176
01:24:42,623 --> 01:24:43,928
For their first dance,

1177
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,696
we'd like to serenade
them in style.

1178
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:48,503
Please let me introduce
the bride's father...

1179
01:24:48,535 --> 01:24:50,906
Mr. Othell Babineaux.
