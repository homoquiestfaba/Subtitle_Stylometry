Let's talk about the meaning of love.

1216
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:25,277
That's the meaning of love?

1217
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,115
Malone's family's not dead.

1218
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,850
He made up those stories
so no one could get to them.

1219
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,721
See, he knows in our line of work,

1220
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:35,023
the best way to hurt a man
is through the people that he loves,

1221
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,293
so he started
moving them around years ago.

1222
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,529
But then one day you showed up,
and she was gone.

1223
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,265
She didn't even bother to leave you
a note, did she, Malone?

1224
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:49,571
Or were you just too drunk
to read it?

1225
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:52,771
Truth is, they're worth
a whole lot more to you

1226
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,678
than you'll ever be to them.

1227
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:57,250
That may be.

1228
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:03,154
But unless you prove my family's safe,
your little carrier pigeon gets it.

1229
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,422
Nobody's worth that much to me.

1230
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,929

Okay, Whitmore, so you got me.

1233
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:32,476
Why the runaround if all you were
gonna do is kill me, huh?

1234
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,555
You've already done it.

1235
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:43,654
You see, you've now murdered
everyone who's ever worked for me,

1236
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,996
which means I'm finally free
to take my business legit.

1237
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:49,728
Fuck!

1238
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,067
You can't buy respectability,

1239
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:55,609
but you can kill everyone who
knows you've ever been bad.

1240
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:05,980
You murdered my entire syndicate,

1241
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:08,920
took my hapless,
right-hand man hostage,

1242
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:12,481
forced your way
into my humble abode,

1243
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:15,791
even murdered the love of my life.

1244
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,958
Now your corpse
is gonna take the fall.

1245
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:37,009
You are a hard man to kill.

1246
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:42,283
But lucky for me,
hard is not the same as impossible.

1247
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:50,696
My wife's no longer around,
so you can't blackmail me anymore.

1248

You wanna know where I got it?

Huh? You wanna know
where they are?

1252
