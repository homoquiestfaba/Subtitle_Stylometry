1
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,327
God damn, it's hot.

2
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,199
Are you done yet?

3
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,733
Early admissions?

4
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,445
lvy Leaguers love it.

5
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,946
Gets 'em all wet.

6
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,441
All that studying
finally pays off,

7
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,453
and you get to leave
this hellhole a year early.

8
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,490
Damn, what is it,
like 95 degrees?

9
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,592
Can't wait to go
to college, man.

10
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,261
lt's like natural selection.

11
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,602
Every hot chick
you meet's got a brain.

12
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,945
Not mine.

13
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,283
Not mine.

14
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,254
You never forget
the sight of a dead body

15
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,817
but then again,
l was experiencing

16
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,863
a lot of things
for the first time.

17
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,024
l guess it's just
part of growing up.

18
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,178
How many calories
in each stick?

19
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,046
550.

20
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,746
How many grams of fat?

21
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,189
32 grams, but we do
cook it in vegetable oil.

22
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,489
l'll take two then.

23
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,927
Could l have mine
extra crispy?

24
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,929
Sure. No problem.

25
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,565
lt's not as hard as it looks.

26
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,465
All it takes is
the extra five minutes

27
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,436
reading the manual
after you get hired.

28
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,166
The way l saw it,
as long as it made it

29
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,142
on my college application,
it was all worth it.

30
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,575
You just can't count
on good grades

31
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,112
to get into a decent
school anymore.

32
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,656
Virgil and l have been friends
since the fourth grade,

33
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,094
when he moved to my school.

34
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,596
He was the other smart kid.

35
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,695
Let's go, you perv.

36
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,401
Dude, did you see the
fucking rack on that?

37
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,273
Man, middle-aged
hos are the finest.

38
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,448
This is Han, Virgil's cousin.

39
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,314
He's everything Virgil's not.

40
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,013
You ladies ready?

41
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,895
l shoot 215 free throws a day.

42
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,907
My goal is to beat
Calvin Murphy's record

43
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,566
of 95.8 percent.

44
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,736
That's 207 baskets.

45
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,412
Punctilious.

46
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,715
''Marked by or concerned
about precise, exact accordance

47
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,256
with the details
of codes or conventions.''

48
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,224
To get a perfect score
on my next SAT

49
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,852
l needed to improve
my verbal score by 60 points.

50
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,555
l picked a new word every day

51
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,723
and repeated it over
and over again.

52
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,597
They say if you repeat
something enough times,

53
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,397
it becomes part of you.

54
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,734
Punctilious. Adjective.

55
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,434
''Marked by or concerned
about precise, exact accordance

56
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,567
with the details
of codes or conventions.''

57
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,558
Oh, we could rock

58
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,690
Or we could bomb

59
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,235
Or we could try

60
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,568
Like super hard

61
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,904
Or we could come

62
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,104
Or we could lose

63
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:26,118
Or we could totally
totally, totally freak you

64
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,586
l wanna spread my dementia

65
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,591
l wanna knock it
off the line

66
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,058
Give me attention

67
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,928
Every day and every night

68
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,227
Whoo-hoo...

69
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,596
Whoo-hoo...

70
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,473
Stephanie Vandergosh.

71
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,599
lt's girls like her

72
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,235
that make you realize
that life's not fair.

73
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,939
l swear, l saw her in a porn.

74
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,311
What are you babbling about?

75
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,882
Daric Loo, academic all-star.

76
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,751
But don't let the letterman
jacket fool you--

77
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,881
it's for tennis.

78
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,390
Hey, so we're using your
credit card, right?

79
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,224
lf we get caught, l'm saying
you stole it from me.

80
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,263
Nigga, please.

81
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,890
The amoeba

82
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,092
is a primitive
and simple organism,

83
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:23,507
which absorbs its prey
and incorporates it into itself.

84
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,739
Miss Vandergosh and Miss Nabham,

85
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,611
is there something you would
like to share with the class?

86
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,317
l thought as much.

87
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,085
Uh, Mr. Farmer, please switch
seats with Miss Vandergosh.

88
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,932
Now that l have your
complete attention,

89
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,969
today we will see a movie.

90
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,004
lt is entitled <i>The Amoeba.</i>

91
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,162
Lunch time was club time.

92
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,824
This was where everyone loaded
up on their extracurricular

93
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,231
activities
for their college app.

94
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,633
And, of course, Daric was
the president of every club.

95
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,572
...but, being part of an ecology
club, it's important that we do.

96
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,338
Unfortunately, all
the really worthwhile things

97
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,903
about high school
were few and far between.

98
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,347
She is right down the hall

99
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,384
Well, what l'm
most concerned about

100
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,920
are the abrasions
on her arms and her back.

101
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,096
lt was my fault-- l
fell down some stairs,

102
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,467
but l feel fine now.

103
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,471
Don't get me wrong.

104
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,598
l mean, l think there's some

105
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,335
pretty fine-looking
bitches in high school.

106
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,376
lt's just that they're all

107
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,876
so fucking stingy
about giving it up.

108
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,071
Dude, you're a fucking virgin.

109
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,205
Dude, l can get laid
whenever l want to.

110
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,217
Any time, anywhere, any place.

111
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,048
Yeah, by who, your
middle-aged aunt?

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,554
No, but your mom's been
looking mighty fine lately.

113
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,680
Hey, shut the fuck up.

114
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,657
Especially with those...
what was that thing

115
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,783
she bought the other day?

116
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,927
Okay, it comes to $482.82.

117
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,203
ls your brother Carl?

118
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,538
Yeah.

119
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,169
l thought you looked familiar.

120
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,271
l-l'm Virgil.
l was in, uh, Cub Scouts

121
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,406
with your brother.

122
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,972
Oh, this is my friend, Ben.

123
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,583
-Hi.
-Hey.

124
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,210
So, uh, what are you
doing these days?

125
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,720
l just got out of college.

126
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,222
Oh, what was your major?

127
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,052
Theater.

128
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,153
Theater. That's, that's...

129
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,558
l love the theater, you know.

130
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,096
-lt's a...
-Sign here.

131
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,724
That makes you, like,
a thespian, right?

132
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,598
You know, you-you have that,
like, kind of an ''X'' factor,

133
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,636
that charisma thing.

134
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,604
You definitely
got it going, really.

135
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,798
Thanks.

136
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,942
Well, it was nice
seeing you again.

137
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,273
Yeah. So... plays.

138
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,938
Let me know if
you're ever in one or...

139
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,946
-Hey, Virg...
-So.

140
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,949
-Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah, cool.

141
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:18,984
Yeah, di...?

142
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,612
What the fuck was that?

143
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,620
What?

144
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,815
You're gonna get us caught!

145
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,822
Watch it!

146
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,825
Like she's gonna go for you.

147
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,451
At least l try.

148
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,527
That's enough, girls.

149
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,301
We were always pissed at Virgil,
but we always let it slide.

150
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,100
We had to--
he's like the little puppy

151
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,764
that keeps shitting
on the carpet.

152
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,773
Hey, Virg.

153
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,970
What color is the
sticker today, man?

154
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,637
Wake up!

155
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,975
Orange.

156
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,016
Give 'em up.

157
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,212
Let's go.

158
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,159
Fuck you.

159
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,517
Hi.

160
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,451
Hi.

161
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,422
lt's my little brother,
and he came home

162
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,788
with all this computer stuff
he can't afford.

163
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,951
So my mom...

164
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,188
Yeah. Do you have a receipt?

165
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,342
lt started with
a pack of baseball cards,

166
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,471
and then it snowballed.

167
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,709
l guess it just felt good
to do things

168
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,479
that l couldn't put
on my college application.

169
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,248
Besides, it was suburbia...

170
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,915
we had nothing better to do.

171
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,890
Our straight A's
were our alibis,

172
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,392
our passports to freedom.

173
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,723
Going to a study group

174
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,026
would get us out of the house
until 4:00 in the morning.

175
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,932
As long as our grades
were there, we were trusted.

176
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,660
We had it all.

177
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,931
Well, almost.

178
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,369
''Uncap the needle.''

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,670
''Swab the finger
with the rubbing alcohol.''

180
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,207
''Prick the finger.''

181
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,711
Come on, Ben.

182
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,778
On three.

183
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,946
One...

184
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,855
See, that wasn't so bad.

185
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,459
All right, let's go.
Come on, now.

186
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,296
Good job. Run! Come on, now.

187
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,529
Get down, get down,
run, run, run.

188
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,665
Stay low when you make
that pass.

189
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,264
Got to get in front of him.
ln front of him!

190
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,537
Dive, come on!
Who wants that ball?

191
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,543
Who wants it?

192
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,943
Don't stand up.

193
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,503
Do not stand up.

194
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,215
Make two, we'll go home.

195
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,540
Hey, Stephanie.

196
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,408
Oh, hey, Ben.

197
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,572
How's it going?

198
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,910
Good.

199
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,915
How's your finger?

200
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,916
Oh.

201
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,213
l'll live.

202
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,811
You have a Band-Aid on it.

203
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,913
Yeah.

204
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,288
lt's a pin prick.

205
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,623
Don't you want to be
a doctor or something?

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,925
lf l don't play
pro basketball.

207
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,895
Aren't you a little short?

208
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,093
Only the size
of your heart matters.

209
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,601
That's corny.

210
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,834
What about you?
What do you want to be?

211
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,836
A cop.

212
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,640
Really? Aren't you
a little too short?

213
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,079
Not when l have this.

214
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,241
Ooh.

215
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,183
You're late.

216
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,857
Sorry.

217
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,125
And you're not wearing
a helmet.

218
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,666
Oh. Ben, this is
my boyfriend, Steve.

219
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,832
Steve, this is Ben,
my lab partner.

220
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,399
Oh, yeah.

221
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,775
l have something for you.

222
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,280
What is this?

223
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,475
This isn't even due
until next week.

224
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,916
l had some free time
so l thought that--

225
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,248
We're lab partners.

226
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,653
We're supposed
to do this together.

227
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,056
Give me a call.

228
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,891
We'll meet to do
the assignment.

229
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,337
-Let's go.
-Later.

230
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,048
lt's amazing what the right

231
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,554
piece of clothing
can do for your image.

232
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,081
l knew it was all bullshit,
but, hell, l was milking it

233
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,787
for all it was worth.

234
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,658
At first it didn't matter
that l rarely saw

235
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,754
any playing time.

236
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,799
l was part of the team.

237
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,300
But like everything else
in life, you get sick of it.

238
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,114
At least it'll look good
on my college app.

239
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,251
Okay.

240
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,788
Ain't no party
like a Wildcat party

241
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,589
Ain't no party
like a Wildcat party.

242
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,596
Look at that ass.

243
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,295
Yeah. What's up, Ben?

244
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,302
Hey, Daric.

245
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,395
Hey, you got a sec?

246
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,099
l'm trying to finish up
this assignment.

247
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,140
-Okay.
-Cool.

248
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,078
So, Ben, how do you feel
about being a benchwarmer?

249
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,079
What?

250
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,412
Well, you don't get
to play much, right?

251
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,453
Yeah, but we all have
our roles on the team.

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,886
And what is your role?

253
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,389
l don't know.
l just hustle.

254
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,892
Well, then how come you don't
get to play in the games?

255
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,553
Well, it's up to the coach.

256
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,891
Well, how do you feel

257
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,228
about being the token
Asian on a team?

258
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,266
What?

259
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,858
lt's obvious to everyone

260
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,994
the only reason that
you're on the team

261
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,095
is for cosmetic ones.

262
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,104
That's bullshit.

263
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,902
l bust my ass
to be on this team.

264
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,168
But you never get to play.

265
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,904
So what?
l'm still on the team.

266
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,242
Well, your coach
could've picked anyone

267
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,213
he wanted to just
to sit on the bench.

268
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,011
Maybe you should
just ask him then.

269
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,917
Okay. Awesome.

270
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,112
Thanks, buddy.

271
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,554
Hey, Takeshi, can you, uh,
give me a few close-ups

272
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,648
and a couple wides?

273
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
Yeah, you got it.

274
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,269
Hi.

275
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,836
ls Stephanie home?

276
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,348
Hi.

277
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,549
Hey.

278
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,393
Stephanie, l just want
to apologize for...

279
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,334
Ben, l'm in
three honor classes,

280
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,306
and l have a 3.8 GPA.

281
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,865
l know and l'm sorry.

282
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,784
l couldn't find the traits
to phylum chordata in the book.

283
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,388
Um, it's not in the book.

284
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,787
lt was in his lecture.

285
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,033
See? lt was
last Tuesday's lecture.

286
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,159
...cells. This one is

287
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,170
more of a non-sexual
cell division.

288
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,433
Right. Okay.

289
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,531
And that's when
mitosis happens...

290
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,540
That was one, anaphase?

291
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,701
Anaphase.

292
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,006
And then metaphase,
interphase and prophase.

293
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,011
You got it.

294
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,878
Yes. Okay.

295
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,383
l think you're right.
Let me just make sure.

296
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,919
When l'm right, l'm right.

297
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,648
You're right.

298
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,883
Hello?

299
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,553
Hey, Steve-o.

300
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,861
Oh, Ben and l are working
on our bio homework.

301
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,130
Yes, l'm sure.

302
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,808
Can you hold on a minute?

303
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,845
l'll be right back.

304
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,380
Yeah. What?

305
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,940
Do you want something
to drink?

306
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,173
Are you okay?

307
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,079
Yeah.

308
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,969
Where are you going?

309
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,198
lt's getting pretty late.

310
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,504
But we haven't gone
through meiosis yet.

311
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,678
Well, l could stay.

312
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,881
Thanks.

313
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,529
Uh, okay. Meiosis.

314
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,393
Hey, Ben.

315
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,271
Be there for you, man,
every game.

316
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,619
We want Ben! We want Ben!
We want Ben!

317
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,953
Daric ended up writing
an article about me.

318
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,459
He even won some kind
of journalism award for it.

319
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,155
lt was some bullshit article
about affirmative action

320
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,164
in school sports
to rile everyone up.

321
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,824
We want Ben! We want Ben!

322
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,597
But l had to give it to him...
The article worked.

323
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,571
lf anyone at school didn't know

324
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,439
what affirmative action was,
they did now.

325
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,274
Aw sh... Ben, Ben, get in.

326
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,780
Go on. Get the fuck in there.

327
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,045
Yeah!

328
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,227
Math or verbal?

329
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,636
What the fuck do you want?

330
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,196
So how does it feel
to be famous?

331
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,798
Come on.

332
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,537
Why'd you quit the team?

333
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,273
l was doing my job.

334
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,215
You call that piece-of-shit
article journalism?

335
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,310
You didn't even interview
my coach for his views.

336
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,354
l did.

337
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,219
He, uh, didn't say
what l wanted him to,

338
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,623
so l didn't put it in the story.

339
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,493
Fucking prick.

340
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,496
lt's just an article.

341
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,328
lf you really liked
what you were doing,

342
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,061
you should have
just kept on playing.

343
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,864
And have everybody think
l'm on the team

344
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,302
because l'm some token player?

345
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,102
Who cares
what other people think?

346
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,573
Oh, yeah?
Well, people also think

347
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,802
that you gave Mr. Reid head

348
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,469
to be the editor
of the school paper.

349
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,845
Well, l still am the editor.

350
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,578
God. Fuck off.

351
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:14,281
You know this is all bullshit,
right?

352
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,917
lt's just a game.

353
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,155
People like you and me,

354
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,461
we don't have to play
by the rules.

355
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,296
We can make our own.

356
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,101
Do this by tomorrow,
you get a fifty.

357
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,168
What?

358
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,444
Hey, l don't just ask anyone
to do this.

359
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,451
Cheat sheets?

360
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,544
lt's easy money.

361
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,751
Ben, it's easier than fuck.

362
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,318
lt's better than
this sorry-ass job.

363
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,694
See you tomorrow.

364
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,571
Hey, Ben.

365
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,307
Hey.

366
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,712
Uh, l'm getting my Diet Coke.

367
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,908
You guys want anything?

368
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,143
Uh, yeah.

369
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,515
Give me a root beer float
to go.

370
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,553
l got it.

371
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,795

372
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,354
Uh, yeah.

373
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,126
Excuse me.

374
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,171
There's no smoking
allowed in this cafe.

375
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,364
California state law.

376
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,565
Sorry.

377
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,336
Can't wait till l get out.

378
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,445
What are you majoring in
in college?

379
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,947
Bio.

380
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,953
Doing any internships?

381
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,215
No.

382
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,188
l know some people.
l'll give them a call.

383
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,051
Cool.

384
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,936
You like Steph.

385
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,840
What?

386
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,105
You want to take her
to the winter formal?

387
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,615
lsn't that your job?

388
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,981
l don't get into
all that bullshit.

389
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,318
Why, you a fag or something?

390
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,651
What do you think?

391
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,022
Hey.

392
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,258
Thanks.

393
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,731
Thanks, honey.

394
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,631
Okay. Okay, l'll see you soon?

395
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,737
Okay. Which species
should we start with?

396
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:51,313
Um, l was... thinking
about the, uh, Chapter Eight.

397
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,107
Temerity. Noun.

398
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,669
''Unwise boldness;
rash or reckless behavior.''

399
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,470
Oh-oh.

400
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,665
Nice.

401
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,674
Good job.

402
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,471
Oh, shit. Sorry, dude.

403
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,478
Hey, man. What's going on?

404
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,808
Popcorn?

405
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,872
So how much did we actually
earn last year at the car wash?

406
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,941
Like $400 and something.

407
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,043
So that's only like $400.

408
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,385
We only got that
one day to do it, so....

409
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,550
Uh, you guys mind
if we have a moment?

410
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,558
Uh, me and Ben?

411
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,559
-Oh. Yeah.
-Okay.

412
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,892
Okay, but we got
to talk about this.

413
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,930
Sure. Thanks.

414
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,557
What's up?

415
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,794
Hey.

416
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,430
Oh. Sweet.

417
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,737
Aren't you gonna check it?

418
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,277
Nah. l trust you.

419
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,908
-Get going?
-Yeah.

420
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,143
All right?

421
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,020
Academic decathlon was huge.

422
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,455
The most prized entry
on a college application.

423
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,925
This was not like
some community service club

424
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,052
where you just
walk in and sign out.

425
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,597
You had to earn your spot.

426
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,428
-Pygmy mouse lemur.
-Excellent.

427
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,661
Tetrahydrocannabanol.

428
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,067
Jersey, Guernsey and Albany.

429
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,400
Hands by your side.

430
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,404
Check.

431
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,599
Portugal!

432
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,869
l didn't ask a question.

433
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:58,874
Sorry!

434
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,207
Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.

435
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,337
Correct.

436
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,472
Johnson.

437
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,606
Excellent.

438
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,707
You're right.

439
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,012
Another language that...

440
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,211
-Tokyo, Japan.
-Excellent.

441
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,378
-Ahh!
-Correct.

442
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,350
Hey.

443
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,587
See you in class.

444
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,890
Good job, man.

445
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,194
What are you talking about?

446
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,235
l got my ass kicked.

447
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,599
No, you knew the answers.

448
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,604
You just got to get
the timing down.

449
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,040
50 bucks if you
do it by tomorrow.

450
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,583
Dude, l think we got enough.

451
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,777
Stop bitching.

452
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,149
Just a few more blocks.

453
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,248
Did l tell you?

454
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,382
l got it.

455
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,517
Got what?

456
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,525
Remember l told you

457
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,528
l saw Stephanie
Vandergosh in a porn?

458
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,528
Yeah.

459
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,529
l got it.

460
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,530
Shut the fuck up.

461
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,930
l'll show you right now, fool.

462
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,126
Oh, my God.

463
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,837
Oh...

464
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,409
So you've been hanging around
that Daric guy, right?

465
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,603
Yeah.

466
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,476
ls it true that he
has his own house?

467
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,673
l don't know.

468
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,411
Hmm. Han told me that his
parents don't live here.

469
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,680
They're in, like,
Vancouver or something.

470
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,880
So what?

471
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,549
You know what l could
do if l had my own pad?

472
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,558
Jerk off at the dinner table?

473
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,093
Ha-ha.

474
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,287
Your turn.

475
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,329
Fucker.

476
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,663
What?

477
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,892
No hot tub?

478
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,299
Well, you tell them,
if they want me,

479
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,929
they're gonna ante up
with that hot tub!

480
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,008
Tracy, what are you doing here?

481
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,443
Well, l can give you
a special Tracy massage.

482
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,913
See? l told you, punk ass.

483
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,711
No.

484
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,251
lt's just the uniform.

485
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,717
Uh-uh. lt's got to be her.

486
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,913
Oh, yes, Tracy.

487
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,250
Yeah.

488
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,381
Work those pom-poms.

489
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,925
l dare you to ask
her boyfriend.

490
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:55,925
White dude, right?

491
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,655
-No.
-Thank God.

492
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,499
Oh, yeah.

493
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,500
Oh, yes.

494
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,501
Shake those pom-poms.

495
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,502
-Ben?
-Huh?

496
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,334
You think you can
talk to Daric for me

497
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,737
about doing the
cheat sheets?

498
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,275
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

499
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,334
How do you know about it?

500
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,141
l hear things.

501
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,614
Han told me.

502
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,877
Fucking Daric's a senior.

503
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,010
Someone's got to take
over when he leaves.

504
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,126
All right. The topic is
population control,

505
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,754
why retarded children
and handicapped people

506
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,854
should be executed

507
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,491
in order to keep
the population down. Ready?

508
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,258
-ls that true?
-l think it was.

509
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,395
'Cause it didn't sound
like you knew it.

510
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,769
Make sure your glasses
are anti-glare, okay?

511
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,206
-Let's see.
-Oh...

512
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,970
Decathlon practices were always
held at Daric's house.

513
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,976
Finish it!
Finish it!

514
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,446
His methods were definitely
unconventional but effective.

515
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,504
Beautiful.

516
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,379
Rock, scissors, paper.

517
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,578
Oh, fuck.

518
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,717
l'm so unworthy
at this moment.

519
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,921
Ah...

520
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,590
Dude. Dude, dude,
you're gonna explode, man.

521
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,962
Don't light that shit.

522
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,102
Come on.

523
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,471
Oh.

524
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,634
Good-bye, guys.

525
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,972
Study hard.

526
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,639
-Come on.
-Oh.

527
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,250
Not bad for academic
decathlon, huh?

528
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,887
Han had a friend named Jesus

529
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,088
who helped him steal, bribe
or do whatever it took

530
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,063
to get the test sheets for us.

531
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,759
l talked to Daric
and he was cool

532
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,233
with Virgil coming on board.

533
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,462
Between the five of us,

534
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,663
there wasn't anything
we couldn't do.

535
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,743
The money was really good,

536
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,679
but l don't think that's
what attracted me the most.

537
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,938
Okay, okay.

538
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,268
They got lucky.

539
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,309
But, you know,
there is no reason

540
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,709
a team of that caliber should
be able to beat us. God.

541
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,379
Mary!

542
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,381
Where's your tie?

543
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,884
l mean, our presentation
absolutely sucked.

544
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,113
We looked like idiots.

545
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,211
Rich, privey fucks.

546
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,550
Press the button.

547
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,215
Wait till
the question is asked.

548
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,553
We're getting locked out

549
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,355
and we can't even
answer the question.

550
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,554
God! Ben.

551
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,062
Fucking twinkie.

552
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,223
American history specialist.

553
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,767
The answer was
1973, not '76.

554
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,171
How many more, Ben?

555
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,205
Would you shut up?

556
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,865
l told you guys
not to come.

557
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,103
Woo!

558
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,306
So how's Stephanie?

559
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,507
Virg.

560
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,913
Stephanie Vandergosh?

561
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,579
l'm going out
with her Friday night.

562
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,588
l asked her out last week.

563
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,920
Does she know it's a date?

564
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,586
Why? Want to lay
some money down on it?

565
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,787
Yeah.

566
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,591
How 'bout an even hundred?

567
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,961
Okay, you got it.

568
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,593
Fucking A.

569
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,194
You motherfucker.

570
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,613
This is fucked.

571
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,779
Hey, Daric wanted us to see it.

572
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,823
You know she has a boyfriend.

573
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,255
Well, this'll teach
that fuckhead

574
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,349
to keep his mouth shut.

575
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,966
Oh, fuck.

576
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,867
ls that the guy
from the privey school?

577
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,799
What does he think he is,
some Chinese movie star?

578
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,109
Hi, l am Chow Yun-Fat.

579
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,206
Hi. l-l-l thought

580
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,843
l was gonna be fucking your
girlfriend tonight.

581
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,181
l-l guess not.

582
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,916
l guess l better go home
and stroke myself really good.

583
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,046
Let's go.

584
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,148
Really, really good.

585
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,125
Ahh!

586
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,957
Hey, hold on,
l'm just getting started.

587
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,125
Get the fuck off my car.

588
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,792
Ow.

589
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,301
Damn, dude.

590
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,201
Dude, you got to tell Stephanie

591
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,936
her boyfriend's boning
some white chick.

592
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,604
lt's none of my business.

593
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,544
What the fuck are
you talking about?

594
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,605
You tell her and
you get bonus points.

595
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,945
l'm not gonna be some rat.

596
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,951
Besides, l don't
even know for sure.

597
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,648
Come on, Ben. Look...

598
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,289
This... is for buddies.

599
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,486
So?

600
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,154
And this is where
he had his hands...

601
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,162
which is for lovers.

602
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,163
God! Get off me!

603
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,132
Am l right, Han?

604
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,936
Daric, where you going?

605
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,905
Mm. Oh, sh...

606
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,572
Yo, fuck her, man.
Let's go drink.

607
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,808
Hey!

608
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,625
Shit. No, Daric!

609
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,131
Whose party is this?

610
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,529
Susie Berk's.

611
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,725
Are we invited?

612
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,461
You don't need an invitation.

613
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,867
Just hear about it and you go.

614
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,302
They're all fucking
drunk, anyway.

615
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,896
So, is everyone buzzed?

616
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,068
Yo, can l have a light?

617
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,841
Thanks, dude.

618
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,980
Let's go around back.

619
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,126
Hey, how's it goin'?

620
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,929
Ah...!

621
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,867
Now l'm gonna throw up.

622
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,688
Hey, what's up, boys?

623
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,921
l think they have...
bible study's next door, right?

624
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,099
Oh, shit, no, look at this!

625
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,101
lt's the Chinese Jordan!

626
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,036
Hey, so, what's up, man?

627
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,130
Where's all your
fan club at, man?

628
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,907
l'm going to go
check on Virg.

629
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,620
Yeah, what's up, shithead?

630
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,676
Are you going to step up?

631
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,382
You know, you got
to play a real sport

632
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,719
to wear that jacket.

633
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,190
Yeah, fuck him up, Brian!

634
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,070
Want your mom?

635
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,835
Huh? You want the cops?

636
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,142
You're what?
You're what?

637
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,143
l'm sorry, l'm sorry!

638
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,770
-What?!
-l'm sorry.

639
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,144
Shoot him in the face.

640
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,204
Shoot him in the face.

641
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,307
lf l ever see any of you

642
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,783
and your fuck
jock friends again,

643
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,183
l'll fucking kill you!

644
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,789
Back off, man, back off!

645
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:14,882
You want some of this?!

646
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,687
-Back off, man!
-Ben, come on!

647
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,718
Back off!

648
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,923
Come on, Ben!

649
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,533
Come on, Ben!

650
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,898
Fuck you, man!

651
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,003
Screw you!

652
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,094
Let's go!

653
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,881
Fuckin' A,
that was better than sex.

654
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,050
Just shut the fuck up.

655
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,819
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

656
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,264
You put the fear
of God in him, man.

657
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,234
The fear of gods.

658
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,236
l went jihad on his ass, man.

659
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,230
You see this blood on me, man?

660
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,274
lt's not my blood.

661
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,401
Did you see his face
when we worked on him?

662
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,910
lt was like...

663
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,874
Fuck, man, when you
pulled out that gun,

664
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,543
it was fucking awesome.

665
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,349
That was, like, boom!

666
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,049
Right in your face.

667
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,886
He probably pissed himself
right then

668
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,555
in front of all his homies.

669
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,861
Not me, man.
l was going off.

670
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:34,064
l felt so... l felt like
surging through my body.

671
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,605
How smooth was that?

672
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,901
Man, you had fucking balls!

673
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,066
That was fucking smooth!

674
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,840
The next minute, the gun
was right in his face,

675
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,974
and l was going off--
ah, yeah!

676
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,514
Shit.

677
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,618
lf my dad finds out,
he's going to kill me.

678
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,273
Man, l'm going to juvie!

679
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,124
By Monday, the word had spread

680
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,664
and pretty much everyone
knew about it.

681
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,476
l was sure the cops were gonna
come and get us that morning...

682
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,214
but it never happened.

683
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,813
Meeting today at 3:00.

684
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,878
Why?

685
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,185
We have to do this chem test.

686
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,919
lt's a big one,
about a hundred students.

687
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,221
Guys...

688
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,123
Hi, guys.

689
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,928
-Hey.
-Hey.

690
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,059
Ben, can l talk to you?

691
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,296
Yeah.

692
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,935
He's fuckin' whupped already.

693
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,681
What's up?

694
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,377
l just talked to Steve.

695
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,545
Yeah...

696
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,056
What?

697
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,217
He said you're taking me
to the formal.

698
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,625
You're fucking with me, right?

699
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,755
He said that you guys agreed

700
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,298
to have you take me
to the formal.

701
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,596
He did ask, l didn't agree.

702
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,499
The whole thing
was pretty weird.

703
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,265
You should have
at least told me.

704
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,569
Well, he's your boyfriend.
l didn't want to get involved.

705
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,269
Ben, that's what friends do.

706
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,274
God, l don't believe this.

707
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,908
Why do l always get shit on?

708
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,144
You know, Steve,

709
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,651
he's the one that
needs to stop...

710
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,449
Ben, l'm just trying
to understand this.

711
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,581
l'm out of here.

712
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,796
What the fuck?!

713
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:22,936
Woo!

714
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,235
What? The formal?

715
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,767
Oh, what, got a hot date
with Barbie that night?

716
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,609
Look, l'm not gonna
say anything,

717
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,673
all right, it's none
of my business.

718
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,449
l just think
she deserves better.

719
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,319
You're probably right.

720
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,892
As our reputation grew,
scams started coming to us.

721
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,055
Usually through Jesus.

722
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,359
There they are.

723
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,457
What l liked about it was
that we were in control.

724
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,434
lf someone came to us
about doing a scam

725
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,267
and we didn't like them,
we'd just tell them to fuck off.

726
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,105
Having that kind of power
quickly became an addiction.

727
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,336
What's up?

728
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,140
How's it going, man?

729
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,611
-What's going on?
-How are you doing?

730
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,343
Man, not too bad.

731
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,645
This is Peter.

732
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,016
So, what's up?

733
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,419
Peter's got a sweet deal.

734
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,322
The school's getting in all new
computer parts next week.

735
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,791
So?

736
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,521
So they've got to store them
for a while

737
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,790
until they can install them.

738
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,262
Peter's got
the school codes.

739
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,822
Can they trace the code?

740
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,492
No, it's all the same number
for everyone.

741
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:25,762
What about that
fucking family

742
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,770
that lives in the trailer
guarding the school?

743
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,772
That's me and my dad.

744
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,705
He's out by 10:00.

745
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,265
lt's easy.

746
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,472
l don't know.
Sounds too easy.

747
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,139
Dude, l guarantee.

748
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,773
No offense,

749
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,715
l don't give a shit
about your guarantee.

750
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,446
Me and Ben checked it out.

751
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,782
Seems legit.

752
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,390
Han, think you can
sell this shit off?

753
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,928
l can always sell
the shit off.

754
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,089
We'll think about it.

755
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,169
Peter, let's go.

756
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,709
-You got the phone?
-Uh-huh.

757
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,761
Ah, God. Fuck.

758
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,501
lt's clear.

759
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,333
We had the run of the place.

760
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,498
Rumors about us came
and went fast and furious.

761
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,906
One had us linked
with some Chinese Mafia.

762
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,203
And it was fine with us

763
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,212
because it just put more fear
in everyone.

764
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,578
Along with that power
came greed.

765
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,553
lt just made sense to expand
our business into drugs,

766
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,454
putting the law of supply
and demand into practice.

767
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,584
l think our teacher
would've been proud.

768
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,718
Whoa.

769
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,178
Let me see this thing.

770
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,314
Fuck off.

771
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,915
lt's got no name brand on it.

772
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,526
Aw...!

773
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,896
Shit.

774
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,798
Sorry, Virg.

775
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,429
Fuckin' dick.

776
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,063
Stop crying.

777
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,835
lt's a piece-of-shit
CD player anyway.

778
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,603
Fuck you!

779
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,779
Here.

780
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,907
Now you can buy three of 'em.

781
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,521
l soon learned that along with
an image, came maintenance.

782
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:42,531
l needed something
to help expand my days.

783
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,931
lt's literally a full-time job
just to make people believe

784
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,535
who you're supposed to be.

785
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:50,630
Four cheat sheets a day,
the drugs, the scams--

786
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,504
between this and
all my club commitments,

787
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,272
l couldn't even start
my homework until 1 :00 a.m.

788
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,767
We were making so much money,

789
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,463
we couldn't spend it
fast enough.

790
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:24,530
lf it was for sale, you could
bet we tried to buy it.

791
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,575
-ls that enough?
-Mm-hmm.

792
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:26,609
All right.

793
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:28,804
Hey, Tracy.

794
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,107
Thanks, it's all there.

795
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,477
Thank you.

796
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,515
So, what are you guys?

797
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,679
A club.

798
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,244
Oh, like a math club
or something?

799
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,550
We partied every weekend

800
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,027
and hung out
with different crowds.

801
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,656
lt's funny,
the more notorious we became,

802
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,563
the more invitations we got.

803
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,932
We didn't know half the people
we partied with...

804
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,367
but they knew us.

805
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,694
Quixotic. Adjective.

806
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,332
Extravagantly idealistic;

807
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,105
unpredictable;
unrealistic or imaginary.

808
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,080
Shit.

809
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,645
You look like shit.

810
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,648
Fifty.

811
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,677
Oh, yeah.

812
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,880
Here's the number
for that internship

813
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:19,887
l was telling you about.

814
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,719
Thanks.

815
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,922
Yeah. You want some?

816
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:39,599
You happy, Ben?

817
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,144
l'm serious.

818
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,775
You happy?

819
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,148
l don't know.

820
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,420
Fuck.

821
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,320
That's the most truthful thing
l've ever heard.

822
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,454
At least you have a choice.

823
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,497
You're not happy?

824
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:03,362
l'm very happy.

825
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,066
lsn't it obvious?

826
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,569
l have everything.

827
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:11,164
Loving parents, top grades,

828
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,936
lvy League scholarships,

829
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,874
of course, Stephanie.

830
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,343
Of course.

831
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,446
Right there.

832
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,576
That's it.

833
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,482
l'm so fucking happy
l can't stop it.

834
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,324
Why not?

835
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,590
lt's a never-ending cycle.

836
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,628
When you got everything
you want, what's left?

837
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,601
You can't settle
for being happy,

838
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,966
that's a fucking trap.

839
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,504
You got to take life
into your own hands.

840
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,666
Do whatever it takes
to break the cycle.

841
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,768
That's what it is,
breaking the cycle.

842
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,380
You're fucked.

843
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,749
l envy you.

844
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:01,891
What?

845
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,427
What?

846
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,860
What?

847
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:12,458
What?

848
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,412
lt was my 1 7th birthday.

849
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,681
No shit, man.

850
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,694
Fuck, man.
l don't want to touch that.

851
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,060
l don't want to touch it
with my hands, man.

852
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,928
There he is.

853
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,495
Hey, ass-wipe,

854
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,537
you're the one
that organized

855
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,333
this ''Keep the Beach Clean''
shit and you're late.

856
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,670
l need to talk to you guys.

857
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,073
Grab a bag.

858
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,169
Where's Han?

859
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,180
Sleeping.

860
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,727
What's up?

861
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,101
This better be fucking good.

862
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,933
l want out.

863
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,868
Out of what?

864
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,005
l can't handle this anymore.

865
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,047
Look, l woke up and my sheets
were covered in blood.

866
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,417
Well, why don't you stop

867
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,080
OD'ing on that shit,
you fuck?

868
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,557
Yeah, too much of that shit
will get to you.

869
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,150
l don't want to do it anymore.

870
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,159
All of it.

871
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,662
Fuck, Ben, stop being a pussy.

872
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,392
Whatever, Virg.

873
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,192
So is that it?

874
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,964
Yeah, l just...

875
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,664
l just want to concentrate
on my own stuff.

876
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,402
Hell, l was thinking
the same thing.

877
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,011
Give it up?

878
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,045
Yeah.

879
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,741
Fuck it. lt's like a job, man.

880
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,875
The only reason l did
it was for you guys.

881
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,755
What are you saying?

882
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,584
Have you two lost
your fucking balls?

883
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,664
Fuck it.

884
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,528
Han and l will do it.

885
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,090
Right, Han?

886
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,658
lt's all yours, man.

887
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:29,937
We got to talk.

888
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,438
Just shut the fuck up.

889
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:34,602
More money for us.

890
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,738
l'm gonna call Jesus
right after this.

891
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,839
Organize this shit.

892
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,578
Well...

893
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,347
Happy birthday, man.

894
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,284
Thanks.

895
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,261
We all chipped in.

896
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,599
Pretty cool, huh?

897
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,573
Jesus Christ!

898
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,802
-Shit!
-Fuck!

899
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,042
Hey.

900
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,525
Temperance. Noun.

901
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,433
Signifying self-restraint
or moderation

902
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,937
in action and statement.

903
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,054
Hi, Stephanie.

904
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,562
Hi.

905
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,467
You need help?

906
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,005
l'm okay.

907
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:20,207
You know, l hate doing
those S's.

908
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,683
The curves make it tough,

909
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,617
but l know a trick.

910
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,515
You work it inside out.

911
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,493
See?

912
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,252
So, what's this l hear
about you, gangster boy?

913
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,811
Oh, God, that's
such old news.

914
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:03,290
Rumors have it you guys
did a number on Ryan.

915
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,260
Do you believe them?

916
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,522
Let's put it this way,

917
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,587
there's also a rumor
that l am in a porno.

918
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,654
Oh, yeah, l've seen it.

919
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,665
Shut up.

920
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:11,666
Yeah, l have.

921
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,759
-Really?
-Yeah.

922
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,634
So the shooting arm
is perpendicular to the body?

923
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,570
Mm-hmm. Bend your knees
and follow through.

924
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,013
ls that it?

925
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,987
l'm hungry.

926
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,837
Excuse me, sir.

927
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,813
There's no food
allowed in the store.

928
00:56:58,882 --> 00:56:59,940
Oh, uh, l'm sorry.

929
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,277
l'm hypoglycemic

930
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,546
and l just need
a little something

931
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,417
to get my blood sugar going.

932
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,854
l just got a couple
more bites left.

933
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,118
Okay.

934
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,421
You think you can get away
with anything, don't you?

935
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,522
No.

936
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,126
Well, yeah, if you're
clever enough.

937
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,570
You sound just like Steve.

938
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,003
You don't like him much,
do you?

939
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,205
Speaking of Steve,

940
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,912
um, you still need
a date for the formal?

941
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,453
Are you asking?

942
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,354
Well, if you'll go with me.

943
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,722
Oh, yeah.

944
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,494
Holy shit.

945
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:32,337
l guess l was clever enough,
thank you very much.

946
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,434
A week later Han
got suspended from school

947
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,030
for distributing cheat sheets.

948
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,871
lt appeared
that Virgil's new position

949
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,501
as head of the outfit
had gone to his head.

950
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,479
He was babbling
to so many people about it,

951
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,039
the school had to do something.

952
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:15,414
The funny thing was,

953
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,682
Han didn't really care
that he got suspended.

954
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,382
l think it just gave him
yet another excuse

955
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,448
to beat the crap out of Virgil.

956
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,837
-Hey.
-Hey.

957
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,899
-You look great.
-You look great.

958
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,672
Jinx.

959
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,145
Two for flinching.

960
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,738
Ow!

961
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,340
Here.

962
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,385
Thank you.

963
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,749
Jeez.

964
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,489
So, do you know
your real parents?

965
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,692
Do you want to?

966
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,101
My parents l have now
are my real parents.

967
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,938
l don't know.

968
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,876
Maybe when l get older.

969
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,183
l still have to find out
who l am.

970
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,152
Yeah.

971
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,621
You sound so mature.

972
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,386
That's what my therapist
tells me, at least.

973
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,794
Thanks for asking, though.

974
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,636
Between the lines,
the disguise

975
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:48,268
Of the love of a butterfly

976
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,446
Do you wish whatever itches

977
01:00:55,518 --> 01:01:04,916
l have seen fishes fly,
why should l believe it?

978
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,225
Swing wide, butterfly

979
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:11,892
lt's a stone's throw
to the inside

980
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:17,531
Of a precious thing

981
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,940
Between the lines,
the disguise

982
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:25,708
Of the love of a butterfly

983
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,518
Between the lines,
the disguise

984
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:37,423
Of the love of a butterfly

985
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:49,132
Swing wide, butterfly

986
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,969
Swing wide, butterfly...

987
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,298
Uh, l had a wonderful time.

988
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,458
Thanks again.

989
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,791
Yeah.

990
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,616
All right, question six:

991
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,245
name of the largest
commercial transport jet.

992
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,583
Virgil!

993
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,884
The Space Guppy.

994
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,720
Where the fuck is he, man?

995
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,919
Jesus.

996
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,220
Hey, open up, man.

997
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,762
Where the fuck
you going, man--

998
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:21,819
on a honeymoon?

999
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,331
No, man; l got my accessories.

1000
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,923
Yeah, what, your
anal intruder?

1001
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,332
No, my lubrication.

1002
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,892
You're just so dry, Daric.

1003
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,995
Don't slam
the trunk either, man.

1004
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,946
Hey, yo!

1005
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,345
Motherfucker.

1006
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,384
As we headed off to Vegas
for the decathlon nationals,

1007
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,544
Stephanie was all
l could think about.

1008
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:48,750
l finally decided that there
were two things l could do--

1009
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,123
go on agonizing over Stephanie,

1010
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,992
or just say fuck it
and have fun.

1011
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,638
Vegas sucks.

1012
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,175
Hey, turn that down.

1013
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,680
The sound is the best part.

1014
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,147
Oh, yeah!

1015
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:53,447
Ben, Virgil,
l want you to meet Rachel.

1016
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,251
-Hey.
-Hi.

1017
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,552
You're Ben?

1018
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:57,957
Yeah.

1019
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,358
What are you studying?

1020
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,225
Um... econ.

1021
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,561
-Econ?
-Yeah.

1022
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:09,602
Brother, today
is your lucky day.

1023
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:10,900
What?

1024
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,065
Yeah!

1025
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,540
Whoo!

1026
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,839
Go get 'em.

1027
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:29,855
All right, sweetie,
here are the rules.

1028
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,793
No kissing, and l always lead.

1029
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,677
Come on, sweetie.

1030
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,064
How was it?

1031
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,466
How was it?

1032
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,204
Oh, you bad, bad boy.

1033
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,473
That is so disgusting, man.

1034
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,071
Come on, man.

1035
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,642
Actually, it was...
incredible.

1036
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,178
l just couldn't believe
l had finally done it.

1037
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,587
lt was such a relief.

1038
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,024
l had prayed every day
up until that moment

1039
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,858
that l would have sex
before l died.

1040
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,464
Thank you.

1041
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,634
Dude, man, wasn't she awesome?

1042
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,371
Wasn't she awesome, man?

1043
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,378
Mmm...

1044
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,110
Dude, what the fuck?

1045
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,344
Here you go.

1046
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,546
Fuck! God damn it!

1047
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,181
Your little friend
pulled a gun on me.

1048
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,588
Calm down!

1049
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,489
-Shut up, Virg!
-Fuck you.

1050
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,653
Look, this is more money
than we owe you.

1051
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:14,753
Fuck all of you.

1052
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,320
What the hell are
you doing, Virg?

1053
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,525
Are you crazy?

1054
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,158
She said she wanted
to play rough.

1055
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,066
You want to play fucking rough?!

1056
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,365
Stop it! Put the gun down!

1057
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,429
l want to play rough.

1058
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,065
Virgil, put the gun down.

1059
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,234
Put the gun down.

1060
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,435
Virgil, put the gun down.

1061
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,773
What do you think now, hotshot?

1062
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,144
Virg, put the gun down.

1063
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,210
Get the fuck off me.

1064
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,901
The morning after
l lost my virginity,

1065
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,995
we won the national title.

1066
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,555
l don't sell that shit no more.

1067
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,591
That's cool.

1068
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,256
How have you been?

1069
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:24,162
-Haven't seen you since the...
-Formal.

1070
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,394
Right.

1071
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,561
Hey, by the way,

1072
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,228
l never got a chance
to thank you

1073
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,897
for taking Stephanie.

1074
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,775
She said she had
the best time.

1075
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,334
Maybe you can take her
to all the school functions.

1076
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,006
You should try it.
You might like it.

1077
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,082
lt's all a superficial,
bullshit waste of time.

1078
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,882
Yeah, you mentioned that.

1079
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,855
l have a proposition for you.

1080
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:50,483
Actually, for you
and your buddies.

1081
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,720
Look, that's all in the past.

1082
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,064
Listen, you guys are definitely
going to like this.

1083
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,226
lt's too sweet.

1084
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,292
No, thanks.

1085
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,567
Well, give me
the other guys' digits.

1086
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,074
l thought we were friends.

1087
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,047
That has nothing
to do with this.

1088
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,379
There's going to be
a lot of money involved.

1089
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,681
You already got all
the money you need.

1090
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,427
Change.

1091
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,495
l don't give a shit
about the cash.

1092
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,430
lt's what we've been
talking about.

1093
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,058
lt's time to break the cycle.

1094
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,500
What?

1095
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:38,233
Listen, this is going to better
everyone involved.

1096
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,605
Just trust me.

1097
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,408
Ben, did he tell you
what this is all about?

1098
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,784
No.

1099
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,954
Fuckin' rich boy.

1100
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:05,266
Let's talk outside.

1101
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,926
Steve, this is Virgil...

1102
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:07,934
Hey.

1103
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,437
...and Han.

1104
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,598
David, right?

1105
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:12,936
Daric.

1106
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,600
Sorry.

1107
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:15,939
How's your stroke?

1108
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,775
My stroke?

1109
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,444
You guys want
something to drink?

1110
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:22,609
Yeah, l'll take a beer.

1111
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,777
Beer.

1112
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,114
Okay.

1113
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,119
Have a seat.

1114
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,622
l'll be right back.

1115
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,216
What's up with that guy?
Stroke?

1116
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,761
Hey, by the way, congrats
on winning the nationals.

1117
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,761
Thank you.

1118
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,956
What happened to you guys?

1119
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,963
Too many freshmen.

1120
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,794
Their fuckin' brains froze
in the semis.

1121
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,960
What are you going to do?

1122
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,329
The streak had to end sometime.

1123
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,602
So, why are we here?

1124
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,509
You're looking at it.

1125
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,412
What?

1126
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,473
We do my parents' house.

1127
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,179
Yo, that's fucked up.

1128
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,346
Why?

1129
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,582
lt's none
of your fuckin' business.

1130
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,057
Okay.

1131
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,525
Let's go, guys.

1132
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,627
Everyone needs a wake-up call.

1133
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:15,864
l love them.
That's why l'm doing this.

1134
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,203
''l love them.
That's why l'm doing this.''

1135
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,473
That dude's fucked up.

1136
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,941
Let's do it.

1137
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,447
Let's fuckin' do it.

1138
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:28,608
No.

1139
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,447
No. We're not gonna rob anyone.

1140
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,952
Everyone needs a wake-up call.

1141
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,352
That's what he said, right?

1142
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,118
Let's fuckin' give it to him.

1143
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,624
Look, that shit is just weird.

1144
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:38,955
Oh, yeah, it is.

1145
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,121
We're gonna play along
for a while,

1146
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,825
and then we're gonna teach
that fucker a lesson.

1147
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,132
Virg, don't you see the way
that guy talks to you?

1148
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:53,800
That dude doesn't even think
you're on the same level.

1149
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,140
Think about it.

1150
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,974
What about you, Han?

1151
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,547
That rich motherfucker wants
to punish his own family?

1152
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,641
Why?

1153
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,278
Because Mommy and Daddy won't
pay enough attention to him?

1154
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,190
And you.

1155
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:14,753
He thinks you're
fuckin' dickless.

1156
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,266
No? Well, why else
would he let you take

1157
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,768
his girlfriend to the formal?

1158
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,203
No. No!

1159
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:27,106
We'll just rough 'em up
a little bit.

1160
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:32,443
Mostly... we'll scare
the shit out of him.

1161
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,948
Dude, this is brilliant.

1162
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,746
After we fuckin'
beat the shit out of him,

1163
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,151
we could turn him in
to the cops

1164
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,779
for conspiring to rob
his own family.

1165
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,118
Exactly.

1166
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,182
Oh, yeah!

1167
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,420
-Ooh.
-Come on, guys.

1168
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,954
l don't know.

1169
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,124
Come on!

1170
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,462
Let's do it!

1171
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:53,933
-Yeah.
-lt'll be fun.

1172
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,362
All right, man,
l'm just doing this

1173
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,134
so you don't fuck
this up, all right?

1174
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,140
Yeah.

1175
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,141
Yeah!

1176
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,975
No, l can't.

1177
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,743
This'll be our blueprint.

1178
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,411
Let's start on page three.

1179
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:13,921
By the way,
l'm going to need a gun.

1180
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,253
l know. l'm working on it.

1181
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,088
Can l get one of those
semiautomatics?

1182
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,593
lt'll cost you.

1183
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,424
Just take it out of my share.

1184
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,466
No. We'll need the money
up front.

1185
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,434
All right.

1186
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,095
Just let me know how much.

1187
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,729
No problem.

1188
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,137
Steve was meticulous.

1189
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,074
He had mapped out each of
our paths for the robbery.

1190
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:38,807
He made us do it over and over
until he felt we got it.

1191
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,782
l just don't know what
Stephanie found so attractive.

1192
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,782
So...

1193
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:43,943
At all!

1194
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,452
...Han, you think
you can break in?

1195
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,613
Fuck, yeah.

1196
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,620
That's it.

1197
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,452
l can't handle it anymore.

1198
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,959
l ain't going
to the meeting tomorrow.

1199
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,392
Shut up!

1200
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,954
Look, we all have to do it,
or it'll just fuck it all up.

1201
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,468
Well, l still ain't going!

1202
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,798
Dude, why?

1203
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,895
'Cause Chrissy's throwin'
a party tomorrow.

1204
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,564
Why don't we just
invite him to come?

1205
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:06,573
He's the one who said

1206
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,940
we should get to know
each other.

1207
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,446
Whatever.

1208
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,085
You think he'll show?

1209
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,244
Who cares, man?

1210
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,915
At least we don't have to sit
through all that bullshit.

1211
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,083
l can't wait till
this is all over.

1212
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,592
You watch.

1213
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,788
lt'll all be worth it.

1214
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,929
Be right back.

1215
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,773
Hey, Steph.

1216
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,643
Hey, Ben.

1217
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:48,782
Where's Steve?

1218
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:49,909
l don't know.

1219
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,283
He told me
to meet him here.

1220
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:53,787
He's on time as usual.

1221
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,617
Hey.

1222
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,957
Whoa. ls it real?

1223
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,893
Just got it done
this morning.

1224
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,056
What does it mean?

1225
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,565
lt's my Chinese name.

1226
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,568
Why you guys hiding out
from everyone?

1227
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:08,728
Hey.

1228
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,396
Hey. Hello.

1229
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,599
Hey.

1230
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,944
Yo, D-Rock!

1231
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,412
ls that a new tattoo?

1232
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,249
Yeah.

1233
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,084
You gonna show me?

1234
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,248
Later.

1235
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,256
When did you get it?

1236
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,259
This morning.

1237
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,261
You all right?

1238
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:35,591
-Hey, Steph.
-What up, man?

1239
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,427
Hi.

1240
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,796
What up, dude?

1241
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,435
So this is where
the Asians hang out.

1242
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,267
Yup. Library was closed.

1243
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:47,603
Hey, you're a funny guy.

1244
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,937
For an Oriental.

1245
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,446
He's been drinking.

1246
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,618
Hey, Daric, where you going
to go to college next year, man?

1247
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,277
l just turned in
my apps last month.

1248
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,615
What about you?

1249
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,155
Ah, it'll be
an lvy League for sure.

1250
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,247
l don't know which yet.

1251
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,552
You already got in?

1252
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,217
Yeah, of course.

1253
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,727
You'll have to excuse Steve.

1254
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,729
He gets cocky
when he's drunk.

1255
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,594
Only when he's drunk?

1256
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,397
Excuse me, guys.

1257
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,562
Too much testosterone.

1258
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,936
Did l say something?

1259
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,246
So, this is like
the ''l love Stephanie'' fan club.

1260
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,081
You know, Daric,
you're a pretty cool guy.

1261
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:35,613
l can't believe Steph thought
you were a stalker or something.

1262
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,083
Yo, what'd you think
of her friend?

1263
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,252
What friend?

1264
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,091
The one she brought
to mini golf.

1265
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,255
All right.

1266
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:46,097
Yeah. lsn't Steph the best?

1267
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,396
You want a drink?

1268
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,096
Yeah, whatever you get.

1269
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,263
All right.

1270
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,271
Ben?

1271
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,637
l'm good.

1272
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,104
Thanks, D-Rock.

1273
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,941
Anytime, Stevie-boy.

1274
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,913
Why you hang out
with him, Ben?

1275
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,712
He's got something up his ass
all the time.

1276
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,411
He's all right.

1277
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:11,893
Yo... Steph's the one.

1278
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,554
Steph's the one.

1279
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,224
You were right.

1280
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,699
She deserves
to be treated better.

1281
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,895
l'm going to treat her better.

1282
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,733
l owe it all to you, man.

1283
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,773
Thank you.

1284
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,404
Steve, you're wasted.

1285
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,569
Thanks, man.

1286
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,943
Okay. You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1287
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,746
All right.

1288
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,749
l'll be right back.

1289
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:37,750
Okay.

1290
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:38,751
All right.

1291
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,287
Thank you.

1292
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,933
At that point,
by the look in Daric's eyes,

1293
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,301
l knew it was on.

1294
01:17:59,307 --> 01:17:59,374
[ Skipped item nr. 1294 ]

1295
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,568
lt was New Year's Eve.

1296
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:02,542
Jesus said we could use
his house

1297
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,579
if we paid him a hundred bucks.

1298
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,547
His parents had left for Tahoe
a day earlier.

1299
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,811
l still thought it was
a bad idea,

1300
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,217
so the guys and l
made a compromise.

1301
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,721
All l had to do
was be the lookout.

1302
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,722
-Hey.
-Hey.

1303
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,383
They're right around back
in the garage.

1304
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,926
l'll be in there in a sec.

1305
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,797
Fuck!

1306
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:33,536
What's up, fellas?

1307
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,599
So you got the cash?

1308
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,145
Of course.

1309
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,908
Got my gun?

1310
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,916
This...

1311
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,585
is your wake-up call.

1312
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,163
For your mommy and daddy.

1313
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,075
Fuck!

1314
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,408
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

1315
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,880
Han, get the gun!

1316
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:15,915
Shit!

1317
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,007
Oh, God.

1318
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,610
Fuck!

1319
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:57,712
Don't!

1320
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:07,919
Ben.

1321
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,087
Ben.

1322
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,091
Ben!

1323
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,760
What the fuck?

1324
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,960
We didn't agree to this.

1325
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,799
This is going
to cost you extra.

1326
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:53,466
We're going to have to get rid
of the body.

1327
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:54,974
What do you mean?

1328
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,136
Jesus, what about
your backyard?

1329
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:58,144
No way.

1330
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,477
l promise no one
will ever know.

1331
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:03,449
$300.

1332
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,951
Come on, guys, dish it up.

1333
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,253
Shit!

1334
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,593
You guys got any money?

1335
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,633
Virg?

1336
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,760
Here. 150.

1337
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,769
l'll get you the rest tomorrow,
all right?

1338
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:24,134
Fuck no.
You pay me now.

1339
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,279
Here, three hundred.

1340
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,444
Can l have the wallet too?

1341
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,784
Fuck!

1342
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,948
Oh, shit.

1343
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,492
He's still alive.

1344
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,633
Someone hold him up.

1345
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,299
Virg, please, hold him up.

1346
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,898
lt's going to be okay, Ben.

1347
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,603
lt's going to be just fine.

1348
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:09,209
Oh, fuck.

1349
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,411
You got him, Virg?

1350
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,578
Yeah.

1351
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,586
All right.

1352
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,088
Hold him up.
Hold his head up.

1353
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,919
-Hold it up. Tilt it back, okay?
-Okay.

1354
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,425
Let me open his mouth.

1355
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,425
All right.

1356
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,586
lt's going to be fine, Ben.

1357
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:21,788
lt's going to be just fine.

1358
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,188
Oh, shit.

1359
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,062
Just hold him down.
Just hold him down.

1360
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:27,601
-Christ!
-Virg, it's okay.

1361
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,102
Listen to me.
Just hang on, okay?

1362

01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:34,767

lt'll be okay, Virg.
lt'll be okay, Virg.

1371
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,950
Okay, Virgil, just
a few more seconds.

1372
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,615
Just breathe.

1373
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,783
Just hang on!

1374

Are you all right, Ben?

lt's okay, man.

1377
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:06,899
Shh. Shh.

1378
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:15,401
Ben.

1379
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,570
Hey, Stephanie.

1380
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,306
Hi.

1381
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,644
Happy New Year.

1382
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:23,547
Happy New Year.

1383
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,721
Are you okay?

1384
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:31,015
l'm just mad at Steve.

1385
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,652
For what?

1386
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,529
He totally stood me up.

1387
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,933
l know he hates these things,
but still...

1388
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,868
All right, everybody!

1389
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:44,927
Let's get crazy!

1390
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:45,938
lt's almost New Year!

1391
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:46,939
Ten...

1392
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,600
Ten, nine, eight...

1393
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:51,941
l guess neither of us
are getting a kiss tonight, huh?

1394
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:56,039
...five, four, three, two,

1395
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:57,448
one!

1396
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,400
l-l'm so sorry.

1397
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,595
-l didn't mean to...
-No.

1398
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:21,768
Don't apologize.

1399
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,209
l need to talk to Steve.

1400
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:33,886
Uh, well, uh, guys are waiting.

1401
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,583
Thanks, Ben.

1402
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,185
Happy New Year.

1403
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,211
Aw, shit.

1404
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:04,876
Ben, will you take him
out of here?

1405
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:05,885
Aw, fuck!

1406
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:06,886
Fuck, man!

1407
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:08,752
Get the fuck out of here.

1408
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,552
Jesus, would you help us,
please?

1409
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:14,890
Fuck it.

1410
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,727
Ah, Jesus.

1411
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,357
You clean that shit up, man.

1412
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,869
l knew what l had to do.

1413
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,928
Of course,
the right thing to do

1414
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:01,032
was to call the police
and tell them everything.

1415
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:05,307
lt was right...
but it didn't mean it was easy.

1416
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,548
Yo, Virg, l'm here.

1417
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,646
Let's go, man.

1418
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:17,213
Stop jerking off; let's go.

1419
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,528
Yo, Virg,
stop fucking around, man.

1420
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,291
Open the door.

1421
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:26,891
Virg!
Open the fucking door, man!

1422
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:29,293
l said open the door!

1423
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,999
Virg! Open
the fucking door, Virg!

1424
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:36,373
Virg! Virg!

1425
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:38,708
Han said Virgil
had called him over

1426
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,270
to watch some new porn.

1427
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:44,011
l guess Virg just didn't have
enough balls to do it alone.

1428
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:47,646
Open the fucking
door, Virg! Virg!

1429
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:50,054
Fuck you, Virg!

1430
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,615
Open this fucking door!

1431
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:04,966
So... what,

1432
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,337
is he going to be retarded,
or something?

1433
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,205
Ben, get him
the fuck out of here

1434
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,574
before l kick his ass.

1435
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,883
Come on, Daric.

1436
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,119
Come on.

1437
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:35,898
Wait, Ben, you think Virg
is going to talk?

1438
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,997
No. What if he does?

1439
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:41,439
Dude, what are we going to do?

1440
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:43,833
Nothing.

1441
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,903
Okay. Let me think.

1442
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,644
Why did you write
that article about me?

1443
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,381
What?

1444
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:54,512
The newspaper article.

1445
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:55,613
Why did you write it?

1446
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,715
What are you talking
about, man?

1447
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,760
l'm trying
to fucking think here.

1448
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,623
Wait.

1449
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,029
Do you think Han
will be with us?

1450
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,396
Later, Daric.

1451
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:26,013
Ben... l'll call you later.

1452
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,530
Nice.

1453
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,364
You haven't seen Steve,
have you?

1454
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,028
Steve?

1455
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:25,697
Get in.

1456
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,872
He's been gone
for a couple days,

1457
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,712
and he's got everyone worried.

1458
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,347
Are you worried?

1459
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:44,949
Yeah, but you just never know
what Steve's up to.

1460
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,095
Ben, thanks for putting
up with this.

1461
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,462
What?

1462
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,865
The whole thing
with me and Steve.

1463
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:03,036
You know how you make decisions
that lead to other decisions?

1464
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,737
Yeah.

1465
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,474
Then you realize

1466
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:09,516
you don't remember
why you made those decisions

1467
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,676
in the first place.

1468
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,286
Yeah.

1469
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:18,189
When l saw you
on New Year's Eve,

1470
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,659
l knew there was only one
right thing to do.

1471
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:13,778
For the first time in my life,

1472
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:16,078
l don't know
what my future will hold.

1473
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,586
l don't even know what the other
guys are going to do.

1474
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,155
All l know is that
there's no turning back.

1475
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:24,124
All l know is that
there's no turning back.

1476
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:42,721
You said you had
no place to go

1477
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:50,499
While standing
in the doorway of our home

1478
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:06,543
And l'm here waiting to see

1479
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:14,755
lf you've come
and found the key

1480
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:20,665
l went and put it
where it used to be

1481
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:28,266
But l'm not waiting
on eventually

1482
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:35,145
No, l'm not waiting

1483
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:38,583
Are we only scraps

1484
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:43,680
Of everything we hoped
that we could be?

1485
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:50,720
And l'm not waiting
on eventually

1486
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:58,500
No, l'm not waiting

1487
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:05,474
Build your house from scraps

1488
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:13,713
Make a home out of laughs

1489
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:22,557
Build your house from scraps

1490
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:32,099
Make a home out of laughs

1491
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:36,108
And laugh

1492
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:39,771
And laugh

1493
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:43,908
And laugh

1494
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:48,079
And laugh

1495
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:51,613
And laugh

1496
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:53,990
And laugh.
