1
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,538
(projector reeling)

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,208
(propeller engine humming)

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,516
(wolf howling)

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,319
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,158
(door creaking)

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,542
(ominous music)

7
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,382
Ah, this is it.

8
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,491
(ominous music)

9
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:34,195
(wolf howling)

10
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,234
(metal clanging)

11
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,471
(grunting)

12
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,245
(dramatic music)

13
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,360
Looks kind of... empty.

14
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,330
Gee.

15
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,363
Ya think?

16
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,703
Right, pardon me,

17
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,639
but may I help you two
lovely lads with something?

18
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,641
Hey boss, there he is.

19
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,885
What do you know, he's a zombie.

20
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,443
Indeed, I am.

21
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:23,578
Hey, true or false?

22
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,813
Yes.

23
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,514
Are you the guys
that eat brains?

24
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,618
Why yes, I do enjoy a
nicely grilled cerebellum

25
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,753
with a side of chips.

26
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,821
Ah! The bigger the better.

27
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:33,889
(chuckling)

28
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,692
Well then, Floop, you're safe.

29
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,626
Harsh.

30
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,293
Quite rude.

31
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,327
Oi! Hello.

32
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,637
Zombie problem solved.

33
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,572
Ugh.

34
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,775
He's so brittle.

35
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,643
Look at him, Floop.

36
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,546
A stinking, rotten bag
of human garbage, oh.

37
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:03,417
Yep, he's a real sack of crap.

38
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,721
So why do you want him?

39
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,488
This man is Franz Pennywhacker

40
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,557
the world's greatest pianist.

41
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,559
I want those phalanges.

42
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,296
Ah, I get it.

43
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,902
I don't get it.

44
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:20,869
Photo.

45
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:21,904
Snap to it.

46
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,337
(claps)

47
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,371
Chop, chop!

48
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:31,913
Hold it.

49
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,516
Smile for the birdie.

50
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,385
Come on, come on.

51
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,419
Aw, come on.

52
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,521
You can smile bigger than that.

53
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,690
Ah, no, don't do the finger.

54
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:45,426
Uh, what else ya got?

55
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,895
Yeah, okay, we'll do that one.

56
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,797
(flashing)

57
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:51,332
(grunting)

58
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,569
I sure hope all these
parts fit together.

59
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,674
You know, a man's more
than the sum of his parts.

60
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,575
I don't mean just slap
together Superman.

61
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,680
Wow.

62
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,547
How incredibly
thoughtful and sensitive

63
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,884
and yet so insightful.

64
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,719
Come on, we have a
lot of grave robbing

65
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,587
ahead of us this evening.

66
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,621
Hiya!

67
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:17,726
Couldn't we have
gotten a horse for this?

68
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,996
Onward. We have
little time to waste.

69
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,631
I hate this job.

70
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,636
(light organ music)

71
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,669
(gasping)

72
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,974
(ominous music)

73
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,951
(growling)

74
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,054
(snapping)

75
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,856
Ow, oh, oh, oh! The back!

76
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,556
Oh, the back's out again!

77
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,759
Oh, oh no, oh no!

78
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,666
(cracking)

79
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,733
Igor?

80
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,501
Igor, where are you? Come on.

81
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,502
Come out, come out.

82
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,637
I know you're around here.

83
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,706
Come on, you little
flying rodent.

84
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,874
Igor!

85
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,976
Igor where are you? Igor!

86
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:41,877
Ig...

87
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,910
Gah!

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,547
Right here, my Lord.

89
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,683
Come on, my back's out.

90
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,550
I need you to do
that thing you do.

91
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,686
Come on, hurry, please.

92
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,586
I'll get those
vertebrae as straight

93
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,523
as my great aunt Elva's
knickers.

94
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,560
I presume it's the
lumbar in that pesky L4.

95
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,064
Yes, L4 and five.

96
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:03,497
Oh, ah!

97
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,066
Come on, come on.

98
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,566
Hurry up, hurry up.

99
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,702
Do it, do it.

100
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:07,836
Oi.

101
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,037
All right, on three.

102
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,605
And three!

103
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,505
(cracking)

104
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,076
Oh, gah.

105
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,944
Better?

106
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,511
Better.

107
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,579
Better.

108
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,649
Oh, Igor, thank you, thank you.

109
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:21,650
That's good.

110
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,851
I gotta tell you something,

111
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,587
once you hit 300,
everything starts to go.

112
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:27,789
And I mean everything.

113
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,523
Sir, you keep telling me, sir.

114
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,625
Is Lily awake?

115
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:31,860
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,004
She's out on a date
with a Mr. Or lock.

117
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,863
Oh, that's good news.

118
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,965
I really think she's
gonna fall for this fella.

119
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,800
I know a love
connection when I see it

120
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,869
and this is a love connection.

121
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,904
And I wanna tell ya
something about Or lock.

122
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,606
He's not only handsome,

123
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,974
but he's a real swinger.

124
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:49,111
And most importantly,
he's loaded to the fangs!

125
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,113
(chuckling)

126
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,049
(light organ music)

127
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,913
So I assume you are Or lock?

128
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,148
Yes, yes.

129
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,916
And you are?

130
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,051
Um, Lily.

131
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,986
Oh yes, yes, Lily.

132
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,056
It's always so hard
to remember the names.

133
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,624
Oh.

134
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,893
I'm hungry, let's eat.

135
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:38,794
Okay!

136
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:39,827
Ha, ha!

137
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,998
Good evening, Mr. Or lock.

138
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,834
We have your usual table ready.

139
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,568
Please, follow me.

140
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,207
So, do you bring
all your dates here?

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,109
Yes, yes, every night.

142
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:56,777
Oh.

143
00:07:57,946 --> 00:07:58,946
Okay.

144
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,890
(chuckling)

145
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,928
(plates shattering)

146
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,863
Oh, whatever happened
to our waiter?

147
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,965
He moves like a snail.

148
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,667
Uh-huh.

149
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,802
It seems like they've
been waiting awhile.

150
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,237
Oh, they are dead.

151
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,805
Who's hungry?

152
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,242
I have one Cleopatra Special.

153
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,010
Oo, hoo, hoo!

154
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:31,113
No garlic, for the lady.

155
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,881
And one Anubis Salad.

156
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:33,815
[Lily] This looks good.

157
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,183
[Waiter] Extra onions.

158
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,217
Bon appetit!

159
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,753
So how is your food?

160
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,890
Delicious.

161
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,092
(squishing)

162
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,732
Um.

163
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,868
Oh, so I noticed on
your dating profile

164
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,936
you only listed two hobbies,

165
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,139
the black plague and pestilence.

166
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,641
Which I thought, technically,
were both the same.

167
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,244
Exactly the same.

168
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,179
I love them both equally.

169
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,982
Oh, don't get me
wrong, I love it too.

170
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,217
It's just, you know,
kind of old news.

171
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,954
Do you like rats?

172
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,256
Of course, who doesn't?

173
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,192
Oh! Good, good, good!

174
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,162
I have pictures of my
fuzzy little nuggets.

175
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,196
Oh.

176
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,197
Oh, ho!

177
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,665
Somehow I'm not surprised.

178
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,867
Mm, oh!

179
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,171
This is Eric.

180
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,473
He's a naughty boy.

181
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,175
Oh, he's a cute little fella.

182
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,944
Oh! This is Steve.

183
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,846
He's a real cut up.

184
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,881
Watch out for his hijinks!

185
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,917
Oh, yeah, he's cute too.

186
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:46,988
Oh, this Opie but
I call her Tubby.

187
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,858
She likes to cuddle
under my pillow.

188
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,126
Uh-huh.

189
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,762
He likes to sit
on my head, ha, ha.

190
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,296
Marry me.

191
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,329
Ah!

192
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,234
She likes to play hide and seek.

193
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,269
She's really big and fat.

194
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,704
Rolly Polly, Jill.

195
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,874
Pumpkin!

196
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:08,009
(laughing)

197
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:11,313
Do you want to rub
Pumpkin's nose?

198
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,881
Oh, I'm good.

199
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:13,982
Oh, okay.

200
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,919
(eerie music)

201
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Come to me.

202
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,035
Be a good little wolf.

203
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,843
Ah, puppy.

204
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,144
Come forward and sit.

205
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,317
Awaken.

206
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,351
Oh, man.

207
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,123
You are a difficult
wolf to find.

208
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,193
Which is strange, because
you are the only wolf

209
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:01,329
in town that owes
Zoya big money!

210
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,265
Me? Nah.

211
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,100
I've been around on the scene.

212
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,002
You know, rocking and rolling.

213
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,372
I know scene, you are
not rocking man on scene.

214
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,141
Ha, ha! Right, like
this guy knows the scene?

215
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,342
Give me a break!

216
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,111
I get around.

217
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,144
Enough!

218
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,082
You give me money now or Bella

219
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,350
will chop off your hand.

220
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,953
Okay, stop.

221
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,421
Let's not get crazy.

222
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,889
I gotta ask ya a question.

223
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,860
Why you got a picture
of my pops on your wall?

224
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,128
(cackling)

225
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:35,363
That is ancient,
unfinished history.

226
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,033
Uh, I don't like
the sound of that.

227
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,934
He should call.

228
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,936
It is time for you
to make the call.

229
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,807
(dramatic music)

230
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:49,177
(laughing)

231
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,414
(phone ringing)

232
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,982
Igor, get the phone.

233
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:55,183
I'm watching TV.

234
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:58,386
(phone ringing)

235
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,388
What does he do
that's so important

236
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:03,124
that he can't be
here when I need him?

237
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:06,127
(phone ringing)

238
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,029
Never mind, I'll get it myself.

239
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,297
It's not like I'm the Count.

240
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,101
Yeah, who is this?

241
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,002
Leave me alone.

242
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:15,403
Yo, pops!

243
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,038
How ya been, baby?

244
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:18,306
Hey guess what?

245
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,275
You're very lucky, I'm
in a good mood tonight.

246
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,911
I'm gonna give you
exactly two seconds.

247
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:23,944
Are ya ready?

248
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:26,214
Go.

249
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,225
I know a straight as an
arrow business lady who...

250
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,451
Time's up.

251
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,453
Listen, pops, she
wants to buy the castle

252
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,055
and transform it into a
casino slash theme park.

253
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,156
We can't lose.

254
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,291
What do ya say?

255
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:38,393
Get the hair out of your ears

256
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,863
and listen very, very closely.

257
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,967
I would rather go into
business with Jack the Ripper!

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,902
Who by the way is
no Jack the tipper.

259
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:51,306
5% tops with this guy,
it's an embarrassment.

260
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,141
Than ever go into
business with you!

261
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:57,978
Moron.

262
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,349
I assume you heard what he said.

263
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:04,519
All Zoya hear was
big, big trouble

264
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,054
for little wolf, wolf.

265
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,389
Funny.

266
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:08,456
That's what I heard too.

267
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,526
(woman screaming)

268
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,994
Oh, nice neighborhood.

269
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,964
So, do you live around here?

270
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:16,997
Yes, yes.

271
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,300
Just around the corner.

272
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,404
Oh well, that's convenient.

273
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,372
Oh yes, yes.

274
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,107
Very convenient.

275
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:33,481
I have a little surprise.

276
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,718
Close your eyes.

277
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:36,751
Oh.

278
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,354
Come with me.

279
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:43,057
Just over here.

280
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,394
Okay.

281
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,495
No peeky-peeky.

282
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,036
(funky music)

283
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,304
Open your eyes!

284
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,940
(funky music)

285
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:03,978
♪ Disco vampire ♪

286
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:07,348

(pop)

292
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,061
(dog barking)

293
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,094
I'm gonna go.

294
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,332
Oh.

295
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,367
Okay.

296
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:33,609
[Announcer] You're
watching TV 666 Transylvania.

297
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:37,312
(dramatic music)

298
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,614
[Reporter] Breaking news!

299
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:39,782
What, what's this?

300
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:42,450
[Reporter] With Donna Doomley.

301
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,553
Good evening, I'm Donna
Doomley with breaking news.

302
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,432
Transylvania's
favorite funny man,

303
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,525
Shecky Von Rathbone, has died.

304
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,394
Shecky was eaten
alive last night

305
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,096
by an irate heckler.

306
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,165
You're momma's so stupid, uh,

307
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,076
she stared at a cup of
orange juice for 12 hours

308
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,302
because it said concentrate.

309
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,437
You call that jokes?

310
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,305
The guy got what he deserved.

311
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:05,507
I got a good job.

312
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,275
I mean, working at
a mirror factory

313
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,646
is something I could totally
see myself doing sexy.

314
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,649
The remains of Shecky were
taken to the Dew Drop In

315
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,183
Funeral Home.

316
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,217
(chuckling)

317
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,152
Shecky's death comes just hours

318
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,122
after the passing of his
brother, Shelly Von Rathbone,

319
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,391
world renown astrophysicist.

320
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,126
Sometimes referred to as

321
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,262
the smartest man on earth.

322
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,098
Silicon carbide
grains are present

323
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,133
in refractory inclusions.

324
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,469
A mere child could
trace the torsions.

325
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,137
Shelly's body also lies in state

326
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,506
at the Dew Drop In Funeral Home.

327
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,609
Although it is
unlikely that anyone

328
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:44,445
but a complete moron, and
I do mean complete moron,

329
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,148
would ever confuse
these two men.

330
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,183
I'm Donna Doomley
and I will continue

331
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,252
to bring you the
news as it breaks.

332
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,666
I'll stand guard
from across the way

333
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,326
while you steal the second most
brilliant brain of our time.

334
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,327
Question.

335
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:04,867
And I know what
you're gonna say.

336
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,435
Leave the sciencey
stuff to you, but,

337
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,270
why don't we steal the first

338
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,640
most brilliant
brain of our time?

339
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:16,277
Because, my dear Floop,
I'm still using it.

340
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,479
Geez, conceited much?

341
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:21,416
No, not conceited at all.

342
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:24,519
Simply dropping ice cold facts.

343
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,625
Well, giddy up, little doggy.

344
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,329
And remember!

345
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,666
Shelly Von Rathbone.

346
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:41,202
No other brain shall do.

347
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,475
What do I look like, a moron?

348
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,273
Don't answer that!

349
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,306
I wrote it on my hand.

350
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,577
Oh god.

351
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:02,123
(door creaking)

352
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Nope.

353
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,442
Nope.

354
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:26,513
Bingo!

355
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,518
Well, hello Mr. Von Rathbone.

356
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,287
Sorry, old boy.

357
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,226
But I'm gonna be
needing that melon.

358
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,895
(sawing)

359
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,367
(thundering)

360
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,494
(somber music)

361
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:39,313
(cracking thunder)

362
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,092
Think of it!

363
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,795
The brain of a super
genius transplanted

364
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:57,431
into the body of a
perfect physical specimen.

365
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:58,599
Ha, ha, ha!

366
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,604
So what are ya gonna call him?

367
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,338
I hadn't given much thought

368
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,542
to such trivial matters,
but now that you mention it,

369
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,847
Project 27X67H54 is a bit dry.

370
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,683
(munching)

371
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,551
Ah!

372
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,754
As I stride this unholy planet

373
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:22,490
as a modern day
Prometheus, perhaps Uranus!

374
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,592
God of the sky!

375
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:27,896
Seriously?

376
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,430
You're making his
life a lot harder

377
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,365
than it has to be with
a name like Uranus.

378
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,871
Well, I suppose you
have a better idea.

379
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,706
Okay, go on, out with it.

380
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,479
I don't know, Herman.

381
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:47,448
Herman?

382
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,851
Yeah.

383
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,586
I had a pitspire named
Herman, he was a swell guy.

384
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,354
Hm, he's gonna need
a last name too.

385
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,794
How about Munster?

386
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:00,963
Do you really think I would call

387
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:04,766
the greatest creation in
the history of mankind

388
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Herman Monster?

389
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,838
Not Herman Monster,
Herman Munster.

390
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,472
Like the cheese.

391
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,574
Like the cheese!

392
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,010
Out of my way, you simpleton.

393
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,378
I've got work to do.

394
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,683
(snapping electricity)

395
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:23,819
Let's make history, Floop!

396
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,854
Are you ready?

397
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:27,723
Three!

398
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:28,957
Two!

399
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:29,958
One!

400
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,425
And away we go!

401
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:33,996
Ah, ha, ha!

402
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:37,398
(buzzing electricity)

403
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,774
Ah, ah, I want more volts!

404
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,975
Woo, ah!

405
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,009
Woo!

406
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,479
Yes, we need it!

407
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,581
We need more power!

408
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:54,615
Ah!

409
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,722
Don't do it!

410
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,490
You'll kill us both!

411
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,759
Ah, ha!

412
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,526
[Announcer] Warning, warning!

413
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,829
Give me more power!

414
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,665
Are you insane?

415
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:11,800
(cackling)

416
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,004
Woo! Ha, ha, ha!

417
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,571
Live, I tell you!

418
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,442
Live!

419
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:25,546
(cackling)

420
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,483
Cut the power, Floop!

421
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,291
And done!

422
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:41,997
Oh, my creation is born.

423
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,768
(ethereal music)

424
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,206
I'm no expert.

425
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,980
In fact, you yourself called
me a, what was that again?

426
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:58,981
Simpleton.

427
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:00,581
Right, simpleton.

428
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,886
So, take this in the
proper spirit, but uh.

429
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,021
Shouldn't he be
moving or something?

430
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,698
(thudding)

431
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,033
Interesting.

432
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,835
Anything going on in there?

433
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,008
No!

434
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,883
(whimpering)

435
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:39,987
No!

436
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,627
(sobbing)

437
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,835
Well, what are ya gonna do?

438
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:56,804
It's alive!

439
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,373
Alive!

440
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:04,646
Oo, no, ugh.

441
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,948
I was talking about my
pet cockroach, Ernie.

442
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,550
You see, I thought he was
dead, but look, he's fine.

443
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:11,820
(chirping)

444
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:12,888
(squishing)

445
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,356
Aye!

446
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,624
Oh no, he's still fine.

447
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:16,657
Tough little bugger.

448
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:20,762
You have no idea what this
failure means to humanity.

449
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:25,867
I could have changed the
course of life as we know it.

450
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,705
I could have altered mankind's
place in the universe.

451
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,174
I could have...

452
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,209
(yawning)

453
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:35,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

454
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:36,378
Am I boring you?

455
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,814
(yawning)

456
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:39,847
Well, am I?

457
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,890
(muffled screaming)

458
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,761
Don't speak, my dear creation.

459
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:54,162
Don't speak.

460
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:57,833
Save your words of wisdom
for the grand unveiling.

461
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,201
Ha, ha, oh.

462
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,736
The world will be watching.

463
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,705
Ha, ha, ha!

464
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,950
[Announcer] Live from the
beautiful Carpathia Mountains

465
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,777
it's "Good Morning
Transylvania."

466
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,747
With your host, the one
and only, Ezra Mosher.

467
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,183
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Ezra.

468
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,220
Hello, everybody.

469
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,889
Welcome back to "Good
Morning Transylvania."

470
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,791
I'm your host, Ezra Mosher

471
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:25,127
and we are coming to ya live
from the very windy studio...

472
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,795
So I really thought
you and old Or lock

473
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:27,829
were gonna hit it off.

474
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,166
Maybe you should give
him another shot.

475
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,834
All right, so he's
a little obsessed

476
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:33,902
with the black plague.

477
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,270
A man needs his hobbies.

478
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:38,006
It's not just that.

479
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,676
I want a man that makes
my blood run cold.

480
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,813
A man that every time
he enters my crypt,

481
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:49,184
it's like a stake through
my dead, black heart.

482
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,786
I could whip ya up a
hubby down in the lab.

483
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,922
Oh no! Remember what
happened last time?

484
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,024
It took us a month to
get him off the roof.

485
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:58,894
He was batty, but
he sure had charisma.

486
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,128
Eh.

487
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,197
Now, can we change the
subject of my love life?

488
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:07,169
So your idiot brother
Lester called last night.

489
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:08,803
Mm, let me guess.

490
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:10,105
He's broke again.

491
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,073
He wants me to sell our castle

492
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:14,009
and cut him in on the deal.

493
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:17,145
Well, at least he dreams big.

494
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,682
Heh, his dreams are my bank
accounts worst nightmare.

495
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,084
Oh.

496
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,719
Oh my goodness.

497
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:26,821
We've got a great treat
in store for everyone.

498
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,157
Our favorite mad
scientist, Dr. Wolfgang,

499
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:32,060
is here to unveil
his latest creation.

500
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:33,228
Oh, ha!

501
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,930
Now ladies and gentlemen.

502
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:38,266
Let's give a warm, "Good
Morning Transylvania" welcome

503
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,703
to the one, the only Dr.
Henry Augustus Wolfgang!

504
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:43,939
Oh, ho, ho!

505
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:45,073
Oo, hoo, hoo!

506
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:47,275
[Ezra] What a pleasure
to have you here.

507
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,077
May I call ya Henry?

508
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,312
(clattering plates)

509
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,713
Oh, finally.

510
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:58,887
Raven's egg with a side of
tarantula hash browns, my lady.

511
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,222
Oh, thank you, Igor.

512
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,990
It looks yummy!

513
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:04,993
(giggling)

514
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,928
Bring it on, bring it on.

515
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:07,972
We have something extraordinary,

516
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,764
and I know everyone backstage

517
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:10,942
is so excited about
what's going on.

518
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,300
Your regular, my Lord.

519
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:15,937
Ice cold.

520
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:18,907
Some of the most
substantial intellects

521
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,811
in Transylvania have
called you certifiable.

522
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:26,348
Well, these so-called
substantial intellects.

523
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:30,185
Well they can just eat
my (cuckoo whistle)

524
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:34,956
And kiss my rosy little
(cuckoo whistle).

525
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,358
Oh, hoo, hoo!

526
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:38,793
Well doctor, now that
we've got that out of the way

527
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,763
why don't you show
us what you've got?

528
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:46,067
(triumphal music)

529
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:13,295
Speak, my child of electricity.

530
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:18,166
Speak, my child of tomorrow!

531
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:21,069
Speak!

532
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,340
(grunting)

533
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,177
(gasping)

534
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,412
Oh my god.

535
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:34,382
He is gorgeous.

536
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,084
Look at that head.

537
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:39,254
Perfectly flat.

538
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,257
You don't see that everyday.

539
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,059
Hey, can you imagine having

540
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,927
a big maroon like
that in the family?

541
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,262
I couldn't live with the shame.

542
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,295
Shh!

543
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:52,267
Dazzle them with
some quantum physics.

544
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Huh?

545
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:59,307
(screeching)

546
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,909
Enough talking.

547
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:02,410
Now a little music.

548
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:04,879
(growling)

549
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:09,851
(single note repeated)

550
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:15,123
(cracking)

551
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:18,026
(crowd laughing)

552
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,261
(screeching)

553
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:27,968
Speak.

554
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:37,345
(grunting)

555
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:46,221
(crowd laughing)

556
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:51,292
My mother-in-law fell
down a wishing well.

557
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:55,263
Boy, I didn't know those
things actually worked.

558
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:58,133
(chuckling)

559
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:02,437
My friend recently died
drinking a gallon of varnish.

560
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,040
It was a horrible end,
but a lovely finish.

561
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,176
(laughing)

562
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:11,045
Maestro, hit it!

563
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:13,548
(light music)

564
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,350
A horse walks into the bar.

565
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,952
The bartender says,
why the long face?

566
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,022
Speaking of establishments,

567
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,991
I'm thinking of opening
up a restaurant.

568
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,392
I'm gonna call it Karma.

569
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:25,360
There's no menu.

570
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:27,495
You just get what you deserve.

571
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,264
(chuckling)

572
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,299
Okay, okay, I can actually feel

573
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,034
my brain cells dying.

574
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,103
Igor, change the channel.

575
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:36,538
(clicking)

576
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:39,307
(deep voice) Don't you dare
touch that dial!

577
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,378
Oh!

578
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:45,346
Goodnight, everybody!

579
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,982
I mean, good
morning, ha, ha, ha!

580
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,486
(upbeat music)

581
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:54,355
He's perfect!

582
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,463
(light music)

583
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,198
Ruined, I tell you!

584
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:05,467
Disgraced in front
of the entire world

585
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,268
by a dancing baboon.

586
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:11,539
Don't worry, I got the
situation under control.

587
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,209
I've been working on some
really keen magic tricks.

588
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:15,243
Magic tricks?

589
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:16,478
- Juggling?
- Juggling!

590
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,511
Impressions?

591
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,349
Wait until you get
a load of this one.

592
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:23,017
(shimmering)

593
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:26,020
You gotta ask
yourself one question.

594
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,222
Do ya feel lucky?

595
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,325
Huh? Do ya, punk?

596
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:32,093
Woo, I get chills
every time I hear it.

597
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,461
I've heard enough!

598
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:36,296
Oh.

599
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,234
Farewell, comrades.

600
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,170
Away, I must go.

601
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:45,106
To live amongst the beasts.

602
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,139
And the lepers.

603
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:49,244
Of dark Zanzibar.

604
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:55,618
The old doc sure isn't
cut out for show business.

605
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:59,655
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

606
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:03,224
You see, there are
unfounded rumors

607
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:08,062
that I might have accidentally
switched brains and...

608
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,300
Ah, forget it! It's old news.

609
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:16,538
Floopy, old boy, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

610
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,572
What's that, big guy?

611
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,143
For some strange reason,

612
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,456
I can't seem to
remember my name.

613
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:26,313
Well.

614
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:30,418
Picture it in lights.

615
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:36,457
The greatest name in
all of show business,

616
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,326
izness, izness, izness.

617
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,564
Herman Munster!

I find wolf
sneaking out backdoor.

650
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:14,288
When I hear your
Lester was in my club,

651
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:18,593
I was assuming he was
here to deliver good news.

652
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:22,263
You own this joint?

653
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:24,565
Zoya owns many joints.

654
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:29,303
Yeah, I guess... I guess
I should a figured that.

655
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:30,639
Well?

656
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:32,407
Good news? Yes.

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,742
Well, I'm close.

658
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,679
I got a few irons in the fire.

659
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,322
I've got my feelers
out there in the street

660
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:41,817
and I'm pretty sure
with a little more time,

661
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,318
I can get you what
you want, heh.

662
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,722
I give you two weeks
to get the castle.

663
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:51,492
Afterwards, you're head is mine.

664
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,494

I'm starting to think my
material is too intellectual.

668
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:05,708
Maybe I should return
to my vaudeville roots.

669
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:06,441
Ugh, no way, man.

670
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,644
This is the wave of the future.

671
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:09,712
What do you guys think?

672
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,822
Ah, they don't know nothing.

673
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,346
See, they agree.

674
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,625
Don't listen to
them, they're relics.

675
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,616
I'm talking about the long road

676
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,384
to the tippity top!

677
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,662
Well, maybe I should
go a bit more mainstream.

678
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:19,855
I am a man of many parts.

679
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:22,725
The honey babies are falling
at your feet, you're the man!

680
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:24,559
I'm not looking
for honey babies.

681
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,631
Hey, baby, what's shaking?

682
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm looking for a
vision, a queen, true love.

683
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:35,880
Forget about the dames, man.

684
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:37,639
Worry about the music.

685
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,651
We gotta feed the machine
and we gotta cut some vinyl.

686
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,852
The beast is
hungry, and besides,

687
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,343
Rome wasn't built in a day.

688
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:44,345
True, but I believe I was.

689
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,824
Yeah, well, that's
besides the point.

690
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,751
I need some hits.

691
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,518
You want hits?

692
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,620
Okay, I'll give you hits.

693
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:59,293
(sighing)

694
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:01,729
Ah!

695
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,501
So you give me what I want?

696
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:07,534
Yes.

697
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:11,372
I will get that deed signed.

698
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,642
The castle will be yours.

699
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:15,878
And we can all live
happily ever after.

700
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,345
I promise.

701
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,346
Get out.

702
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,749
(chuckling)

703
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:23,384
(funky music)

704
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,326
What the heck?

705
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,402
Lily, I never thought
I'd see you haunting

706
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,805
these hallowed halls.

707
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:44,539
What brings you here?

708
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,775
That, my dear brother,
is none of your business.

709
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,944
I bet it's that new cat, Herman.

710
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:50,411
I can dig it.

711
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:51,589
I was rapping with him earlier.

712
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:52,915
Solid dude.

713
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,616
Seriously?

714
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,851
You know him?

715
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:56,819
How?

716
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:57,653
You wanna meet him?

717
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:59,487
Oh yes!

718
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,723
But I don't know if I trust
you making the introduction.

719
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:03,826
Consider me your bat wing man.

720
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:06,862
Although, I do seem to be
a little light tonight.

721
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,502
Danke.

722
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:15,570
So?

723
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:16,772
Where is he?

724
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,706
Who?

725
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,707
Herman Munster!

726
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,508
Oh, oh, oh.

727
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,880
Your Romeo is just down the
hall, last door on the left.

728
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:28,416
Or right, one of them doors.

729
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,449
Ha, ha, ha.

730
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,621
(howling)

731
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:34,823
(chuckling)

732
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,397
(squeaking rats)

733
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,499
(knocking)

734
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,875
And what exactly do you want?

735
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:54,910
Um, is Herman Munster in there?

736
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:58,680
Maybe.

737
00:37:58,714 --> 00:37:59,991
And who should I say is calling?

738
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,617
Lily.

739
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,952
(choral music)

740
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,490
Why don't you just take a number

741
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,525
and wait in the alley with
the rest of the chicks?

742
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,695
(crashing)

743
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:14,730
Well, hello.

744
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:18,800
Hi, um, I'm a big fan and um,

745
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,501
I was wondering.

746
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,503
Well, wait, no this sounds dumb.

747
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,973
But maybe would you like to
come over for dinner one night?

748
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,507
Dinner.

749
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,578
I'd have to check my schedule.

750
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,612
Please hold.

751
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,719
(creaking)

752
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:38,921
Oh boy, oh boy!

753
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,389
Oh boy, oh boy!

754
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,793
Uh, yeah.

755
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:48,030
I happen to have
an opening sometime

756
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,530
in the near future.

757
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,234
What night were
you thinking about?

758
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:55,704
Um, well, maybe tomorrow.

759
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:56,737
Tomorrow?

760
00:38:57,973 --> 00:38:58,941
Hold, please.

761
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,575
Oh.

762
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,745
(creaking)

763
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:04,947
Whoa, tomorrow!

764
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Tomorrow!

765
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,687
Uh, yeah.

766
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,057
I moved some
appointments around.

767
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,925
I think tomorrow works.

768
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,694
Fantastic.

769
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:20,561
Here's my address.

770
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:21,930
And we usually eat early.

771
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,799
Um, we?

772
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:26,268
Oh, my father, the Count and I.

773
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:29,705
Ha, I can dig that, the Count.

774
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:31,505
Far out.

775
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,942
Now I know you show business
people keep weird hours.

776
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:37,913
Shall we say around midnight
or is that too early?

777
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:40,916
Well, I usually
have my bubble bath,

778
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,583
yummy treat, and nap time.

779
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:44,786
But yeah, midnight sounds great.

780
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,824
Tomorrow it is, my sweet Lily.

781
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:49,857
Oh.

782
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:51,692
Tootles.

783
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:57,498
(creaking door)

784
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,803
(Herman cheering)

785
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:03,537
Herman's got a date!

786
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,611
(light music)

787
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,850
I can't go, I tell
ya, I can't go.

788
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:15,784
What are you talking about?

789
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:16,818
Why can't you go?

790
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:18,720
I haven't got a thing to wear.

791
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:20,789
Herman, you gotta take it easy.

792
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,556
You're a stud.

793
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,893
She's just some undead chick
from out in the sticks.

794
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,560
Quit being so dramatic.

795
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,595
Dramatic!

796
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:32,768
Lily thinks I'm a
Hollywood big shot.

797
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,136
A swinger in the in-crowd.

798
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:36,638
I'm no Bobby Darin.

799
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:37,973
She's gonna see right through me

800
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,941
and know I'm just a big boob!

801
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:42,978
Ah, I need the perfect choice.

802
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:44,946
Herman isn't some lug
head who just fell off

803
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,615
the funeral truck.

804
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:48,784
He's a man of the world.

805
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,085
Well boob or no boob,

806
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,054
when you got hot wax like this,

807
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:54,056
the world is at your feet, baby!

808
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,657
Why, brother man.

809
00:40:56,925 --> 00:41:00,796
With a disc like
this, who can resist?

810
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:01,829
So Igor?

811
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:06,101
Which dress says I'm
very, very interested

812
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:08,637
but not a miserable
and depressed?

813
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,605
The silk baby tarantula web?

814
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,074
Well, yes.

815
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,142
Well yes, of course.

816
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:16,745
Or the faux lizard silk chiffon?

817
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,213
Oh, um, the faux.

818
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:20,816
Um, oh, well you could.

819
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:21,849
Maybe, yes.

820
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:24,219
Igor, get with it!

821
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:27,823
Yowza, baby!

822
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:28,856
Kick it! Woo!

823
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Oh!

824
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,964
Fresh blood, get
your fresh blood!

825
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,700
Fresh blood!

826
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,168
Grab your fresh blood!

827
00:41:41,236 --> 00:41:42,236
Fresh blood!

828
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,239
Lilies!

829
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:46,975
Ha, this my lucky night.

830
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:50,178
What else can I
do for you today?

831
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,200
Well, everything looks so great.

832
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,018
I'll take a bottle
of the B posit...

833
00:41:57,052 --> 00:41:59,654
No! I'm gonna splurge.

834
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:00,422
O negative.

835
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:03,158
Oh, that's a good year.

836
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,627
It's two leg, and
one for the lilies.

837
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,731
Three leg? Wow,
prices are going up.

838
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,268
You know, that reminds me.

839
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,003
I bought a balloon yesterday.

840
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,939
I thought the same thing.

841
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:19,941
Must be the inflation.

842
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:22,176
Ha, ha, ha!

843
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:24,179
Ah, ha, ha!

844
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,849
(light music)

845
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,090
Hello, Lily!

846
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:37,192
That's too boring.

847
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,962
Good evening, my dear Lily.

848
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:41,996
That's too uptight.

849
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,866
Yo, what's up?

850
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,301
Nah, that's too glib.

851
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,769
It doesn't seem glib.

852
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,171
There's no good.

853
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:51,206
Hey, baby doll. What's shaking?

854
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:55,777
Let's blow this pop stand
and get our groove on.

855
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:58,246
Hermie's got the moves.

856
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,017
Back it up, back it up.

857
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,852
Hermie's backing it up.

858
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,287
Hey, numbskull!

859
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,289
(record scratching)

860
00:43:07,322 --> 00:43:08,990
What?

861
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,726
I said, hey numbskull!

862
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,930
Excuse me sir, can you speak up?

863
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:20,502
I assume you are the
Herman Munster character

864
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:23,505
I've been hearing so
much about lately?

865
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,941
Yeah, I think I'm the only one!

866
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,742
When they made me
they broke the mold!

867
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:30,278
With you in it, I presume.

868
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,816
No!

869
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,751
I think I was out by that point!

870
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:39,154
Wait there, I'm gonna come
right...

871
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:41,121
Down.

872
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,825
Are you gonna come inside

873
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:45,760
or do you wanna stand out here

874
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:48,196
swiveling your hips like
a rabid baboon in heat

875
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,031
for the whole
neighborhood to see?

876
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,132
I'll come in!

877
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:56,271
Why are you shouting?

878
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:58,006
I thought you liked it!

879
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,741
Why don't you come inside?

880
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:07,816
After you.

881
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:08,984
Thank you!

882
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,017
I mean, thank you.

883
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,358
This is for you.

884
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,392
Oh yeah, what is it?

885
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:19,561
It's a bottle of O negative.

886
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,305
The blood lady said it
was a very good year.

887
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,832
Well, you're very kind.

888
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:24,399
Thank you.

889
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:26,334
The kind I don't need.

890
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:31,072
(ethereal music)

891
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:42,317
Hermie, thank you
so much for coming.

892
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,419
I hope you like curried
scorpion casserole.

893
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:46,955
I made it especially
for tonight.

894
00:44:46,988 --> 00:44:49,357
If you made it, I
know I'm gonna love it.

895
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:52,060
As a matter of fact,

896
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,693
I saved a special spot
for it right here.

897
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:55,930
I mean right here.

898
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:56,964
Oh, you.

899
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:58,800
Oh, these are for you.

900
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:01,436
Thank you so much.

901
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,405
Lilies are my favorite.

902
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:06,041
He gives her lilies
because her name is Lily.

903
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:09,044
We're dealing with some
serious brain power here.

904
00:45:09,077 --> 00:45:11,446
Father, that's quite enough.

905
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:12,314
Come on, Hermie.

906
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:13,181
I'll show you around.

907
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:14,214
Yes, Lily.

908
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:19,954
I beg her to make
curried scorpion casserole

909
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:21,323
and I get nothing.

910
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,425
All of a sudden Mr.
Herman Munster comes over

911
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,827
and it's raining curried
scorpion casserole.

912
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:30,932
Oh, bebop, baloo-bop!

913
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:32,967
How low can you go?

914
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,235
(laughing)

915
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,438
I mean, the songs
just come to me.

916
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,206
I got a million of 'em.

917
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,250
I mean, I don't even know
where they come from exactly,

918
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:42,410
but I get a lot of hot
tracks up in this noggin.

919
00:45:42,444 --> 00:45:44,212
(chuckling)

920
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:46,381
(slurping)

921
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:49,384
Ah.

922
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,919
You know, father,
Herman isn't just

923
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:51,953
another pretty face.

924
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:54,923
He's also very, very funny.

925
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:55,957
Stop.

926
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,293
Oh yeah, that's right.

927
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:01,896
Flat top here fancies
himself a comedian.

928
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,233
All right, dazzle me with
your side splitting wit.

929
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:06,266
Okay.

930
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,337
Here's one I know
you're gonna love.

931
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,276
How do you keep a grouchy, old,

932
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,446
broken down,
vampire in suspense?

933
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:22,417
(light music)

934
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,425
I don't know.

935
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,695
How do you keep a grouchy, old,

936
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,029
broken down vampire in suspense?

937
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:39,300
I'll tell ya later.

938
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,273
Ha, ha, ha!

939
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,941
Ah, ha, ha!

940
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:51,311
Oh, you.

941
00:46:53,415 --> 00:46:55,250
(wheezing)

942
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,061
Okay, what exactly are
your intentions here?

943
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,020
Because, as you can
see, I've been around

944
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:01,022
the cemetery a few times myself,

945
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,024
and you are not
going to bamboozle me

946
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,926
with your fancy
showbiz fast talk.

947
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:08,496
(creaking chair)

948
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:12,133
(sighing)

949
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:16,237
I assure you, my good man.

950
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:21,309
My intentions are
nothing but honorable.

951
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:23,478
Deep inside

952
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,348
beats the heart of a
simple country boy.

953
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,384
Oh.

954
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,086
In fact, most of my parts

955
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,355
come straight from the dirt.

956
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,192
Oh!

957
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,093
Did you hear that?

958
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:41,764
You can't get more
grounded than that.

959
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:44,999
A simple country boy
straight from the dirt.

960
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,167
Preach it, sister.

961
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:53,107
This is a bunch
of cornball hooey.

962
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,077
Listen, Herman, you may
have hoodwinked Lily

963
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,780
with your folksy gibberish,

964
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,514
but it ain't working on me.

965
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,618
Okay, we're done here.

966
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,119
Enjoy your scorpion, father.

967
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:06,054
Come on, Hermie.

968
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:07,355
Let's go for a walk.

969
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:10,225
Uh, well, it was
so nice to meet you

970
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:11,627
and I hope to see
you again soon.

971
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,228
Over my dead body.

972
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,097
That would be delightful.

973
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,232
Oh, ignore him.

974
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:18,366
Come on, Hermie.

975
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,201
Come on, let's go.

976
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:22,036
Okay, Lily.

977
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,138
(laughing)

978
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:28,109
Hey by the way, your
scorpion is undercooked!

979
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,083
Igor.

980
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:36,484
Sir?

981
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:39,120
We have to do something
about this situation.

982
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:44,058
(light music)

983
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,066
What's that?

984
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,568
Oh, that's one
of my gravestones.

985
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,601
Wow!

986
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,348
I hope you don't take the things

987
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:59,240
my father says to heart.

988
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:00,518
He's a bit old fashioned and has

989
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,111
a tendency to go
straight for the jugular.

990
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:05,079
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that, heh, heh.

991
00:49:05,113 --> 00:49:07,282
Oh, I didn't mean it literally.

992
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:09,551
Although to be safe,
wear high collared shirts

993
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,286
while you are getting
to know each other.

994
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:12,520
Oh.

995
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:14,322
Lily it shall be
my mission in life

996
00:49:14,355 --> 00:49:16,457
to get that man to like me.

997
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:19,093
And when Herman Munster
puts his head to something,

998
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,496
Herman Munster puts
his head to it.

999
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,565
Unless of course it falls off.

1000
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:24,465
(wheezing)

1001
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,601
- Can I confess something?
- Please do.

1002
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:28,169
I knew the moment
I laid eyes on you

1003
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,337
that you were special.

1004
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:33,107
I understand if you
don't feel the same.

1005
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:36,511
I'm just a regular gal
living a boring, normal life.

1006
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:37,713
No, when I first saw you

1007
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:39,480
my heart leapt from my chest.

1008
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:43,251
If there's one thing I know

1009
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:46,287
is that the rest of
the world melted away

1010
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:48,289
as soon as you
appeared in my life.

1011
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,158
Oh, Hermie.

1012
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:51,191
Mm.

1013
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,196
After you, my dear.

1014
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,198
Oh.

1015
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:05,473

Oh Hermie, it's so romantic here

00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:26,547
with the soft, gentle
screech of the vultures

1056
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,617
circling overhead.

1057
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,818
It sure is, dear.

1058
00:52:29,852 --> 00:52:31,653
Unfortunately the
clouds are clearing up

1059
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,622
and the sun's coming out.

1060
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,356
Oh.

1061
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,425
Pussy cat, this
last week has been

1062
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,261
the most wonderful time
of all of my lives.

1063
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,902
Lily, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

1064
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:48,604
Oh yes, pookie bear?

1065
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,676
Okay, keep it together big guy.

1066
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,511
You're Herman Munster.

1067
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:57,880
You got this, you practiced it.

1068
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:58,913
Let's do it.

1069
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,652
Lily, I...

1070
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:04,552
What is it?

1071
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:05,585
Is something wrong?

1072
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:10,659
Will you, ma, ma, ma...

1073
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:12,527
Marry me?

1074
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:15,764
Oh, Hermie!

1075
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,835
You've made me the happiest
ghoul in the world.

1076
00:53:22,638 --> 00:53:25,573
Everything you ever wanted
to know about magic spells

1077
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:27,676
but were afraid to ask.

1078
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,846
Igor, there's gotta be a
husband spell in here somewhere.

1079
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,447
Are you sure about this?

1080
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:36,685
It seems that Miss
Lily is truly in love.

1081
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,687
Oh come on, you know and I know

1082
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,422
that we gotta get rid of
that bozo Herman Munster.

1083
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:42,557
He's got no class.

1084
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,826
Class?

1085
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,627
Yeah, class.

1086
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:47,639
He's a stitch job from the
wrong side of the cemetery.

1087
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,631
He's not the type
of person I want

1088
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:51,465
my Lily hooking up with.

1089
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,836
Hamster.

1090
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,570
Oh, hippopotamus.

1091
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:59,440
Let's see, husband!

1092
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,475
There's a husband spell.

1093
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:04,445
I really think you
should reconsider.

1094
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,648
Who's side are you on, anyway?

1095
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:07,749
Mine's the best one.

1096
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,450
It's the most gruesome.

1097
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:11,519
It is not, mine is uglier.

1098
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:12,621
Oh yeah?

1099
00:54:12,654 --> 00:54:14,723
I've got the ugliest face.

1100
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:17,425
Freddy, we're talking
about the sweatshirts.

1101
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,593
(giggling)

1102
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:19,871
Sorry things didn't
work out for you

1103
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:21,596
so great at the leper colony.

1104
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,466
I don't want to talk about it.

1105
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,535
Well, at least you came home

1106
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:28,937
with that cool new T-shirt.

1107
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:31,372
They gave it to me when
they lost my luggage.

1108
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:35,878
(creaking door)

1109
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:37,746
Hey, hey, you're back!

1110
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,650
It's not a crime to go
on holiday, now is it?

1111
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,485
Uh, well, you look good.

1112
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,519
You look good.

1113
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:47,587
Is something different?

1114
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,693
New hairdo?

1115
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,762
Yeah, new hairdo.

1116
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:55,796
Spray tan?

1117
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,968
So, how'd it go?

1118
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,804
I'm assuming she said yes?

1119
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,042
Oh God.

1120
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,509
Oh, I knew it!

1121
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:09,945
I knew she was a phony.

1122
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:11,914
Vampire chicks are all the same!

1123
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:14,616
One bite and it's
so long, sucker!

1124
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,784
There's always somebody

1125
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,686
that spoils everything
by chickening out.

1126
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:18,687
She said yes.

1127
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,789
That no good, fang banger!

1128
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:21,790
Wait, wait, what?

1129
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:23,058
She said yes!

1130
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:24,726
[Together] She said yes!

1131
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,994
She said yes!

1132
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:27,028
She said yes!

1133
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:32,801
Let's begin.

1134
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:37,639
Alrighty, we'll start with
the chest hair of Tarzan.

1135
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:40,008
For that swinging vibe.

1136
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,610
There you go.

1137
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:42,844
(giggling)

1138
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:43,779
Oh, and of course
she'll want him

1139
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,914
to have some special moves

1140
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:48,016
so how about a pair
of dancing shoes.

1141
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,687
One from Fred Astaire
and one from Gene Kelly.

1142
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,988
(giggling)

1143
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,589
And to top it all off
with a little swagger.

1144
00:55:57,025 --> 00:56:00,494
A cowboy hat of the one
and only John Wayne.

1145
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:01,529
(horse whinnying)

1146
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,699
Well how about that, the
Duke did wear a toupee.

1147
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:05,000
(giggling)

1148
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:07,568
And now some wizarding words.

1149
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:11,505
Herman Munster dumb-dumb
will be no more.

1150
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,976
When you bring the
perfect marrying man

1151
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:16,712
to my sweet Lily's door!

1152
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:18,847
(cackling)

1153
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:24,552
What?

1154
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:25,821
What?

1155
00:56:25,854 --> 00:56:27,689
Ugh, I always forget
one ingredient.

1156
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:30,058
One simple ingredient.

1157
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:33,729
Here we go, perfect
husband coming up.

1158
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:36,732
(cackling)

1159
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:37,765
Ah! Ah!

1160
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:39,667
What? What?

1161
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,805
Okay, alrighty, what went wrong?

1162
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,007
(monkey screeching)

1163
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Hold on.

1164
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:51,847
Ah! This isn't the
hair of Tarzan.

1165
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,048
It's the hair of Cheetah!

1166
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,618
Okay, time to shuffle
off to Buffalo.

1167
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,820
Keep going, all right.

1168
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:00,521
Ah, you win some, you lose some.

1169
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:03,925
(wolf howling)

1170
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:10,699
(humming)

1171
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:12,533
Lily, is that you?

1172
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:14,102
Ha!

1173
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:15,804
Wow, hey.

1174
00:57:15,837 --> 00:57:16,972
You're in a good mood.

1175
00:57:17,005 --> 00:57:18,874
Everybody's in a
dancing mood tonight.

1176
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:20,709
Is that a victory dance

1177
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:23,178
because you finally got rid
of that bum Herman Munster?

1178
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,746
♪ La, da, dee ♪

1179
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,914

1182
00:57:28,617 --> 00:57:29,484
Are you drunk?

1183
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:31,062
Did that good for
nothing give you wine?

1184
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:32,354
No, silly.

1185
00:57:32,387 --> 00:57:34,689
You know I never drink wine.

1186
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:35,723
It's this.

1187
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,126
Is that what I think it is?

1188
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,161
Yes, it is.

1189
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,064

(crows cawing)

1198
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:20,001
(howling)

1199
00:58:21,103 --> 00:58:22,971
Herman Munster!

1200
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:24,206
How's it going, man?

1201
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,775
Man, it's going great.

1202
00:58:26,808 --> 00:58:28,110
And you are?

1203
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:29,111
I'm Lester, baby.

1204
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:31,046
Ah, Lester Baby.

1205
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,647
Your future brother-in-law.

1206
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:34,116
Oh!

1207
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:36,194
I'm the one who pointed
Lily directly to your door.

1208
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:40,188
If not for me, who knows
if love would have bloomed.

1209
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:43,592
Oh, ho, ho, it is
so great to meet you.

1210
00:58:44,893 --> 00:58:46,070
So listen, Herman,
now that you and I

1211
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:47,863
are practically blood related

1212
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:49,173
I think it's only
right that I tell ya

1213
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:52,134
about this sweetheart
real estate deal.

1214
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,935
That sounds boss, man.

1215
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,673
But, I think it's
best if Lily handles

1216
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:00,842
the finances because I don't
have a head for numbers.

1217
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:01,776
Come on, Herman.

1218
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,944
Get with it.

1219
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,279
You gotta get
ahead of the curve.

1220
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:06,114
If you wanna swerve.

1221
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:07,682
Oh, ho, yeah!

1222
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:10,952
What do you mean?

1223
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,687
Now that you and
my lovely sister

1224
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:15,757
are tying the knot, what's
hers is yours, right?

1225
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:18,026
Well, you do have a point.

1226
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:21,796
(crows cawing)

1227
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:25,200
I assume you are the
man of the house, right?

1228
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:27,035
Yeah, well, I guess I am.

1229
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,069
You guess!

1230
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:29,204
Come on, brother man.

1231
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:31,473
Stick that chest straight out.

1232
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:33,308
I am the man of the house.

1233
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:34,476
That's the spirit.

1234
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:36,211
Just sign on the dotted line

1235
00:59:36,244 --> 00:59:38,013
and you and your lovely bride

1236
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:40,282
will be residing on easy street.

1237
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:41,816
Oh, goodie!

1238
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:46,788
Lester Baby, you are
the man with the plan.

1239
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:52,027
(ominous music)

1240
01:00:15,317 --> 01:00:16,317
Oh.

1241
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:24,025
(screeching bats)

1242
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:28,095
Oh!

1243
01:00:30,332 --> 01:00:33,068
(ethereal music)

1244
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:49,251
Please proceed with the vows.

1245
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:50,752
Dearest Lily.

1246
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:54,155
You're the hemlock in my veins,

1247
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,957
the cobweb in my brains.

1248
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:58,860
I wanna boogie, oogie, oogie

1249
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:00,295
'til we just can't
boogie no more.

1250
01:01:02,197 --> 01:01:05,033
My sweet pussycat.

1251
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:06,066
Rawr.

1252
01:01:07,335 --> 01:01:11,873
I knew from the moment
I saw your flat head

1253
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:14,409
and that cute little scar,

1254
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:17,846
that I wanted to
spend every moment

1255
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:19,881
tightening those neck bolts.

1256
01:01:21,316 --> 01:01:23,084
All I ask is that we spend

1257
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:27,155
the rest of my lives growing
disgracefully old together.

1258
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,393
And now the rings.

1259
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:33,828
Oh yeah.

1260
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:36,898
Oh, uh, hey.

1261
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:40,035
(blowing harmonica)

1262
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:41,269
Yo-yo. Ha, ha.

1263
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:42,303
Yo-yo.

1264
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:45,407
Oh, there they are.

1265
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,941
(chuckling)

1266
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:48,310
Oh!

1267
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:50,045
Herman, do you
take Lily Gruesella

1268
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:52,047
to be your lawfully wedded wife

1269
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,382
until a stake through
the heart do you part?

1270
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:55,618
(sniffling)

1271
01:01:55,651 --> 01:01:56,418
Oh.

1272
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:58,887
What a cream puff!

1273
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
I do.

1274
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:01,455
Oh!

1275
01:02:05,193 --> 01:02:07,896
(gasping)

1276
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:11,433
Lily Gruesella, do you
take Herman Dillon Munster

1277
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:14,969
as your husband until a loss
of electricity do you part?

1278
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:16,970
I do!

1279
01:02:20,442 --> 01:02:22,210
If anyone objects
to the marriage

1280
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:25,080
of these two wretched
souls, speak now

1281
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:26,915
or forever hold your peace.

1282
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:28,016
Yeah, uh...

1283
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:29,951
(zapping)

1284
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:33,121
I was just gonna say, good luck.

1285
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:35,156
You're gonna need it
with that big dope.

1286
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:38,259
(snapping)

1287
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:39,928
I now pronounce.

1288
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:41,162
I now pronounce.

1289
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:42,931
I now pronounce.
I now pronounce.

1290
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:43,965
I now pronounce.

1291
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:45,934
(buzzing)

1292
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:46,967
Whoopsie.

1293
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:51,072
I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Munster.

1294
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:53,942
Oh yeah.

1295
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:56,144
(chuckling)

1296
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,081
Pardon me.

1297
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:01,315
Could someone please call 911?

1298
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,153
Come on, Hermie.

1299
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,389
Mrs. Munster wants to
start her new life.

1300
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:09,057
Mrs. Munster.

1301
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,458
(chuckling)

1302
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:11,492
Bye!

1303
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,266
He's your bloody
problem now, mate.

1304
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,368
(laughing)

1305
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:33,014
(whimpering)

1306
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:37,285
(light music)

1307
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:56,237
Oh, there's Lester.

1308
01:03:57,773 --> 01:03:59,541
(honking)

1309
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:02,343
(howling)

1310
01:04:02,377 --> 01:04:03,478
Did I miss the wedding?

1311
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:06,214
As a matter of fact, you did.

1312
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:10,385
Well, then, let me
take this opportunity

1313
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:14,389
to congratulate my baby sister

1314
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:17,325
and um, my new partner.

1315
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:18,593
Scram.

1316
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:20,261
Let's make some money, brother!

1317
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:23,565
(laughing)

1318
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:26,000
(howling)

1319
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:28,203
(belching)

1320
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:29,380
That Lester, what a character.

1321
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,404
Gotta love him.

1322
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:32,540
Ha, ha.

1323
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:34,118
What exactly was
Lester talking about?

1324
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:35,486
You didn't give
him money, did you?

1325
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,212
Money? No!

1326
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,246
He's just tipsy.

1327
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:40,515
You know how wolves get
after a few too many.

1328
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:43,117
I know, my sweet,
adorable Hermie baby

1329
01:04:43,151 --> 01:04:44,495
wouldn't be dumb
enough to get into

1330
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,155
a lame brain business
scheme with Lester.

1331
01:04:47,188 --> 01:04:48,624
Business? With Lester?

1332
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:49,657
Don't be ridiculous.

1333
01:04:51,092 --> 01:04:52,327
Ha, ha.

1334
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,095
Good, I would hate
to think I just threw

1335
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:56,030
my life away
marrying a blockhead.

1336
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,533
(ominous music)

1337
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:01,436
The castle is
now official yours.

1338
01:05:04,072 --> 01:05:06,140
(howling)

1339
01:05:08,443 --> 01:05:10,411
Ah, it appears
your brother-in-law

1340
01:05:10,445 --> 01:05:13,181
is as stupid in
the brain as you.

1341
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:15,216
(chuckling)

1342
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,250
What about my green?

1343
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:22,557
That's it?

1344
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,060
That is what is left
for you after our cut.

1345
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:30,532
My advice to you, don't
borrow money from Zoya.

1346
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:33,601
Trust me, you ain't
never seeing me again.

1347
01:05:33,636 --> 01:05:36,371
Next time we won't
be so hospitable.

1348
01:05:36,404 --> 01:05:37,548
There won't be no next time.

1349
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:40,141
I'm going straight to Las Vegas.

1350
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:42,645
So I can quadruple
my pitiful stack.

1351
01:05:42,678 --> 01:05:44,245
Ha, ha.

1352
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,681
Wolf never learn.

1353
01:05:45,714 --> 01:05:47,515
Wolf is stupid.

1354
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,151
(light music)

1355
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:00,428
Merci!

1356
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,263
French fries.

1357
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:04,299
Oh, look up there!

1358
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:05,668
Tres magnifique!

1359
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,569
So, romantic.

1360
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:10,071
(laughing)

1361
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:14,375
(whistling fireworks)

1362
01:06:15,678 --> 01:06:19,213
I hate to say it, but
old Paris is overrated.

1363
01:06:21,617 --> 01:06:24,519
These are some of the homeliest
people I've ever seen.

1364
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:27,388
I noticed that too.

1365
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:30,693
And they sure have a funny
way of reacting to foreigners.

1366
01:06:30,726 --> 01:06:32,728
Some of these customs
seem downright rude.

1367
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,096
Well, wait a second.

1368
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:38,533
I almost forgot.

1369
01:06:38,566 --> 01:06:40,301
I think this will
solve our problem.

1370
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:45,406
We'll have no
trouble blending in.

1371
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:48,611
Oh, pookie!

1372
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:51,212
You look so
continental and suave.

1373
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:56,351
I hope they don't confuse
me for Maurice Chevalier.

1374
01:06:56,384 --> 01:06:58,486
(laughing)

1375
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:03,257
(patrons chatting)

1376
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,178
Oh, what a beautiful sculpture.

1377
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:27,448
(light music)

1378
01:07:35,323 --> 01:07:37,660
(patrons gasping)

1379
01:07:37,693 --> 01:07:39,360
Hey look, a mime.

1380
01:07:40,796 --> 01:07:42,573
That's the height of French
culture, very classy.

1381
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,533
Oh right about now I think
I could use some culture.

1382
01:07:51,472 --> 01:07:53,642
(screaming)

1383
01:07:57,445 --> 01:07:58,546
Sacre bleu!

1384
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,749
(screaming)

1385
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:18,331
I don't get it.

1386
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:21,235
That's the loudest
mime I've ever seen.

1387
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:24,006
Must be that new modern
mime I was reading about.

1388
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:25,473
Oh.

1389
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:26,507
Oh, Hermie, look.

1390
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:32,413
Oh, he's so cute.

1391
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:33,716
What a sweetie.

1392
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:35,851
Oh, what's it say?

1393
01:08:35,884 --> 01:08:38,252
Monstre les egouts de Paris.

1394
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:39,454
Huh?

1395
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:41,322
Monster haunts
the sewers of Paris.

1396
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:43,357
Oh, ho, ho! Oh, goodie!

1397
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,626
Let's go.

1398
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,794
What a fun town!

1399
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:49,263
(chuckling)

1400
01:08:53,836 --> 01:08:56,437
(eerie music)

1401
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,822
This is so romantic.

1402
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:15,758
It reminds me of the
old neighborhood.

1403
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,392
Oh, I'm surprised it's so empty.

1404
01:09:18,426 --> 01:09:20,394
I thought it would be
crawling with tourists.

1405
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,265
Oh, well this is why it's empty.

1406
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:26,367
It's closed.

1407
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:28,503
Oh!

1408
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:30,471
I so wanted to find
that little cutie.

1409
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:33,842
Stand back.

1410
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:40,481
(spitting)

1411
01:09:41,817 --> 01:09:44,753
(cracking)

1412
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:46,855
(grunting)

1413
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:54,096
(clanging metal)

1414
01:09:54,129 --> 01:09:56,430
(gasping)

1415
01:09:56,665 --> 01:09:57,933
Oh, Hermie.

1416
01:09:57,966 --> 01:09:59,467
You're so manly.

1417
01:10:00,836 --> 01:10:03,304
(giggling)

1418
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,674
After you.

1419
01:10:05,707 --> 01:10:07,743
(giggling)

1420
01:10:16,919 --> 01:10:19,554
Oh, I think I hear something.

1421
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:25,828
(gurgling)

1422
01:10:25,861 --> 01:10:26,895
There it goes!

1423
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:27,929
Ah!

1424
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:34,670
(chuckling)

1425
01:10:36,638 --> 01:10:39,641
(creature growling)

1426
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:40,876
Herman.

1427
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:42,845
(creature growling)

1428
01:10:42,878 --> 01:10:44,378
Herman.

1429
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,514
(growling)

1430
01:10:46,547 --> 01:10:49,417
(Herman chuckling)

1431
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,425
Oh, he's adorable!

1432
01:10:58,193 --> 01:11:00,896
(creature growling)

1433
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:06,367
Boy oh boy.

1434
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:08,469
Boy, that is nice.

1435
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:11,505
That is very, very nice.

1436
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:12,774
Wow.

1437
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:15,878
Look at this neck, it's
completely natural.

1438
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:18,412
Yeah, boy, look at that.

1439
01:11:18,446 --> 01:11:18,947
(whistling)

1440
01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:19,948
That's what I say.

1441
01:11:19,982 --> 01:11:22,885
I'm really a leg man, myself.

1442
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:25,453
Preferably two if possible.

1443
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:29,423
What's that?

1444
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:31,425
Special delivery, my Lord.

1445
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:33,896
From Zoya Krupp.

1446
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:36,632
Zoya Krupp?

1447
01:11:36,665 --> 01:11:38,200
Why does that name
sound familiar?

1448
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:40,903
I believe you were once married.

1449
01:11:40,936 --> 01:11:42,804
You know what,
Igor, you're right.

1450
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:43,739
I was married.

1451
01:11:43,772 --> 01:11:44,940
Let me tell ya something.

1452
01:11:44,973 --> 01:11:46,708
I really dodged a
stake with this one.

1453
01:11:46,742 --> 01:11:48,644
Yeah, she was a little wacky.

1454
01:11:48,677 --> 01:11:51,512
And she swore she would
get revenge on me.

1455
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:53,815
But you know, they all say that.

1456
01:11:53,849 --> 01:11:56,818
(chuckling)

1457
01:11:56,852 --> 01:12:01,857
My dear Count, as you
once broke Zoya's heart

1458
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,927
I now return the favor.

1459
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,029
Enjoy being a peasant.

1460
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,732
(screaming)

1461
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:11,833
Good news?

1462
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:13,467
We're being evicted!

1463
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,905
How is this pa, pa, possible?

1464
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:19,808
Because, I have a
complete numbskull

1465
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,043
for a son-in-law!

1466
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:25,981
(speaking in French)

1467
01:12:32,988 --> 01:12:33,988
Huh?

1468
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:38,860
Lily!

1469
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:40,629
Your lover boy Herman

1470
01:12:41,997 --> 01:12:43,597
is getting lonely.

1471
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,803
Almost ready, pookie bear!

1472
01:12:47,836 --> 01:12:50,538
(ominous music)

1473
01:13:00,115 --> 01:13:02,718
How's the newest member
of our family doing?

1474
01:13:04,686 --> 01:13:06,955
Oh, he's being just
as cute as can be.

1475
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:09,590
What should we name him?

1476
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:12,094
I was thinking, Spot.

1477
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:14,629
You know, he looks like a Spot.

1478
01:13:16,898 --> 01:13:19,634
(ominous music)

1479
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:25,140
(knocking)

1480
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:26,608
Oh, oh, goodie.

1481
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,744
That's the champagne I ordered.

1482
01:13:28,777 --> 01:13:31,747
Room service at this
hotel is terrible.

1483
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:32,981
Every time I order something

1484
01:13:33,015 --> 01:13:34,726
they just throw it at
me from across the hall.

1485
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,584
Oh, Herman.

1486
01:13:36,618 --> 01:13:38,887
You have to remember, we're
not in Transylvania anymore.

1487
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,822
They do things
differently over here.

1488
01:13:40,856 --> 01:13:42,791
Tell me about it.

1489
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:46,628
I can't follow the plot of
this Woody Woodpecker cartoon

1490
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:47,661
to save my life.

1491
01:13:48,697 --> 01:13:49,798
Oh.

1492
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:52,801
(speaking in French)

1493
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:55,971
(knocking)

1494
01:13:59,107 --> 01:14:00,142
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1495
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:06,748
(knocking)

1496
01:14:06,782 --> 01:14:08,950
(chuckling)

1497
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:12,621
Merci beacoup.

1498
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:22,964
(sighing)

1499
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:27,568
Sweetie, I'm ready.

1500
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:31,238
Father!

1501
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:34,609
What's going on?

1502
01:14:34,643 --> 01:14:38,046
This halfwit, blockhead
dummy you married

1503
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,115
just signed over our castle

1504
01:14:40,148 --> 01:14:41,750
to my crazy ex, Zoya.

1505
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,622
Well Lester said, if
I didn't swerve then...

1506
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:49,024
No, wait.

1507
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:52,027
If I don't curve
that I don't swerve.

1508
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,964
Oh Herman, how could you
let Lester drag you into this?

1509
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:58,233
Yeah, now thanks
to swervy curvy here,

1510
01:14:58,266 --> 01:14:59,935
we are effectively homeless.

1511
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:05,006
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

1512
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,041
What's that?

1513
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:10,076
I'm gonna hold my breath
until we get the castle back.

1514
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:13,915
(grunting)

1515
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:15,183
What are we going to do?

1516
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:16,751
Oh.

1517
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:18,096
Who's that lawyer that's
always advertising

1518
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,122
in the back of the
Transylvania Gazette?

1519
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:22,424
The one that says
he can win any case?

1520
01:15:22,457 --> 01:15:23,992
Shady Ma Go on!

1521
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:25,660
I know him.

1522
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:27,038
There's not an honest
bone in his body.

1523
01:15:27,062 --> 01:15:29,998
He's untrustworthy,
unethical, and immoral.

1524
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:31,199
Good.

1525
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,901
I will give him a
call when we get back.

1526
01:15:34,236 --> 01:15:36,705
(groaning)

1527
01:15:43,311 --> 01:15:45,714

01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:52,120

(muffled shouting)

1536
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,804
So you've looked at our case.

1537
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:12,741
(muffled shouting)

1538
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,778
Right.

1539
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:17,879
Okay, lightning.

1540
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,216
(shouting)

1541
01:16:23,818 --> 01:16:24,986
Yes, I understand, shark.

1542
01:16:26,855 --> 01:16:28,857
(muffled shouting)

1543
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:29,791
Right.

1544
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:30,824
Lunar eclipse.

1545
01:16:31,793 --> 01:16:33,895
(shouting)

1546
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,199
Well, thank you.

1547
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:38,934
Hey, that sounded promising.

1548
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:40,902
What did they say?

1549
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:42,079
We have a better chance
than being struck by lightning

1550
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:45,106
while being attacked by a
shark during a lunar eclipse.

1551
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,309
In other words, we have no case.

1552
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:49,044
What are we going to do?

1553
01:16:49,077 --> 01:16:52,113
Ha, why don't you ask
magna cum dum-dum over there

1554
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:53,515
what we're gonna do.

1555
01:16:53,548 --> 01:16:56,184
He's the one who got
us into this mess.

1556
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:57,786
Friar Zombo.

1557
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:01,223
The most handsome man in
Hollywood, California.

1558
01:17:01,256 --> 01:17:02,256
Herman!

1559
01:17:03,892 --> 01:17:04,892
Herman Munster!

1560
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:07,329
Did you hear that?

1561
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:08,530
Hear what?

1562
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:10,232
Hollywood, California.

1563
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:11,766
So?

1564
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,968
I was thinking.

1565
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:15,237
Please, please,
please, do us a favor.

1566
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,838
No more thinking.

1567
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:17,982
As I was saying before I was

1568
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:19,007
so rudely interrupted.

1569
01:17:21,076 --> 01:17:24,312
If that guy's a star,
imagine what'll happen

1570
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:26,081
when they get a look at me.

1571
01:17:26,114 --> 01:17:27,082
I'm a 10.

1572
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:29,251
Zombo's a seven at best.

1573
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:31,987
That man on the boob
tube has actual talent.

1574
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,056
Oh Herman, you can't be serious.

1575
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,300
I don't wanna leave our
beloved home country

1576
01:17:36,324 --> 01:17:38,393
and move to Tinseltown.

1577
01:17:38,426 --> 01:17:40,028
Crumble Creature Crackers.

1578
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:42,163
As head of this
household, I've decided.

1579
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:44,165
Take it out of
the box like this.

1580
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,835
The Munsters have
out grown Transylvania!

1581
01:17:46,868 --> 01:17:49,871
And then you destroy
it in the bowl!

1582
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:51,373
Hey, what about me?

1583
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:52,340
What about you?

1584
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:54,209
Lily.

1585
01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:56,278
You're not gonna let
your lame brain husband

1586
01:17:56,311 --> 01:18:00,849
abandon your poor, old,
broken down father.

1587
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:02,917
Oh, of course not.

1588
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:04,986
Herman.

1589
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,920
Okay, he can come too.

1590
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:07,188
(giggling)

1591
01:18:07,222 --> 01:18:08,299
But all your junk stays
here in Transylvania.

1592
01:18:08,323 --> 01:18:10,225
Including that freeloading Igor!

1593
01:18:12,227 --> 01:18:13,161
No offense.

1594
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,896
None taken.

1595
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:15,897
Oh.

1596
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,065
This is a fresh start.

1597
01:18:17,098 --> 01:18:18,900
All you get is one box.

1598
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:21,102
One box is all I need.

1599
01:18:23,305 --> 01:18:25,407
(laughing)

1600
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:35,450
Perfect.

1601
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:36,985
Perfect.

1602
01:18:37,018 --> 01:18:38,420
Well, Igor.

1603
01:18:38,453 --> 01:18:42,057
This is gonna put a little
flutter in your wings.

1604
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:45,060
(cackling)

1605
01:18:45,093 --> 01:18:46,861
Are you sure about this, sir?

1606
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,430
I'm getting on a bit in age

1607
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:51,132
and I could suffer
from the side effects

1608
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,335
of the transformation.

1609
01:18:53,368 --> 01:18:55,036
Oh come on.

1610
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,038
What's a couple side effects?

1611
01:18:57,072 --> 01:18:59,274
Um, perhaps I should stay.

1612
01:18:59,307 --> 01:19:04,012
I noticed Lord Grimsby is
canvassing for a new pool boy.

1613
01:19:04,045 --> 01:19:07,482
Trust me, Grimsby
Manor has no pool.

1614
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,217
Then why would he...

1615
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,095
Look, do you wanna go
to America with me or not?

1616
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,119
Well...

1617
01:19:14,122 --> 01:19:15,056
Yeah.

1618
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,257
He, he, bottoms up!

1619
01:19:17,492 --> 01:19:19,894
Oh, that's what
Lord Grimsby said.

1620
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:20,928
Ha, ha.

1621
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,930
Mm.

1622
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:27,268
(coughing)

1623
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:32,941
(sputtering)

1624
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:37,077
It's not working.

1625
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:40,315
(screeching)

1626
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,254
Something homey with
an old world flare.

1627
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:48,256
Preferably a tomb with a view.

1628
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,457
That would be nice.

1629
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:51,459
Tell her nothing too showy.

1630
01:19:51,493 --> 01:19:54,095
We don't wanna be the
talk of the neighborhood.

1631
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:56,998
It'll be bad enough once
they get a look at me.

1632
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,175
Paparazzi will be everywhere.

1633
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,101
Oh, I agree.

1634
01:20:00,135 --> 01:20:02,070
Yes, nothing too showy.

1635
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:04,406
We're just your typical
family looking to blend in.

1636
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:06,040
Yeah, yeah.

1637
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:09,110
I believe I have just
what you're looking for.

1638
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:11,212
It's a beautiful property

1639
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:13,515
on a very quiet street.

1640
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,417
Oh, I do love quiet.

1641
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,986
I just can't take a
noisy tomb anymore.

1642
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,023
The market in that
area is booming,

1643
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:25,994
but if we move quick, we can
snatch up that last unit.

1644
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:28,430
If it's booming why is
there still a house available?

1645
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:32,000
Well, there is a
situation on the street

1646
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:33,468
that needs to be relocated.

1647
01:20:33,501 --> 01:20:36,304
But once it goes, so
will the last house.

1648
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:37,415
We'll be arriving tomorrow

1649
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,108
on Air Transylvania flight 666.

1650
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:42,444
Oh, Mrs. Munster,
I must warn you

1651
01:20:42,477 --> 01:20:44,179
I'm going to be heading straight

1652
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,749
to a Halloween party after
we visit the property.

1653
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:50,018
So, don't be shocked
by my appearance.

1654
01:20:50,051 --> 01:20:52,187
Um, okay.

1655
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,289
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

1656
01:20:54,322 --> 01:20:55,190
Goodbye.

1657
01:20:55,223 --> 01:20:56,458
Bye-bye.

1658
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:57,392
Hm.

1659
01:20:57,425 --> 01:20:59,060
That was strange.

1660
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,094
What was strange?

1661
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:01,405
For some reason the poor woman

1662
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:04,132
was afraid we'd be
shocked by her appearance.

1663
01:21:04,165 --> 01:21:07,602
Women, they're always so
concerned about their looks.

1664
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:10,104
Not everyone can be as
beautiful as you, my dear.

1665
01:21:10,138 --> 01:21:11,306
No, I guess not.

1666
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:15,043
[Announcer] Good afternoon

1667
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:20,348
and welcome to Air
Transylvania flight 666.

1668
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:24,219
We have a flying time of
22 hours and 47 minutes

1669
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:26,521
to Los Angeles today.

1670
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,456
Oh, it sure was nice
of that flight attendant

1671
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,158
to bump us up to first class.

1672
01:21:30,191 --> 01:21:32,327
First class, baby!

1673
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,629
Although it was a bit strange

1674
01:21:33,662 --> 01:21:35,439
when all the other first
class passengers moved

1675
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:37,298
to the back of the plane.

1676
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:39,367
Lily, my dear.

1677
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,544
How many times
must I remind you,

1678
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:42,805
the average person
isn't accustomed

1679
01:21:42,838 --> 01:21:47,509
to being around people of
such fine breeding of person.

1680
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:49,645
(belching)

1681
01:21:49,678 --> 01:21:51,614
Oh, I suppose you're right.

1682
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:54,516
But still, the way she was
pushing and shoving everyone.

1683
01:21:54,549 --> 01:21:56,251
It was a bit aggressive.

1684
01:21:56,284 --> 01:21:57,485
Where is she?

1685
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,387
You know what, I could
go for another one.

1686
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,156
Hey, yoo hoo!

1687
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,070
I could go for another
one of these drinky poos.

1688
01:22:06,294 --> 01:22:07,630
Over here.

1689
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:09,230
Hi.

1690
01:22:09,264 --> 01:22:10,131
(chuckling)

1691
01:22:10,164 --> 01:22:11,566
Can, can I help you?

1692
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,719
I would like another one
of these delightful drinks.

1693
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:16,304
What do you call this?

1694
01:22:16,337 --> 01:22:17,405
Shirley Temple.

1695
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:19,240
It's very strong.

1696
01:22:19,274 --> 01:22:20,141
(chuckling)

1697
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,174
Okay.

1698
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:27,315
(farcical music)

1699
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,565
Oh.

1700
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,668
- Here you go.
- Thank you, dear.

1701
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:47,168
You know, statistically,

1702
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:48,561
flying is the safest
way to travel.

1703
01:22:51,306 --> 01:22:53,541
Oh.

1704
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:56,679
(slurping)

1705
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:02,350
(rushing wind)

1706
01:23:07,355 --> 01:23:10,425
[Announcer] Welcome to
beautiful Los Angeles.

1707
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:16,497
The local time here is 12:47
and it's a balmy 79 degrees.

1708
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:18,667
Thanks for flying
Air Transylvania.

1709
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,234
Oh, here comes our luggage.

1710
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:22,705
Talk about service, he, he!

1711
01:23:28,543 --> 01:23:29,612
Um, where's Herman?

1712
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:31,779
Herman!

1713
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,651
Here he comes.

1714
01:23:39,487 --> 01:23:40,487
Oh.

1715
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:47,427
I'll never

1716
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,264
drink another Shirley Temple

1717
01:23:51,499 --> 01:23:52,499
for as long as I live.

1718
01:23:54,803 --> 01:23:56,571
How do I know where they are?

1719
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:59,207
Maybe they got wise
to the situation.

1720
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,375
(muffled speaking)

1721
01:24:00,408 --> 01:24:01,968
That's true, they are
from Transylvania.

1722
01:24:02,745 --> 01:24:03,712
(knocking)

1723
01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:05,580
Oh, wait, wait a minute. I think
this is them.

1724
01:24:05,614 --> 01:24:06,782
Okay, I gotta go.

1725
01:24:06,815 --> 01:24:09,752
Time for me to work my magic.

1726
01:24:09,785 --> 01:24:11,419
[Caller] Oh dear.

1727
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:16,357
(knocking)

1728
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:17,760
Greetings from Transylvania.

1729
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,664
(farcical music)

1730
01:24:29,705 --> 01:24:31,539
That's a strange
way of saying hello.

1731
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,475
Oh, I guess we're gonna
have to get used to it.

1732
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:35,654
It ain't easy being beautiful.

1733
01:24:35,678 --> 01:24:38,714
Tell me about it. He, he!

1734
01:24:38,747 --> 01:24:40,515
Miss.

1735
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:41,482
Miss?

1736
01:24:41,516 --> 01:24:42,516
- Ah.
- Miss, wake up.

1737
01:24:46,722 --> 01:24:50,391
I assume you're
the ma, Munsters?

1738
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:51,760
I'm Herman.

1739
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:54,429
And this is my darling
better half Lily.

1740
01:24:54,462 --> 01:24:55,462
Hello.

1741
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,199
Oh, and that thing over there is

1742
01:24:58,867 --> 01:25:00,703
my father-in-law the Count.

1743
01:25:00,736 --> 01:25:02,303
Pleased to meet you.

1744
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,772
Oh yeah, uh.

1745
01:25:03,806 --> 01:25:04,606
Here you go.

1746
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,540
Here you go.

1747
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:06,842
- Ah!
- Oh.

1748
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:09,510
So nice to meet you in person.

1749
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,814
Those costumes really
threw me for a loop.

1750
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:15,617
And I thought I was
taking it to an extreme.

1751
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:19,387
Uh, well way to get in
the spirit of the day.

1752
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,420
Thank you.

1753
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:22,490
What spirit is that exactly?

1754
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:25,292
Oh, you!

1755
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:29,631
Okay, my car is parked
right out front.

1756
01:25:29,665 --> 01:25:31,734
I'm just gonna
grab my keys, okay.

1757
01:25:33,769 --> 01:25:37,505
I think when she said shocking
she meant gorgeous, huh?

1758
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,540
Bow-chica-wow-wow.

1759
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:40,809
(giggling)

1760
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:42,678
Father, please keep
your fangs to yourself.

1761
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:44,412
Yeah, don't blow this.

1762
01:25:44,445 --> 01:25:45,814
Follow me.

1763
01:25:45,848 --> 01:25:48,516
(rushing traffic)

1764
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:49,549
- Hi!
- Hey!

1765
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:54,422
(screeching tires)

1766
01:25:57,425 --> 01:25:59,762
Lily, I want a picture of you.

1767
01:26:01,395 --> 01:26:02,597
I don't feel good.

1768
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,399
Oh, oh, oh!

1769
01:26:10,105 --> 01:26:12,875
(children laughing)

1770
01:26:20,448 --> 01:26:22,684
(light music)

1771
01:26:38,634 --> 01:26:40,936
Just in case you're wondering,

1772
01:26:40,969 --> 01:26:42,671
this is the party I'm
all gussied up for.

1773
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:45,573
The residents throw a big
Halloween bash every year.

1774
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:50,411
Boy we sure picked
a happening area.

1775
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:51,723
I'm getting a little
worried we might be

1776
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:54,415
too boring for this
hipster neighborhood.

1777
01:26:54,448 --> 01:26:55,651
Speak for yourself.

1778
01:26:55,684 --> 01:27:00,488
I'm always the first on the
dance floor at every funeral.

1779
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:01,521
I bet you are.

1780
01:27:02,891 --> 01:27:04,325
(screeching tires)

1781
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:07,528
Happy Halloween!

1782
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:09,932
Oh my, what beautiful children.

1783
01:27:09,965 --> 01:27:11,499
Trick or treat!

1784
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:12,710
Are you planning on having kids?

1785
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:13,845
Well, I'm a little
young for children.

1786
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:16,437
I'm only 150.

1787
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,873
Although, you know
what they say?

1788
01:27:17,906 --> 01:27:19,440
What, what's that?

1789
01:27:19,473 --> 01:27:21,509
150 is the new 100.

1790
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:23,578
Oh.

1791
01:27:23,612 --> 01:27:24,713
Oh!

1792
01:27:24,746 --> 01:27:27,683
(laughing)

1793
01:27:27,716 --> 01:27:28,784
You are a trip!

1794
01:27:29,885 --> 01:27:30,886
Ha, ha, ha!

1795
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:33,956
I'm a trip?

1796
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:35,724
Hollywood lingo.

1797
01:27:35,757 --> 01:27:36,757
Oh!

1798
01:27:39,895 --> 01:27:40,963
Well, what'd ya think?

1799
01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:41,864
Cute, right?

1800
01:27:41,897 --> 01:27:45,868
Oh my! Herman.

1801
01:27:47,468 --> 01:27:47,970
I know it.

1802
01:27:48,003 --> 01:27:48,971
It's perfect.

1803
01:27:49,004 --> 01:27:50,973
It's more than perfect.

1804
01:27:51,006 --> 01:27:52,608
It's breath taking.

1805
01:27:53,942 --> 01:27:55,744
I've always wanted
to be featured

1806
01:27:55,777 --> 01:27:57,445
in Better Tombs and Gardens.

1807
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:01,617
(ethereal music)

1808
01:28:02,918 --> 01:28:06,021
Uh, okay, crazy jokesters.

1809
01:28:06,054 --> 01:28:07,054
Follow me.

1810
01:28:08,757 --> 01:28:10,792
Herman, why is
she walking towards

1811
01:28:10,826 --> 01:28:13,662
that hideous monstrosity?

1812
01:28:13,695 --> 01:28:15,964
I think Barbara is
trying to swindle us

1813
01:28:15,998 --> 01:28:18,599
into buying that abomination.

1814
01:28:18,634 --> 01:28:21,602
She must think we're yokels
straight off the garlic wagon.

1815
01:28:21,637 --> 01:28:24,538
Oh! Herman, deal with this.

1816
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:26,208
Show her who you're made of.

1817
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:27,843
Yeah, you're the
man of the house.

1818
01:28:29,077 --> 01:28:31,680
Look, Barbara.

1819
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,954
I must inform you
that we Munsters,

1820
01:28:39,988 --> 01:28:41,790
we're not born yesterday.

1821
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:43,725
I mean, some of my
parts were, of course.

1822
01:28:43,759 --> 01:28:45,526
But that's besides the point.

1823
01:28:47,062 --> 01:28:48,062
I want this house.

1824
01:28:49,698 --> 01:28:51,633
And I'm not gonna
pay more than...

1825
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:52,701
Sold.

1826
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:53,802
Please, please.

1827
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:55,871
Don't argue with me.

1828
01:28:55,904 --> 01:28:56,948
You'll only embarrass yourself.

1829
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:58,073
Let's be civilized.

1830
01:28:58,106 --> 01:28:59,507
Oh, whatever you say.

1831
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,909
The house is yours.

1832
01:29:00,943 --> 01:29:02,010
Ha!

1833
01:29:02,044 --> 01:29:03,044
Now, now.

1834
01:29:04,012 --> 01:29:05,614
You don't want me to get tough.

1835
01:29:06,815 --> 01:29:08,549
What?

1836
01:29:08,582 --> 01:29:10,986
Wait, what'd you just say?

1837
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:12,955
The house is yours.

1838
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:15,090
This place has been
a thorn in my butt

1839
01:29:15,123 --> 01:29:16,590
for the past two years.

1840
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,093
If you wanna buy
it and restore it

1841
01:29:18,126 --> 01:29:22,563
to its former glory, then
you just go for it, honey.

1842
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:25,834
And another thing, we
don't want one grave moved.

1843
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:27,803
We're very sociable people.

1844
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,571
Um, okay.

1845
01:29:30,604 --> 01:29:31,807
No problem.

1846
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,709
If you think it
looks wonderful now,

1847
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:35,978
just wait until we
get finished with it.

1848
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:38,046
Oo, I can't wait to
start poking around

1849
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,682
the backyard, who
knows who I might find!

1850
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:41,984
(giggling)

1851
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:43,919
So, when do you wanna move in?

1852
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:47,022
[Together] Right now!

Well, now what?

1855
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:11,713
We've got the house
of our dreams,

1856
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:13,648
but we are flat broke.

1857
01:30:15,784 --> 01:30:17,686
I guess we all have to get jobs.

1858
01:30:18,754 --> 01:30:19,754
No, no, no.

1859
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:23,625
I'm the man of the house.

1860
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,030
Tomorrow I'll go
out and get a job.

1861
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:30,766
Doing what, exactly?

1862
01:30:33,368 --> 01:30:34,368
I don't know, I mean.

1863
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:37,906
I'm pretty sure any
business would wanna

1864
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:39,608
have me around the
office as eye candy.

1867
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:46,181
You know what that sounds like?

1868
01:30:46,214 --> 01:30:47,214
A witch burning.

Well, it's obviously
a beauty contest.

Well, this is quite the welcome.

1924

You see, my family

1925
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:45,827

only one hour ago.

This is my beautiful wife, Lily.

Oh my goodness, well I'll
have to visit you, thank you.

1945
01:34:27,168 --> 01:34:28,370
A ghost walks into the bar

1946
01:34:28,403 --> 01:34:30,138
and orders a shot of vodka.

1947
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:31,940
Listen, there's
no blood in this.

1948
01:34:31,973 --> 01:34:34,876
I don't know, someone's
playing a joke.

1949
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,077
Well, he is, and you know.

1950
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:39,881
The bartender says, sorry,
we don't serve spirits here.

1951
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,149
Ha, ha, ha!

1952
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,917
Oh you're.

1953
01:34:42,951 --> 01:34:44,152

1954
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:45,387

1956

01:34:49,257 --> 01:34:50,892

Oh.

1962
01:34:56,931 --> 01:34:59,267
Is it true you are looking
for gainful employment?

1963
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:02,037
Because if it is, we
might have something

1964
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,872
of interest to you.

1965
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:06,908
Well, I hope it's in the
entertainment business.

1966
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:09,444
No, we're in the
business of death.

I think I could dig that.

1973
01:35:23,358 --> 01:35:27,128
We need a man to move some
of our larger, uh, clients

1974
01:35:27,162 --> 01:35:29,331
from box to box.

1975
01:35:29,364 --> 01:35:30,965
I've got experience in that.

1976
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,401
We don't like to leave
the stiffs lying around

1977
01:35:33,435 --> 01:35:36,171
for more than 48 hours or so.

1978
01:35:36,204 --> 01:35:39,174
They tend to ferment.

1979
01:35:39,207 --> 01:35:41,218
Have you fellas heard
about the new glass coffins?

1980
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:43,011
We have not.

1981
01:35:43,044 --> 01:35:45,013
Are they successful?

1982
01:35:45,046 --> 01:35:47,916
Remains to be
seen, Mr. Gateman.

1983
01:35:47,949 --> 01:35:49,284
Remains to be seen.

haven't had that much fun

can talk your ears off.

1993

Oh, what's wrong?

1994
01:36:22,283 --> 01:36:24,687
I'm just checking to see if my
ears are still there.

1995
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,121
I'd hate to lose one.

1996

glasses hang funny.

01:36:49,978 --> 01:36:50,979
I lost you once,

2006
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:54,015
but now you belong
with the dead.

2007
01:36:54,048 --> 01:36:55,950
I want to live, even
in this strange...

2008
01:36:55,984 --> 01:36:56,984
Hoo yah!

2009
01:36:59,053 --> 01:37:01,523
Herman, what are you doing?

2010
01:37:01,556 --> 01:37:04,025
I'm just practicing a few moves.

2011
01:37:04,058 --> 01:37:07,162
Thursday night is league
night at the parlor.

2012
01:37:07,195 --> 01:37:08,563
Oh, I thought you hated bowling.

2013
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:11,332
Besides, you haven't even
started your new job yet.

2014
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:13,134
I'm trying to get ready.

2015
01:37:13,168 --> 01:37:14,302
Can't let the fellas down.

2016
01:37:14,335 --> 01:37:16,337
I know but let's
not get carried away.

2017
01:37:17,338 --> 01:37:20,108
(glass breaking)

2018
01:37:25,046 --> 01:37:26,414
Come to bed, dear.

2019
01:37:26,448 --> 01:37:28,488
You don't wanna be tired
for your first day of work.

2020
01:37:28,516 --> 01:37:30,485
I really like
that Mr. Gateman.

2021
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:32,153
He paid me the
nicest compliment.

2022
01:37:33,154 --> 01:37:34,556
Oh, what was it?

2023
01:37:34,589 --> 01:37:38,326
He said, Munster, you
have a face for funerals.

2024
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:39,461
How sweet.

2025
01:37:39,494 --> 01:37:40,494
And how true.

2026
01:37:44,532 --> 01:37:46,067
(glass shattering)

2027
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,100
Still got it.

2028
01:37:52,207 --> 01:37:54,476
(light music)

2029
01:37:56,244 --> 01:37:57,244
Mm!

2030
01:38:00,616 --> 01:38:02,618
So what do you have
planned for today?

2031
01:38:02,651 --> 01:38:05,487
Oh, I was gonna hang around
the house for a little while.

2032
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,088
See if I could figure out a way

2033
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:10,325
to turn Igor back
into his old self.

2034
01:38:10,358 --> 01:38:11,502
Oh, I kind of like the new Igor.

2035
01:38:11,526 --> 01:38:13,461
He's got a lot more pep.

2036
01:38:13,495 --> 01:38:15,396
Yeah.

2037
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,430
Bawk!

2038
01:38:17,398 --> 01:38:19,234
The time is... get to work.

2039
01:38:19,267 --> 01:38:21,302
Ya big dummy.

2040
01:38:21,336 --> 01:38:22,403
Nevermore.

2041
01:38:22,437 --> 01:38:25,006
Oh golly, I'm gonna be late.

2042
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,310
Don't forget your lunch.

2043
01:38:29,344 --> 01:38:32,146
I made you a special
surprise for your first day.

2044
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,316
Chocolate chip cookies
shaped like Mickey Mouse?

2045
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,551
You'll find out at lunch.

2046
01:38:38,152 --> 01:38:39,354
(kissing)

2047
01:38:39,387 --> 01:38:40,387
Gotta boogie.

2048
01:38:41,222 --> 01:38:42,223
Knock 'em dead!

2049
01:38:43,491 --> 01:38:45,193
I'm pretty sure
they already are.

2050
01:38:45,226 --> 01:38:47,462
It's always good
to double check.

2051
01:38:47,495 --> 01:38:48,495
Oh!

2052
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:50,532
Ho, ho!

2053
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:51,565
Have fun.

2054
01:38:53,434 --> 01:38:55,236
(slurping)

2055
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,371
(belching)

2056
01:38:56,404 --> 01:38:57,404
Ugh.

2057
01:38:58,707 --> 01:39:01,309
(light music)

2058
01:39:08,483 --> 01:39:10,184
Oh bummer.

2059
01:39:10,218 --> 01:39:12,353
What a crummy day.

2060
01:39:12,387 --> 01:39:14,657
(light music)

2061
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:23,565
(ominous music)

2062
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:35,443
(baby crying)

2063
01:39:35,476 --> 01:39:36,476
Ah!

2064
01:39:37,913 --> 01:39:39,247
Ah!

2065
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,280
Oh!

2066
01:39:44,485 --> 01:39:45,485
Ah!

2067
01:39:57,265 --> 01:39:58,266
Lily! Lily!

2068
01:39:58,299 --> 01:39:59,299
Come quick!

2069
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,536
911 emergency!

2070
01:40:01,569 --> 01:40:03,639
Car 54 where are you?

2071
01:40:04,773 --> 01:40:07,208
Herman, what is the matter?

2072
01:40:07,241 --> 01:40:09,277
It's a freak show out there.

2073
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:13,581
Everywhere ya look, it's
more horrible than the next.

2074
01:40:13,616 --> 01:40:16,551
I think we've been invaded
by outer space mutants.

2075
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:20,221
What are you talking about?

2076
01:40:20,254 --> 01:40:21,700
All the beautiful
people from last night

2077
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:26,160
have been replaced by
these hideous creatures.

2078
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:27,228
Oh, Herman.

2079
01:40:27,261 --> 01:40:29,230
Don't be so dramatic.

2080
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:31,299
Everybody looks different
in the daylight.

2081
01:40:31,332 --> 01:40:32,266
Let me take a look.

2082
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,636
No, don't.

2083
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:34,669
Don't! Don't!

2084
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:38,741
(ominous music)

2085
01:40:41,442 --> 01:40:42,442
I can't look.

2086
01:40:43,779 --> 01:40:46,481
(ominous music)

2087
01:40:47,783 --> 01:40:48,783
The horror.

2088
01:40:51,285 --> 01:40:54,155
(children playing)

2089
01:40:57,392 --> 01:40:59,527
I for one just
don't understand it.

2090
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,963
Neither do I.

2091
01:41:00,996 --> 01:41:03,264
What happened to all the
hotties from last night?

2092
01:41:03,297 --> 01:41:04,432
What are we gonna do?

2093
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:06,267
We can't live like this

2094
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,444
with people that look like that.

2095
01:41:07,468 --> 01:41:09,270
I agree with my
favorite son-in-law.

2096
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:10,605
It's a disgrace.

2097
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:11,539
Yeah.

2098
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:12,708
Herman Munster!

2099
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:14,242
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

2100
01:41:14,275 --> 01:41:16,444
I expect this from
my father, but you?

2101
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:18,681
Everyone can't be
as fortunate as us.

2102
01:41:18,714 --> 01:41:20,716
It's what's inside a
person that counts.

2103
01:41:26,487 --> 01:41:28,222
Well then I'm gonna need a pair

2104
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:30,358
of X-ray glasses because I
can't handle the outside.

2105
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:31,794
He's right.

2106
01:41:31,827 --> 01:41:34,697
I haven't seen anything that
gruesome in all of my lives.

2107
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:35,596
(knocking)

2108
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,597
Oh no!

2109
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,366
It's one of those freaks!

2110
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:39,399
Don't answer.

2111
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:42,336
We are going to answer
that door as a family

2112
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:45,206
and greet whoever is
there as our equal.

2113
01:41:46,307 --> 01:41:47,307
Okay, but.

2114
01:41:48,877 --> 01:41:50,445
I hope this lessens the shock.

2115
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:54,816
Follow me.

2116
01:41:58,754 --> 01:42:00,288
Your wife is scary.

2117
01:42:01,355 --> 01:42:02,355
I know.

2118
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:06,762
Ugh.

2119
01:42:06,795 --> 01:42:07,795
Lily!

2120
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:10,665
Lester.

2121
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:15,303
What are you doing here?

2122
01:42:15,336 --> 01:42:17,405
You've got a lot of
nerve coming here, buster.

2123
01:42:18,707 --> 01:42:20,241
After what you pulled,

2124
01:42:21,509 --> 01:42:22,821
I ought a belt ya
right in the kisser.

2125
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:25,313
Herman, baby, before
you go all ape on me,

2126
01:42:25,346 --> 01:42:26,749
I got a surprise.

2127
01:42:26,782 --> 01:42:29,685
I made a killing in Vegas
after that castle deal.

2128
01:42:29,718 --> 01:42:30,786
And here's your share.

2129
01:42:34,355 --> 01:42:36,591
(light music)

2130
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:44,666
(chuckling)

2131
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,667
What's it say?

2132
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,836
Come on, spit it out.

2133
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:48,870
Herman!

2134
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:50,705
I'm rich.

2135
01:42:51,807 --> 01:42:53,574
I'm rich! I'm rich!
- What?

2136
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:54,676
We're rich!

2137
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:55,778
We're rich!

2138
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,079
We're rich!

2139
01:42:57,112 --> 01:42:58,647
Oh, ho!
