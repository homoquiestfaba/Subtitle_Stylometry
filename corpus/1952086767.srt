00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,534
Hi. This is Yumi.

2
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,737
Speak your message.
Thank you.

3
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,244
Yumi, with Greg.
How are you?

4
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,353
It was the intention that we are
in your house would meet at 4 o'clock?

5
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,387
Call me back when you
message you received.

6
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,354
I wait here.

7
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,921
Greg, I know you are there.

8
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,218
Make the door open.

9
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,033
Be glad you are not with her in bed.

10
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,168
I do not know what you are talking about.

11
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,947
Do you trust me?

12
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,881
This is not the point.

13
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,579
I just want to know what
dude you really are.

14
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,021
What do you now again?

15
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,686
Amanda ...

16
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,330
I have heard that they model.

17
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,304
A super model from Japan.

18
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,500
I have hired detectives to follow you.

19
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,704
They have pictures of you and her.

20
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,644
Not as artistic as yours,
but they have at least something.

21
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,312
She is just 3 months in the country,
and if you go to sleep with her?

22
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,120
What do you mean?

23
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,751
I would talk to her.

24
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,729
This remains between you and me.
Tell me what you want to tell her.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,632
I wanted to tell her that she had
stop my husband to bed.

26
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,835
Where is she?

27
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,079
Amanda, wait.

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,773
Where is she?

29
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,513
Where you hiding her?
- What are you talking about?

30
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,588
Where is she?
- Amanda, calm down.

31
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,817
Try to be adults.
- I, I keep quiet?

32
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,894
You have no right to something
to me to say!

33
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,394
You are the only one I love.

34
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,193
It means nothing to me.

35
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,306
What made you plans
to meet her today?

36
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,236
I had me taken to the
today about her.

37
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,410
You are never a good liar been.
- Amanda, no. Amanda!

38
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,612
Come here!
Go away!

39
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,948
Amanda, I love you!

40
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,823
Why are you not?
- Keep your hands off me!

41
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,289
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

42
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,003
Excuse me.

44
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,610
Hello?

45
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,389
Who's there?

46
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,843
What?

47
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,887
Is everything okay?

48
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,435
Do you have problems ...

49
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,914
Having problems with your car?

50
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,914
I'm just a little tired.

51
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,152
Did a long ride back.

52
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,666
You should be more cautious.

53
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,271
Are you sure?

54
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:38,998
Take care.

55
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,594
Okay?

56
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,105
I will.

57
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,401
Thank you.

58
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,389
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

59
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,842
My car has just gone.

60
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,140
I need a ride.

61
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,742
My car has just gone.

62
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,013
I need a ride.

63
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,852
I saw you just not a lot back?

64
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,953
And you stopped for me?

65
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,721
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

66
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,258
Oh, damn.

67
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,931
You drove 120 where 80 was.

68
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,525
I did not.
- Driver's license and registration papers.

69
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,838
It is late.
The only thing I want is go home.

70
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,746
Is this your current address?

71
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,546
Yes, sir.

72
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,881
And you said you went home?

73
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,987
If so,
would you not be that way?

74
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,121
Please exit and your hands
keep up.

75
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,099
Sir, this is really not necessary.

76
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,202
Legs apart and hands on
the roof of the car.

77
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,010
Excuse me.

78
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,644
What is this about?

79
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,750
Someone had already asked you.

80
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,728
He said, that you behaved strangely.

81
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,628
I have done nothing.

82
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,727
So it makes you nothing,
if I check your car?

83
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,641
Do you have something to hide?
- No. I ...

84
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,773
Why should you check my car?

85
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,890
Can you please the trunk
open for me?

86
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,023
Please, sir?
- Can you open the trunk?

87
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,197
Is there a problem?

88
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,333
No. I just want ...

89
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,415
Understood. - Ben on the way.

90
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,458
Let the next time you speed.
You may go.

91
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,358
"Black Lake, 90 Mile"

92
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,330
Very nice.

93
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,463
Sean, you can use the reflector a bit
shift for me? Thank you.

94
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,776
Very nice. Thank you.
Is he.

95
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,410
You are so beautiful.

96
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,385
Another pair.

97
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,477
Very nice.

98
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,024
Okay everyone, we are ready.

99
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,592
Thank you.

100
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,994
Yumi, it's fun for your cooperation.

101
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,591
Hopefully I see you again soon.

102
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,729
I knew together we could find.

103
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,637
You need to have good intuition.

104
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,403
And an eye for talent.

105
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,537
I have an eye for beauty.

106
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,046
I know.

107
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,744
This is a special place ...

108
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,853
for us.

109
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,526
Come on, Yumi, take the phone.

110
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,800
Hello. This is Yumi.

111
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,898
Leave a message.
Thank you.

112
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,703
Yumi, it's Greg.

113
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,508
Call me back when you receive.
We need to talk.

114
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,544
Hello?

115
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,247
Hello?

116
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,932
I love you in the eye.

117
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,846
Promise me that you never have sex with her.

118
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,849
I'm sick of the idea that
you leave me for your wife.

119
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,350
You love me, right?

120
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,059
You never loved me, do you?

121
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,900
Yumi, you know I love you.

122
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,370
Prove me.

123
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,392
I wait for you.

124
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,832
You may never leave me.

125
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,735
I love you always in mind.

126
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,754
I love you always in mind.

127
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,415
I know.

128
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,288
I've seen what you did with her.

129
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,406
She?

130
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,543
She?
- She?

131
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,994
Well. Come on.

132
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,963
No, come on, Amanda!

133
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,795
Come on.
Here we go.

134
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,630
All right, another one.
- No.

135
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,601
One more.
I know. I know.

136
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,570
Look at the camera.

137
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:18,479
And again, we are not a happy couple.

138
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,143
We were always a happy couple.

139
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:30,223
Amanda, you know that they
nothing for me to do it.

140
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,592
Let's not ruin our day.

141
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,091
You know that I only have eye for you.

142
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,329
Let us but to keep right.

143
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,235
I will always remain with you.

144
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,403
I hope you know.

145
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,250
You'll never leave me.

146
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,151
Forever lasted not very long, or sometimes?

147
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,994
What happens?

148
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,117
What was that?

149
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,191
Why did not you lift me?

150
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,562
Do you need help?

151
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,064
Keep your calm.
- Okay.

152
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,574
Excuse me.

153
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,518
Maybe you better off with ...

154
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,082
my clothes.

155
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,889
What you want.

156
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,007
What?

157
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,610
I thought that I heard something.

158
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,819
Greg, are you home?
- Speed. Come on.

159
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,224
We gotta go.
Come on quickly.

160
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,818
I call you, okay.

161
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,921
Promise me that?
- Sure.

162
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,260
Go.

163
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,137
Who said what?

164
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,470
With anyone.

165
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,349
And? How was it today?

166
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,502
Yumi. Hello?

167
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,007
Can you hear me?

168
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,411
Excuse me.

169
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,846
I was not home on time ...

170
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,114
I would like to see again.

171
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,415
I miss you.

172
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,514
Play a game with me?

173
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,752
If so then ...

174
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,954
Where are you?

175
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,423
You saw what happened.

176
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,932
What? Greg?

177
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,233
I can not hear you.

178
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,638
Hello.

179
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,641
I know.

180
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,873
I saw what you did with her.

181
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,124
Damn.

182
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,057
"Black Lake: 72 miles"

183
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,368
Great then.

184
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,123
Damn.

185
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,398
I bring you back to the lake, Amanda.

186
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,284
I am the happiest girl
of the whole world.

187
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:04,987
I know.

188
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,083
I was just a joke.

189
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,664
You know I do not
could do without you.

190
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,367
That you also never forget.

191
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,669
I do not.

192
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,584
I gotta leave this body in the woods.

193
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,848
Young whore!

194
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,867
Damn. Come on.

195
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,963
Come on.

196
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,270
Damn!

197
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,755
Are you crazy?

198
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,462
I'm out of fuel.

199
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,396
Did you see the gas station a
piece back is not it?

200
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:34,902
It's your lucky day.

201
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:53,387
I have some extra gasoline from
the generator, and am in a generous mood.

202
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,780
Open the tank.

203
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,594
Oh, damn.

204
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,198
Open the fuel tank.

205
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,797
Thank you.

206
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,500
I did not know how long I have
would wander around.

207
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,812
Do not worry about.

208
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,354
Thank you.

209
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,726
This should be enough gasoline to give you
back to the gas station.

210
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,858
Ok!

211
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,165
How much do you love me?

212
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,780
My God.

213
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:57,752
With such a beautiful woman
what are you doing so late?

214
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,086
This is for you, and your effort.

215
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,806
There is something out of your trunk.

216
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:31,344
It is very dangerous when
a trunk is not closed.

217
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,455
It may at any time open fold.

218
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,528
Open the trunk.
I get it for you.

219
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,461
No, I do it myself.
Okay then.

220
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,466
Ok.
What you want.

221
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,872
What?

222
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,484
I make sure that you
heelhuids outta here.

223
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,684
You're out of fuel.

224
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,492
There is something out of your trunk.

225
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,496
Whether you are careless,

226
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,623
or you have just a bad day.

227
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:22,194
Anyway, I will ensure
that you are outta here.

228
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,805
I feel good, really.

229
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,508
It will give me a better feeling.

230
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,128
Well.

231
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,029
Pleasant night.

232
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,125
And go home to your wife.

233
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,932
It will be very worried.

234
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,836
I will. Thank you.

235
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,360
'Sheriff'

236
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,713
Did you not that you going home?

237
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,823
Now I remember.

238
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,357
You told me you went home.

239
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,156
You look so good.

240
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,201
Where do you really go?

241
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,373
Back to Black Lake.

242
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,773
And why you go to?

243
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,575
It is not such a difficult question, actually.

244
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,080
I've just killed my wife,

245
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,984
and was planning to dump her
in Black Lake!

246
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,588
You do not tell me
if you do not want.

247
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,190
Be careful.

248
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,733
That is funny!

249
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,796
Since I now always on,
to my wife in the lake to dump.

250
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,809
This was a very bad night.

251
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:08,357
You take her to the lake?

252
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,667
I saw what you did with her.

253
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,708
We should go.

254
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,911
It is almost morning.

255
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:00,133
You love me, right?

256
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,972
Leave me alone!

257
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,876
This is not real!

258
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,042
You are a manifestation of my imagination!

259
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,656
You never love me,
or sometimes?

260
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,953
Go away!

261
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,694
Stop the car!

262
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,518
So, you dump her ...

263
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,096
in the lake.

264
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,137
They will find out.

265
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,933
Nobody knows.
- But ...

266
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,045
I know.

267
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:23,051
Go me murder?

268
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,692
Shut up!

269
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,200
Welcome to: Black Lake
"Black Lake".

270
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:02,170
Hold on to me to look ...

271
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:10,922
Hello?

272
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:14,587
Yumi, this is Greg.
We need to talk.

273
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,400
Where do you want to talk about?

274
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,831
I have personally seen.

275
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,100
Can I come?

276
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,611
I'll explain everything when I see you.

277
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,154
You know too much!

278
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:55,643
Sorry it this way
had expired, Yumi.

279
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,160
Excuse me.

280
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,260
I didn 't murder. 

281
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,701
Leave me alone! 

282
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:40,968
Excuse me!
