1
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:52,380
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

2
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,348
Just wondering. We're making
a little documentary

3
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,651
Do you guys wants
to be interviewed?

4
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,653
No, I don't think so.

5
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:23,576
A dance that has no beginning
and no end.

6
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:31,684
Would you wanna talk about
your relationship on camera?

7
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,152
Don't move.

8
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,621
Let the music move you.

9
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:45,195
How do you move in silence?

10
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:47,664
If you feel it,
take a partner.

11
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,775
Have both of you been
in long-term relationships

12
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,476
before you met?

13
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,244
- No.
- Not really, no.

14
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:07,648
So this is like your longest
relationship by far.

15
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,252
We've been together
for almost, what...

16
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,486
- 10 years.
- 10 years.

17
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,854
- 10 years?
- December.

18
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:16,622
In December,
it'll be 10 years.

19
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,802
We are so much more powerful
when we are not two,

20
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:33,203
we are one.

21
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:37,273
- Yeah, I totally liked it.
- Yeah?

22
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:41,443
Doesn't it feel good?
Doesn't your body feel alive?

23
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:44,179
- I feel like free and open.
- And light.

24
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:49,184
I was not making fun.
I was just...

25
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,853
I was just drawing your
attention to your patterns

26
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,254
and your habits.

27
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,556
- And I appreciate it.
- Okay.

28
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:58,158
Wow. That long-haired guy
was into you.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,593
- He was all over you.
- That's not what it's about.

30
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,597
but the guy I thought was gonna
put his hand down your pants.

31
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,465
Okay, Danny, no, no.

32
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not a sexual connection.
It's like...

33
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:13,204
I just love those guys, how they
pretend they're all spiritual,

34
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,372
and it's really they're trying
to get ass, you know?

35
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:17,774
- I mean, it's like, come on.
- That's not what's happening.

36
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,742
- Come on, really?
- It's not.

37
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:22,544
No, it's not.
It's deeper than that.

38
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:25,580
Listen, I love all this stuff.
It's great. It's really great.

39
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:30,484
We're kinda pathetic
as a race, you know?

40
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,185
- All guys?
- All guys.

41
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:35,288
- Including you?
- Well, I'm the one exception.

42
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,190
That's why I notice it
when I see it in other guys.

43
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:42,527
I'm sensing a little jealous
energy from you right now.

44
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:43,961
- Really?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,629
- I'm just looking out for you.
- Oh.

46
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:47,897
It's all right.
I can handle myself.

47
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,732
I know you can.
That's what I like about you.

48
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,366
Yeah.

49
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:53,801
- You know what? I...
- What?

50
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:57,304
I think we should shift this
energy before we go to dinner.

51
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,371
What do you mean?

52
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,306
Can I hug you right now?

53
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,940
Yeah. What, right here?

54
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,785
- All right.
- All right.

55
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,787
That was amazing.

56
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,389
- Good. Feel good?
- Totally. How did you do that?

57
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,524
Just changing the energy
a little.

58
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,726
You're so good at that.

59
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,228
We all are, Danny.

60
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,729
I like it here.

61
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,397
It's beautiful.
Beautiful spot.

62
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,831
Yeah, it's got a good feel.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,566
Great place to come
after the dance.

64
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,001
It is! It is a good place
to come after the dance.

65
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,535
- It's all raw, right?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,470
Or is it some? All raw.

67
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:41,005
- Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

68
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,974
- You sure?
- Love raw.

69
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,977
It's really nice.
I can't wait.

70
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,845
Hi.

71
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,881
- Hi.
- Hi, hi, hi.

72
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,469
Thank you.

73
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:17,805
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,573
This is Danny.

75
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,341
- Hi, Danny.
- Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:23,376
- This is Gayle.
- Hi, Gayle,

77
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:24,677
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Just a moment of sadness.

79
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,948
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,918
- But it's passed.
- That's good.

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,519
- I haven't seen you in so long!
- I know!

82
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,654
- The moment's gone.
- I know.

83
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,723
I know, but it's so good
to see you now.

84
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,692
- You too.
- She is so special.

85
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:48,029
We all are. We all are.

86
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,565
- Green smoothie?
- Yes.

87
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,368
- Uh, what is it?
- Yeah. Just say yes.

88
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,503
Yes, I'm saying yes
to everything today.

89
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:58,971
Yes to the world.

90
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:03,875
The service here is phenomenal.
It really is.

91
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,610
So you wanted to know
about my open relationship?

92
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,612
If you're okay with that.

93
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,081
- Sure.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,583
So basically how it worked
is I had a primary partner,

95
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:15,919
and he had another
girlfriend in L.A.,

96
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,954
and he would see her
when he was there.

97
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:20,623
Wow. So you knew that
that was going on.

98
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,492
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

99
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:26,661
It was a very open...
open relationship.

100
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,496
Hence the name.

101
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,531
And were you ever seeing
somebody at that time too?

102
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,666
Um...

103
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:36,636
I explored things a little
with some people, but...

104
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,037
nothing really stuck.

105
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,074
So you didn't feel jealous
or anything like that?

106
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,842
- No.
- That's amazing.

107
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,044
No, no, no.
She was really amazing.

108
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,713
She was great,
and she was great for him.

109
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:50,514
So this is something like
you guys would talk about.

110
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,915
Yeah.

111
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:56,052
because it's sort of
totally what I'm looking for.

112
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:58,621
Oh, yeah?

113
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,823
No. I mean,
not like that.

114
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,091
I mean, it sounds
interesting to me, maybe,

115
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,927
but just more
in terms of the film.

116
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:10,097
Like that's why I would like
to interview you on camera

117
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:13,033
and have you explain
your experience

118
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:14,768
with an open relationship.

119
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,036
If you'd be into that.

120
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,737
Sure, Dan.

121
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,374
All right. Let me try
and explain this to you.

122
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,541
I feel like
you're not getting it.

123
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,775
- Really?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,510
- I'm trying.
- I know.

125
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,111
It's like I'm here with you
right now, right?

126
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:32,514
But I'm not totally present
with you

127
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,950
because I feel very drawn
to that person over there.

128
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,552
- The guy with the book?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,086
- Really?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,520
He's your type?

131
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:45,823
Wait.
Are you being serious?

132
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,858
Because it's not
a reality to me.

133
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,659
I invent some fantasy
in my mind

134
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:54,897
and follow my impulse
and see what's drawing me.

135
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,899
What, you mean you
really wanna do that?

136
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,768
Or are you making
like an example?

137
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:07,975
- Hi.
- Hey.

138
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,177
- How are you?
- I'm good.

139
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,979
- Good. I'm John.
- Theresa.

140
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:34,498
It was nice to have met you.

141
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,932
Thanks, John.

142
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,972
What the hell was that?

143
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:47,508
So that was totally not
what I thought it was gonna be.

144
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,943
What was it?

145
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,811
But now I can just,
you know,

146
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:55,447
I can just let it go,
and I can be here with you.

147
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,082
Totally and completely.

148
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,584
- Wow.
- Right?

149
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,686
Actually, that might be a little
too much for me at the moment.

150
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,890
But okay.

151
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,763
Hey.

152
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:54,499
- Hi.
- Mmm.

153
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,601
- How are you?
- Good.

154
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:58,970
- Are you tired?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:00,604
- Already?
- Yeah.

156
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,807
- It's so early though.
- Not that early.

157
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:22,157
- Okay.
- What?

158
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,859
Um, do you wanna stay
and just sleep?

159
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:28,062
Uh, is that my only option?

160
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,798
- Maybe tonight, yeah.
- Tonight it is.

161
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,666
All right, awesome.

162
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,833
Let's sleep.

163
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,803
You're that tired?

164
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,105
- I am.
- Oh.

165
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,875
Mmm!

166
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,978
I need to do some dreaming.

167
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,379
- Some dreaming?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,981
All right.

169
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,717
- Will you turn off the light?
- Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

170
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,385
That's good.

171
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:00,989
Well, all right then.
Good night.

172
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,424
Good night.

173
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:05,993
Blessed dreams.

174
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:07,995
Blessed dreams to you too.

175
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:12,265
Why do you torture yourself
with these women, Danny?

176
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:14,867
Is it just for the film?
Is it worth it?

177
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:18,437
It's about the film,
but she's a nice person.

178
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:22,808
the film is just an extension
of where I'm at lately.

179
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,810
And yeah, maybe I'm getting
a little involved with her,

180
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,979
but it's sort of
part of the work.

181
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:31,682
Right, but it's like this
girl's got your brainwashed.

182
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,317
If she doesn't wanna
have sex, then...

183
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,985
suddenly you
don't wanna have sex.

184
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,888
Obviously I would like
to have sex more than I do.

185
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,157
I think you're better
than this situation.

186
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,092
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you saying that,

187
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:47,961
but I feel more connected
sometimes

188
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:50,697
when we don't have sex.

189
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,865
But I know what you're saying
because at the same time,

190
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,366
there's like...

191
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,201
I would really like to get...

192
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:57,869
Your cock sucked?

193
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:00,071
It might be nice.

194
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,073
This is what I'm saying!

195
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,974
There comes a time
when, you know,

196
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,076
every woman knows
you gotta suck a cock!

197
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,244
How would you know that?

198
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,979
'Cause I've done it before?

199
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:10,946
You've sucked a cock.

200
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,747
Yeah.

201
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,715
When was this, and how come
I didn't know about it?

202
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,983
My man days.
You know about my man days.

203
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,451
No, I don't.
You had man days?

204
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,786
- Does Emmy know about it?
- Yeah.

205
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,888
She does?
And she's cool with it?

206
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,123
Well, she can't
do much about it.

207
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,758
They came before her.

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,025
That's amazing.

209
00:12:29,027 --> 00:12:31,794
I mean, it doesn't surprise me.

210
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:35,397
I've seen you with men,
and I've thought like,

211
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,899
"For a lesbian,
she's very flirty with men."

212
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,468
No, I'm just kidding.

213
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,303
- I'm kidding.
- I have to open the studio.

214
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,507
If I pull down with two hands,
it's a fumble!

215
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,509
You should actually
have a relationship

216
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,210
instead of making movies
about them.

217
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:52,911
It's so boring!

218
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,946
I mean, what did
Woody Allen say?

219
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,981
He said, "I can only live
in my art, not in my life."

220
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,183
And I totally relate.

221
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:00,984
- What?
- It's so fucked up

222
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:03,252
that you're taking life advice
from Woody Allen.

223
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:04,753
I'm not taking
life advice from him.

224
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,322
I'm just saying I relate.

225
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:10,024
I don't know. I think
I just like being alone.

226
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,959
You gotta stop
saying that, dude.

227
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,461
- Why? It's true.
- I know it's true,

228
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,229
but when you say that to girls
when they first meet you,

229
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:17,496
they think you're a weirdo.

230
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,498
- I am a weirdo.
- No, you're not.

231
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,467
You're not a weirdo
because you like to be alone

232
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,534
some of the time.

233
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,135
That's totally natural.

234
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,137
Everybody feels like that.

235
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,007
I just like being
in my day, you know?

236
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:35,044
- That's great.
- Is it great?

237
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,213
how could it be any better
than this right now?

238
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:41,182
We got music,
it's two degrees outside,

239
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:43,150
we're having coffee.

240
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:45,252
I mean, getting laid would be
nice every once in a while.

241
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:47,988
Totally.
How long has it been?

242
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,123
I'd rather not say.

243
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,226
Oh, my God.

244
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,261
- What?
- Oh, my God.

245
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:59,265
How many weeks?
It's been months!

246
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,267
- Will you stop?
- How many months?

247
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,168
Maybe-- I don't know.
I don't have a sex calendar

248
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,270
where I mark off the days.

249
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,238
It was definitely warmer
the last time I had sex.

250
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,473
- Oh, my God.
- It's not that big a deal.

251
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,908
You remember it's like
some distant season.

252
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,043
In spring.
There were buds on the tree.

253
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,511
Will you have sex
with my friend?

254
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:16,812
Ow.

255
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,848
You are so in love with him.

256
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,283
Shut up.

257
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:26,119
I'm not in love with him,
I just love him.

258
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:28,454
There is a distinction.

259
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:31,423
You know,
he's sweet and charming,

260
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:34,559
and I just wanna see him
with a nice girl, that's all.

261
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,562
Maybe he doesn't want
a nice girl.

262
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,330
Oh, come on.
Of course he does.

263
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,031
Who doesn't want
a nice girl?

264
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,298
I don't know.

265
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,166
Maybe he likes being alone.

266
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:47,035
That's what he says, but...

267
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,870
I don't know.
I don't buy it.

268
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,838
Why not?

269
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,473
I love that he doesn't need
to be with someone all the time.

270
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,308
I'm not saying he needs to
be with someone all the time.

271
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,444
Just, you know,
some of time.

272
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,613
I mean, I've never seen him
with anyone except these...

273
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,082
creepy new-age girls
who torture him.

274
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:07,485
I mean, you would not
believe some of things

275
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,620
he's told me
these girls say and do,

276
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,922
in the name of
going with the flow.

277
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,023
It sucks.

278
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,059
I know.

279
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,862
Yeah?

280
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:23,196
Hmm?

281
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:26,965
You know?
What do you know?

282
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,233
What do you mean?

283
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:31,401
Oh, my God,
I caught you!

284
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:36,105
Em, I know when you're
not listening to me.

285
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,573
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,141
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry!

287
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,575
I'm distracted.

288
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:42,910
You know that work
is crazy right now.

289
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,345
So why don't you close your
computer and hang out with me?

290
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,947
I will in a second.

291
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,915
Let me just do
this one thing, okay?

292
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:53,084
I'm meeting with the election
committee woman tomorrow.

293
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,453
- Okay.
- What?

294
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,923
Nothing.

295
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,160
What are you doing?

296
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,128
- Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:17,438
I thought you were
making us dinner.

298
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,940
It's cookin', good-lookin'.

299
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:25,912
- So tell me this.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:29,682
Can your election
committee woman do this?

301
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,419
Stop that.
That's disgusting.

302
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:38,656
Oh, come on.

303
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:41,524
- Do not be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

304
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,234
I'm very, very sorry.

305
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:55,236
You did stick your tongue
in my ear.

306
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:57,471
It's kinda wet and gross.

307
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:02,542
No. You know what?
I'm not into it anymore.

308
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:06,145
Yes, you are. You're always
into it, you little nymph.

309
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,947
- Fuck off.
- Sweetie...

310
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,116
I'm sorry if I'm attracted
to my girlfriend.

311
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,052
I was kidding.

312
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:17,154
Come on, I was kidding.

313
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,455
Huh?

314
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:20,523
Huh?

315
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,291
- Huh?
- You always do this!

316
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,126
- What?
- No, you know what?

317
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,695
If I have to explain it,
just forget it.

318
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,130
Come on.

319
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,632
Don't be such
a little baby, huh?

320
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,568
- Can't take a joke suddenly.
- Fuck you.

321
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,337
Why aren't you ticklish?
It's so unfair.

322
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,972
Oh, fuck off.
I'm going.

323
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:43,375
I'll make you your dinner,
madam!

324
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:45,510
One of these nights,
you're cooking.

325
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,212
In your dreams,
sweet cakes.

326
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,514
Oh, my God.

327
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,518
Why do I have to be
the mom?

328
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,388
Uh, I think I burnt this.

329
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,759
<i>Well, it doesn't</i>
<i> make a lot of sense</i>

330
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,361
<i>because I have</i>
<i> a really close friendship...</i>

331
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,396
Hey, did you finish
the behind-the-scenes?

332
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:11,500
Oh, that was
the airline thing.

333
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:14,002
No, before that.
What is that you're working on?

334
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:15,470
It was nothing.

335
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:18,706
- No.
- Everybody does it. Show me.

336
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,774
- Really?
- Please. I'm bored.

337
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,675
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

338
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:25,678
It's this doc that I've been
working on for years.

339
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,579
It's going to be a cure
for boredom,

340
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:30,348
but if you really wanna
see it, uh, here.

341
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,782
What's it about?

342
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,618
It's about uh,
you know, people's lives

343
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,786
and relationships and...
Here.

344
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:39,255
<i>I started like...</i>
<i> I don't...</i>

345
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,290
<i>I... First of all...</i>

346
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:43,659
I did the camera shake
intentionally.

347
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,328
Yeah, it looks like
a battle scene or something.

348
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,330
<i>...to avoid it.</i>

349
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,198
Back-lit.
It's supposed to look bad.

350
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,100
So is she,
is she like mentally ill?

351
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:55,168
No, she's not mentally ill.

352
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,137
She's just talking about
her relationship history.

353
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,439
Romantic relationships.

354
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,208
Or other kinds. If they don't
have romantic relationships,

355
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,776
then how they, you know,

356
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:07,612
subvert that emotion
in other ways

357
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,448
and, you know,
just connection, basically.

358
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,516
Highbrow.

359
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,418
Sort of, but I don't know
where it's going right now.

360
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,853
I'm just trying to find
the heart of the doc.

361
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,789
Hey, there he is.
Zack, what's up?

362
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,324
done by the end
of the day, right?

363
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:26,561
Yeah, I was just, uh,
I put that in the bin for you.

364
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:29,330
Is this still H.264?

365
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,398
- Oh, we're great.
- Yeah.

366
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
- Yeah, no problem.
- You got it.

367
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:36,668
Did you start this?

368
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,703
No, not at all.

369
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:41,472
- All right, uh...
- You got it?

370
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:42,706
Yeah, I'm on it.

371
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,208
All right. okay.
Thanks, man.

372
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,609
Oh, hey, speaking
of relationships.

373
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:49,712
You still with that
hot freaky chick?

374
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,513
- Oh, Theresa?
- Yeah.

375
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,715
She is hot.
Not that freaky though.

376
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:55,583
She's into that
like new-agey stuff.

377
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,719
I mean, with her?
I don't know.

378
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,488
because she's into
open relationships,

379
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,289
so it's a little weird.

380
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,890
- It's perfect.
- Really?

381
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:07,559
Dude, don't fuck it up
by asking questions.

382
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,793
You're probably right.

383
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,728
Seriously, yeah.

384
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,530
- All right, man.
- I'll see ya.

385
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,666
<i>...relationship rather than</i>
<i> just being myself, so...</i>

386
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,470
<i>I'm uncomfortable,</i>
<i> and I want out.</i>

387
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,639
What?

388
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,908
All right, Mr. Cameraman,
what do you wanna know?

389
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,611
Give me some good stories
about open relationships.

390
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,679
Um, okay.

391
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:38,750
Um, my primary partner
had his L.A. girlfriend

392
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,651
come in to town once,

393
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:45,656
and I was going to New Jersey
to stay with my parents,

394
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:49,926
and I spent the whole day
cleaning and getting ready,

395
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:52,295
and I bought flowers.

396
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:53,963
Oh, my God.

397
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:57,499
Yeah, I just wanted it
to be perfect for them.

398
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:59,634
- Really?
- Yeah.

399
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:02,003
That seems so amazing to me
that you can just like--

400
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:04,505
So you don't have
jealousy at all, ever?

401
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:07,374
- No.
- Come on.

402
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,842
No, we're all on
our own paths, you know?

403
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,878
Everybody's got...

404
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,881
their own needs.

405
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:18,317
But do you even have the
feeling, and then you say, like,

406
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,419
"I'm not going to go
with this feeling,"

407
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:23,788
or do you just not even have
the feeling of jealousy?

408
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:29,392
Um...

409
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:32,395
The only feeling I have is like,
"Oh, I really wish..."

410
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:38,300
If I suddenly wish that he
was there, but he's not there.

411
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,768
Mm-hmm.

412
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,670
But that's, you know,
that's my own shit.

413
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:44,805
That's your own shit?

414
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:47,407
My teabag says,
"You are unlimited."

415
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,443
You are unlimited.
What does mine say?

416
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:52,578
Trust creates peace.

417
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,813
- Oh, see?
- That's appropriate.

418
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,948
Can we put the camera
away now?

419
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,953
I know, but sometimes
I just wanna be here.

420
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,454
Okay.

421
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,722
Just the two of us.

422
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,724
Without a camera between us.

423
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,726
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.

424
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,030
- Good breath.
- I know.

425
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,565
- I'm getting better at this.
- You are.

426
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,435
It's so interesting
to do this, isn't it?

427
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:24,503
It's good. Feels good.

428
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:27,439
Yeah, 'cause it's funny,
the first few times we did it,

429
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:31,976
it's like, the eye contact
always seems to be like,

430
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:36,347
we should either make out
or cry or you know...

431
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:38,082
- Yeah.
- But...

432
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:40,951
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to do it.

433
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,820
- I should shut up now.
- You don't have to qualify it.

434
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,990
See? So much better.

435
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,858
Totally.

436
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,497
We'll take it
to the next level.

437
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,998
All right.

438
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:04,970
That's good.

439
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:06,938
- That's nice.
- Yeah?

440
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,047
- That's good.
- Wow.

441
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:19,549
- Feel good?
- That's amazing.

442
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:23,819
Yeah, that's like third-eye
to third-eye, you know?

443
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:26,121
It's like kind of
an inner seeing.

444
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:27,889
- Do you wanna, um...
- I like it.

445
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,658
Do you wanna trade massages
right now?

446
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,795
I would love that.
You mean like right here?

447
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,898
- No, let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

448
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,566
- Should we bring our tea?
- Bring your tea.

449
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,468
Trust is peace.

450
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,536
Trust is peace.

451
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:45,837
Oh, that feels good.

452
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,905
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

453
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,506
Yeah, you got
some tension going on.

454
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,840
- Whew!
- Wow.

455
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:53,709
Too much?

456
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:54,976
- It's a lot.
- It's a lot?

457
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,478
It's a lot,
but in a good way.

458
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,712
Oh, my goodness.

459
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:01,381
- Yeah, you need that.
- Ooh!

460
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,783
This shirt is kinda
getting in the way here.

461
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,918
Do you wanna take it off
and then we can use the oil?

462
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,588
All right, sure.
Yeah, let's do that.

463
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,990
Let's see,
this looks like good...

464
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:16,827
- massage oil.
- See where the oil is?

465
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,962
Yeah, it's pretty handy here.

466
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,830
You must get massages a lot.

467
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,666
Well, sometimes,
when I'm lucky.

468
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:26,402
It's a nice thing to do.

469
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:28,102
All right, here we go.

470
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:33,607
This'll be nice.

471
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,117
- Do these go up?
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,921
I need more oil for this.

473
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,905
- It's a very kissable back.
- Oh, okay.

474
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,876
- It's just part of the massage.
- Oh, okay.

475
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:18,744
It's a very...

476
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:20,178
special technique I have.

477
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,513
I see. Uh...

478
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:23,780
- Danny.
- What?

479
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,581
- I...
- What?

480
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,516
- I think maybe we should stop.
- What do you mean?

481
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:28,817
This is just getting going.

482
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,119
Yeah, I just,
I'm not really...

483
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,987
- I think we should stop.
- What? Really?

484
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,156
Yeah, yeah, I just, um...

485
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:38,191
I just don't wanna be
sexual right now.

486
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:40,826
- Oh, no, I don't either.
- Okay, good.

487
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,527
It just doesn't...
Hate isn't what wants to happen.

488
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,196
Oh, okay, sorry.

489
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:48,065
I just get a little excited
because you're so beautiful.

490
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:51,068
Oh, that's so nice.
That's so nice.

491
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,004
Okay, so much love,
so much love.

492
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,538
Yeah.

493
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,972
Mmm!

494
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:02,110
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

495
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,779
Although, it still does
feel slightly sexual,

496
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,748
I understand, I understand.

497
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:15,054
Just gonna help myself
out here where I can.

498
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,889
See? There we go.

499
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:18,523
Perfect.
That looks great.

500
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:20,157
- Now can I hug you?
- Absolutely,

501
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,492
- Now it's like we're cousins.
- Okay.

502
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,893
Mmm.

503
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:28,597
Yeah, this is great.
I don't feel anything.

504
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,969
Well, um, we were...

505
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:36,705
should I look at you
or should I look at your thing?

506
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,773
Into the lens
or at your face?

507
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:41,542
- No, you can look at me.
- Okay.

508
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:45,779
- Um, I was into her for a--

509
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,781
a long time, a while.

510
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:50,817
- She was?
- Did I talk during your turn?

511
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,786
- Um, yeah, you did.
- Oh, my God.

512
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:56,522
I'm so excited that there is
documentation of this

513
00:26:56,524 --> 00:26:58,624
because we can
actually rewind.

514
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:02,094
First of all, you did talk
through my whole turn.

515
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:06,064
And second of all,
it doesn't actually matter

516
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:08,099
'cause technically
there are no turns.

517
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:11,168
That's good.
I like the bickering too.

518
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,103
- .Keep that going.
- Oh, great.

519
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:17,740
So, um, she was
going out with a guy.

520
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,908
- A man person.
- A man person.

521
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,110
And so I didn't even know
if it was a possibility.

522
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:25,580
- And she was dating a shrew.
- That is not true.

523
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,315
- She was--
- Oh, my God, she was awful.

524
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,850
She was this
controlling psychopath

525
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:32,285
who literally never laughed.

526
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:34,287
She did laugh.

527
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,290
She laughed
all the time in private.

528
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,959
You don't think that's weird?

529
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:41,827
- A little bit.
- You're not allowed to ask him.

530
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,261
She's a private laugher.

531
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,797
She can't ask you
for validation.

532
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,833
Um... You are so mean.

533
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:54,337
when your partner's last person
was such a square

534
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,740
because it's so easy
to please them.

535
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,808
All I have to do is
laugh over brunch,

536
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,843
and you feel like
I'm the most delightful woman

537
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,911
you ever dated.

538
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,714
Um, oh, my God.

539
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:09,083
You're such a bitch.

540
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,684
Do you have any fistfights?

541
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:14,354
'Cause I feel like we could do
a cat fight for you.

542
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:17,790
That's nice, but let's go back
to Carla and her man.

543
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,224
Oh, God, do we
actually have to?

544
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,226
And had you
dated men before, Carla?

545
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,962
- You know this.
- I know it, yeah,

546
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,997
but we're talking to the rest
of the film audience here.

547
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:29,233
All right, sorry. Um...

548
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:31,001
- Yeah, let's hear it.
- Shut up.

549
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,736
What's the other story?

550
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:36,740
So I wasn't
that comfortable with it,

551
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:40,944
and I, uh...

552
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,846
and I wasn't out.

553
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:47,850
So I was dating Brad
and experimenting with women.

554
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:52,320
And Brad knew about
this experimentation?

555
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:54,121
No, no.

556
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:57,724
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

557
00:28:57,726 --> 00:29:01,728
And Emmy was friends
with his sister.

558
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,164
Oh.
Was that weird?

559
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,269
This is good stuff.
This is really good.

560
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:14,939
Yeah, well, you know,
it was a long time ago, so...

561
00:29:23,982 --> 00:29:25,983
That's it. We don't have
to talk about Brad anymore

562
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:30,186
'cause this has really
gone down a different turn here.

563
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,355
No, I... She's right.

564
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,857
It's probably--
I just feel bad about it.

565
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,959
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him anymore.

566
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,226
It's fine.

567
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,329
So because
she was dating Brad,

568
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:46,899
I didn't know
if it was a possibility.

569
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,467
Back to me.

570
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:50,535
Take it back to you.

571
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:55,839
But then I found out
about all this experimenting.

572
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,440
And that was it?

573
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,141
And that was it.

574
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:02,210
And the buck stopped there.

575
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:04,445
Let's hope.

576
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:05,546
So far.

577
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:14,054
- We can cut it now.
- Okay.

578
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,823
- Why?
- You are not talking to Brad.

579
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,191
I have to talk to him.

580
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:22,328
The subject reveals
where the story goes.

581
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,097
Didn't you see<i> Hoop Dreams?</i>

582
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,401
No, really.
You can't talk to him.

583
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:33,037
- Why not?
- Because he was traumatized.

584
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,874
Seriously, he's my only ex
that I don't talk to anymore,

585
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,276
and it ruined the relationship
between Emmy and his sister.

586
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:40,977
I'm gonna be totally
sensitive to that.

587
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,578
It's a really
bad idea, dude.

588
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,546
It's not.
No, it's a good idea.

589
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:48,550
This documentary is gonna
bring everyone back together.

590
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,418
- Oh, my God.
- And it's gonna be great.

591
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,119
You guys are gonna
go to the premiere.

592
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:56,189
- I'm serious, Danny.
- I'm serious too.

593
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:58,424
Actually, do you wanna become
the center of this film?

594
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,259
You know, it's so sweet
of you to ask me that

595
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,461
because I've been wanting
to say to you that,

596
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:04,596
"Yes, I want to be
the center of your film!"

597
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:09,867
Oh, my God.
You're fucking with me, right?

598
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,602
- No.
- This is not okay.

599
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,170
Holy shit.

600
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,539
- That's Rosie.
- Wow.

601
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,108
She just ate that pigeon
over there in the grass.

602
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,043
Yeah, rubbed one out.

603
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:57,980
Bobby and Violet
were there years ago,

604
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,416
and then Violet died
and this one moved in.

605
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:04,919
Bobby and Rosie, they live
together in the white building,

606
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,021
or that red building over there,
those two windows.

607
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:10,224
Her and Bobby met right up there
on top of the building up there.

608
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:12,426
But Bobby had his choice.

609
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:17,597
because he watched her catch it
right here in the grass.

610
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,232
And she was messed up.
She died.

611
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:22,534
- She ended up dying.
- Oh, man.

612
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:25,336
But then she moved in.
She just took off.

613
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,004
Where did she go?

614
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,273
- I lost her.
- I know.

615
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,341
Where'd she go?
Did you see her?

616
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:54,427
<i>Um, so, well,</i>

617
00:32:54,429 --> 00:33:00,399
<i>I was into her for a while.</i>

618
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,441
Hey, Aunt Lily,
how are you?

619
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:25,076
- Good! How are you?
- Good.

620
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:27,344
Good! Were you at the church?
I didn't see you there.

621
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:29,713
No, I just came right from work,
so I missed the church part.

622
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:32,148
That's too bad.
It was wonderful.

623
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,749
- Carol was so beautiful.
- Was she really?

624
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:39,454
- Would you like something?
- I'm good. I'll see you later.

625
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:43,024
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

626
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,534
- Hello, hello!
- Danny!

627
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,769
How you doin', Aunt Jules?

628
00:34:56,771 --> 00:35:00,105
- Nice to see you, Trevor.
- Danny.

629
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,040
- Nice to see everybody.
- How was work?

630
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,674
It was good. I'm sorry
I came right from work.

631
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:05,242
- I missed the church.
- That's okay,

632
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,710
We're just glad you're here.

633
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:09,179
Aunt Lily said it was
beautiful though, yeah?

634
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:11,247
- It was somethin'.
- Not a dry eye in the house.

635
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,248
Nice.

636
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,415
Really?

637
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,216
Go say hi to Carol.

638
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:17,351
Oh, she looks busy,
I'll get her later.

639
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:20,620
You know, she brought a whole
lot of cute, single friends.

640
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,155
Okay, Aunt Jules,
thank you very much.

641
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:26,158
There are a lot of
cute, single girls here.

642
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,260
Trevor's noticed them.

643
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:31,796
Good observation.
I'm taken.

644
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,697
- Right, honey?
- Yes.

645
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,098
And you're too old
for any of them

646
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,366
to be interested
in you anyway.

647
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,668
Oh, so I'm monogamous
by default.

648
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,703
By default, yeah.
You never know though.

649
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,438
Sometimes they go
for the older guys, Mom.

650
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,706
You'd better be careful.

651
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:55,180
Danny, what are you
editing now?

652
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:56,648
Oh, I mean,
just dumb shit.

653
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,351
Commercials mostly, but now
I'm starting to get more films.

654
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:04,221
My cousin was an orderly
on<i> General Hospital.</i>

655
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:06,756
Oh, really, that's exactly
the same thing as a film editor.

656
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,259
- What do you do?
- Uh, I, um...

657
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:12,094
Investment counseling.

658
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:15,697
- She had to tell you that?
- No, no, I do.

659
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:17,699
I counsel people
on their investments.

660
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,534
Yeah, that's great, man.
You like it?

661
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:22,336
No, but I make
a shitload of money.

662
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,804
Well, there you go.

663
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,705
That's a good thing,
I guess.

664
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:28,374
You just got a husband here
to dance with.

665
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:32,211
I gotta get the ol'
ball and chain off my back.

666
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:35,247
Already? Come on.
That was quick.

667
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:36,281
Have fun.

668
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:39,383
We'll dance together.

669
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:42,619
You haven't always tried
new things.

670
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:46,155
- I'm trying it, believe me.
- Awesome.

671
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:47,456
You don't think of me
here anymore though.

672
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,325
I know you don't.
You forget all about me.

673
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:52,226
That's not true at all.

674
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,827
You were always
my favorite cousin.

675
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,129
- We just never see you anymore.
- No, I know.

676
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,732
It's true, it's true.
I've sort of like cut off

677
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,167
because you're the only one
I can talk to.

678
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:05,503
The rest of these people here
I don't feel comfortable with.

679
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,305
Well, I mean, you never
give people a chance.

680
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:10,740
That's true, I don't,
but you know what it is?

681
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:13,509
It's like I feel like everyone's
just trying to figure me out,

682
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,777
put me in a box or something.

683
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,913
Yeah. You know my friend Suze
was asking about you tonight.

684
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:21,282
- Oh, Suze.
- She wanted to see you.

685
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:23,284
- Really?
- Yeah.

686
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:26,487
You can just enjoy your day,
you know what I mean?

687
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,388
This is ridiculous!

688
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,857
He's just unconventional
when it comes to relationships.

689
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,692
That sounds like
code for gay.

690
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,694
What, Danny?

691
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:37,430
Are you kidding?
No way.

692
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:39,465
That guy gets all the tail
he wants. I've seen.

693
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,700
What have you seen?

694
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:44,335
Well, like with that
hippie-dippie girl we met.

695
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:45,703
Oh, Theresa.

696
00:37:45,705 --> 00:37:50,808
Exactly. What kind of
straight man has women friends?

697
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,178
Why when someone
shows up solo

698
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,346
that everybody thinks gay?

699
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:59,615
I mean, if he was gay,
wouldn't he bring a guy?

700
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,483
Not if he was
in the closet.

701
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:02,817
Oh, why are you so concerned?

702
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:15,862
- Hey, Charlie, how you doin'?
- Good. How you doin'?

703
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:20,933
All right, I will.
I'll be over in a second.

704
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:22,434
- Okay.
- Yeah.

705
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:27,238
No, no, no, no.
I don't think you're gay.

706
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,806
Yeah.

707
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:33,944
because they've never
seen you with women.

708
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:38,982
Right, because if you're alone,
that's not an option. I get it.

709
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:43,353
I was alone for a long time
before I met your mother,

710
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,587
and I loved it,

711
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,625
but then I met her and...

712
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,094
it was like, I really dug
hanging with her.

713
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,562
Yeah.

714
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,996
Yeah, she's a good lady.

715
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,365
Yeah, yeah, she is.

716
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,468
But you know,
once you get older,

717
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,404
the body and the sex
and all that,

718
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,706
it becomes less.

719
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:08,910
I used to be really into
like tight bodies

720
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,478
with pow-wow curves.

721
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,349
but she has more of a roly-poly
kind of beautiful, you know?

722
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:16,717
Right.

723
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,386
Not to say that...

724
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:23,656
not to say that the sex
is not fucking fantastic.

725
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:24,990
- Okay.
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

726
00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:26,624
That's probably
not very appropriate.

727
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,958
No, no, that's fine.

728
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:34,764
It is great to be outside.

729
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:36,899
Yeah, it's a beautiful night.

730
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,500
No, no, man.

731
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,768
I mean outside of convention.

732
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,704
You know?

733
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:46,440
I don't know.

734
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:47,474
What?

735
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:50,410
What? What?

736
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:52,678
This fucking suit, man!

737
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,113
- It's fucking terrible!
- Really?

738
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:58,549
No, no, no!
But it's beautiful.

739
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,552
It is beautifully terrible.

740
00:40:01,554 --> 00:40:06,690
It says, "I couldn't bother
being conforming to you,

741
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:09,859
you conforming automatons."

742
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:11,627
- No, it's noble, man.
- Really?

743
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:14,529
Yes. It's noble.

744
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,764
It's like...

745
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:20,834
fucking nobility
from a time gone by.

746
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:21,968
Don't ever stop.

747
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,003
Wow. I don't think I can.

748
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,105
Like Rilke says,
"You build your life

749
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:30,876
in accordance
with that necessity."

750
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:36,181
What's your necessity?

751
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,916
I don't think I have one.

752
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,651
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on, man!

753
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,119
- What's your necessity?
- I don't know.

754
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,687
I never really...

755
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:47,691
Okay, like my necessity is to...

756
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:49,559
do nothing.

757
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,894
Like I wake up
in the morning

758
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:56,098
and just let the day unfold.

759
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,633
That's beautiful, man.
I fucking love that.

760
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:01,636
See once you find
your necessity,

761
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:05,539
it's all gravy
from there on out.

762
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,977
Carla, where are you
right now?

763
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,946
Why is your phone off,
first of all?

764
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:15,948
Second of all,
I'm so high right now.

765
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,717
I'm still at the wedding,
and my family is insane.

766
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,518
I just got high
with my mom's boyfriend.

767
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,052
You know what he told me?

768
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:25,121
He told me that sex with
my mom is still fantastic.

769
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:28,157
So I've got that image in
my head for the rest of my life.

770
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:32,027
I so wanna talk to you
right now.

771
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:36,698
I just feel like I'm at
that perfect high place,

772
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,033
and I just need
to talk to you.

773
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:40,968
I love talking to you high.

774
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,070
It's one of my favorite
things to do.

775
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:45,906
I need you right now.
Where are you?

776
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,841
God!

777
00:41:47,843 --> 00:41:50,076
Call me back
as soon as you get this.

778
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:51,710
Before you get this,
call me back.

779
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,011
All right, love you, bye.

780
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,618
- Uncle Bob, you takin' off?
- Yeah.

781
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,486
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

782
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:04,187
When are we gonna see you
getting married?

783
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,689
Me? Oh, I don't know.
I'm too young.

784
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,725
You better hurry up.
You don't wanna end up like me.

785
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,027
Oh, come on!
That wouldn't so bad.

786
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,062
You think?

787
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,930
- Have a good night.
- You too.

788
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,629
- Hey.

789
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:00,704
- What happened?

790
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:04,040
I don't know.
I have no idea, Danny.

791
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:13,247
I mean, is she seeing
somebody else or what is it?

792
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:14,915
She wouldn't say.

793
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:17,651
Oh, God.

794
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,653
It's impossible.

795
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,223
I really... I don't know
how anybody does it.

796
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:30,829
Well, you're asking
the wrong guy.

797
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:33,164
You are so lucky you don't
have to deal with this shit.

798
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,232
No.
I don't know about that.

799
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:38,301
Do you have any weed?

800
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,571
I think I might
have some weed.

801
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:45,006
Look at who you're
talking to right now.

802
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:47,341
- Can I have some?
- Do you want some?

803
00:43:47,343 --> 00:43:48,842
- Yeah, I want weed.
- I'm getting you weed.

804
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:51,611
Gonna make it all better.

805
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:53,679
I want wine and weed.

806
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:56,648
I'll do what I can here.
I don't know how much...

807
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,249
I don't know how much
weed and wine we have,

808
00:43:58,251 --> 00:43:59,350
but I'll do my best.

809
00:43:59,352 --> 00:44:01,685
- Pills.
- Pills? Heroin?

810
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:03,119
- Heroin.
- All right.

811
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:05,020
So let's start you off
with weed.

812
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:08,156
I'm gonna get you wine.
How is cheap red wine for you?

813
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:09,290
It's fine.

814
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:38,818
This is really good weed.
Where'd you get it?

815
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,220
I got it from
my tai chi instructor.

816
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,091
Oh, my God.

817
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,860
You have a tai chi instructor?

818
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,963
You don't?

819
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:56,098
Oh, my God, what are you?

820
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,933
Like an 85-year-old Asian man?

821
00:44:57,935 --> 00:45:00,001
I am, in the body of...

822
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:02,770
You're very well maintained.

823
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:05,139
You never know what it's like
inside the relationship

824
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:07,241
That's so true.

825
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:11,044
Well, it was fun.
It used to be fun.

826
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:13,780
How long has it
not been fun for?

827
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:18,150
I don't know.

828
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,923
Are you okay?

829
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,693
Hey.

830
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:53,013
Hey, come here.

831
00:46:02,923 --> 00:46:04,890
You're gonna be okay.

832
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:07,759
Really?

833
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:10,695
Really.

834
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,764
How do you know?

835
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:15,898
I can feel it.

836
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:21,036
I know these things.

837
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,308
I do.

838
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,245
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna go for a walk.

839
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,348
You're gonna be fine. Come on.
I have a good plan for us.

840
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,116
- You do?
- Yeah.

841
00:46:56,234 --> 00:46:58,468
- Can you do it?
- Yeah, I can do it.

842
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,304
- Can you see?
- It's a meadow!

843
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:03,739
- What is it?
- It's a whole meadow!

844
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:50,384
- Are we in the right space?
- Yeah. Straight.

845
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:52,552
What street is this?

846
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:54,854
Suffolk.

847
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:56,355
We're not there yet.
We're almost there.

848
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:00,258
- What is your name?
- I'm Megan.

849
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,326
- Hey, I'm Danny.
- Hi, Danny, nice to meet you.

850
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:04,895
- This is Carla.
- Hi, how are you?

851
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:07,464
- Yeah, good. How are you doing?
- Good. It's good.

852
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:09,199
Tequila?

853
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,341
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Ireland, from Dublin.

854
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:22,277
- Do you like it?
- I love it here.

855
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:26,314
- Do you live in the city?
- Well, I don't know now.

856
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,282
I'm sort of homeless
as of tonight.

857
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:30,150
- You gotta drown your sorrows.
- Yeah!

858
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:33,920
She's like
an Irish Brigette Bardot.

859
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:35,821
- You should have one more shot.
- Really? You think?

860
00:48:35,823 --> 00:48:37,489
Have you got to work tomorrow?

861
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:39,991
How can you say no
to that accent?

862
00:48:39,993 --> 00:48:42,560
No, I can't
say no to that accent.

863
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:45,129
Here's to New York.
Come on.

864
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,264
It's a good tequila.
I wouldn't give you bad tequila.

865
00:48:47,266 --> 00:48:48,832
I already can't feel my teeth.

866
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,567
You got the basic stuff.

867
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:53,436
You haven't met that guy
or that girl, right?

868
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:57,440
Yeah, exactly.
I haven't met that person.

869
00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:01,143
You never know. You come into
a bar and meet a guy or girl.

870
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:03,612
Completely depends.

871
00:49:03,614 --> 00:49:08,249
And that's a good way to be
because you double your odds.

872
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,317
No, I've never dated
a customer.

873
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,053
Thanks for answering that.

874
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:15,055
I'm not doing a number slide.
I'm just asking!

875
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:16,990
I'm gonna get a number slide!

876
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:18,891
I want you to be happy.
This is your night.

877
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:21,426
I don't even know
what's going on with her.

878
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:26,097
and she wouldn't tell me
if she was with someone else.

879
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,432
When you ask someone,
"Are you with someone,

880
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:30,467
"are you seeing someone else,
have you met someone else?"

881
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:33,303
and they don't
answer that question...

882
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:37,006
Right, but I mean, you don't
ask that question unless like...

883
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:39,608
- What did you... What?
- Let's stop talking about it.

884
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,977
But she's also--
Where are you going?

885
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:47,716
I dropped my napkin,
you fucking pervert!

886
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,351
- This is your life, right?
- No, I know.

887
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:52,619
Do you want something
that's extraordinary

888
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:57,123
Or something that's like...

889
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:59,625
- No, I want that.
- Yeah, exactly.

890
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:02,594
- Sorry, if I spat on you.
- No, I just wanna hug you.

891
00:50:02,596 --> 00:50:04,729
I just wanna hug you.

892
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:07,064
- She's doing her thing.
- What are you saying?

893
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:12,769
- Then you go like this.
- I don't need the criticism.

894
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:14,470
We should really...

895
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:17,139
We should go?

896
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,673
But I tried to get that
out of her.

897
00:50:18,675 --> 00:50:20,374
Did you see how I tried
to get that out of her?

898
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,676
- Yeah.
- Did you try?

899
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:27,547
I feel like there's a level
that we're so close,

900
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:29,649
and we're like
really good friends,

901
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,550
but I get to a certain level,
and then it's like,

902
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:34,786
boom, door goes up.

903
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:39,457
Like, it's like
"That's as far as you get."

904
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:43,093
- You wanna get a bit further.
- No, no, no!

905
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:44,694
You joke about it
and you make jokes,

906
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:47,596
but like I really
feel that sometimes.

907
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:51,465
I'm just being honest.
I'm just being honest.

908
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:54,568
You know, you can trust me.

909
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,237
Like I don't know why you feel
like you can't trust me.

910
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:59,172
Why are you taking
all the drinks?

911
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:01,674
It's like you get it,
like you fucking get it,

912
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:03,409
and you don't even know
that you get it.

913
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:05,411
Like you're just like so cool,

914
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:07,312
and you're
a fucking great woman,

915
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:11,816
and you seek these relationships
where if you're not appreciated,

916
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:17,354
No, I was crazy in college.

917
00:51:17,356 --> 00:51:21,391
and I would fuck these women
that I had no connection to.

918
00:51:21,393 --> 00:51:23,226
Oh, my God,
that's so unusual!

919
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:25,561
Wait, in college, you got
really drunk all the time

920
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:27,829
- and fucked women?
- Isn't that crazy?

921
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:32,366
So you were that one
that did that in college.

922
00:51:32,368 --> 00:51:34,735
- You were the one guy...
- That did that.

923
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:36,236
No, I'm not saying
I was a one guy.

924
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:37,403
I'm just trying
to make a point.

925
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:39,071
I'm saying that I did that

926
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:41,106
with these girls
that I would be attracted to,

927
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:43,475
but then I also had these
really good girlfriends

928
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,143
that we would
stay up all night

929
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,211
and talk and bond
and everything,

930
00:51:47,213 --> 00:51:49,379
but I would never even think
about sleeping with those girls.

931
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:52,482
It was like I wanted to keep
those two things separate.

932
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,684
Right, right,
but did those chicks,

933
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:58,688
the ones that would stay up
braiding your hair every night...

934
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,624
- You are such a bitch.
- Did they wanna have...

935
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:03,859
Did they wanna
have sex with you?

936
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:05,694
No, because I had
braided hair at that point.

937
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:07,162
Why would they wanna
have sex with me?

938
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:09,164
No, that was not
part of our thing.

939
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,166
They totally wanted
to have sex with you.

940
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:18,373
And they were like, "When is he
going to make a move?

941
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:23,177
How long do I have to talk about
feelings with this fucking guy?"

942
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:25,145
Really? They were waiting
for me to make a move?

943
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:28,748
I hope they weren't.
I thought we were bonding.

944
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,484
You couldn't
handle the intimacy

945
00:52:31,486 --> 00:52:33,886
like full-on altogether.

946
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:36,521
You could either have
sexual intimacy,

947
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:39,357
which wasn't really intimacy;
it was just banging.

948
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,560
- It was banging.
- Or intimacy without the sex.

949
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:44,762
You weren't ready
for the whole shebang.

950
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,397
I get it. You're really
not there even now.

951
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:48,731
That's what I'm saying.

952
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:51,200
I have not made
that much progress.

953
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,769
Did she call?

954
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,771
I have not
looked at my phone.

955
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:58,240
Good.
Don't.

956
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,742
Yeah.

957
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,677
I don't want to.

958
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:10,216
Thank you so much
for tonight.

959
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:13,252
Of course, it was fun.
I had a good time.

960
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:18,223
Do you have
everything you need?

961
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:21,226
- Glass of water, anything?
- No. I'm good.

962
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:23,494
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep.

963
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:25,596
- Where?
- On the couch.

964
00:53:25,598 --> 00:53:27,864
You should
get in here with me.

965
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:30,199
There's plenty of room.
Look.

966
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,367
No, it's all right.

967
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,268
- What's your problem?
- Couch is comfortable

968
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,570
I don't know.
You wanna share the bed?

969
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:39,573
This is stupid.
It'll be fun.

970
00:53:39,575 --> 00:53:41,541
I don't wanna sleep alone.

971
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:43,543
All right.
I'm good with it.

972
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:48,247
I can't really sleep
in these, but...

973
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:50,916
- Can you turn around?
- Are you kidding me?

974
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:55,954
so I just feel a little awkward,
and I don't like these boxers.

975
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,756
But I've seen you
in swimming trunks before.

976
00:53:58,758 --> 00:54:00,457
But I don't like
these boxers.

977
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:01,791
Just...

978
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:04,193
turn around for two seconds!

979
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:05,594
This is ridiculous.

980
00:54:05,596 --> 00:54:07,829
Oh, just shut the fuck up
and turn around.

981
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,630
- One.
- Wait a second.

982
00:54:09,632 --> 00:54:11,531
- Two.
- No, no, I meant...

983
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:14,634
Two and a half.
I saw your boxers!

984
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:16,235
They're horrible, aren't they?

985
00:54:16,237 --> 00:54:18,971
- No, I didn't see them.
- I have no idea.

986
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:20,572
You're shy, huh?

987
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:22,740
I'm a little shy.

988
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:25,576
We've never been
in bed together.

989
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:27,811
- It's the first time.
- Oh, my God!

990
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:31,581
Is this what you do
usually in bed?

991
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,749
Face the person
and talk to them?

992
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:38,419
Yeah. Can we kill the lamp?

993
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,754
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

994
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:42,922
- Sorry. I gotta reach over you.
- So fuckin' rude.

995
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:45,858
I can't believe
I just did that.

996
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,593
Are you tired?

997
00:54:47,595 --> 00:54:50,295
I'm a little tired, but...

998
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:51,863
You wanna talk at all?
I'm not tired at all.

999
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:53,965
A little chitchat?
Yeah, you seem wired up.

1000
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,868
What's up with Theresa?

1001
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,504
I don't know. I'm not really
talking to her right now.

1002
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,240
Huh? Why?

1003
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:06,941
Just haven't.

1004
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,943
Not into her anymore?

1005
00:55:08,945 --> 00:55:11,245
No, I'm into her, I mean...

1006
00:55:14,749 --> 00:55:17,283
I don't know.

1007
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:18,917
I guess I'm into her.
I don't know.

1008
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:24,655
I guess I was kind of like
into her in a way

1009
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:28,425
unconventional
relationship thing.

1010
00:55:28,427 --> 00:55:32,328
Like the open relationship
thing seems interesting to me.

1011
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,596
Yeah, because you're a weirdo.

1012
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,998
Is that really weird?

1013
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,567
I thought it was progressive
and open minded.

1014
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,702
Uh-huh.

1015
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:43,570
I just feel like there's
gotta be something else

1016
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:44,837
that doesn't feel
so oppressive,

1017
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,872
like I'm totally
losing my freedom

1018
00:55:46,874 --> 00:55:50,842
and any sense
of identity I have.

1019
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:53,945
Yeah, but relationships
don't have to be oppressive.

1020
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:56,747
Like it can be
what you want it to be,

1021
00:55:56,749 --> 00:56:00,016
you know,
like with me and Emmy.

1022
00:56:00,018 --> 00:56:02,818
Okay, that's not
the best example right now,

1023
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,389
but still, you make it
what you want it to be,

1024
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:11,526
what suits you and your partner,
do you know what I mean?

1025
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:13,628
You know, if you're
starting to feel,

1026
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,731
if you actually
take it that far,

1027
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:19,900
you can actually just say
to that person,

1028
00:56:19,902 --> 00:56:23,336
"Hey, you know, I need
a little space here."

1029
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,072
I just feel like you never
let it get to that point.

1030
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:27,706
- You know?
- No, you're right.

1031
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,441
You decide that
it's gonna be oppressive

1032
00:56:29,443 --> 00:56:33,311
before you've even
tried it out.

1033
00:56:33,313 --> 00:56:35,880
And I guess I haven't really
been in a situation lately

1034
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:38,349
where I thought that,
you know,

1035
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:42,453
the person was worth like
making the sacrifices for.

1036
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:43,821
Yeah.

1037
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:47,457
Yeah, it's rare.

1038
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:50,626
I don't know.

1039
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:52,661
I'm kinda getting tired.

1040
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:54,929
You wanna go to sleep?

1041
00:56:54,931 --> 00:56:58,599
Yeah.
I'm kinda fading.

1042
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,534
Okay.

1043
00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:06,605
I'll see you
in the morning then.

1044
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:08,607
Thank you for tonight.

1045
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:09,908
Of course.

1046
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:16,113
It's fun here.

1047
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:20,616
Nice to have you.

1048
00:57:20,618 --> 00:57:23,852
It feels like there's
a blanket folded up

1049
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:26,955
inside the pillowcase.

1050
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:29,090
Man pillows.

1051
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:39,499
What?
No.

1052
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,101
No, I'm not doing this
right now.

1053
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:44,536
He's on the couch.
I'm in the bed.

1054
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:47,438
What?

1055
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,039
Yeah.

1056
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,641
Yeah.

1057
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:52,775
You too.

1058
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,413
You okay?

1059
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,483
Yeah, I'm fine.

1060
00:58:07,887 --> 00:58:10,787
What'd she say?

1061
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:12,655
I don't wanna talk about it.

1062
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,165
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1063
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,836
What do you mean,
why am I being so nice to you?

1064
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,271
I care about you,
that's why.

1065
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:42,715
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry.

1066
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,116
It's okay.

1067
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:51,622
It's okay.

1068
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:41,623
Ready.

1069
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,958
Ohh.

1070
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,859
Step.

1071
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:47,760
Chi.

1072
01:00:47,762 --> 01:00:50,763
Ahh.

1073
01:00:50,765 --> 01:00:54,199
Chi.

1074
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:56,334
Ohh.

1075
01:00:56,336 --> 01:01:00,671
Chi.

1076
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,673
Around.

1077
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,808
Hold.

1078
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,109
Chi.

1079
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:08,410
Half step.

1080
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:11,946
Ahh.

1081
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:15,682
Chi.

1082
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:20,052
Ahh.

1083
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:23,722
Haven't seen you in class
in a while.

1084
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:25,757
What?

1085
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:27,959
I'm starting to think the only
reason you come to class

1086
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:30,061
is when you need some weed.

1087
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:34,298
I come for the practice.
The weed is the added bonus.

1088
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,899
You know that.

1089
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:39,268
Namaste, my friend.

1090
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,204
- I'll see ya next week.
- All right.

1091
01:03:57,102 --> 01:03:59,470
Because, Mom,
I have like 80 cousins.

1092
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:02,039
They all eventually get married.
I'm not going to every wedding.

1093
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,174
I'm doing her a favor.

1094
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:06,042
She only invited me
out of obligation.

1095
01:04:06,044 --> 01:04:07,843
You know how expensive it is
per person?

1096
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,478
They're gonna be psyched
that I don't go.

1097
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,115
Because!

1098
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:19,219
All right, Mom, listen, my ear
is killing me from the phone.

1099
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,554
I do have a hands-free device.
I just didn't bring it with me.

1100
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:25,524
I'm going! I have to go.
I love you too.

1101
01:04:25,526 --> 01:04:28,293
Okay, okay,
I'm hanging up now.

1102
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:30,161
All right, I gotta go.

1103
01:04:30,163 --> 01:04:32,830
All right, I'll see you.

1104
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:35,966
Oh, my God, Em!
How are you?

1105
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:37,400
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you!

1106
01:04:37,402 --> 01:04:39,135
How have you been?
Where have you been?

1107
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:42,571
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just been crazy.

1108
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:45,407
She's good, yeah.
What's up with that?

1109
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:48,576
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, a fight?

1110
01:04:48,578 --> 01:04:51,211
Oh, no, no, no.
I've just been crazy.

1111
01:04:51,213 --> 01:04:53,279
How's the documentary?
Are we going to Sundance?

1112
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:56,615
It's kind of my
forever project, you know.

1113
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:59,217
Don't wait too long.
Sorry.

1114
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:01,385
Okay, I better go, but you're
gonna vote tomorrow, right?

1115
01:05:01,387 --> 01:05:06,890
Only for you because I usually
come out for the big ones.

1116
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:09,125
- They're all the big ones!
- I know, I know!

1117
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:10,626
Vote on
the Working Families Party.

1118
01:05:10,628 --> 01:05:13,028
- I will, whatever that means.
- Okay.

1119
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,963
I gotta go.
And come to our night.

1120
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:16,965
We're gonna be at
the Soho House on Crosby.

1121
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:19,200
- Okay, I'll try, yeah.
- Hopefully a celebration,

1122
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:24,071
- Carla wants to see you.
- Okay. Tell her I said hi.

1123
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:25,505
- Okay, bye.
- All right.

1124
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:43,488
Hey. Hey, it's me.

1125
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,391
Hello!

1126
01:05:47,393 --> 01:05:49,159
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad to be...

1127
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:50,260
Hi.

1128
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:52,395
...here with all you guys.

1129
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:54,563
- What's happening?
- You guys know each other?

1130
01:05:54,565 --> 01:05:57,032
Yes. Yeah, how are you?

1131
01:05:57,034 --> 01:05:58,466
- From dance class.
- Oh, yeah.

1132
01:05:58,468 --> 01:06:01,101
- Yeah, how's it going?
- Good, good.

1133
01:06:01,103 --> 01:06:03,136
What are you kids up to?

1134
01:06:03,138 --> 01:06:06,172
- Just being.
- Yeah.

1135
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:07,940
Just being. Nice.
That's nice.

1136
01:06:07,942 --> 01:06:09,508
It is nice.

1137
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,910
It feels you guys
are just being in here.

1138
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:14,479
- We missed you at class today.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1139
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:17,482
- 'Cause I couldn't make it.
- It was amazing.

1140
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:20,451
Yeah, it always is with
this guy. He's awesome.

1141
01:06:20,453 --> 01:06:21,518
I love your class.

1142
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,421
This is really great.
You guys should know each other

1143
01:06:25,423 --> 01:06:30,459
Yeah, I feel like
there's a good thing, yeah.

1144
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:31,993
- All good.
- It's all good.

1145
01:06:31,995 --> 01:06:33,928
It's all love.

1146
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,929
It is?

1147
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:36,697
Sit, Danny, sit.

1148
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:40,534
Oh, no, I was just on my way
around the block,

1149
01:06:40,536 --> 01:06:42,402
and I thought of you,

1150
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:45,071
and I didn't know
this was happening,

1151
01:06:45,073 --> 01:06:46,405
so you guys should
just do your thing.

1152
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:49,207
- It's not our thing.
- No.

1153
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,042
It's <i>our</i> thing.

1154
01:06:51,044 --> 01:06:52,977
- Yeah, you're included.
- I'm included?

1155
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:54,545
- You are.
- Sure.

1156
01:06:54,547 --> 01:06:56,246
That's so nice.

1157
01:06:56,248 --> 01:06:58,281
What am I included in,
exactly?

1158
01:06:58,283 --> 01:07:00,216
- Not sure what's going on.
- In the love.

1159
01:07:00,218 --> 01:07:02,985
I don't know if I'm in the
same vibe as you guys, though.

1160
01:07:02,987 --> 01:07:04,419
- That's okay.
- Well, get into it.

1161
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,421
Come on, sit down.

1162
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,156
No, I really don't
wanna sit right now.

1163
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,257
I'm kinda amped up, so...

1164
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:14,128
You don't have to do the
whole alpha dog thing here.

1165
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:18,966
It's not like I'm gonna
steal her away from you.

1166
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,369
She's not mine to steal.
We're just friends.

1167
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,037
I just have some stuff
going on.

1168
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,171
I'm good, I'm good.

1169
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:26,572
- Hey.
- What?

1170
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:29,207
Can I just hug you?

1171
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:31,442
I really don't want a hug
right now, all right?

1172
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:33,377
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1173
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:36,279
Maybe we'll talk later
or something, but you know...

1174
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:38,147
Have a good day, dude.

1175
01:07:38,149 --> 01:07:40,182
Okay, take it easy, guy.

1176
01:07:40,184 --> 01:07:42,484
Take it easy, guy.

1177
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,586
That's awesome.
This guy's awesome.

1178
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:46,287
- He is awesome.
- He is, yeah.

1179
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:48,122
Is this like for real?

1180
01:07:48,124 --> 01:07:50,357
Or is this just like
an act you put on or like...

1181
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:52,726
What's going on?

1182
01:07:52,728 --> 01:07:55,261
I don't really
understand the question.

1183
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:59,765
you got your shirt off
in November, like, all love,

1184
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:01,666
is that really who you are?

1185
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:03,200
What's happening?

1186
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:07,537
No. Don't put a shirt on.
Just be whoever you are.

1187
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:13,009
Do you really believe
all that shit, man?

1188
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:17,213
Like the shit you teach
and all that, you know.

1189
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:19,381
It's not a matter of belief.

1190
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:21,683
It's a matter of knowing.

1191
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:29,257
I hear you, and you're right.
Your truth is not my truth.

1192
01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:31,626
Totally, yeah, thank God.

1193
01:08:31,628 --> 01:08:33,461
I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna go.

1194
01:08:33,463 --> 01:08:34,762
Don't.
Nothing's happening,

1195
01:08:34,764 --> 01:08:36,797
We had an amazing class,

1196
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,565
and then Jarrod wanted
to borrow a book,

1197
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:40,767
so that's all
that's going on.

1198
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:43,269
That's nice, yeah.
What book?

1199
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:45,337
- Good book?
- Yeah.

1200
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:49,307
- He looks like a big reader.
- What's up?

1201
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:51,676
Nothing's up! I just thought
we were gonna hang out like--

1202
01:08:51,678 --> 01:08:54,679
and you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

1203
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:57,581
I didn't realize
what I was coming into.

1204
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:01,518
and I want you
to be able to let that go.

1205
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,720
No, I just wanna
let you guys just be

1206
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,388
'cause that's
what you're doing.

1207
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,256
Hang on, take a step back.

1208
01:09:07,258 --> 01:09:09,524
Look at this fucking guy.

1209
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:12,493
I think we should
just ask ourselves

1210
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:15,796
What do you mean,
what's really happening?

1211
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:17,264
You want me to tell you
what's really happening?

1212
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:19,499
- Yeah.
- You're here,

1213
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:21,267
you got the no shirt on
in November,

1214
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:24,069
she's a fuckin' beautiful woman,
and you wanna fuck her,

1215
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:26,304
but you're using
the spiritual thing as like...

1216
01:09:26,306 --> 01:09:28,472
- Hey, hey.
- No, I'm just saying.

1217
01:09:28,474 --> 01:09:30,607
He said he wants to be real
like I'm being real.

1218
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:32,342
But you're not gonna
admit that.

1219
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:33,810
You're gonna say,
"It's all love,

1220
01:09:33,812 --> 01:09:35,444
and it's about
the connection, man."

1221
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:37,446
Okay, look,
you don't know me, man.

1222
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:41,817
Sex is one emotion
on a much larger compass.

1223
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,753
Do you have like spiritual
Tourette's or something?

1224
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:48,355
What are these platitudes?

1225
01:09:48,357 --> 01:09:49,689
I'm gonna go.
This is so weird.

1226
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,158
I feel like
really weird right now.

1227
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,527
- Don't go like this, Danny.
- We'll talk later.

1228
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:56,729
You should have told me
you had shit going on.

1229
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:58,864
- No, no, no.
- Danny, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1230
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:02,868
Don't walk out with this,
this anger on you.

1231
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,805
Can you just adjust your
expectation and be with us?

1232
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:09,541
I feel like I'm doing that
all the time when I'm with you.

1233
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:13,344
that we were gonna just have
a one-on-one thing,

1234
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:15,579
and there's sometimes
always a party here,

1235
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:18,248
and I just wasn't ready for it,
you know what I mean?

1236
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,315
Okay.

1237
01:10:19,317 --> 01:10:21,350
And I love who you are,

1238
01:10:21,352 --> 01:10:23,485
and I want you
to be who you are,

1239
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,688
but it's just hard
for me sometimes

1240
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,157
'cause I wanna have you in a way
that I know I can't have you.

1241
01:10:33,695 --> 01:10:37,397
But you're great,
and I'm grateful for you.

1242
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,465
So I just need to go
right now.

1243
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:40,899
- Okay.
- All right?

1244
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:42,300
All right.

1245
01:10:44,403 --> 01:10:46,871
- Bye.
- Bye.

1246
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,807
Be well.

1247
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,552
<i>Do you ever have times</i>

1248
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:05,988
<i>where you do feel</i>
<i>jealous or angry?</i>

1249
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,956
<i>Yeah, I feel</i>
<i>those things,</i>

1250
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,691
<i>but I know that</i>
<i>they're not real</i>

1251
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:11,993
<i>and that you...</i>

1252
01:11:11,995 --> 01:11:14,862
<i>They're just,</i>
<i>they're just ego,</i>

1253
01:11:14,864 --> 01:11:18,265
<i>and you have to...</i>

1254
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:21,034
<i>breathe and come back</i>
<i>to yourself.</i>

1255
01:11:58,668 --> 01:12:01,002
Oh, I'll be right back.

1256
01:12:01,004 --> 01:12:03,637
If you were smart,
you'd use Grand Marnier.

1257
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:05,572
- Hi!
- How are you?

1258
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:07,874
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

1259
01:12:07,876 --> 01:12:10,743
Thank you.
Come meet these guys.

1260
01:12:10,745 --> 01:12:12,745
This is Danny.

1261
01:12:12,747 --> 01:12:14,680
I want to introduce you
to Danny.

1262
01:12:14,682 --> 01:12:16,581
Oh, good to see you!
What's going on?

1263
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,316
Nice to see you.
Congratulations.

1264
01:12:19,951 --> 01:12:22,719
We're just discussing really
important political matters here

1265
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:24,887
like how to make
a good margarita.

1266
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:26,722
That's important.

1267
01:12:26,724 --> 01:12:30,392
That's how we're
gonna win this thing!

1268
01:12:30,394 --> 01:12:31,993
Guys, I'm gonna
check in with you later.

1269
01:12:31,995 --> 01:12:33,794
I'm gonna show
this gentleman around.

1270
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,829
Of course.

1271
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:38,531
Good to meet you guys.
Nice to meet you.

1272
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:40,699
All right.
Have a good time.

1273
01:12:42,968 --> 01:12:46,670
Yeah.
That guy's a real asshole.

1274
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:48,405
Sit over there.
I'll come find you guys later.

1275
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:50,340
- Oh, right.
- His way.

1276
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:51,774
No, that's all
it comes from.

1277
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:55,811
What are you doing here?
You wanna sit down?

1278
01:12:55,813 --> 01:12:59,548
It's good to see you.
How are you?

1279
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,384
I'm gonna take my coat off,
all right?

1280
01:13:02,386 --> 01:13:04,386
Can I have a sip
of your beer?

1281
01:13:04,388 --> 01:13:05,920
Yeah, of course.

1282
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:13,059
How you doin'?

1283
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:14,660
Good.

1284
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:18,430
It's been a while.

1285
01:13:18,432 --> 01:13:19,497
Are you drunk?

1286
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:20,965
I miss you, Danny.

1287
01:13:22,434 --> 01:13:24,701
It's so good of you to come.

1288
01:13:24,703 --> 01:13:28,638
I mean not yeah.
You know what I mean.

1289
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,939
Shut up!

1290
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,975
No, no, I'm not drunk.

1291
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:37,111
It's a good party.

1292
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,946
It is!

1293
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:42,516
It's a dumb party,
but it's fun.

1294
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,019
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1295
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,388
I love this fucking song.
Will you dance?

1296
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,856
You're gonna dance with me.

1297
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,891
You're gonna dance with me
right now!

1298
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:54,927
I just got here.
Let me have a little drink.

1299
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,729
Okay. Drink that
in the next five seconds.

1300
01:13:57,731 --> 01:14:00,531
I don't wanna dance just yet.
We have to dance right now?

1301
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:02,533
Yes, come on.

1302
01:14:02,535 --> 01:14:04,401
All right, fine.

1303
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:13,500
It's all about grass roots.

1304
01:15:13,502 --> 01:15:14,601
And tonight you saw that.

1305
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,173
'Cause it's all about people,

1306
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:21,974
it's all about
every one of you,

1307
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,742
Democrats, Republicans,
inclusive.

1308
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:40,122
Hey.

1309
01:15:41,524 --> 01:15:43,591
Hey.

1310
01:15:43,593 --> 01:15:45,726
What're you doin' in here
all alone?

1311
01:15:47,228 --> 01:15:49,829
That's how I like it,
I guess.

1312
01:15:49,831 --> 01:15:51,130
Too bad.

1313
01:15:52,832 --> 01:15:54,098
I wanna come bug you.

1314
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:58,135
- I thought you'd left.
- Nope.

1315
01:16:05,943 --> 01:16:08,544
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

1316
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:16,518
It's weird. I feel like
nobody sees me like you do.

1317
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,987
It's true. I just think
these last couple months,

1318
01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:22,090
like I've just felt like...

1319
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:24,958
invisible or somethin'
from not seeing you.

1320
01:16:27,528 --> 01:16:29,795
I know.

1321
01:16:29,797 --> 01:16:31,530
Me too.

1322
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:41,172
So what happened?

1323
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:42,907
What do you mean?

1324
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:44,541
Like after that night.

1325
01:16:44,543 --> 01:16:46,943
- Oh, that.
- Yeah.

1326
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:55,751
Sorry. I don't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

1327
01:16:55,753 --> 01:16:57,652
No, no, I wanna...

1328
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,320
I just can't be fake
with you, you know?

1329
01:16:59,322 --> 01:17:02,022
It's just impossible.

1330
01:17:02,024 --> 01:17:03,256
I know.

1331
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,627
I don't know
what happened, Danny.

1332
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:10,129
I guess I just...

1333
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:12,197
freaked out.

1334
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:16,668
You freaked out?
Wow. The tables turned.

1335
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,336
I don't know.
I didn't wanna lose you and...

1336
01:17:21,872 --> 01:17:24,573
I just couldn't deal.

1337
01:17:24,575 --> 01:17:27,642
Welcome to my world.

1338
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,243
Yeah, I guess we both
couldn't deal.

1339
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:32,179
Yeah. I've been not dealing
my entire life.

1340
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:36,349
I'm so tired of it.
I just wanna deal for once.

1341
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,150
See how the other half lives,
you know?

1342
01:17:41,287 --> 01:17:43,121
What?

1343
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:45,022
What's goin' on?

1344
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:46,690
I don't know. It's dumb.

1345
01:17:46,692 --> 01:17:50,660
Well, you do too.
I'm just not saying it.

1346
01:17:50,662 --> 01:17:53,929
Like you want me
to really say it?

1347
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:58,233
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1348
01:17:58,235 --> 01:18:01,336
I wanna kiss you right now,
okay? That's the truth.

1349
01:18:01,338 --> 01:18:03,338
And I feel like
that's all I ever do

1350
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,206
is like I have to pretend
that I don't wanna kiss you

1351
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:07,641
every time I'm with you.

1352
01:18:07,643 --> 01:18:09,242
And I get to like
hang out with you and Emmy

1353
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:12,044
and have dinner
and come party here,

1354
01:18:12,046 --> 01:18:17,015
and it's just...
I'm just tired of it.

1355
01:18:17,017 --> 01:18:20,118
I like you, you know?
And I like being around you.

1356
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,755
I'm just waiting, you know,
for them to leave

1357
01:18:24,757 --> 01:18:26,123
so I can be alone again,

1358
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:29,659
and I never feel that
with you.

1359
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:31,193
Shut up.

1360
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:32,928
No.

1361
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,631
I love you like this.

1362
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:37,732
You do?

1363
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:48,775
- Danny, Danny, stop.
- What?

1364
01:18:48,777 --> 01:18:50,309
- We can't.
- Yes, we can.

1365
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:52,344
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

1366
01:18:52,346 --> 01:18:54,813
There are people involved.
What are you doing?

1367
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,948
- I'm trying to shut you up.

1368
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,116
- Danny.
- What?

1369
01:18:59,118 --> 01:19:00,283
What?

1370
01:19:28,044 --> 01:19:29,911
Danny.

1371
01:19:29,913 --> 01:19:32,847
- What?
- Danny, don't do this.

1372
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,917
What? This is me dealing.

1373
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:38,318
You're happy.

1374
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,389
That's not what you were that
night with me, that's for sure.

1375
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:47,125
Look, we were--
Emmy and I were fighting,

1376
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:49,093
I was upset.
You can't just use that.

1377
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:54,731
I felt it, okay?
And I felt it from you.

1378
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:57,300
Tell me you're happy.

1379
01:19:57,302 --> 01:20:00,903
Fuck you!
Who do you think you are?

1380
01:20:00,905 --> 01:20:03,205
I'm not gonna prove myself
to you, okay?

1381
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:05,774
Tell me you love her.

1382
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:11,979
Hi, you guys!

1383
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:13,280
Hey!

1384
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:16,115
Whoa.

1385
01:20:16,117 --> 01:20:18,383
- What's goin' on here?
- What are you talking about?

1386
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,785
- Am I interrupting, huh?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1387
01:20:20,787 --> 01:20:22,386
I gotta go, actually,
but this was a great night.

1388
01:20:22,388 --> 01:20:25,422
- Oh, my God.
- I had a great time.

1389
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:27,891
Wait a minute.
You stay here for a second.

1390
01:20:27,893 --> 01:20:31,728
You guys do me a favor.
I just want you to make out.

1391
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:35,198
Because this weird
sexual tension between you guys

1392
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,465
is driving me insane.

1393
01:20:36,467 --> 01:20:38,867
And if you just make out once,

1394
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:40,935
you'll see that
there's nothing to it,

1395
01:20:40,937 --> 01:20:43,370
and it'll be gone.

1396
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:45,138
- Uh, no.
- Yeah. Please?

1397
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,506
- No. For me.
- No thanks.

1398
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,274
Come on, one little kiss.

1399
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,575
I don't think
she's gonna leave us alone.

1400
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:51,209
Come on, it's my big night.

1401
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:53,578
We'll just give her
one little kiss.

1402
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:56,614
- That's all she wants, right?
- There you go.

1403
01:20:56,616 --> 01:20:58,515
That's it.
That's fine, right?

1404
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:02,218
See? Nothing.
She's right.

1405
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,053
I gotta go.
I'll see you. Have a--

1406
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:05,888
Congratulations again.

1407
01:21:08,157 --> 01:21:10,091
What the fuck was that?

1408
01:21:12,427 --> 01:21:14,895
What the hell's going on?

1409
01:21:23,102 --> 01:21:25,503
I'm not bullying you!
I'm asking you a question!

1410
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:28,138
Okay, so I don't get
to ask you any questions,

1411
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,073
even though you were crying
and you were back here

1412
01:21:30,075 --> 01:21:32,075
instead of being out there
with me on my big night.

1413
01:21:32,077 --> 01:21:36,145
You didn't even know
I was gone.

1414
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:38,380
Oh, give me a break.

1415
01:21:38,382 --> 01:21:40,448
Now you're gonna be a crybaby,

1416
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,450
that I wasn't paying
enough attention to you?

1417
01:21:42,452 --> 01:21:45,986
Do you know what I've
been doing all night?

1418
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:48,455
- Come here.
- I'm gonna go.

1419
01:21:48,457 --> 01:21:49,889
- Oh, come on.
- No, no.

1420
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:51,657
Oh, come on!

1421
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:53,158
Carla.

1422
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:57,027
Come on!

1423
01:21:57,029 --> 01:21:59,496
- Come on, Carla.
- Let go.

1424
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:03,967
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
You stay. You enjoy this.

1425
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:08,171
No, I'm not gonna stay.
You're just gonna leave like...

1426
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,107
What is going on?

1427
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:13,042
I don't know what else
to say to you.

1428
01:22:13,044 --> 01:22:14,576
I'm done.

1429
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:29,323
<i>We all have impulses</i>
<i>and feelings,</i>

1430
01:22:29,325 --> 01:22:31,625
<i>but you can't act on it</i>
<i> just whenever you feel it.</i>

1431
01:22:31,627 --> 01:22:34,060
<i>I always feel kinda like</i>
<i>invisible in the world.</i>

1432
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:37,363
<i>Do you want something</i>
<i>that's extraordinary</i>

1433
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:41,367
<i>or something that's like</i>

1434
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:45,304
<i>Right, 'cause being</i>
<i>alone's not even an option.</i>

1435
01:22:45,306 --> 01:22:47,606
<i>That sounds excruciating.</i>

1436
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,593
Just stick with us.

1437
01:25:30,595 --> 01:25:32,861
Stick with us.

1438
01:25:32,863 --> 01:25:36,264
- Did you pack the charger?
- The charger?

1439
01:25:36,266 --> 01:25:37,698
- The charger.
- Phone charger?

1440
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,833
- Yes.
- I don't have a charger.

1441
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,568
- You had the charger.
- What do you mean?

1442
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,436
You said you were
going to pack it!

1443
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,737
No, you said you were.

1444
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:47,106
Grace, stay away
from the railing.

1445
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,408
I said I was gonna
pack the charger?

1446
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,611
Oh, I'm the charger man.
I see.

1447
01:25:57,149 --> 01:25:58,449
What's goin' on?

1448
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,650
Nothing.

1449
01:26:15,533 --> 01:26:18,334
Wanna hear something?

1450
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:19,835
What?

1451
01:26:19,837 --> 01:26:21,670
I'm a dancer.

1452
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:23,204
You're a dancer?

1453
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:24,705
Yeah.

1454
01:26:24,707 --> 01:26:27,240
What kinda dancer are you?

1455
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:29,208
Jump, jump.

1456
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:30,842
- Wow. That's pretty good.
- Twirl.

1457
01:26:30,844 --> 01:26:33,878
Oh, she's just teaching me
a little dance move.

1458
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,280
Shh! Don't pay attention
to them.

1459
01:26:36,282 --> 01:26:38,715
- Are those your parents?
- No.

1460
01:26:38,717 --> 01:26:41,718
No, 'cause they're not
dancers like us.

1461
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,219
They're not dancers like us?

1462
01:26:43,221 --> 01:26:47,156
How do you know I can dance?
I'm not that good.

1463
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:49,224
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1464
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:51,793
Because you are.
I know that.

1465
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,427
- You know it?
- Yeah.

1466
01:26:53,429 --> 01:26:54,428
Oh.

1467
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:57,431
What? Ready?
Here I go.

1468
01:27:05,406 --> 01:27:06,773
Twirl.

1469
01:27:06,775 --> 01:27:10,443
Jump, jump and up.

1470
01:27:21,187 --> 01:27:22,687
I told you a hundred times
to pack the charger!

1471
01:27:26,925 --> 01:27:28,825
Now you twirl me.

1472
01:27:30,527 --> 01:27:33,729
I am not responsible
for the charger.

1473
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:42,269
It's gonna be
down the hall to your left.

1474
01:27:42,271 --> 01:27:44,604
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1475
01:27:48,943 --> 01:27:53,312
Thank you. We're gonna have
a Q&A with the director.

1476
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:56,348
Please stick around
as I introduce Daniel Sullivan.

1477
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,850
Um...

1478
01:27:58,852 --> 01:28:02,220
I don't know. I mean,
I like movies that just end.

1479
01:28:02,222 --> 01:28:03,988
You know, I never buy it
when they're like

1480
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:06,790
tying it all up in a bow
at the end, you know?

1481
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:09,492
Yeah, but there has to be
some sort of conclusion.

1482
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:11,627
Does there? I don't know. Why?
Why can't it just end?

1483
01:28:11,629 --> 01:28:13,428
Because as an audience,

1484
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,296
there has to be a reason
we're watching.

1485
01:28:15,298 --> 01:28:18,565
because you're engaged
by what's going on

1486
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:21,301
and you're interested
in the characters and...

1487
01:28:21,303 --> 01:28:23,403
Yeah, but there has to be
a journey to follow.

1488
01:28:23,405 --> 01:28:25,571
That's not my favorite word
"journey,"

1489
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:27,906
but I mean, everything's
a journey, isn't it?

1490
01:28:27,908 --> 01:28:30,008
I mean, this conversation,
for example,

1491
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:34,412
But we have to take something
from any piece of art.

1492
01:28:34,414 --> 01:28:38,716
But what does that have
to do with endings, really?

1493
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:40,517
You can't just
stop things happening

1494
01:28:40,519 --> 01:28:43,920
But I think you can.
That's what an ending is.

1495
01:28:43,922 --> 01:28:46,989
then all of a sudden
there is a journey,

1496
01:28:46,991 --> 01:28:49,691
I think you're taking this
the wrong way.

1497
01:28:49,693 --> 01:28:53,695
but I felt like I was
missing something,

1498
01:28:53,697 --> 01:28:57,999
Right, but for me
I take that as a compliment

1499
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,401
because I think
that life is unfinished,

1500
01:29:00,403 --> 01:29:02,870
and I think that art and film
should reflect that.

1501
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:07,407
I think that, you know,
there are structures to a movie

1502
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:10,610
but now even
in small independent

1503
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:13,346
and, you know,
documentaries like this,

1504
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,282
you have to fulfill
this preconceived idea

1505
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:19,818
and if you don't hit
all these points,

1506
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:21,719
somehow the audience thinks
there's something missing

1507
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:26,523
and in that constantly
looking for what's missing,

1508
01:29:26,525 --> 01:29:28,558
we're not seeing what's there.

1509
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,360
And, I mean,
for me personally,

1510
01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:34,663
it's really in the looking
that we are missing.

1511
01:29:36,565 --> 01:29:39,733
I mean, that's just sort of
my personal thing on endings.

1512
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:42,068
I don't know if that
answered your question, but...

1513
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:45,604
It's an interesting
discussion anyway.

1514
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:48,873
Um, I think we have time for
one more. One more question?

1515
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:51,742
Yeah, I could totally fall
in love with the process.

1516
01:29:51,744 --> 01:29:54,044
But that was probably
I was in love with the film.

1517
01:29:54,046 --> 01:29:56,046
- Hi. Thank you for you coming.
- Thank you.

1518
01:29:56,048 --> 01:29:57,947
Yeah, have a good night.

1519
01:29:57,949 --> 01:30:00,482
I, uh...

1520
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:02,550
Yeah, I loved everything
about it.

1521
01:30:02,552 --> 01:30:06,320
Um, it was great.
It was a really great process.

1522
01:30:06,322 --> 01:30:08,322
Thank you, guys, so much
for coming.

1523
01:30:08,324 --> 01:30:10,857
It was nice
to meet you all, yeah.

1524
01:30:10,859 --> 01:30:12,925
We'll see you later on, okay?

1525
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:16,427
What are you doing here?

1526
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:19,430
I come to this festival
every year.

1527
01:30:19,432 --> 01:30:21,398
You do not.

1528
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:25,935
Oh, my God.
It's so nice to see you.

1529
01:30:25,937 --> 01:30:27,836
Hi.

1530
01:30:27,838 --> 01:30:29,971
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1531
01:30:29,973 --> 01:30:31,472
I can't believe you're here.
It's so wild.

1532
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:33,407
- I loved it so much.
- You did?

1533
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:34,975
- Yeah, I was really...
- Are you just saying that?

1534
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:38,511
Yeah. Isn't that
what I'm supposed to do?

1535
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:40,479
- No, I really loved it.
- You did.

1536
01:30:40,481 --> 01:30:42,914
- Yeah, I was so moved.
- I'm glad you saw it.

1537
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,649
Where were you sitting?
I didn't even see you.

1538
01:30:44,651 --> 01:30:46,784
I was hiding.
I was in the back.

1539
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:48,118
- You hid?
- Mm-hmm.

1540
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,053
But you have bad vision.

1541
01:30:50,055 --> 01:30:52,922
That's true.
I didn't have my glasses on.

1542
01:30:52,924 --> 01:30:55,557
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- Thank you.

1543
01:30:55,559 --> 01:30:57,058
And it's impressive
that you actually finished it

1544
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,760
after all these years.

1545
01:30:59,762 --> 01:31:01,661
I mean, well,
apparently I didn't finish it,

1546
01:31:01,663 --> 01:31:03,029
according to some people.

1547
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:04,964
That guy was such a douchebag.

1548
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:07,633
No, really,
there's one at every Q&A,

1549
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:10,102
and they're always
some frustrated filmmaker.

1550
01:31:10,104 --> 01:31:13,371
There's always one at every Q&A,
and you can tell.

1551
01:31:13,373 --> 01:31:14,638
Now that I think of it,
that's who that guy was.

1552
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,406
Yeah, that's who he was.

1553
01:31:16,408 --> 01:31:19,575
But I liked what you said.

1554
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:23,045
"It's in that looking
that we are missing."

1555
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:25,714
- You liked that one?
- Yeah.

1556
01:31:25,716 --> 01:31:27,949
I thought it was maybe
a little pretentious or--

1557
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:31,819
It was totally pretentious,
but he deserved it.

1558
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:34,054
It's so good to see you.
You look great.

1559
01:31:34,056 --> 01:31:36,956
- I do?
- Yeah.

1560
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,025
- Do you wanna...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1561
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:40,726
You walking out?
Let me grab my coat.

1562
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:49,767
I can't believe you're here.
It's so crazy.

1563
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:52,970
Where are you staying?

1564
01:31:52,972 --> 01:31:56,206
I don't know.
Just got into town.

1565
01:32:01,078 --> 01:32:04,180
Well, what are you doing
right now?

1566
01:32:04,182 --> 01:32:07,149
Um... I'm free.

1567
01:32:07,151 --> 01:32:08,884
Really?
You're free?

1568
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:10,585
- I'm so lucky.
- I'm available.

1569
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:13,020
You're available.

1570
01:32:13,022 --> 01:32:14,788
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

1571
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:17,290
Yeah, but I have something
kind of serious news.

1572
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:18,257
What?

1573
01:32:20,627 --> 01:32:21,793
I quit coffee.

1574
01:32:21,795 --> 01:32:23,694
Get out of here.

1575
01:32:23,696 --> 01:32:26,163
You quit coffee?

1576
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:28,532
Of all the people
in the world.

1577
01:32:28,534 --> 01:32:29,833
Yeah.

1578
01:32:32,237 --> 01:32:34,070
Who <i>are</i> you?
