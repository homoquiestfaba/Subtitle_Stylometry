00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,631
A great civilization is not
conquered from without until It has
destroyed itself from within W. DURANT

2
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,991
the heart...

3
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,754
...for smoke frog.

4
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,434
Thank you

5
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,990
this liver for curl nose.

6
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,273
Thank you

7
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,634
cocoa leat...

8
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,428
...the ears. Thank you

9
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,394
and for you blunted...

10
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,394
...the balls

11
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,192
not this again

12
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,192
i'm helping you then you
eat them!

13
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,312
I don't need them. Neither
do the rest of the fellows

14
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,192
do you fellows? No.

15
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,992
Of course not! Sometimes!

16
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,958
What do you think? No!

17
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,632
No, no!

18
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,911
But how many times does it take?

19
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,508
I have eight older sisters
and one brother

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,877
father took tapir balls all
ten times

21
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,151
shall I tell him?

22
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,508
I'm sorry. The balls are useless

23
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,398
you've never had them? Couldn't
tell you what they taste like.

24
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,314
None ofyou?

25
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,314
No, but it's
been fun watching you...

26
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,314
this was your idea!

27
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,634
Get him off me!

28
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,314
Calm down!

29
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,274
Why do you let them treat
you like this?

30
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,592
Be strong

31
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,274
where is your pride?

32
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,274
It all works... yes?

33
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,274
Yes...

34
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,994
i just can't make children.

35
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,268
There is something
I will tell you...

36
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,988
...but I warn you, it's
very powerful

37
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,550
what do you speak of?

38
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,268
The soanzo leaf

39
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,552
the soanzo leaf?

40
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,268
From the great marshes
in the south...

41
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,234
this is what gave me my
ten children

42
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,234
no! No! Wait...

43
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,234
you have to rub them on...
down there

44
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,234
just before you next try

45
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,228
apply it generously...

46
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,228
i don't know how to thank you.

47
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,228
If this works... maybe she'll
stop bothering me

48
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,512
your wife?

49
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,512
No, her mother

50
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,194
the old hag wants grandchildren

51
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,512
give me some meat

52
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,512
here, work on this...

53
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,194
...pure meat...

54
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,194
ball breath

55
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,114
what do you want?

56
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,114
What do you want?

57
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,074
I am flint sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age

58
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,068
my father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

59
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,352
Jaguar paw. My son

60
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,068
he hunts this forest with me

61
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,068
he will hunt it with his
son after I am gone

62
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,352
a good catch/

63
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,034
good waters here

64
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,028
the forest gives much here

65
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,312
we ask only to pass through

66
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,028
pass.

67
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,994
Keep safe as you pass.

68
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,994
Let's go.

69
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,954
Our lands were ravaged.

70
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,954
We seek a new beginning.

71
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,954
Your lands were ravaged?

72
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,954
Yes...

73
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,954
we seek a new beginning...

74
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,948
be still my son!

75
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,948
Be still

76
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,948
back to the village

77
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,908
i ask you not to speak of what
you saw in the forest today

78
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,908
you are troubled

79
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,908
yes. I am

80
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,874
those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

81
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,874
I do not understand.

82
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,874
Fear

83
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,868
deep rotting fear.

84
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,868
They were infected by it.

85
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,152
Did you see?

86
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,868
Fear is a sickness

87
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,834
it will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it

88
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,834
it has tainted your peace already.

89
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,834
I did not raise you to see
you live with fear

90
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,152
strike it fromyour heart

91
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,152
do not bring it into our
village.

92
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,834
At first light we will gather
with the elder...

93
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,828
...at the sacred hill
of our fathers

94
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,828
there we will call on
their spirits to guide us

95
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,794
oh here he is!

96
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,794
The big lump!

97
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,112
He's useless.

98
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,112
He can't do it.

99
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,794
You! Yes you!

100
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,794
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us

101
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,794
get inside!

102
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,072
Damn you! Get in there!

103
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,072
Old woman, please

104
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,788
move it!

105
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,788
You don't work!

106
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,788
What are you laughing about!

107
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,754
Give me a grandchild or
I will have you replaced

108
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,754
mother, that's enough

109
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,754
do not come out until
you make a child

110
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,754
two would be better what?

111
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,748
Twins you oaf

112
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,032
mother

113
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,748
can you go away? He says he can't
with you sitting there

114
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,032
just get busy

115
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,714
mom...

116
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,714
she's gone

117
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,674
mother, what do you say we should
have ate the feast tonight?

118
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,992
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

119
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,992
I say boy! Rosted!

120
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,674
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh

121
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,958
no dad! No! It's me!
It's me!

122
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,674
I'll just hang the boy here in case
we change our minds

123
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,952
wait...

124
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,668
that's our turtles run.
That's our eldest

125
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,952
yes it's me it's your eldest!

126
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,668
In that case a crush for
my eldest...

127
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,634
...and a crush for my youngest.

128
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,634
Tapir it is.

129
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,870
One day, old man!

130
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,588
One day you won't be
able to run anymore!

131
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,554
And a man sat alone

132
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,554
drenched deep in sadness.

133
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,554
And all the animals drew near
to him and said:

134
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,554
We do not like to see you so sad...

135
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,548
ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it.

136
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,548
The man said I want to have
good sight.

137
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,548
The vulture replied: You
shall have mine

138
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,514
the man said: I want to be
strong

139
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,514
the jaguar said:

140
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,514
You shall be strong like me

141
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,514
then the man said I long to
know the secrets of the earth

142
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,514
the serpent replied: I will
show them to you

143
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,508
and so it went with all the animals

144
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,508
and when the man had all the gifts
that they could give...

145
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,792
...he left

146
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,508
then the owl said to the other
animals:

147
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,474
Now the man knows much and is able
to do many things...

148
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,474
suddenly I am afraid.

149
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,474
The deer said: The man has
all that he needs.

150
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,792
Now his sadness will stop

151
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,474
but the owl replied: No

152
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,474
i saw a hole in the man...

153
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,468
deep like a hunger he will
never fill...

154
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,468
it is what makes him sad
and what makes him want

155
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,468
he will go on taking and
taking...

156
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,434
until one day the world
will say:

157
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,434
I am no more and I have
nothing left to give

158
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,394
come back to me...

159
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,394
come back to me

160
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,354
my son is dancing

161
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,354
your son is happy

162
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,314
what do you want?

163
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,308
Run!

164
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,274
Now thatyou're up,
can you please kill that dog?

165
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,268
The dog

166
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,188
get up. Get up. Now

167
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,392

168
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,108
run do not look back

169
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,392

170
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,392

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,028

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,788
that's enough!

189
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,754
Stand him up

190
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,754
move away

191
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,748
my son

192
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,714
don't be afraid

193
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,674
almost...

194
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,668
...that's your name

195
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,668
"almost"

196
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,954
our life is over

197
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,634
shame...

198
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,628
shame!

199
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,988
Cowards!

200
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,711
Let's move!

201
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,678
We move out now

202
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,314
they are back

203
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,274
get up!

204
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,274
Heave!

205
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,468
Cut rock, you forgot to duck

206
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,228
hold still

207
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,194
can you see?

208
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,550
Yes

209
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,234
get back to your line

210
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,108
come with us...

211
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,148
get up

212
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,194
leave him alone, almost

213
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,315
I said get up

214
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,392
up, up...

215
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,074
...that's it.

216
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,434
Let's go

217
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,794
this man is a good friend
ofyours...

218
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,434
don't worry...

219
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,314
I'll take care of them

220
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,314
they are mine now

221
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,828
gentle ixchel, tender mother
of mercy

222
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,348
keep them from harm, please,
keep them

223
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,988
one more

224
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,674
ready?

225
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,908
Hold on! Hold on!

226
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,348
Wait...

227
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,988
...let's see what happens

228
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,874
that's it!

229
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,873
Hurry!

230
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,314
Pull! Be strong!

231
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,868
Yes! You did it

232
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,554
good work

233
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,834
can you breathe? ...good

234
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,794
wait here

235
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,788
what's become of my capture?

236
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,072
Dead weight

237
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,754
he nearly took the rest with him

238
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,754
I let him go

239
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,674
you, let him go?

240
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,198
Shall we now do whatyou want?

241
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,748
Let us try that

242
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,714
don't let any others go

243
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,708
let's move

244
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,708
get up almost

245
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,674
we don't want to
lose you justyet

246
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,634
stand up, boy

247
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,952
you proved yourself today, my son

248
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,628
you're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us

249
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,108
thank you father

250
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,112
take it...

251
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,074
...it's yours

252
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,194
it has taken many lives

253
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,594
get some rest

254
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
resting brothers...

255
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,228
...fathters, mothers, wives

256
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,476
you felt the cold of this day's
early morning

257
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,715
now you cannot feel the coldness
of its night

258
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,074
she stopped screaming...

259
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,074
...too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming

260
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,074
we saw how she fought them

261
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,228
but in the final moment?

262
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,708
If she let them...

263
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,478
...the goddess of the scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

264
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,548
her soul waits for yours in the
shade of the ceiba tree

265
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,794
I need to know

266
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,434
before this day's end I will
leave this world

267
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,074
I will take as many of these
bastard dogs with me as I can

268
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,828
and I will gladly embrace the
torments of hell...

269
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,988
...if I do not find my sky
flower there

270
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,073
don't rain

271
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,554
I am walking here

272
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,348
keep away she has the sickness

273
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,708
get back!

274
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,348
You fear me?

275
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,708
So you should...

276
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,470
...all you who are vile

277
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,554
would you like to know
how you will die?

278
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,478
The sacred time is near...

279
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,589
beware the blackness of day

280
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,835
beware the man who brings
the jaguar

281
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,308
behold him reborn from mud
and earth...

282
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,829
for the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

283
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,593
...and scratch out the earth

284
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,274
scratch you out

285
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,554
and end your world

286
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,228
he's with us now

287
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,268
...day will be like night

288
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,077
and the man jaguar will lead
you to your end...

289
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,588
where are they taking us?

290
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,228
We tell stories of a place
stone-built

291
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,597
what happens there?

292
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,718
I don't know...

293
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,713
...but the earth bleeds

294
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,434
we are near

295
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,430
salvation!

296
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,830
He has the laughing sickness

297
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,794
he likes you!

298
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,316
Help me!

299
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,108
Save me

300
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,191
die like a man

301
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,912
welcome back

302
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,672
have you been successful?

303
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,512
Ask my son

304
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,273
how many captives?

305
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,272
Deal with my son

306
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,828
a fair price

307
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,992
as always, trust me

308
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,074
good

309
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,914
how much will you give me?

310
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,434
Who will buy this woman?

311
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,112
No... she's too old

312
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,194
she can be useful

313
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,709
she can cook... clean...

314
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,554
useless old woman

315
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,554
no sale

316
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,199
go

317
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,828
go on
