1
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,151
So how long's this been going on for?

2
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,513
I don't know.

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,039
A few weeks?

4
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,991
- A long time.
- A year?

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,952
I suppose so.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,592
A whole year?

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,632
You've taken your time to come
and see me, haven't you?

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,432
You think it's going to stop, don't you?

9
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,277
I'll just take your blood pressure.

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,356
Can you pop your arm on the desk
for me?

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,594
There you go.

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,313
If you straighten it up
and push up your sleeve...

13
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,711
Are you dozing in the daytime?

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,753
Sometimes.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,069
So, I just need something
to help me sleep.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,033
I know. How much sleep
are you getting at night?

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm not getting any. That's why I'm here.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,111
I understand, sweetheart.

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,671
OK. It's just going to go tight.

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,869
(puffing)

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,799
(hissing)

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,759
Have you got any particular worries
at the moment?

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,271
No financial problems?

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,709
No. I don't know
what that's got to do with it.

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,631
What about at home?

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,511
How are things with husband?

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,478
OK, if you just lean forward and take a
few deep breaths, in through your mouth.

28
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,477
And again.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,231
It's lovely and clear.

30
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,911
- Have you got any kids?
- Yes.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,191
- Are they still at home with you?
- Son is, works with his father.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,879
Daughter's left, only see her
when she wants something.

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,117
And how about you?
Have you started your menopause?

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,309
Yes.

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,792
Everything OK?

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,956
So, will you give me some sleeping tablets?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,355
Maybe, but it might not solve your problem.

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,709
Give me a night's sleep, though,
wouldn't it?

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,070
- How much alcohol are you drinking?
- I don't drink. My husband drinks.

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,473
Is it a problem?

41
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,555
No.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,556
Are you taking any drugs, medication?

43
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,233
How about coffee?

44
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,350
Are you drinking a lot to keep awake?

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,753
Coffee, yes.

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,869
- Tea?
- Yes.

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,559
Well, we might have to look at that,
mightn't we?

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,398
OK.

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,149
Your blood pressure is slightly up,
but I'm not overly concerned about that.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,272
But I do want you to have a blood test,
to check your thyroid.

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,153
You can make an appointment at reception.
All right?

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,189
Yes.

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,673
Now, I will give you something to help
you sleep but just enough for a week.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,439
- What good's that?
- Insomnia isn't a disease.

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,234
Sleeping tablets won't make it go away.
We need to find the cause.

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,316
Now, you're obviously anxious,
and a little depressed.

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,198
So I want you to come back
and speak to our counsellor.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,639
- What for?
- I think she'd be able to help you.

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,470
But you'll give me the prescription now?

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,831
Yes, but will you see the counsellor?

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,831
I think it will do you some good.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,311
You think about it for a moment.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,271
(tapping of keyboard)

64
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,552
Tom!

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,511
Give us it.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,791
(sighs)

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,031
- Don't do your back in.
- I know.

68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,398
It doesn't get any easier.
Job for a younger man, this.

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,151
Joe used to love it here.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,314
Did you speak to my son and heir?

71
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,510
I left him a message on his answerphone.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,515
(panting)

73
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,431
It's going to rain again.

74
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,151
(machinery whirs)

75
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,551
- Now, then.
- Hello, boss.

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,071
- What you got?
- You hit rock, then?

77
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,350
Yeah, we just gone through.
This is the fourth, so I reckon, what, 17½?

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,435
Give or take.

79
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,517
- 17½? It's got to be a scour hollow.
- Probably.

80
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,039
- All right, Mick?
- All right.

81
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,956
Hello.

82
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,916
How long will it take us to get back?

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,679
- 25, with traffic. Are you hungry?
- I am.

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,233
Good.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,911
There you go.

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,756
Yes, London clay. Thank you.

87
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,518
- Thanks, Andy. See you.
- Cheers.

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,675
Ta-ta.

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,831
- Dusting of mica.
- Let's have a look.

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,551
Hmm, it's quite nice.

91
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,871
(chuckles)

92
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,591
Very nice.

93
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,710
- It's just a dusting, isn't it?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,838
What would you say was the happiest
moment in your life?

95
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,671
What do you mean?

96
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,831
Your nicest memory.

97
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,271
Have a think.

98
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,631
When your children were born?

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,276
- Your wedding day?
- I don't know.

100
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,751
Take your time.

101
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,518
I can't remember.

102
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,676
- Can't or won't?
- Mm?

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,992
Can't or won't remember?

104
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,918
Don't know what I'm doing here.
I didn't want to come.

105
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,190
Don't want to talk about my family.
Why should I?

106
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,038
None of your business.
All I need is a good night's sleep

107
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,798
and nobody's helping me.

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,479
Janet, I want to help you.
That's why we're here.

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,593
I know it's not easy
to talk about personal things.

110
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,072
Suppose the boot was on the other foot,
and someone came to you,

111
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,875
say, your daughter, and said,
"I haven't been sleeping for months."

112
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,797
What would you say to them?

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,751
"Go to the doctor."

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,711
What else would you say?

115
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,474
I don't know.

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,078
What would you ask her?

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,511
Is she eating all right?
I don't know, something like that.

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,154
Good.

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,318
Anything else?

120
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,080
That a couple of months of proper sleep
would sort it out.

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,997
Sort what out?

122
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,518
The sleeping.

123
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,834
OK.

124
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,351
On a scale of one to ten...

125
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,150
...how happy
would you say you are, Janet?

126
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,111
- One.
- One.

127
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,548
I think there's room for improvement there,
don't you?

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,829
What is the one thing that would improve
your life, apart from sleep?

129
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,234
- A different life.
- A different life.

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,631
Change is frightening, isn't it?

131
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,831
Nothing changes.

132
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,949
Hope to see you next week, Janet.
Same time.

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,389
I'll be here, but it's up to you. No pressure.

134
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,755
Bye.

135
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,231
(sighs)

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,711
- Bye-bye, Sam.
- Bye.

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,392
Look at you!

138
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,112
You look like you're fit to burst.

139
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,958
I am fit to burst.
Big boy's wrestling his way down.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,911
If he pops out, give me a shout.

141
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,116
Sweetheart, I'll do more than shout.

142
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,350
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hello, Mary.

143
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,311
You're a sight for sore eyes.

144
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,310
- Can you process these for me?
- Oh, well, seeing as it's you.

145
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,669
- How are you?
- I'm snowed under, to be honest,

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,358
and I've got a headache.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,516
- Have you seen the doctor?
- (laughs)

148
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,834
Hello, Gemma.

149
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,632
Do you fancy a drink tonight?

150
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,272
- I'd love one.
- Great. Are you sure?

151
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,276
- I've only got an hour.
- That's all right.

152
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,470
- Tom's cooking supper.
- Oh, lovely.

153
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,431
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,633
(rain pouring)

155
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,791
(buzz of conversation)

156
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,153
Do you know, Gerri, I've never been with
a man who could cook.

157
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,031
- Haven't you?
- No.

158
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,799
- They could do other things.
- That doesn't get you fed.

159
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,229
No, it keeps a girl happy, though.
(laughs)

160
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,669
- And you can't cook.
- No. Well, I can a bit.

161
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,109
- But it's not really my thing.
- No, it's not.

162
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,555
Oh, no, don't remind me about that,
Gerri.

163
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,669
(laughs)

164
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,109
You could put an ad in the paper
"Chef wanted".

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,756
Yeah. "Chef/boyfriend
required for gorgeous girl."

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,711
No, "Mature woman with cat."

167
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,637
(laughter)

168
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,478
No, "Maturish".
We don't want to put them off, do we?

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,753
It's lovely the way you and Tom
do everything together.

170
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,951
- We're very lucky.
- Yeah. You are, but you deserve it.

171
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,470
- You're both such lovely people.
- Oops, my halo's slipping.

172
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,431
Yeah, Saint Gerri.

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,715
No, but I'm really comfortable
with where I am in my life, as you know.

174
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,228
I've got my lovely little garden flat,
a good job.

175
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,590
I've got my health, touch wood,
I've got my independence.

176
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,154
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not all rosy.

177
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,556
I have good days and bad days
like everyone else, but, hey!

178
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,034
Are you going to do something
about your garden?

179
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,674
Oh, don't remind me!
I'm really guilty about that.

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,109
- I've neglected it, haven't I?
- Yes, you have.

181
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,550
But yesterday I was brushing my teeth
and I looked out the window

182
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,751
and I saw these two daffodils
peeping over the top of the grass.

183
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,028
I must get it cut.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,991
- Get yourself that lawn mower.
- I know.

185
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,679
Couldn't I just get a man in?
It wouldn't cost much.

186
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,077
- Hmm. "Gardener/chef/ boyfriend."
- Yeah! (laughs)

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,716
But I don't want to spend too much money
because I'm going to get myself a little car.

188
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,194
- Are you?
- Yeah, I've decided it's about time.

189
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,595
- It's a big step.
- I know. It's exciting, isn't it?

190
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,518
I mean, I've got a little bit of money.
Not a lot, but enough.

191
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,869
But I'll have to cut back on, you know,

192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,480
shoes, clothes, jewellery,
my knick-knacky things.

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,308
But that's OK because I've got loads of
clothes. My wardrobe isn't big enough.

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,035
In fact, I'm not doing anything this
weekend, so I'll get up really early,

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,356
sort my winter clothes into plastic bags
and shove them under the bed.

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,515
- Can I top you up?
- No, I'm going now, Mary.

197
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,516
- Won't you help me finish it?
- No, really.

198
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,109
- Oh, all right. Well, I think I'm going to
stay for a little while.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,755
How's Joe?
Have you heard from him this week?

200
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,268
- No, but I'm sure he's fine.
- Still no girlfriend?

201
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,231
I've no idea.

202
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,590
He must have something on the go,
a good-looking boy like him.

203
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,119
- See you on Thursday.
- Oh!

204
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,832
You're coming for supper on Saturday.

205
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,553
Oh, lovely. Thank you, Gerri.
Give my love to that lovely Tom.

206
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,477
- I will. You take care.
- Yeah.

207
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,471
Sorry I'm late. I'm sorry.

208
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,837
What's for supper?

209
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,030
Arrabbiata. Are you hungry?

210
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,311
I'm starving.

211
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,951
Hello.

212
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,591
Have a taste.

213
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,437
I hope it's not too hot.

214
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,391
You can never tell with chillies.

215
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,751
- No.
- No?

216
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,351
Oh, it's coming out my ears.

217
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,755
Good. Glass of wine?

218
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,000
No, I've had a couple.
Oh, go on, just a smidgeon.

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,758
That's the spirit.

220
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,355
- How was your day?
- Good.

221
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,709
I was out and about, getting my hands dirty.

222
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,035
- How about you?
- Disappointing.

223
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,116
Pass me the parsley.

224
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,479
No breakthroughs?

225
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,875
I had my alcoholic tutor in again.

226
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,239
Yeah?

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,714
- He was pissed as a fart.
- Really?

228
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,398
It was very upsetting, actually.

229
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,072
How did you handle it?

230
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,680
I bought him a double Scotch.
No, I had to challenge him.

231
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,631
I told him it was up to him.

232
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,711
How did he take that?

233
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,716
Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.

234
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,035
- Well, at least he came.
- Hmm.

235
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,548
- Have we heard from Joe?
- No.

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,477
But I haven't checked my e-mails.

237
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,159
I'll ring him later. I'd love to see him.

238
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,474
He's all right.

239
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,911
Mr Gupta?

240
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,678
Joe Hepple, nice to meet you.

241
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,472
- I just came with him.
- Ah, good.

242
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,431
Just follow me this way, please.

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,199
This way.

244
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,311
Excuse the mess.

245
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,876
You sit there, Mr Gupta,
and... l'll pop you there.

246
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,950
OK, now we've opened all these letters,

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,834
and I've seen all I need to see
for the time being.

248
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,314
Obviously, it's a sizeable correspondence

249
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,558
and, understandably, Mr Gupta hasn't
exactly been in a position to open them,

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,194
seeing as he's been in hospital
for the past ten weeks.

251
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,596
But, you're looking fit and raring to go,
Mr Gupta.

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,914
Huh?

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,632
(mouths)

254
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,839
WOMAN: Excuse me.
- Hm?

255
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,155
- How long will this take?
JOE: Not too long.

256
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,191
It's just I have to get back to work.

257
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,513
What do you do?

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,518
Er, I'm... Restaurant family business.

259
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,516
Oh, tasty.

260
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,437
OK.

261
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,395
Erm... it's important for Mr Gupta
to understand that at this point

262
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,749
he's in no danger of being evicted.

263
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,711
(speaks Hindustani)

264
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,549
Acha?

265
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,238
(continues in Hindustani)

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,192
OK?

267
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,959
I'll take you briefly through
what is going to happen in court.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,197
Erm... l'll be representing Mr Gupta
on the day.

269
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,196
We'll put the case to the judge...

270
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,832
- (phone rings)
...and...

271
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,476
he will agree to adjourn which will then
give us time to sort things out, OK?

272
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,795
So, I'll... Excuse me.

273
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,114
Hello?

274
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,871
(knocks on door)

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,277
- I'll get it!
TOM: All right.

276
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,798
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Gerri.

277
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,956
- It's stopped raining, thank goodness.
- I know.

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,638
- Welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

279
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,398
I bought you a little present, some thyme.

280
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,476
- That's lovely. Thank you.
- It's nothing much.

281
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,919
- Oh, there he is.
- Hello, love.

282
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,552
Hello, Tom.

283
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,636
Oh! I'm sorry, I just had to have a cigarette

284
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,989
- and I know you don't like the smell.
- Don't be daft.

285
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,395
- I'm trying to give up, aren't I, Gerri?
- Oh, are you?

286
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,510
Only I've just had a bad experience
on the tube.

287
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,551
- What happened?
- There was this man.

288
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,795
- What did he do?
- Well, he was looking at me.

289
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,469
I mean, every time I looked up,
he was looking at me.

290
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,795
- Oh, dear.
- It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,319
Well, you're here now.

292
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,352
Exactly, and I'm very happy
to be here with both of you.

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,038
This is for you, Tom.

294
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,718
- Ah!
- It's nothing special.

295
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,954
Buenos Aires.

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,675
Yeah, because I thought you went there,
didn't you, the two of you, Argentina?

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,358
- No, we didn't, no.
- No.

298
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,719
- Didn't you?
- No.

299
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,955
Tom's been to Brazil, digging his holes.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,231
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so stupid sometimes.

301
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,111
- That's all right.
- Oh, honestly,

302
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,310
Pow! What are you going to do with me,
eh?

303
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,035
I'm just going to run upstairs.
Is that all right? I won't be a minute.

304
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,509
- I haven't seen you since Christmas.
- Really?

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,869
- Oh, it's just the three of us tonight?
- Yes.

306
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,036
- I did tell you.
- Did you?

307
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,719
- Mm.
- We wanted you all to ourselves, Mary.

308
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,832
Oh, thank you, Tom.
That's what all the boys say.

309
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,438
No, I wasn't sure what to wear.

310
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,233
I didn't know if it was going to be
one of your big dinner parties,

311
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,670
- or just us, you know, casual.
- I think you got it just about right, Mary.

312
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,439
- You look lovely.
- Oh, thank you, Gerri.

313
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,916
- (yawns) Oh... sorry.
- Did you have a late night?

314
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,554
Oh! I stayed up watching the film.

315
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,552
I couldn't wake up this morning.

316
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,795
No, but it was lovely having a lie-in
on my day off.

317
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,159
- We stayed in.
- Did you?

318
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,714
- We listened to some music.
- Amongst other things.

319
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,830
- I thought Joe might be coming.
- I don't think so.

320
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,952
- He's coming tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a shame. I won't see him.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,070
Did Gerri tell you about me getting a car, Tom?

322
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,075
Yes.

323
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,714
- What do you think?
- Exciting. What are you going to get?

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,038
Oh, well, I don't know.
Something small and... red.

325
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,878
Small and red?
Well, that narrows it down.

326
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,115
- Yeah.
- I hope you're hungry.

327
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,879
- I'm starving, Gerri, you know me.
- We'll have to fatten you up.

328
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,150
Oh, it's lovely having your dinner cooked
for you.

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,509
You don't really bother
when you're by yourself.

330
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,198
- You look well.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

331
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,753
You're nice and slim.

332
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,711
Am I?
Well, I've always been slim, haven't I?

333
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,672
- Unlike me. Middle-aged spread.
- Shut up.

334
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,438
You're perfect. Gorgeous in every way.

335
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,391
And you know it.

336
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,832
Sit yourself down, Mary.
Help yourself to another drink.

337
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,270
How is that dressing coming along?

338
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,231
As well as can be expected.

339
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,913
I hear you're going to the Emerald Isle again,
Tom.

340
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,918
That's correct. Rent a cottage, take the car.

341
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,838
- Put the tent in the back.
- And the sleeping bags.

342
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,031
- If it's nice we might do a bit of camping.
- Oh, no.

343
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,231
I wouldn't fancy sleeping in a tent,
thank you very much.

344
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,273
No, I never had you down
as one of nature's Girl Guides, Mary.

345
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,231
No, Tom.

346
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,389
But I am always prepared.

347
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,159
- Yes, but what for?
- For anything, Gerri.

348
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,031
- You know me.
- Yes, I do.

349
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,479
(laughter)

350
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,590
I'm not going to get a holiday this year.

351
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,834
But then I never do, do I, Gerri?
Because I haven't got anyone to go with.

352
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,273
It's all right for you two,
you've got each other.

353
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,231
We're going to the Ring of Kerry.

354
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,233
The what?

355
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,271
- The Ring of Kerry. It's an area.
GERRI: Tralee,

356
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,231
- Dingle Bay.
- Oh, lovely.

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,077
You've been there before, haven't you?

358
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,190
- That was Donegal.
- Oh.

359
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,390
The geologist stands on the beach

360
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,113
with his back to the sea and looks at the cliffs

361
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,436
whilst the geologist's wife stands on the beach

362
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,994
with her back to the cliffs
looking at the sea.

363
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,748
You see, I can't afford to buy my car
and have a holiday.

364
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,200
But, if I had more money,
then I could do both.

365
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,550
But when you've got your car, Mary,
you'll be able to go wherever you want,

366
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,750
- very reasonably.
- Exactly, Tom.

367
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,995
That's exactly why I'm getting it.

368
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,353
You see, I like just taking off
and escaping, don't I, Gerri?

369
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,799
Hm.

370
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,150
I feel like I'm being somebody else.

371
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,112
- Really? Who's that, then?
GERRI: Tom!

372
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,791
I like to get on the train...

373
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,114
But, you see,
the car is cheaper than the train, isn't it?

374
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,798
GERRI:
Not environmentally.

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,270
Oh, what you mean...?
(bangs feet on floor)

376
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,390
(laughs)

377
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,000
Those are my carbon footprints, Gerri.

378
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,235
- Yes, I know.
- (giggles drunkenly)

379
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,033
Financially, cars are cheaper.
That's why there's no incentive to go by train.

380
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,230
Well, what about the airlines?

381
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,353
No government wants to increase
the duty on aviation fuel.

382
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,628
No.

383
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,114
And this government
won't invest in the railways,

384
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,957
so anything we do is a piss in the ocean.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,115
Absolutely.

386
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,230
And then there's the big corporations,

387
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,953
who keep their lights on all night
in empty office blocks.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,514
We're all expected to do our bit with eco bulbs.

389
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,471
I know.

390
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,711
Should I stop recycling, then, Gerri?

391
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,830
- No.
TOM: You've got to set an example.

392
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,713
- Yeah.
- Plant a few tomatoes.

393
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,079
And courgettes.

394
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,878
I am very environmentally friendly, actually.

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,751
- Are you?
- Yeah.

396
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,518
I don't fly.

397
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,590
I don't live in a house
that's more than I need.

398
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,158
I don't cook.

399
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,033
- Other people cook for you, though.
- Who?

400
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,672
You get takeaways, don't you?

401
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,315
That doesn't count.
Everybody gets takeaways.

402
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,511
You've built whole motorways, Tom.

403
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,233
How environmentally friendly is that?

404
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,395
Exactly!

405
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,353
More cars! More cars!
At least I'm buying an old car.

406
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
- Recycled.
- Yeah.

407
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,039
Yet we're constantly told that
the measure of a thriving economy

408
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,514
is the sale of new cars.

409
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,152
Yes, but, Tom...

410
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,998
...if I buy a new car...

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,912
...that's another car.

412
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,633
You're absolutely right, Mary.

413
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,351
And would you like some coffee?

414
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,799
No, thank you.

415
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,956
I'd like my usual.

416
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,198
Are you all right, Gerri?

417
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,276
Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

418
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,276
How are you?

419
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,118
I'm happy.

420
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,798
Good.

421
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,671
I just wanted to say...

422
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,395
...that if you ever need to share anything...

423
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,871
...I'm here for you.

424
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,755
I'm a very good listener.

425
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,597
Thank you, Mary, but I'm fine.

426
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,551
Yeah, I know.

427
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,591
It's very kind of you, Mary.

428
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,111
Oh, Gerri.

429
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,316
Everybody needs someone to talk to,
don't they?

430
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,271
Yes, Mary, they do.

431
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,036
Oh, well, onwards and upwards.

432
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,393
You'd better stay the night.

433
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,158
No. No.

434
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,952
Well, I think you should.

435
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,831
All right, Gerri, you're the boss.

436
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,791
We'll find you a T-shirt again.

437
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,472
Will you?

438
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,752
I've found you a toothbrush.

439
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,955
I sometimes wonder what he's doing.

440
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,873
If he thinks about me. I bet he does.

441
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,831
GERRI:
How old was he?

442
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,629
He'll be 64 now.

443
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,114
TOM: 64?
Blimey, he's older than me.

444
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,515
- Almost a pensioner.
TOM: He'll be past it now, Mary.

445
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,437
- Give us your hand.
- Oh, no, Tom.

446
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,993
He was lovely.

447
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,190
Well, we all grow old.

448
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,916
Oh, no, but he was very, very, sexy, Gerri.
Do you know what I mean?

449
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,030
TOM:
Too much information.

450
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,991
I bet he regrets it deep down.

451
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,878
I hope he does.

452
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,191
He was my big love...

453
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,358
...but he was married.

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,355
Well, what can you do, Tom?

455
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,834
You can't walk around
with a label saying,

456
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,110
"Don't fall in love with me,
I'm married," can you?

457
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,798
Some people wear a ring.

458
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,478
He didn't.

459
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,353
But he wasn't a bad person.

460
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,038
He loved me.

461
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,077
Sounds to me
like he was a duplicitous shit.

462
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,599
GERRI:
Tom?

463
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,632
Do you think it was my fault, Tom?

464
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,432
No, I don't, Mary.

465
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,753
Honest.

466
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,075
It takes two to tango.

467
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,793
Oh, so you think it was my fault, Gerri?

468
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,638
- I didn't say that.
- No, I know you didn't, really.

469
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,589
I blame my big heart.

470
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,870
Well, we all have to make choices,
don't we?

471
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,278
Why do I always get it wrong, Gerri?

472
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,796
I mean, look what happened
when I got divorced from that shit.

473
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,994
I let him palm me off with 5,000...
nothing pounds

474
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,792
and what am I left with now?

475
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,398
Sod all.

476
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,033
I'm living in a poky rented flat when
I should have my own home at my age.

477
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,472
It's not fair.

478
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,393
Bastard.

479
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,037
My goodness.

480
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,638
Hm?

481
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,513
- She gets worse.
- I know. Desperate.

482
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,751
I feel a bit guilty.

483
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,432
What?

484
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,072
Well, you know.

485
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,031
No.

486
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,388
No. You're right.

487
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,755
I don't think I really enjoyed history at school.

488
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,677
Didn't you?

489
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,358
Maybe I did.

490
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,557
It's just that the older you get,
the more relevant it seems.

491
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,238
Hm.

492
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,191
To state the bleeding obvious.

493
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,311
We'll be part of history soon.

494
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,839
Exactly.

495
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,479
- Aha!
- Aha!

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,988
What are you doing riding
on the pavement, young man?

497
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,632
I'm breaking the law, officer.

498
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,795
- 'Ey up.
- Hiya.

499
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,512
- How long did it take?
- About an hour.

500
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,278
- Are you knackered?
- I'm ready for bed.

501
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,117
- Late night?
- Hangover.

502
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,832
- Do you want a hand?
- Yes, please.

503
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,791
- I'll stick this away.
- All right.

504
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,678
Oh, he's back. That was quick, Tom.

505
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,631
- Didn't you get the manure?
TOM: Compost.

506
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,830
- Here's Joe!
- Hi, Mary.

507
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,472
Hello, Joe, what a surprise.

508
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,556
- Are you all right?
- I'm great. How are you?

509
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,592
- Oh, continental! He's all sweaty.
- I've been riding all morning.

510
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,153
Have you? I like your hat.

511
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,428
- Aha!
- Aha!

512
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,914
Ah, that's right.
Never forget to kiss your mum.

513
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,520
- I never do.
- No, you're a good boy, aren't you?

514
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,676
- Yeah.
- I remember when you were this big.

515
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,278
You were a naughty boy.

516
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,231
- I still am from time to time.
- Oh, really?

517
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,430
- I like your coat.
- Oh, thank you.

518
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,472
I think I'm a bit overdressed for
a Sunday morning. What do you think?

519
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,671
- Is that what you wore in bed?
- I slept in your bed. Is that all right?

520
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,632
- As long as you cleaned the sheets.
- No, I didn't. Is that a problem?

521
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,477
- We'll have to wait and see.
- Oh, right.

522
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,431
Oh, sorry, Tom. I'm in your way.

523
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,595
All of these strong men.

524
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,393
- Look at his muscles.
GERRI: That's why we had him.

525
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,033
All right, well, I'm off, then.

526
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,196
- You want a lift to the station?
- It's all right.

527
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,470
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fine. I could do with a walk.

528
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,192
Yeah.

529
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,913
- Sorry about... you know...
- It's OK.

530
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,076
TOM: It was good to see you.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

531
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,678
Are you all right?

532
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,358
Yeah, you know.

533
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,311
Had a bit of a wild night, Joe.

534
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,358
Well, I'd best be off.

535
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,433
Oh, thanks for saving me that breakfast.
It was really delicious.

536
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,516
- You're very welcome, Mary.
- Yeah.

537
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,915
It's lovely to see you, Joe.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

538
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,871
JOE: See you soon.
- Yeah, hopefully.

539
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,876
Well, have a lovely day together, all of you.

540
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,275
- Right. Ta-ta, then.
- Yeah, OK. Bye.

541
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,515
- See you on Tuesday, Gerri.
- Bye, Mary. Take care.

542
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,709
Bye.

543
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,557
- Bye Joe.
JOE: Bye.

544
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,511
- Bye.
- Bye.

545
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,229
There you go.

546
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,589
- Delicious.
- Present for you.

547
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,792
Matt's getting married.

548
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,068
Oh, Mathew!

549
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,633
Oh, is he? Matt with the guitar?

550
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,079
No, that's Paul.

551
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,156
Oh, Matt, yeah.

552
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,474
That's great.

553
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,750
- Have you met the lady in question?
- Certainly have.

554
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,473
- Is she worthy of him?
- No, they hate each other.

555
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,556
You mean, is he worthy of her?

556
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,397
Oh, beg your pardon, Mrs Pankhurst.

557
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,717
Where's the stag do this time?
Buenos Aires?

558
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,637
- No, Dublin.
- Ooh, lovely.

559
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,513
Another capital city brought to its knees.

560
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,437
Well, we'll try and leave it as we find it.

561
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,835
- When are you going?
- July. The wedding's August.

562
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,155
Lovely. I'll make some tea.

563
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,390
So, when's it going to be your turn?

564
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,953
A week on Wednesday?

565
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,798
- Oh, you didn't say.
JOE: I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

566
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,479
- I knew.
- Oh, no, I haven't bought a hat.

567
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,433
Any news?

568
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,678
Nobody...?

569
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,870
No, still quiet on that front.

570
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,113
What?

571
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,871
Sorry, love. Excuse me.

572
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,949
(knocking on door)

573
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,036
Who's that a-knocking on my door?

574
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,399
MAN:
It's only me!

575
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,192
- Bugger off!
- Hello, Tom, mate.

576
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,549
Hiya, Gerri, love.

577
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,194
- Hi, Ken, how are you?
- I'm all right.

578
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,992
- Oh, crushed ribs.
- Sorry.

579
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,917
- Give us your bag.
- I'm bursting for a pee.

580
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,951
I'll just run upstairs. Is that all right?

581
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,793
I'll put it on your bed.
You're in Joe's room.

582
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,679
- Ooh, that's better. I needed that.
- I'll take your coat.

583
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,278
Thanks, mate.

584
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,914
- Ooh, Gerri.
- Careful, Ken.

585
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,030
- Would you like a beer?
- Oh, I'd love one, ta.

586
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,071
Hup! Ha, ha, ha!

587
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,680
(chuckles)

588
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,350
- Maniacs.
- Oh...

589
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,395
Mm.

590
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,473
Mm.

591
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,914
- It's great this.
- Thank you.

592
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,109
Mm!

593
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,354
Better?

594
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,038
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

595
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,752
- Haven't you?
- No.

596
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,119
It's great to see you both. Cheers.

597
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,559
Cheers.

598
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,919
Cheers.

599
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,112
(laughter)

600
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,835
- Mm.
GERRI: So how's your flat, Ken?

601
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,440
Oh, same old, same old.

602
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,754
You employed a cleaner yet?

603
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,712
If I got a cleaner in, she'd turn round,
walk straight out again.

604
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,512
It might give her a purpose in life.

605
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,471
- Bit of a mess, but it suits me.
GERRI: Yeah.

606
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,158
Five minutes walk to work.

607
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,113
I usually get the bus, but if I'm late,
I have to leg it, if I miss the bus.

608
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,310
I stop at the caff to pick up breakfast.

609
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,635
I have a croissant
if they haven't got any iced buns.

610
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,318
Cup of tea.

611
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,998
I have to smuggle it in.

612
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,395
Just because of that Steve.
He's a right fascist.

613
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,556
TOM: That's your boss, isn't it?
- Yeah, my boss.

614
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,113
My supervisor.

615
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,116
- Is he still there?
KEN: Oh, yeah.

616
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,355
He's only been with us three...
no, two years.

617
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,995
35, looks 12, treats me like a child.
Bloody graduate.

618
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,713
- You're a graduate.
- We're all graduates, aren't we?

619
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,228
- Oh, yeah, so we are!
GERRI: You forgot.

620
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,952
Would you like some salad, Ken?

621
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,116
- No, no. I'm all right, ta.
GERRI: Sure?

622
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,556
I mean, you spend nearly 40 years trying to get
people out of the dole queue and into jobs.

623
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,352
What thanks do you get? I'm sick of it!

624
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,231
At your age, you can walk away, can't you?

625
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,077
Hm. I don't know.

626
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,396
You've got a good retirement package.
Index linked pension.

627
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,635
- I could have gone two years ago.
- Why didn't you?

628
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,910
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Isn't it?

629
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,394
What would you do with your time
if you retired, Ken?

630
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,399
Pub.

631
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,192
Eat, drink, be merry.

632
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,839
I don't know.

633
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,799
How's Joe?

634
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,149
- He's fine. You'll see him on Sunday.
TOM: He's well.

635
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,475
Oh, great. Has he got a girlfriend?

636
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,478
GERRI: No, I don't think so.
TOM: Not that we know of.

637
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,158
Who else is coming to the barbeque?

638
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,553
Jack and Janey.

639
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,352
Tanya, GP from work.

640
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,914
- Mary.
- Oh, Mary.

641
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,393
Is she?

642
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,078
Then, of course, there's yourself, sir.
The guest of honour.

643
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,348
Hooray!

644
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,038
I don't know about that.

645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,318
TOM:
What else you been up to?

646
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,918
Oh, nothing much.

647
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,956
Mm! Oh, no, hey.

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,877
Guess where I went the other week.

649
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,672
- Where?
- Hull versus Derby.

650
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,439
- Ho, ho, ho! Who'd you cheer for?
- Derby, of course.

651
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,074
I had to keep quiet,
I got stuck with the home mob.

652
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,271
- Was there owt worth cheering?
- No, it were crap.

653
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,675
I don't think my brother
ever missed one home game.

654
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,349
No. Me and my dad used to stand
with him on the terraces.

655
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,392
You used to leave Carl at your mum's
on a Saturday afternoon. Remember?

656
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,998
Oh, yeah.

657
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,474
You could hear the roar of the crowd
from the front room.

658
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,590
Of course you could.
It was three streets away.

659
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,073
Our house used to shake.

660
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,395
TOM:
Ours did. They all did.

661
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,797
During the Clough glory years, we were
at the centre of the footballing universe.

662
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,717
- You never went.
- I did occasionally.

663
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,273
I wasn't manic, like him.

664
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,631
I don't think Ronnie can afford to go now,
the price of season tickets.

665
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,955
How is Ronnie?
I haven't seen him for years.

666
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,956
- He's 70 now, you know.
KEN: Is he?

667
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,718
- Carl's 41.
KEN: Bloody hell.

668
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,752
- Linda's still working.
GERRI: She's kept him all his life.

669
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,916
- She's worn out, poor woman.
KEN: Is Carl the same?

670
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,632
As far as we know.

671
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,318
Very sad.

672
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,952
Linda's heartbroken.

673
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,434
TOM: So's Ronnie.
- He's cut himself off.

674
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,993
I used to have a drink with Ronnie.

675
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,077
When my dad was in the home, I'd
go to Derby, he was always in the pub.

676
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,111
Yep, that's one of the advantages

677
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,152
of being free from the tyranny
of regular employment.

678
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,395
- He never bought a round.
- Are you accusing my brother

679
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,510
- of being a mean bastard?
- Yeah, I am.

680
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,357
- You're right, he is.
- I know.

681
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,873
Mm.

682
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,796
I mean, I...

683
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,192
You get to a certain age...
I can't go to the places I used to.

684
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,958
They don't like old fogies.

685
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,991
- You don't have to go.
KEN: They're my pubs.

686
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,359
Not any more, they're not.

687
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,073
Except they're not like pubs now,
they're all poncy bars.

688
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,236
TOM:
Exactly, things change.

689
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,431
When I started at work,
we'd all socialise together.

690
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,598
On a Friday night, everybody would go
to the pub for a drink, go for a curry.

691
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,039
But now...

692
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,672
It's hard, isn't it?

693
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,791
I mean, who would I go on holiday with?

694
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,917
There's nobody, let's face it.

695
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,789
The only time I went on holiday
was with Pam.

696
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,794
Spain. Nightmare.

697
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,319
Didn't you go away with Andrea?

698
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,669
No, she went off with her sister.
You remember?

699
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,039
Oh, yeah.

700
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,672
Stood me up, the bitch.

701
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,069
TOM:
It leaves a nasty taste, doesn't it?

702
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,869
Girls in bikinis covered with suntan oil.

703
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,037
Boys flexing their muscles on the beach.
No, it's not for me.

704
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,433
Oh, I don't know.

705
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,277
Sounds nice.

706
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,630
- (laughs)
- You could try a cultural holiday.

707
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,035
No, I'm not one for culture.

708
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,672
Pub culture.

709
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,434
Young people, young people.
Everything's for young people.

710
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,238
These bars, you know, they're full of
young people shouting about nothing.

711
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,874
I seem to remember you got banned
from a number of pubs in Hull

712
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,672
for shouting about nothing,

713
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,472
when you were a young person.

714
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,714
Right.

715
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,591
(laughs)

716
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,357
"Ken, we like you.

717
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,516
You're a good bloke,
you're good on the darts,

718
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,949
but if you talk about politics again,
you're barred."

719
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,677
No, but these kids,
they're just bloody noisy.

720
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,880
Isle of Wight Festival, 1968.

721
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,990
We were noisy, weren't we?

722
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,156
- We weren't, he was.
- You were noisy.

723
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,634
- You were noisy.
- I know I was noisy.

724
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,358
Remember Plastic Penny?

725
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,516
Plastic Penny.

726
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,199
- Where are they now?
- You fancied Plastic Penny.

727
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,037
It's the young person's prerogative to be noisy.

728
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,150
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's all my own fault.

729
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,909
I'm not meeting the right people.
I'm stuck in a rut.

730
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,234
It's not your fault, Ken.

731
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,238
You are stuck in a rut.
That's why you can't face retirement.

732
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,952
KEN:
Yeah, I know.

733
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,873
I'm dreading getting on that train
Sunday night. I always do.

734
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,639
- Why?
- I know what I'll be thinking.

735
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,830
There's nothing for me in Hull any more.

736
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,398
Except my job.

737
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,391
Most of my friends have gone.

738
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,874
Hit you hard when Gordon died, didn't it?

739
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,114
And his wife.

740
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,832
Is she gone?

741
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,949
Yes.

742
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,672
KEN:
Oh, yeah, they're both gone now.

743
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,274
Funnily enough, I was thinking about him
on the way down.

744
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,789
I looked out the windows
when we were in Lincolnshire,

745
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,518
I saw this fucking tree.

746
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,513
It rem...

747
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,755
It reminded me of his funeral.

748
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,313
(sobs)

749
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,718
Oh, Ken.

750
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,999
Ken.

751
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,312
Ken.

752
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,872
Come on.

753
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,195
(sobs) Gerri, I'm sorry.

754
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,037
It's all right.

755
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,632
I'm sorry, Tom.

756
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,718
How you doing?

757
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,235
- I feel like shit.
- You look like shit.

758
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,998
I know.

759
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,679
- Apart from that, how are you doing?
- I still feel like shit.

760
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,358
(laughs)

761
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,518
I'll race you to the top.

762
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,755
- What?
- Snake Pass, I'll race you.

763
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,233
Oh, yeah.

764
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,357
When was the last time you sat on a bike?

765
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,789
1896, penny-farthing.

766
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,319
(laughs)

767
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,350
I tell you what.

768
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,871
You and me, we'll walk from Edale
to Matlock Bath.

769
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,232
Take as long as it takes.

770
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,192
Stay in nice pubs along the way.
What do you reckon?

771
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,719
I'll tell you what.

772
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,512
I'll stay in the pubs, you do the walking.

773
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,357
Bugger that, you're carrying the bags.

774
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,992
(chuckles)

775
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,998
How about it?

776
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,357
Serious, we'll go in the autumn.

777
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,516
What are we going to do with you, then,
eh?

778
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,950
You can't go on like this, that's for sure.

779
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,269
So, is it every man for himself
or are we having teams?

780
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,435
Teams.

781
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,439
If I might make so bold, I would suggest
that the best plays with the worst, Jack.

782
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,630
- Good idea.
- In other words, you're with Ken.

783
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,318
- Thanks.
- It's me and you, Ken.

784
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,191
- Is there anything on it?
- Bottle of wine.

785
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,434
You're on.

786
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,232
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.

787
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,838
- It's you!
- Ah, right!

788
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,711
- Shall I kick off?
- You take the honour.

789
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,671
So, this father and son team.

790
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,871
- The double Hepple.
- Yes, take on these unknown mavericks.

791
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,478
- That's us, Ken.
- Good luck, Tom.

792
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,192
And good luck to you, Mo.

793
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,349
Can I just say what a great pleasure it is
to be playing with you once again?

794
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,072
Yep, yeah. Watch and learn, Ken.

795
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,712
There's wine on it.

796
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,318
Right.

797
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,913
Off we go.

798
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,832
- At-choo!
- I knew it!

799
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,075
- I knew you were going to do that!
- Ha, ha, ha!

800
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,918
All my life I've had to put up
with this nonsense from you

801
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,793
and I'm not going to have it any longer!

802
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,191
JOE:
Don't scare the wildlife, Ken.

803
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,276
TOM:
How many times a night do you go?

804
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,231
I lose count.

805
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,396
JACK:
You gotta get it sorted out, Ken.

806
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,759
TOM:
Yeah.

807
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,310
- Oh, what a beauty.
- Lovely.

808
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,793
Good shot, partner?

809
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,717
- Oh, sorry. Good shot, Jack.
- Thank you.

810
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,398
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

811
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,397
- You want it out, Joe?
- Yep.

812
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,992
TOM:
Good luck, partner.

813
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,712
JOE:
It's all down to this.

814
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,392
(Ken coughs)

815
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,311
JOE:
Looks good.

816
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,157
ALL:
Oh!

817
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,430
TOM:
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

818
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,993
TOM: My partner.
JOE: Oh, yes.

819
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,758
(knocks on door)

820
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,879
Gerri!

821
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,433
- Tom!
- Here she is.

822
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,471
- Hello, Mary.
- Sorry I'm so late.

823
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,159
- What happened?
- It's taken me three hours to get here.

824
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,636
I left home at two. I had to ask
a policeman in the end, I got so lost.

825
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,910
- You got lost?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

826
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,757
- You've been here loads of times.
- I know.

827
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,155
- You know the way.
- Yeah, but I came in my car, Gerri.

828
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,599
- Oh, God!
- What's happened?

829
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,359
Oh, I'm so stupid.
Why do I always spoil everything?

830
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,789
- I wanted it to be a surprise.
- You've bought a car?

831
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,319
- Yeah!
- God help us.

832
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,715
I got it ever so cheap.
I was really chuffed with myself

833
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,958
because they wanted 700,
but I offered 600, but we settled at 650.

834
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,673
They were a nice couple of guys.
I think they were brothers.

835
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,472
- One of them had a gold tooth.
- Did he?

836
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,272
Yeah. But, they wanted cash.

837
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,438
So I had to go to the cash point on
Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.

838
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,835
So, I couldn't collect it till after work on Friday.

839
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,552
But they rang on Friday morning

840
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,989
to find out what time I was going
to go round with the money.

841
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,350
And had I sorted out the insurance?
Well, that hadn't even crossed my mind!

842
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,710
So, I spent the whole of my lunch break
on Friday sorting that out

843
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,230
and it was really expensive
because I haven't driven since 1984.

844
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,716
But I didn't tell you on Thursday, Gerri,
because I knew I was coming here today

845
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,318
and I wanted to surprise you all.

846
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,271
It is a surprise.
Shall I take that from you?

847
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,912
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.
- Thank you.

848
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,632
Oh, Tom, sorry.

849
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,471
- Can I have a little glass, please?
- Sure?

850
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,238
You shouldn't drive if you're drinking.

851
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,431
I know, Gerri, but you're allowed
a couple of glasses, aren't you, Tanya?

852
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,630
- Small ones.
- Yeah, yeah. Is that all right, Tom?

853
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,193
Yeah.

854
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,752
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hi.

855
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,518
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, don't be daft.

856
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,232
- Hi, Tanya.
- Hello.

857
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,396
Oh, we really miss you at work,
don't we, Gerri?

858
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,034
- Sweetheart.
- When are you back off maternity leave?

859
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,752
- Give us a chance. (laughs)
- Oh, yeah.

860
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,313
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

861
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,828
- Oh, it's really lovely to see you.
- You too.

862
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,678
- Hi, Ken. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

863
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,915
- Come and sit down, Mary.
- Have a seat, Mary.

864
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,837
- Is anyone sitting here?
- No.

865
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,633
- No.
- Oh, this is lovely. Hiya, Jack.

866
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,636
I thought you were going to miss me out, Mary.

867
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,274
Oh, sorry. Where's Janey?

868
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,356
She's a bit under the weather
this afternoon.

869
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,516
Oh, sorry to hear that. Oh, I'm starving.

870
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,357
Oh, the baby!

871
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,675
- Oh, yeah, the baby.
- I'm sorry, Tanya.

872
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,756
- That's all right.
- Oh, hello, little Isaac.

873
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,836
Say hello. Don't mind the funny lady.

874
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,632
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognise him.

875
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,318
Oh, he's asleep.

876
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,157
Oh, hasn't he grown?
He's got ever so big.

877
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,872
- They do that.
- Here you are.

878
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,309
- Oh, thanks, Tom.
- I'll give him to you.

879
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,559
- Where do you want him?
- Oh, that's better.

880
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,837
Are you OK?

881
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,359
We've saved you some food, Mary.

882
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,073
- I hope it's still warm.
- Oh, thanks, Gerri. That will be fine.

883
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,078
- I'll do you some fresh, if you like.
- Oh, no, don't worry about me.

884
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,475
- So you didn't get arrested, Mary?
- No, I didn't, Joe.

885
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,112
He was very kind to me, actually.

886
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,832
What CC is your car?

887
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,950
- What do you mean?
- How big's the engine?

888
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,672
Oh, I don't know.

889
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,317
It's about this big, I think.

890
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,952
(laughter)

891
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,270
- What's so funny?
GERRI: Don't be cruel.

892
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,198
TOM: He means, how powerful is it, Mary?
How many cubic centimetres?

893
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,753
- Oh.
- You should know that.

894
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,030
On the back there's numbers,
like 1.6 or 1.9.

895
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,992
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah.
Well, that's boys' stuff, isn't it?

896
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,190
- It's not important.
- No, Tanya.

897
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,634
I think I'm gonna have a cigarette
before I eat this.

898
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,114
- I'll get out your way.
- Shall we take Isaac over there?

899
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,197
Oh, well, I thought you wouldn't mind
cos we're outside.

900
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,356
- We don't, Mary. You carry on.
- You're all right.

901
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,834
- You're all right.
TANYA: It's OK. I fancy a swing.

902
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,518
(laughs)

903
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,109
- Have one of these, Mary.
- It's all right. I've got my own, thank you.

904
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,071
- Here.
- Oh...

905
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,279
Thanks.

906
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,030
I'll have a smoke with you.

907
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,190
Well, I don't really smoke, normally.

908
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,549
I just have the occasional one or two.

909
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,078
How are you doing?

910
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,630
Yeah, I'm really well, thanks, Ken.

911
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,953
Still on your own, are you?

912
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,275
Yeah, I am and I like it like that, you know.

913
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,117
You're like me.

914
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,152
He's good.

915
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,918
He's great.

916
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,871
- He's a hungry bugger.
- Is he?

917
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,433
Just like his dad.

918
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,038
Is he a good dad?

919
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,990
Yeah.

920
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,712
Is he a nappy changer?

921
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,988
Ish.

922
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,951
I expect you're too capable.

923
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,871
- Oh, I am.
- Like Gerri was.

924
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,238
Like Gerri was what?

925
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,511
- Mind your own business.
- We're talking about you, not to you.

926
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,751
Hey, thanks for popping round on Friday.
Janey really appreciated it.

927
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,199
- How is she?
- Not good.

928
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,195
No.

929
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,119
It's exhausting all the time, just getting up
and down the stairs, knocks her out.

930
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,479
I noticed.

931
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,274
She could do with losing a few pounds,
but she's not getting any exercise, so...

932
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,231
- How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm all right.

933
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,192
We stay cheerful, you know?
We don't let things get us down.

934
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,559
That's the spirit.

935
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,191
No, it's all right, Ken. I can pour my own wine,
thank you very much.

936
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,195
Sorry.

937
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,117
Look at the food in this fridge.

938
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,991
I haven't got anything in mine.

939
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,758
I'll see you later, all right?

940
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,479
Here she comes.

941
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,715
- Can I come in the middle?
- Of course you can.

942
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,716
Never come between a mother and her son.

943
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,032
Oh, this is my second one, Gerri.

944
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,196
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, and then that's it.

945
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,196
This could be the making of you, Mary.

946
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,229
Yeah.

947
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,793
I think so, Gerri.

948
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,435
I mean, just driving here today,
I felt like a whole person.

949
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,391
- Did you?
- Yeah, a free spirit.

950
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,637
I mean, even though the journey
was a complete nightmare,

951
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,673
from beginning to end - it was awful,
people were getting so cross with me.

952
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,597
It's a lovely little car.

953
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,676
I want you to come out and see it later.

954
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,235
I feel really good behind the wheel,
really special.

955
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,477
- You looked so lovely holding that baby.
- He's delightful.

956
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,512
I expect you're looking forward
to being a grandmother.

957
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,278
Hm, you should ask my son about that.

958
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,038
It's got nothing to do with me.

959
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,638
He's great, isn't he?

960
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,956
You should come out and have a drink
with us sometime, me and your mum.

961
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,671
Yeah?

962
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,473
- Yeah, why not? We often go, don't we?
- Occasionally, yes.

963
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,478
- Yeah, I know you do.
- It doesn't even have to be your mum.

964
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,476
- It could be just us.
- Just you and me?

965
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,195
Yeah, well, we've known each other a while,
haven't we? We're old friends.

966
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,878
Could you get me a refill, Joe?

967
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,911
- Yes, Mummy.
- Thank you.

968
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,271
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

969
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,754
- Can I get you a drink?
- Got one somewhere.

970
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,431
Oh, here comes Ken.

971
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,271
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

972
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,911
- He's a good lad.
- Yes.

973
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,840
He could be quite good-looking,
if he wanted to.

974
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,313
How's it going?

975
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,873
He's got a nice clean bum.

976
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,434
MARY: He should lose a couple of
stone, shouldn't he?

977
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,470
He was a good-looking man
when he was young.

978
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,953
- Was he?
- Mm.

979
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,072
He's got a good heart.

980
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,278
Life's not always kind, is it?

981
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,798
No, it isn't, Gerri.

982
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,951
(low chatter)

983
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,191
I don't mind the grey hair.

984
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,350
I think that can look quite distinguished
on a man of his age, but...

985
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,239
You know.

986
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,031
- I'll give you a ring in the week.
- We'll have a proper game next time.

987
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,798
- Ta-ta.
- See you.

988
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,033
Hi, Joe.

989
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,308
Hi.

990
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,271
- Have you come back to me?
- I have.

991
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,550
- They all come back in the end.
- Do they?

992
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,319
- In my nightmares.
- Oh, it's as bad as that, is it?

993
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,430
Oh, let's not open that can of worms.

994
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,278
- No, let's leave that closed.
- Not today, anyway.

995
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,031
Oh, how are you, Joe?

996
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,033
- Is life treating you kind?
- Can't complain.

997
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,716
- Really?
- Yes.

998
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,671
Nothing you want to share with me?

999
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,113
No, I don't think so.

1000
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,833
Because you know that you can talk to me.

1001
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,791
Any time you like.

1002
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,431
Well, I'll come and find you if I need you.

1003
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,913
Yeah. Yeah.

1004
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,949
I like to feel that I'm always there for you.

1005
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,553
Thanks, Mary.

1006
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,033
How are you?

1007
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,433
Yeah, I'm all right.

1008
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,993
No, I'm great, actually.

1009
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,951
- Well, you look well.
- Do I?

1010
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,319
Oh, thank you.

1011
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,713
I suddenly feel...

1012
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,159
really liberated.

1013
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,589
- Well, you're a free spirit now.
- I know.

1014
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,949
You're your own woman.
The world's your oyster.

1015
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,558
It's so exciting, isn't it?

1016
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,192
I feel like Thelma and Louise.

1017
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,752
This little car is going to change my life.

1018
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,279
Well, let's hope so.

1019
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,033
I do feel a bit guilty, though,
but at the end of the day...

1020
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,399
...so what?

1021
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,158
It's my little present to me.

1022
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,713
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

1023
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,275
Because if I don't treat myself,
nobody else is going to, are they?

1024
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,038
What are you going to call this car?

1025
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,719
Ooh, I don't know.
Why? Do you give names to things?

1026
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,035
- I've got names for everything.
- Really?

1027
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,594
- Like what?
- Well, my nose is called Roger.

1028
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,358
- Oh, you mean...
- (giggles)

1029
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,913
...your body parts!

1030
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,032
Yeah, I'm not going to introduce you
to everyone though.

1031
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,396
What, not even little Percy?

1032
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,953
You've already met my knee, then?

1033
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,149
Oh, Joe, we must go out
and have a drink one night.

1034
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,111
- We have such a laugh.
- Yeah, we do.

1035
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,709
You see, the thing about you and me is
that we've always just sort of clicked.

1036
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,352
- Haven't we?
- Yeah.

1037
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,150
Yeah.

1038
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,076
It's nice when that happens, isn't it?

1039
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,715
Do you remember
when you showed me your little box?

1040
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,715
Yes.

1041
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,238
You wouldn't tell me what was in it.

1042
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,838
I'm still not going to tell you.

1043
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,029
I know.

1044
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,035
What?

1045
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,112
I'm not telling you.

1046
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,958
I still think about that.

1047
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,911
We had a barbeque that day, didn't we?

1048
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,957
Oh! It still smells the same.

1049
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,558
It's messy, isn't it?

1050
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,273
Your kids will enjoy playing in here, won't they?

1051
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,993
One day.

1052
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,152
So, is there anyone special in your life
at the moment, Joe?

1053
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,395
- No.
- Oh, good.

1054
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,432
No, what I mean is, that's all right.
You're comfortable with that.

1055
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,754
- Aren't you?
- Am I?

1056
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,349
Well, the thing is, Joe, you're young.
You still want to be out there, don't you?

1057
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,799
What, sowing my wild oats?

1058
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,159
Well, yeah.

1059
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,397
Live life while you can.
Don't think about tomorrow.

1060
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,795
Well, a lot of my friends
are getting married.

1061
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,957
Oh, but, yeah,
you wanna be careful, Joe, because...

1062
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,198
See, I got married in my 20s
and, granted he was the wrong man,

1063
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,958
but I was too young.

1064
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,638
I couldn't handle it.

1065
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,037
But when I was in my 30s,
I met the right man and I was mature.

1066
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,638
I was ready for it.

1067
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,311
I mean, he left me, but...

1068
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,353
What can you do?

1069
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,911
It's never too late, Mary.

1070
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,551
Oh, no, I know it isn't, Joe,

1071
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,910
and, you know me, I'm very much
a glass-half-full kind of girl.

1072
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,513
But it's tricky, because...

1073
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,872
I meet these older men,
who want somebody younger,

1074
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,115
and that's great, because I fit the bill.

1075
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,514
But...

1076
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,471
when they find out that...

1077
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,274
...you know, I'm not as young
as they thought...

1078
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,390
they don't want to know.

1079
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,791
My looks work against me.

1080
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,951
How old do you think I look, Joe?

1081
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,515
60?

1082
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,869
70?

1083
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,478
Oh, stop it.

1084
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,268
Oh, it's all right.
You don't have to answer that.

1085
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,436
So, when are we going to have this drink?

1086
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,596
I don't know. I'll have to check my diary.

1087
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,517
- Yeah. You do that. Give me a call.
- I will.

1088
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,471
- Promise.
- I promise.

1089
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,108
Mate, got to get your train. We should get
cracking. I'll run you to the station.

1090
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,718
You've had too much to drink, Tom.

1091
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,398
- No, I haven't.
- I think you have.

1092
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,476
- I'm all right.
- We can get him a mini cab.

1093
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,432
- No, I'll be fine on the tube.
- You don't want to get a mini cab.

1094
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,119
It might take 20 minutes to turn up.
We haven't got time.

1095
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,390
I had a really bad experience
in a mini cab once.

1096
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,829
- You're going on the tube, aren't you?
- Of course.

1097
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,997
Don't go on the tube, Joe. I can give you a lift.
You can be my navigator.

1098
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,473
- Ooh, that sounds fun.
- Yeah.

1099
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,988
You can give them both a lift.
All in the same direction.

1100
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,112
- I'm not sure Mary can manage that.
- Of course I can. Oh, I don't know.

1101
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,549
- I'll be fine on the tube, honest.
- It's a great idea.

1102
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,672
- I don't know how to get to King's Cross.
- I do. We can all go together.

1103
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,598
- Great. Is that all right with you, Mary?
- Yeah, of course it is.

1104
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,198
It'll be good practice for me.

1105
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,629
I'm going to run upstairs
before we go on the journey.

1106
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,238
I'm not sure about this.

1107
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,679
It'll be fine.

1108
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,233
Better pack my bag.

1109
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,713
- Tom.
- What?

1110
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,393
What do you think, Tom?

1111
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,715
Well, it's small and red.
It's what you asked for.

1112
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,228
JOE: What have you done, Mary?
- It's great, isn't it?

1113
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,793
- Nice bit of parking, Mary.
- Oh.

1114
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,753
Oh, God, I didn't lock it.

1115
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,155
It's a good job it didn't get pinched, isn't it?

1116
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,832
By the way, Mary, it's a 1.4.

1117
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,835
Oh.

1118
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,314
You must come again.
Now you don't know the way.

1119
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,753
Oi, where are you going?

1120
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,072
Oh, God, Joe.

1121
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,429
- What am I going to do without you?
- You'll be fine.

1122
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,630
Can't you stay just till we get to King's Cross?

1123
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,116
- We'll be all right, Mary.
- Ken! You don't even know London.

1124
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,593
It'll be signposted.

1125
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,110
It's so lovely having you next to me, Joe,
telling me where to go and what to do.

1126
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,593
It's been a pleasure, Mary.

1127
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,518
Oh, please, I'll take you anywhere you want.
I'll take you home.

1128
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,993
Just here will do.

1129
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,837
Oh, God. All right. Let me pull in.

1130
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,030
Oh, bye, then. But lovely to see you.

1131
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,116
- Don't forget to give me a ring.
- No, I won't.

1132
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,479
- Bye, Joe.
- Yeah, take care.

1133
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,272
- See you soon.
- Look after yourself.

1134
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,197
- Oh, Joe, where do I go?
- Straight ahead.

1135
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,231
- Left round the one-way system.
- Yeah. OK.

1136
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,793
- Bye, then. Bye.
- Yeah.

1137
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,671
- I'll get in the front now.
- Oh, no, Ken.

1138
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,233
We haven't got time for this.

1139
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,833
Oh, for God's sake.

1140
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,431
Oh! No need to slam the door.

1141
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,717
- You better hurry up.
- Yeah, I'll run.

1142
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,432
Yeah, I'll see you soon, then.

1143
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,993
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Bye.

1144
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,234
Bye, Ken.

1145
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,078
- I like you, Mary. Can I phone you?
- No, Ken. No.

1146
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,271
- I could come down and see you.
- Take your hand off of me, please, Ken!

1147
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,230
Sorry.

1148
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,998
I'm going to have to be honest with you.

1149
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,271
I just don't have those kind of feelings
for you, Ken. I'm really sorry.

1150
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,275
Right.

1151
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,990
Oh!

1152
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,996
Sorry, I got carried away.
I didn't mean to.

1153
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,554
It's all right. Hurry up.
Your train is going in a minute.

1154
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,591
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, all right. Bye.

1155
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,873
God Almighty!

1156
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,388
- I'll put the kettle on.
- The sooner the better.

1157
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,479
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1158
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,875
What are you doing here, you daft bugger?

1159
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,433
I've come to surprise you.

1160
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,435
Joe!

1161
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,153
- You certainly did that.
- It's lovely to see you.

1162
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,110
Ohh!

1163
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,149
Hello!

1164
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,111
Sorry. He made me hide behind the door.

1165
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,754
- You frightened the life out of me.
- So, who's this, then?

1166
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,438
- Mum, Dad, this is Katie.
- Hello.

1167
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,631
- This is Tom and Gerri.
- Tom and Gerri? That's brilliant!

1168
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,999
Yeah, well...

1169
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,235
We've learnt to live with it over the years.

1170
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,191
- So, what's your name again?
- Katie.

1171
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,195
Katie.

1172
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,310
- So have you been at the allotment?
- Yes.

1173
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,715
Gathering the last of the season's harvest.

1174
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,876
We've brought back some lovely tomatoes.

1175
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,433
- Yeah.
- Sounds gorgeous.

1176
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,558
- We were going to have a sandwich.
- Are you both hungry?

1177
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,318
- I'm starving.
- She's starving.

1178
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,318
- I'll just go and change.
- Let me get out of this filthy clobber.

1179
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,271
- You go on through, Joe.
- All right.

1180
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,190
KATIE:
This is a lovely big kitchen, isn't it?

1181
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,151
- It's gigantic.
- Shut up!

1182
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,998
- Thank you for the flowers, Katie.
- Glad you like them.

1183
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,871
- They're lovely.
- They're all right.

1184
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,831
- Sit yourself down.
- Thank you.

1185
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,077
- So how did you two meet?
- Our eyes met across a crowded bar.

1186
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,997
We'd both been stood up by our dates.

1187
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,918
- Ah, the bonding of the jilted.
- Something like that.

1188
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,518
- Pretty much.
- When was this?

1189
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,028
- Oh, about three months ago, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1190
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,310
- You never told us.
- Master of discretion.

1191
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,874
- I didn't know he had it in him.
- My enigmatic son.

1192
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,831
- You know me.
- Must be important.

1193
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,872
- Oh, he's a dark horse.
- I wanted to keep you a secret.

1194
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,196
- You son's a weirdo!
- Yes, we know. He's having treatment.

1195
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,832
Help yourself. Tuck in.

1196
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,677
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

1197
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,553
- My mum and dad know all about you.
- Do they now?

1198
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,830
- And what do they do, Katie?
- Oh, my dad's a postman

1199
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,552
and my mum works
on a make-up counter.

1200
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,192
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you work at?

1201
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,073
- I'm an occupational therapist.
- Oh, are you? Where do you work?

1202
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,156
- At the Royal Free.
- That's a great hospital.

1203
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,555
- It's pretty good.
- Do you specialise?

1204
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,989
Yeah. Care of the elderly
and stroke rehab.

1205
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,234
What's straight rehab?

1206
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,433
Stroke rehab.

1207
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,993
You are going deaf.

1208
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,918
Oh, stroke rehab.
I thought you said straight rehab.

1209
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,473
What's straight rehab?

1210
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,875
What, for gay men who are on the turn?

1211
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,754
Or straight men, who tried being gay,
but want to be rehabilitated into straight.

1212
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,310
- Joe tells me you're a counsellor, Gerri.
- Yes, I am, for my sins.

1213
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,558
But it's great to come home and feel like
you've made a contribution, isn't it?

1214
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,749
Yes, of course.

1215
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,472
Or not, as the case may be.

1216
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,351
Oh, I'm sure you contribute.

1217
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,119
Not me. I'm talking about you lot
in the caring professions.

1218
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,673
- I don't care.
- We know.

1219
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,039
Hard man.

1220
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,430
And I know you're a geologist, Tom,
but what exactly do you do?

1221
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,631
Ah, yes. Strictly speaking, I'm actually
an engineering geologist.

1222
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,591
- Which means that I...
- He digs holes.

1223
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,631
- I investigate...
- You dig holes.

1224
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,079
All right. I dig holes.

1225
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,759
That's just calling a spade a spade,
isn't it?

1226
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,268
- I always call it a shovel.
- You call it a fork.

1227
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,359
I call it a trailer-mounted-tripod
cable-percussive boring unit.

1228
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,958
And that's why I love him.

1229
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,070
No, I investigate
the ground beneath our feet

1230
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,351
to test the feasibility of various
engineering and building projects.

1231
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,868
It sounds amazing. What are you
working on at the moment?

1232
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,708
Ah, yes. Well, right now, the main project
is an eight-metre-diameter tunnel,

1233
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,514
which is going to alleviate the pressure
on London's Victorian sewage system.

1234
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,515
Blimey.

1235
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,471
Eight metres? That's big.

1236
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,638
Oh, yeah. And it'll follow the path
of the Thames for 20 miles,

1237
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,432
up to 80 metres underground.

1238
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,072
And that's just for this household.

1239
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,597
TOM:
So, it's quite a big number.

1240
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,200
I'm not doing it on my own.
There's a few of us.

1241
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,879
- It won't be finished till after I'm dead.
- Oh, no.

1242
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,512
You'd better get a move on.

1243
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,991
Help yourself.
Is there anything you want?

1244
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,395
- Some ham?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm a veggie, actually.

1245
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,668
- Are you?
- Mm.

1246
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,756
This cheese is gorgeous, though.
Thank you.

1247
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,518
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

1248
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,790
- What have you got planned later?
- Ah, yes.

1249
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,229
- We're having a visitation.
- Sounds ominous.

1250
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,589
- Mary's coming for tea.
- Oh, I was right.

1251
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,949
- Who's Mary?
- She's a friend from work.

1252
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,116
- Oh, right.
- Yes, she's... Yes.

1253
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,832
She's something else.

1254
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,279
I won't ask.

1255
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,150
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Joe!

1256
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,111
How lovely to see you.

1257
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,116
This is a surprise. How are you?

1258
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,037
- I'm good.
- Oh, you look great.

1259
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,991
- So do you.
- Oh, thank you.

1260
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,797
Hello, Mary.
I'm Tom. I'm his father. I live here.

1261
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,193
Oh, Tom.

1262
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,878
My two favourite men.

1263
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,353
In you go.

1264
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,277
- You never rang me.
- I'm sorry.

1265
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,392
Whatever happened to that drink
we were gonna have?

1266
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,273
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, Joe, you shouldn't have.

1267
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,550
- Hello.
- Katie, this is Mary. Mary, this is Katie.

1268
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,556
- Hello, Mary. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

1269
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,955
GERRI: This is Joe's girlfriend.
- I like your jacket.

1270
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,831
Your mum gave me a pot of basil. Smell that.

1271
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,916
- She's going to make him some pesto.
- Lovely.

1272
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,269
- Shall I take your jacket, Mary?
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.

1273
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,914
- How are you, Mary?
- Yeah, I'm really good, thanks, yeah.

1274
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,871
- How was your journey?
- It was all right.

1275
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,792
- Oh, no, it wasn't actually.
- Didn't get lost again, did you?

1276
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,956
Oh, no, the journey was all right.
It's the car.

1277
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,632
TOM: Is it OK?
GERRI: What happened?

1278
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,477
- It wouldn't start.
- Oh, no.

1279
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,114
Yeah, it's a nightmare.
I had to come on the tube.

1280
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,071
And it got broken into last night.

1281
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,031
- Oh, sorry to hear that.
- Oh, no.

1282
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,958
Yeah, I did my big weekly
supermarket shop yesterday,

1283
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,878
which is great, I couldn't do that
before I had the car.

1284
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,037
I went nice and early,
so it wouldn't be dark when I got back.

1285
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:03,073
I brought three bags in, but I must have
left the fourth one on the front seat.

1286
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,588
I got in. I thought, that's great, that's done,

1287
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,518
I can chill out now
and have a nice little glass of wine.

1288
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,551
I had a really nice evening, actually.

1289
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,555
Er...

1290
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,797
But then, this morning,
I'm in the bathroom, I'm sitting on...

1291
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,354
Cos it's the toilet roll that I've left in the car.

1292
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,789
So, I rush out
and my window's been smashed.

1293
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,751
There's glass everywhere

1294
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,950
and all my toilet rolls have been stolen.

1295
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,275
- It's probably kids.
MARY: I think you're right.

1296
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,673
Are you insured, Mary?

1297
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,438
- Yeah, of course I'm insured.
- Well, that's something, isn't it?

1298
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,755
You can't drive a car without insurance.
It's illegal.

1299
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,314
I know. At least you'll be able
to claim for your window.

1300
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,588
I know.

1301
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,758
Anyway, I'm... I'm sick of it. I just left it.
It's just a car. What does it matter?

1302
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,597
GERRI:
Go on. Sit yourself down, Mary.

1303
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,279
- Put the kettle on, Tom.
- Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

1304
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,431
It's given me a lot of stress, Tom.

1305
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,278
This car's been a catalogue of disaster, hasn't
it?

1306
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,469
I know.

1307
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,238
Cut your losses, Mary. Get rid of it.

1308
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,033
But I've spent so much on it, Tom.
I can't just sell it now.

1309
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,548
But if you keep it,
it's only going to get worse.

1310
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,034
- Well, you know what I think, Mary.
- Yeah, yeah.

1311
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,310
I'm fed up with it, to be honest, Tom.

1312
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,237
I've had three punctures.

1313
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,918
- Three punctures?
- Yeah.

1314
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,872
My exhaust has fallen off. I had to get
a new one. My carburettor went.

1315
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,990
You can't take it back
to the guys you got it from?

1316
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,794
No. They'd guarantee the labour for three
months, but not the parts. Bastards.

1317
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,593
Other way round, isn't it?
Parts for three months, not labour.

1318
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,595
No.

1319
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,352
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1320
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,551
Oh, I don't know. Anyway...
my windscreen wiper got ripped off.

1321
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,795
I got three points for speeding, at £60 each.

1322
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,195
So, I've got nine points on my driving licence.

1323
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,559
- Haven't I, Gerri?
- Yes.

1324
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,113
It keeps making funny noises.

1325
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,357
I got towed away and I wasn't even
parked on a double-yellow line.

1326
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,790
I've got seven parking tickets...
no, nine parking tickets.

1327
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,193
And then...

1328
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,993
I broke down on the motorway
on the way to Brighton

1329
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,951
and I got towed to Crawley,

1330
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,390
which is the last place I want to go,
because I grew up there and I hate it.

1331
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,069
So, I had to get the train home and then
the train back to Crawley the next day

1332
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,872
and the guy kept trying to touch me up.

1333
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,037
It cost me nearly £500 and I never even
got my weekend in Brighton.

1334
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,150
That was supposed to be my summer holiday.

1335
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,030
Yes.

1336
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,832
- It's not fair, is it?
- No.

1337
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,519
- Well, never mind.
- Come and sit down, Mary. Relax.

1338
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,869
- Yeah, thanks, Joe.
- At least you're here now, eh?

1339
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,110
- What did you say your name was?
- Katie.

1340
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,353
MARY:
Oh.

1341
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,357
Well, the good news is, Mary,
I've made a cake in your honour.

1342
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,719
Oh, thanks, Gerri.

1343
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,069
TOM: She knew you were coming,
so she baked a cake!

1344
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,998
- Don't forget to give me the recipe.
- No, I won't forget, Katie.

1345
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,270
- You haven't tasted it yet.
- Oh, it smells nice.

1346
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,029
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having the recipe
for that. I've never baked a cake before.

1347
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,275
- Of course you can.
- You can have a cake-off!

1348
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,993
Oh, I don't think so.
I tried making a fruit cake once.

1349
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,508
Everything sank to the bottom.
It was horrible.

1350
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,152
You're a good cook.

1351
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,553
Thank you.

1352
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,672
- What about these two, then, Mary?
- Such a surprise.

1353
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,269
This monster hid this young lady
behind the sitting-room door.

1354
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,392
- Made me jump.
- I nearly gave poor Tom a heart attack.

1355
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,759
She passed the test.

1356
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,156
Surprised you passed the test.
I'd have got rid of you on the spot.

1357
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,838
A terrible way to treat someone.

1358
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,156
KATIE: Yeah.
- We had absolutely no idea.

1359
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,918
- My big secret.
- Oh, thanks very much.

1360
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,871
It's obviously serious.

1361
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,038
Still, it's been really good to meet you both,
though, and we had a lovely lunch.

1362
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,672
You didn't say you were having lunch.

1363
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,235
- We have lunch every day.
- I know you have lunch every day, Joe.

1364
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,599
Bread and cheese.

1365
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,234
- Nothing special.
- I thought it was special.

1366
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,716
We had some tomatoes from Tom
and Gerri's allotment. Have you tasted them?

1367
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,070
Loads of times. Gerri's always giving me
stuff, aren't you, Gerri?

1368
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,680
- I'll give you some to take home, Mary.
- Oh, great.

1369
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,631
Oh, yeah, I can take them on the tube.

1370
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,871
So, what is it you do, then, Jackie?

1371
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,239
KATIE:
Katie.

1372
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,273
- Katie.
- Don't worry. An occupational therapist.

1373
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,675
Oh.

1374
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,712
GERRI: She looks after stroke victims
and the elderly.

1375
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,389
And... I grew up just down the road
from you, in Croydon.

1376
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,557
- I only went to college in Croydon.
- Oh, right. Which college?

1377
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,278
Croydon College.

1378
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,753
The aptly named.

1379
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,276
So which course did you do? Secretarial?

1380
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,550
What makes you think I'm a secretary?

1381
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,511
Well, you are, aren't you?

1382
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,630
- Gerri said...
- Yes.

1383
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,755
Well...

1384
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,956
I got my diploma. I look after the doctors.

1385
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,399
Oh, brilliant.

1386
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,994
So have you two worked together
for a long time?

1387
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,270
Ooh, about 20 years, haven't we, Mary?

1388
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,275
Yeah.

1389
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,232
- Mary's known Joe since he was ten.
- No way!

1390
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,919
I bet you've got some embarrassing stories.

1391
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,916
I've got some really nice stories, actually.

1392
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,758
Joe and I have shared some really
special moments, haven't we?

1393
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,598
- Yes, Mary.
- It'll just have to be our secret, won't it?

1394
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,232
She's almost like an auntie to him.

1395
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,599
I wouldn't say that.

1396
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,392
Well, we think of you as his auntie.

1397
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,839
Auntie Mary.

1398
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,632
I think that's really sweet.

1399
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,235
- Right. Who wants some cake?
- Yes, please.

1400
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,553
Auntie Mary.

1401
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,158
Thanks, Joe.

1402
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,758
Thanks, Mum.

1403
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,035
It must be really boring looking after old people.

1404
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,672
No, I love it.

1405
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,712
You get to know them really well
and, well...

1406
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,875
...we're all going to be old, one day,
aren't we?

1407
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,433
Touch wood.

1408
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,948
TOM: Some of us already are.
- (Katie giggles)

1409
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,551
We look after old people, don't we, Gerri?

1410
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,032
No, not in the same way.

1411
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,873
Amazing cake.

1412
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,433
Thank you, Katie.

1413
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,435
TOM:
Right.

1414
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,198
We'll see you when we see you.

1415
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,595
- Soon. Hopefully.
- And you'll never know when.

1416
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,837
- Probably find you hiding in the shed.
- Or lurking in the bathroom.

1417
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,393
- Or down the toilet.
- Oh, nice!

1418
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,590
- You must come to supper.
- Yes, please.

1419
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,200
I hear you're both excellent cooks. No pressure.

1420
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,470
- Tom makes a mean curry.
- Oh, I love curry.

1421
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,274
- Well, there's been no litigation to date.
- I'll take my chances, then.

1422
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,719
- I'll speak to you later.
- Bye.

1423
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,398
- See you, boy.
- Bye-bye. Take care.

1424
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,635
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the flowers.

1425
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,796
- A pleasure. Lovely to meet you.
- You, too.

1426
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,910
Bye, Mary. Really nice to meet you.

1427
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,871
Hope you get your car sorted out.

1428
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,478
- Bye, Katie.
- Bye.

1429
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,431
TOM: Bye.
KATIE: See you soon.

1430
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,436
TOM: Yeah. Safe journey. Bye.
- Bye.

1431
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,152
(front door closes)

1432
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,918
How about that, then?

1433
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,918
- That's a turn-up for the books.
- You're not kidding.

1434
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,713
- Excuse me, I've got a bit of work to do.
- All right.

1435
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,753
I was going to bring you some flowers, Gerri.
I just couldn't find anywhere open.

1436
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,199
Don't be silly.

1437
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,714
Gerri?

1438
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,908
What?

1439
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,758
- What do you think of her?
- She's lovely, isn't she?

1440
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,878
Well, I don't know.

1441
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,433
Joe likes her.

1442
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,198
Yeah, but, you know.

1443
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,196
They seem to connect.

1444
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,231
Well, he's only young, isn't he?

1445
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,430
He's 30 years old, Mary.

1446
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,752
No, but what I mean is,
he doesn't want to rush into anything.

1447
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,631
He's only known her for five minutes.

1448
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,955
I think Joe knows what he's doing, actually.

1449
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,198
Well, I hope so.

1450
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,717
Don't forget your tomatoes, Mary.

1451
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,193
No, I won't.

1452
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,116
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

1453
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,558
- I might head off in a minute.
- All right, then, Mary.

1454
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,435
- Thank you for coming, Mary.
- Thanks, Gerri.

1455
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,152
- I'll see you on Tuesday.
- Yes.

1456
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,950
Yeah.

1457
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,433
- Bye, then.
- OK, bye.

1458
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,759
Very sad.

1459
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,313
Really upsetting.

1460
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,315
Yeah.

1461
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,351
- Are you surprised?
- Of course I am.

1462
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,913
No, I'm not, actually.

1463
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,915
No.

1464
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,518
It's disappointing.

1465
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,750
So, when are you inviting her round next?

1466
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,913
Did you see this?

1467
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,793
It's extraordinary.

1468
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,112
- I like whatshername.
- Katie?

1469
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,720
- Yeah, she's a laugh, isn't she?
- She's lovely.

1470
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,711
He is a dark horse, our son.

1471
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,511
I think you'll find that we men are.

1472
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,911
Can you take that for me?

1473
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,433
(clink of bottles)

1474
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,591
Hasn't changed much, has it?

1475
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,473
Hello, mate.

1476
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,918
How are you, Ron?

1477
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,679
Hi, Ronnie.

1478
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,154
TOM: Do you recognise Joe?
- I've grown a bit.

1479
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,871
How are you managing, Ronnie?

1480
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,831
I'll be glad when this is over.

1481
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,791
- This is the hardest day.
- Yeah.

1482
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,191
- She was a lovely person.
- She was.

1483
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,673
Very kind.

1484
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,200
Have you been eating
over the weekend, Ronnie?

1485
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,798
I had some beans.

1486
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,229
Need a bit more than that, though, don't you?

1487
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,191
Do you want something now?

1488
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,195
Nah.

1489
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,151
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1490
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,998
- We brought a load of sandwiches, Ron.
- Some beers.

1491
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,718
So where's Carl?

1492
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,478
I told him when and where.

1493
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,397
The question is, if he'll turn up.

1494
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,158
Well, that's up to him.

1495
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,758
He'd bloody better.

1496
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,669
Cheers, Gez.

1497
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,756
- The hearse will be here soon.
- Yeah.

1498
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,038
There you are, Ronnie.

1499
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,557
Can I have one of them beers now?

1500
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,511
Yeah, you're all right. Go on.

1501
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,475
Ta.

1502
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,192
- Hello.
- Hello. Mr Hepple?

1503
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,913
Yes, I'm Tom Hepple.
I think we spoke on the phone.

1504
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,598
This is my brother, Ronnie.

1505
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,551
- Hello.
- He's Linda's husband.

1506
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,672
- Are you all ready?
- Yes, we are, yes. Just the four of us.

1507
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,116
Have you got the keys, Ronnie?

1508
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,354
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1509
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,713
Thank you.

1510
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,108
Thank you.

1511
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,993
- Mr Hepple?
- Yes.

1512
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,951
This is Robert, your minister.

1513
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,831
- I'm Tom Hepple.
- Oh, yes.

1514
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,796
This is my brother, Ronnie,
Linda's husband.

1515
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,354
Robert Saunter.
I shall be taking the service.

1516
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,675
We're expecting Ronnie's son,
Carl, to be here,

1517
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,711
but he doesn't appear
to have turned up yet.

1518
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,315
Right, well, we'd... best be started.

1519
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,509
Yes. Yes.

1520
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,471
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

1521
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,113
Thank you.

1522

# BACH:
Air On The G String

1523
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,638
FUNERAL DIRECTOR:
Thank you.

1524
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,478
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
says the Lord.

1525
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,351
"Those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

1526
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,472
Everyone who lives and believes in me
will never die."

1527
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,958
I am convinced that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,

1528
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,151
nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come,

1529
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,590
nor height, nor depth,
nor anything else in all creation

1530
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,236
will be able to separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

1531
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,313
We have entrusted our sister,
Linda Margaret, to God's mercy,

1532
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,954
and we now commit her body to be cremated.

1533
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,955
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

1534
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,834
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

1535
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,030
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1536
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,355
who will transform our frail bodies

1537
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,870
that they may be conformed
to his glorious body,

1538
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,390
who died, was buried
and rose again for us.

1539
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,351
To him be glory forever.

1540
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,628
Amen.

1541
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:06,713
May God give you his comfort
and his peace, his light and his joy,

1542
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,432
in this world and the next.

1543
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,436
And the blessing of God Almighty...

1544
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,754
(door opens)

1545
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:17,591
...the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
be upon you and remain with you always.

1546
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,358
Amen.

1547
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,913
You are welcome.

# ELGAR:
Enigma Variations IX Nimrod

1549
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,350
You're joking, aren't you?

1550
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,913
Hello, Carl.

1551
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,349
- Is that it?
- It's all over, Carl.

1552
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,913
I'm really sorry.

1553
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,233
TOM: That was just right.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

1554
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,759
Thank you. God bless you.

1555
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,708
Unbelievable.

1556
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,318
Why couldn't you wait?

1557
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,193
There's another one coming up behind us.
You can't wait.

1558
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,879
- They can't wait five minutes?
- No. We asked them.

1559
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,831
- Outrageous.
- What happened to you?

1560
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,713
- Motorway was fucked up.
- Should have taken that into account.

1561
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,318
- I did.
- Obviously not enough.

1562
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,920
I'll never forgive you for this.
You know that, don't you?

1563
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,712
- Don't blame me.
- It's not his fault.

1564
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,876
I might have known
you'd pull a stunt like this.

1565
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,833
- Carl.
- What?

1566
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,279
It's Joe.

1567
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,953
Oh, yeah. All right?

1568
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,598
Carl, I'm really sorry.

1569
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,155
We're going back to the house,
to your mum's.

1570
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,633
If you want to come...

1571
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,036
- I gotta go back there, any road, so...
- All right. We'll see you there.

1572
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,718
Hello, I'm Tom. Ronnie's brother.

1573
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,479
- We're going back to the house.
- Are you friends of Linda?

1574
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,637
How long have you worked with her?
Are you coming back to the house?

1575
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,148
- Good. We'll see you there.
- Do you have transport?

1576
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,273
Do you know the way?

1577
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,072
We'll see you there, then.

1578
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,391
Carl said he is going back.

1579
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,871
When was the last time you saw Carl?

1580
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,353
A couple of years ago.

1581
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,516
Just turns up out of the blue, doesn't he?

1582
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,471
When he can be bothered.

1583
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,351
When did we last see him?

1584
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,909
TOM: I can't remember.
Five, ten years ago?

1585
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,678
It was the year your mum died.

1586
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,869
- Was it?
- Mm.

1587
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,398
1979.

1588
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,476
- No.
JOE: No, '95.

1589
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,873
TOM:
Yeah.

1590
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,148
Don't know.

1591
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,033
JOE: So, hang on.
When did he stay with us in London?

1592
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,594
- That was in the '80s.
- You were nine.

1593
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,551
He always wore black, didn't he?

1594
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,555
Mm.

1595
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,919
It's tragic.

1596
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,871
He was such a lovely kid, full of fun.

1597
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,233
Was he?

1598
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,713
Hi. Come on in.

1599
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,671
- Thanks, love.
- Hello. Come in.

1600
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,675
Hiya.

1601
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,836
- Do you want to go through?
- Thank you.

1602
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,508
- You find it all right?
- Aye, aye. No problem.

1603
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,109
- Shall I take your coat?
- Er... no, you're all right, duck, thanks.

1604
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,878
Shall I take your coats, ladies?

1605
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,638
- Thank you.
TOM: Right.

1606
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,069
GERRI:
Joe, is there another chair in there?

1607
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,195
Yeah.

1608
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,838
It was a very nice service.

1609
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,634
It was, wasn't it? Simple, straightforward.

1610
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,238
That's what you wanted, wasn't it, Ronnie?
Nothing fancy.

1611
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,838
No.

1612
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,753
- Good job it didn't rain.
- (others laugh politely)

1613
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,189
- It's a nice spot that, isn't it?
- Mm.

1614
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,556
We've seen a few off from there,
haven't we?

1615
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,830
- Aye, we have over the years.
- Aye.

1616
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,632
Have you worked with Linda for long?

1617
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,750
About ten years.

1618
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,756
How about you, Maggie?

1619
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,233
Not as long as that, no.

1620
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,399
She was a lovely lady.

1621
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,796
- She was, yeah.
- We weren't that close.

1622
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,638
- She'll be much missed.
- It was such a shock.

1623
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,072
Be a big change for you, Ronnie,

1624
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,190
having to look after yourself.

1625
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,156
You get used to it though, Ronnie.

1626
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,911
- Eight years for me, now.
- Is it?

1627
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,154
Aye.

1628
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,599
(door opening)

1629
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,238
It's Carl.

1630
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,037
All right, Carl?

1631
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,355
- 'Ey up, Carl.
- Excuse me, mate.

1632
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,189
- Do you want a drink, Carl?
- You got tea, beers...

1633
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,117
...couple of bottles of wine.

1634
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,557
Sort myself out, ta.

1635
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,512
- Are you local, then, Frank?
- Aye, aye, I'm just a few streets down.

1636
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,835
- You know, Palmer's Street.
- Oh, yeah.

1637
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,871
I haven't lived in Derby for 40 years.

1638
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,558
- How are you, Carl?
- All right. You?

1639
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,158
We're all fine.

1640
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,316
This must have been
a bit of a shock for you.

1641
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,713
I'll say.

1642
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,276
- Where are you living?
- Up in Yorkshire.

1643
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,198
- Are you working?
- Don't need an interrogation.

1644
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,194
There's food out here
when you want it.

1645
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,151
WOMAN:
It's all changed.

1646
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,469
- No post for me, then?
- No.

1647
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,917
None from you, either.

1648
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,916
- Eh?
- There's none from you.

1649
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,596
Not lost your sense of humour, then?

1650
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,753
Who sorted all this lot out?

1651
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,439
- We did.
- We brought it with us.

1652
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,038
- From London?
- Yeah.

1653
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,957
Nice.

1654
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,877
You didn't get your arse in gear, Ronnie?

1655
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,195
- He didn't need to, we offered.
- Did you?

1656
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,073
- Yeah.
- It's his responsibility, though, in't it?

1657
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,994
Don't underestimate
the shock he's had, Carl.

1658
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,032
Yeah, I know.
Very fragile, in't he, your brother?

1659
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,829
- His wife's just died.
- His wife.

1660
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,916
Didn't much care for her
when she was alive.

1661
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,474
- Did you?
- I beg your pardon?

1662
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,272
- Did you care for her, Carl?
- Tom?

1663
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,992
- I cared for her in my own way.
- Carl.

1664
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,110
- What way was that?
- She knew how I felt.

1665
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,513
- Did she?
- Shut it.

1666
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,039
Don't tell me how to behave in my house.

1667
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,230
- It's not your house.
- It is, as much as it is his.

1668
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,076
Tom.

1669
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,879
- And what are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you, Carl.

1670
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,797
Well, I don't like it.

1671
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,591
Don't feel you need to hang about, duck.

1672
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,518
We best get going.

1673
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,073
Excuse me.

1674
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,916
GERRI:
I'm really sorry about this.

1675
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,074
Do you want your coats?
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

1676
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,429
- Thank you for coming.
- Shall I drop you off?

1677
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,879
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

1678
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,150
- Thanks.
- Is that... Can you do that, Frank?

1679
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,758
Aye, aye. Give them a lift home.

1680
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,950
Look after yourself, Ronnie.

1681
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,389
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about this.

1682
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,273
- One of those things.
- Aye, well, not to worry, duck.

1683
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,435
- See you.
- Thanks.

1684
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,277
- Take care. Ta-ta.
- Bye.

1685
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,511
Bloody hell.

1686
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,193
Are you all right, Ronnie?

1687
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,196
I don't know what to do.

1688
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,752
Ah, sod him.

1689
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,471
He'll bugger off soon enough.

1690
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,079
Tell you what.

1691
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,076
Why don't you come back with us?

1692
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,752
To London.

1693
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,800
No, no. You're all right.

1694
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,558
Well, why not?

1695
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,076
Just for a few days, a week.

1696
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,791
Whatever it takes.

1697
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,988
Then we'll put you on the train back home.

1698
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,271
I don't know.

1699
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,351
Think about it.

1700
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:58,756
What do you reckon?

1701
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,678
You might as well,
until you feel a bit better.

1702
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1703
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,313
- OK.
- Good.

1704
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,590
Chuck a few things in a bag.
We'll clear up.

1705
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,596
- Yeah.
- Have you got a bag?

1706
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,755
I think so.

1707
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,155
Your dad's coming home with us
for a couple of days.

1708
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,952
Is he now?

1709
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,275
- I think there's one under the bed.
- Right.

1710
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,992
How did she go?

1711
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,878
Eh?

1712
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,836
She were dead when I woke up.

1713
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,711
Satisfied?

1714
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,196
- Excuse me, Carl.
- I'll do that, Gerri.

1715
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,310
- No, I'll do it.
- No, you leave it.

1716
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,271
You sit yourself down.

1717
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,078
(crockery clatters)

1718
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,354
What am I doing this for?
Save my mam the trouble?

1719
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,231
- She's fucking dead now.
- Listen to me.

1720
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,793
Nah, no, no, no, no.

1721
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,231
I'm going to get a bottle of wine.

1722
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,191
Carl, we've got loads of wine.

1723
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,151
Carl.

1724
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,351
He won't be back.

1725
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,237
Pyjamas. Get some shirts.

1726
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,309
- Are you going to change?
- Yeah.

1727
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,476
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.

1728
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,676
How you doing?

1729
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,312
Are you all right?

1730
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,316
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1731
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,471
We'll be off soon.

1732
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,391
(knock at door)

1733
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,797
Oh, hi.

1734
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,439
Is Gerri in?

1735
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,511
No.

1736
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,272
Oh.

1737
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,073
- Is Tom here?
- No, they're out.

1738
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,113
What's it about?

1739
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,320
I... I... I just wanted to see them.

1740
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,352
They didn't say nothing.

1741
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,311
Oh... Oh, no, they don't.

1742
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,349
I just came on the spur of the moment.

1743
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,114
I'm a friend of Gerri's. I work with her.

1744
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,674
Oh, have they gone to the allotment?

1745
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,032
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1746
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,313
Can I come in?

1747
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,631
Just to wait for them?

1748
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:02,596
- I don't know.
- I'm really cold.

1749
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,199
I'm here on my own.

1750
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:10,030
Oh, I'm not going to burgle you
or anything.

1751
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,832
I can give you a description of the house,
if you like?

1752
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:25,668
When you go in the kitchen,
the cooker's on the right...

1753
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,831
...and the sink's straight in front of you
and on the left is...

1754
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,393
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right.

1755
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,192
Thanks.

1756
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,791
I'm Mary.

1757
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,351
What's your name?

1758
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,550
Ronnie. Tom's my brother.

1759
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,511
Oh, oh.

1760
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,070
Is it your wife that's just passed away?

1761
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,429
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry.

1762
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,391
That's all right.

1763
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,240
Would you like me to make you
a cup of tea?

1764
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,430
No, thank you.

1765
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,795
Is it all right if I make one for myself?

1766
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,075
I don't think Gerri and Tom would mind.

1767
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,351
All right.

1768
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,436
Have you come down for a few days?

1769
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,471
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1770
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,876
I haven't had any breakfast.

1771
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,758
Did you have breakfast?

1772
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,233
Yeah.

1773
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,191
- With Tom and Gerri?
- Yeah.

1774
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,071
Do you want a cuddle?

1775
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,355
You sure you don't want some tea?

1776
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,516
- Aye, go on, then.
- Yeah.

1777
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,637
Ooh, that's better.

1778
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,551
It's really lovely to be here.

1779
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,671
I haven't been for months.

1780
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,793
They invite me a lot.
We're really old friends.

1781
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,711
Are you sleeping in Joe's room?

1782
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,988
Yeah.

1783
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,837
Oh, yeah.

1784
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,950
All his little bits and bobs.

1785
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:20,833
Did he go to the funeral?

1786
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,074
Yeah.

1787
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,511
With his girlfriend?

1788
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,471
- No.
- Oh.

1789
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,638
They're coming round later.

1790
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,556
Oh, are they?

1791
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,470
Sorry I'm such a mess.

1792
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,312
I didn't get to bed till five
and then I couldn't sleep.

1793
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,515
I just got up and came straight here.

1794
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,230
Does Gerri ever mention me?

1795
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,115
No.

1796
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,472
Mary.

1797
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,519
No.

1798
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,799
You look like Tom.

1799
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,998
Oh, aye?

1800
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,314
Yeah.

1801
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,158
You've got a nice face.

1802
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,396
Tom's got a nice face, too.

1803
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,676
What was your wife's name?

1804
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,555
- Linda.
- Oh.

1805
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,312
Was she nice?

1806
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,478
Did you have dinner last night?

1807
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,080
- We had chicken.
- Oh, lovely.

1808
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,314
- They're good cooks, aren't they?
- Yeah.

1809
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,392
I can't cook.

1810
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,515
- Can you cook?
- Nah.

1811
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,871
I didn't really eat anything yesterday.

1812
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,078
Do you want some toast?

1813
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,871
No, I'm all right, thank you.

1814
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,511
Wouldn't mind a cigarette, though.

1815
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,669
- Do you smoke?
- Yeah.

1816
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,631
Oh, good.

1817
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,233
Oh, yeah. My friend used to roll her own.

1818
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,553
Do you want one of these?

1819
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,120
No, it's all right.
I'll have one of mine.

1820
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,673
Oh, no, go on, then.
For old time's sake.

1821
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,994
Yeah.

1822
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,471
We have to go out there.

1823
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,518
Oh, we can stay in here, can't we?
They won't know.

1824
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,233
Ooh.

1825
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,191
Takes me back.

1826
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,676
Did you ever smoke dope?

1827
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,716
Tried it a few times.

1828
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,118
We used to.

1829
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,956
Me and my best friend, Monica.

1830
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,670
Don't see her any more.

1831
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,671
Did you like the Beatles?

1832
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,913
They were all right.

1833
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,994
I was more Elvis. Jerry Lee Lewis.

1834
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,632
Yeah.

1835
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,433
# I'm all shook up

1836
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,549
Heh.

1837
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,239
Have you got any children?

1838
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:23,554
Got a son.

1839
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,153
Is he married?

1840
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,508
Don't know.

1841
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,831
You got kids?

1842
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,233
No.

1843
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,512
Unfortunately.

1844
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,111
Have you got to go back soon?

1845
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,753
Yeah. Got a few things to sort out.

1846
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,830
I don't suppose your son will help you.

1847
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,711
Nah.

1848
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:23,311
I could come up and give you a hand,
if you like.

1849
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,157
Have you got to move?

1850
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:26,996
No.

1851
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,076
I could take a few days off work.

1852
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,712
Are you warm enough?

1853
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,830
Oh, I'll be all right.

1854
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,996
We'll just finish these.

1855
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,875
Oh, do you know Ken?

1856
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,592
Ken?

1857
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,119
Yeah.

1858
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,196
Yeah. Did he go to the funeral?

1859
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:03,639
No.

1860
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,676
He's a bit weird, isn't he?

1861
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,589
Is he?

1862
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,872
I don't really smoke.

1863
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:28,350
I had too much to drink last night.

1864
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,755
I had a bit of a bad day.

1865
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,917
My car broke down.
It had to be towed away.

1866
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,396
They said it wasn't worth repairing.
They gave me 20 quid for it.

1867
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:43,069
- That's not much.
- No. What can you do with 20 quid?

1868
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,994
I bought myself a bottle of champagne.

1869
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,109
Yeah?

1870
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,312
Yeah.

1871
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,318
Did you finish it?

1872
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,314
Yeah, I did.

1873
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,112
Huh.

1874
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,911
(Mary sniffles)

1875
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,755
I might have to have a little bit of a lie down.

1876
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,428
It's really lovely
to have someone to talk to.

1877
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,793
Yeah.

1878
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,351
It's peaceful here.

1879
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,634
I might move away somewhere else.

1880
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,071
Start again.

1881
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,236
I used to work in Majorca.

1882
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,558
They'll be back soon.

1883
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,511
Oh, yeah.

1884
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,718
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1885
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,238
(low conversation, door opens)

1886
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,672
(laughter)

1887
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,631
- Hello, Ronnie.
- We're back.

1888
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,634
Hi, Gerri.

1889
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,271
- Hello, Mary.
- Bloody hell!

1890
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,629
- Hi, Tom.
- What are you doing here?

1891
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,435
Well, I just thought I'd...

1892
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,078
Just get my boots off.

1893
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,552
- Where'd she spring from?
- Bloody nuisance, especially today.

1894
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,511
You're not kidding.

1895
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,513
(sighs)

1896
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:22,551
- Are you all right, Gerri?
- Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

1897
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,673
Did you drive?

1898
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,631
Oh, no. I came on the tube.

1899
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,193
Did you?

1900
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,355
It might have been nice
if you'd phoned first, Mary.

1901
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,311
Oh, I'm really sorry.

1902
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,560
- Joe and Katie are coming.
- Yeah, Ronnie said.

1903
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,471
All righty.

1904
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:02,348
TOM: Tea, Ronnie?
- Yeah.

1905
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:12,235
GERRI: Come and sit yourself down, Mary,
and have a cup of tea.

1906
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,071
(motor racing on TV)

1907
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:25,830
(channels change)

1908
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,791
How's it going?

1909
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,796
Inexorably.

1910
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:46,230
- I don't know what to do.
- Well, if you don't, I don't.

1911
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,191
I can't just chuck her out.

1912
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,797
- Can't you?
- No.

1913
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,673
- Look at the state of her.
- I know. Poor woman.

1914
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,635
Joe and Katie will be all right.
They can handle her.

1915
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,194
I know. I've got enough food for her.

1916
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,834
- That's all right, then.
- Oh, well, here goes.

1917
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,391
(approaching footsteps)

1918
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,112
- Do you want me to give you a hand?
- No, thank you, Mary.

1919
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,077
Would you like to stay for a bite to eat?

1920
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,997
No, it's OK. I don't want to be in the way.

1921
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,076
You won't be. We've got plenty of food.

1922
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,071
Are you still angry with me?

1923
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:38,639
Mary, I wasn't angry with you.
I just felt you'd let me down.

1924
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,591
Oh, Gerri.

1925
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,671
I'd never want to do that.

1926
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,233
I'm really sorry.

1927
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,191
Yes, and I know you apologised.

1928
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,599
I miss you.

1929
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,356
I mean, I know I see you at work,

1930
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,960
but we don't seem to talk to each other
any more.

1931
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,790
- I feel terrible.
- This is my family, Mary.

1932
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,671
You've got to understand that.

1933
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,631
(sobs):
I do.

1934
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,159
Oh... Come here.

1935
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,751
(Mary sobs)

1936
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,359
You have to take responsibility
for your actions.

1937
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,311
I know.

1938
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:49,591
Now, listen, Mary.

1939
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,195
You need to talk to somebody.

1940
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,151
Oh, no, I don't want to do that.

1941
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,437
- Well, I think it would help you.
- I just want to talk to you.

1942
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,029
Why don't I have a word
with one of my colleagues?

1943
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,674
As long as we're friends,
then I'm all right.

1944
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,679
Well, that's beside the point. You need
independent, professional help.

1945
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,597
You'd be much happier.

1946
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,718
Let's talk about it on Tuesday.

1947
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,671
- Yeah.
- And you have a think.

1948
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,351
Yeah, we could have a drink.

1949
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,311
Why don't you help me lay the table?

1950
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,791
He's really nice Ronnie, isn't he?

1951
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,432
Hello. I saw you through the window.

1952
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:56,959
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

1953
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,718
- I'm fine, how are you?
- I'm good.

1954
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:01,593
- Katie, lovely to see you.
- Ahh, lovely to see you.

1955
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,119
- How are you?
- Fine.

1956
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,071
(mouths):
Mary's here.

1957
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,190
- Hello!
- Aha!

1958
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,155
- We brought you some chocolates.
- Good. Ha-ha!

1959
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,634
- Oh, no, give them back!
- You'll never see them again.

1960
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,750
- Can I take your things?
- Yeah, cheers.

1961
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,711
(chuckles)

1962
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,752
TOM:
Dear, dear.

1963
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,439
I've got the longest scarf in the world.
Sorry.

1964
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,994
- And a tea cosy on my head.
- Come and meet Ronnie.

1965
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,837
- Oh, great.
- Mary's here.

1966
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,869
Oh!

1967
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,512
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

1968
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,073
- Good, thanks.
- Excellent.

1969
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,314
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

1970
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,555
Hi, you must be Ronnie.
I've heard a lot about you.

1971
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,477
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Hello.

1972
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,033
- This is Katie.
- My big brother.

1973
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:42,150
- Ah, brilliant.
- What are we having to drink?

1974
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,760
- I'll have what everyone else is having.
- Red wine for me.

1975
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,438
- We're having fish.
- I'll have white.

1976
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,835
- I'll have white wine as well, please.
- Beer, Ronnie?

1977
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,359
- Yeah.
- White wine, Mary?

1978
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,039
- Yeah, please, if that's all right?
TOM: I'll do that, Gez.

1979
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,275
JOE:
I'll get you a beer, Ronnie.

1980
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,993
So, I hear you're a massive Derby fan, Ronnie.

1981
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,917
- Er... yeah.
- Great club.

1982
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,394
I'm a Palace supporter myself, for my sins.

1983
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:06,069
I still hope we might crash back through
to the Premiership, at some point.

1984
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,792
What do you reckon
to Derby's chances?

1985
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:10,195
- I don't know, not so bad.
- Well, fingers crossed.

1986
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,394
TOM: We met on our first day
at university in Manchester.

1987
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,431
Oh, your first day!

1988
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,311
We were in the same halls of residence.

1989
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,998
GERRI: We met on the stairs.
- Yeah.

1990
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,031
I was falling down them,
she was going up them.

1991
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:33,231
- I was falling up them.
TOM: Things haven't changed, then.

1992
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:39,629
And Tom's first job, when we left uni,
was abroad for two years.

1993
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:42,194
- Did you try not to take it personally?
- (laughter)

1994
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,708
We came down to London, didn't we?
For about nine months.

1995
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:48,639
I got my first geologist's job
in Western Australia in the outback.

1996
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,396
Right.

1997
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,351
It was him
and a load of Australian cowboys.

1998
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:55,439
- It was like the Wild West out there.
- Yeah, all cork hats and beers.

1999
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,677
- You've worked in Australia, Katie.
- Yeah, I worked in Sydney for a year.

2000
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:02,315
I had a wonderful time. They know
how to enjoy themselves, the Aussies.

2001
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,588
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

2002
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,677
And you came out and visited,
didn't you, my first Christmas holiday?

2003
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,631
Yeah.
We spent Christmas on the beach.

2004
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,318
- Barbie on the beach?
- Yeah.

2005
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:14,148
And when Tom had finished after
two years, I joined him again and we...

2006
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,794
- You went on your grand tour.
...we came back overland.

2007
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,990
Yeah. It took us seven months, I think.

2008
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,679
We got the boat
from Fremantle to Singapore

2009
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,553
and then Singapore to Malaysia
and then onto Thailand.

2010
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,750
GERRI: Thailand. Burma.
JOE: And to India.

2011
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,155
- I'd love to go to India.
- We went trekking in Nepal.

2012
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,317
TOM: Nepal, trekking in Nepal.
The beach at Goa.

2013
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:35,397
- Wonderful, holiday of a lifetime.
- Pakistan.

2014
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,113
- Afghanistan. Iran.
TOM & GERRI: Turkey.

2015
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:40,674
- Over to the Greek Islands.
- Greek Islands.

2016
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:44,076
The wonderful thing was, because
I'd been in... two years working in Australia,

2017
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,669
and earning relatively good money,
and nothing to spend it on, really.

2018
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:50,188
So, we didn't have to do it
on a really tight budget.

2019
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,993
Some people could just hitch,
but we could get buses and trains.

2020
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,634
- Yeah, yeah.
KATIE: It must have made a difference.

2021
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,752
TOM: You've been to the Greek Islands,
haven't you, Mary?

2022
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,633
- Yeah.
- Which island was it?

2023
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:04,477
- Corfu.
- Yeah.

2024
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:08,229
- What were you doing on Corfu?
- Oh, I only ran a bar on the beach.

2025
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,350
JOE: You were a cocktail waitress?
- Yeah.

2026
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,719
(laughter)

2027
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,957
GERRI: When are you going to Paris?
KATIE: Oh, a week on Friday.

2028
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,035
JOE:
Yeah.

2029
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:19,277
- We've got an early start, 6:22 train.
TOM: Oh, no.

2030
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:21,231
- Yeah.
KATIE: We get in at Paris, what is it?

2031
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,191
- About quarter to ten?
- Yeah, 9:50.

2032
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:26,357
- Have breakfast by the Seine.
TOM: Have you got your hotel booked?

2033
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,994
KATIE: Yeah, we've got a lovely hotel.
TOM: Very nice, yeah.

2034
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,395
KATIE: Beautiful. In the Marais area.
- Oh, yeah?

2035
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,351
It will be brilliant for Christmas shopping.

2036
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,960
TOM: When are you coming back?
KATIE: On Sunday.

2037
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,560
- Short weekend.
- Not enough time to do all the things.

2038
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,511
JOE: We'll cram it all in.
- We'll try.

2039
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,074
GERRI: You can walk everywhere.
KATIE: Yeah, yeah.

2040
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,475
(conversation fades out)
