00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,070
At this basketball game once,
we were all chanting...

157
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,977
"We're number one!
We're number one," right?

158
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,450
So I see Morrie a couple rows down, he's
eyeing us, he's giving us all this look.

159
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,782
All of a sudden
he stands up and says...

160
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,788
"What's wrong
with being number two?"

161
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,189
He actually wanted to discuss that
right in the middle of the game.

162
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,194
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

163
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,756
Made a really big difference in my life,
and I never even thanked him.

164
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:05,361
Well, you talk about him
as if he were already dead.
You could still go see him.

165
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,430
He's in Boston. When am I
gonna find time to go to Boston?

166
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,941
Well, make time, if he
meant that much to you.

167
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,538
You're on the road half your life.
Why can't you make time
for one trip to Boston?

168
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,107
- Why are you getting upset?
- Why do you have such a problem
making time in your life...

169
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,949
- Hey, you're that guy
Mitch Albom, right?
- Yeah. Hey...

- Guys, I'm in the middle here.

the truth is,
it's too late.

176
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,836

sent the guy a postcard.
How am I gonna face him now?

- [Crowd Cheering]
- Mitch, think...

178
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,978
Hey, think of him. Think about
how much it would mean to him.

179
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,145
At least call him.

Oh, you... You wanted to hit me.

1252
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:47,219
- This is for that " B" you gave
me sophomore year, Morrie.
- [Laughing]

1253
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,223
When did I ever...

1254
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,226
give you... a " B"?

1257

given the opportunity
to learn them.

1258
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,406
But how do we know we're
gonna be able to keep them?

1259
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,913
I know I will, Mr. Albom.

1260
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:16,417
I've had real excellent counseling,
and I've learned from my mistakes.

1261
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,385
It's like I had
my whole life given back to me.

1262
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,820
- When they dropped the drug charges?
- Yes, sir.

We need you down here!

1265
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,227
How can we ever be sure
we've learned anything, though?

1266
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:33,734
Well, like I said, I learned my lesson.
I'm never gonna forget.

Thanks for your time.

1269
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,507

<i>We made the best of it.</i>

1275
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:23,482
<i>We called Morrie.</i>
<i>He cried, of course...</i>

1276
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,350

1279

<i>[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>So, I'm typing up the thesis.</i>

1280
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,772
What there is of it, anyway.

1281
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,298
- Thought you might want
to read it over.
- Okay.

1282
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,004
- 'Course we're not finished yet.
- No.

1283
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,974
So I had a thought.
It was kind of weird.

1284
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:01,250
- Wait-Wait, I don't think
the tape is rolling.
- Oh.

1285
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,685
Okay, so, weird thought.

1286
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:09,162
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, if somebody could
wave a magic wand...

1287
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:14,999
and give you one day...
24 hours of perfect health...

1288
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:19,131
- how would you spend it?
- That's a weird thought?

1289
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,438
That's a good thought.
[Laughs] Oh... [Inhales]

1290
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,411
Twenty-four hours?

1291
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:34,383
- Care to share it with the world?
- <i>Well</i>...

1292
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:37,220
I'd have a lovely breakfast:

1293
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,318
Sweet rolls and tea.

1294
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:44,195
Then a good swim.

1295
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:48,100
I'd ask my friends for lunch,
a great lunch. You know, but...

1296
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,969
A salad or something simple.

1297
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,201
And then we'd take
a walk in a park...

1298
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:58,474
with trees,
so we could watch the birds.

1299
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:03,677
And we'd talk about how much
we meant to each other.

1300
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:09,590
And for dinner, I'd take 'em
to a place that had great pasta.

1301
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,126
Oh, boy.

1302
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:15,253
And a little duck. Yeah, I love duck.
Do you like duck?

1303
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,629
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

1304
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:21,134
And then I would dance.

1305
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:26,299
Oh, I'd dance
with my lovely partners...

1306
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,309
till I was exhausted.

1307
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,404
Then go home,
and I'd have a great sleep.

1308
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,112
That's it?
That's your perfect day, huh?

1309
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:41,587
- Uh...
- Sounds pretty simple.

1310
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,590
Oh, yeah.

1311
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:47,957
What about Charlotte and your sons?
You didn't mention them.

1312
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,497
Well, I don't
have to mention them.

1313
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:55,093
I mean, if they weren't there, how
could it be a perfect day? [Chuckles]

1314
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,901
Oh, I-I picked
the spot to be buried.

1315
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,772
<i>It's on a hill under a tree.</i>

1316
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:05,176
It's got a pond.
Great place to think.

1317
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,807
[Chuckles] You plannin' on doin'
a lot of thinkin' there?

1318
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:12,409
I plan on being dead there.

1319
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:17,116
<i>Will you come and visit,</i>
<i>tell me your problems?</i>

1320
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:22,219
Won't be quite the same,
not hearing you talk.

1321
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,061
Well, I'll tell you what...

1322
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:29,126
when I'm dead,
you talk, I'll listen.

1323
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:34,141
What if, uh, you know,
after you're, uh...

1324
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,811
What if all this was just...
What if...

1325
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,815
What if all this was
just wasted on me?

1326
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,181
Well, you think
that could happen?

1327
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:49,383
Well, out in the world...
you know, outside this room...
things aren't so clear.

1328
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:52,483
Your wisdom and your aphorisms...

1329
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,120
"Once you learn how to die,
you learn how to live."

1330
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,596
What if you can't learn that?

1331
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:01,362
What if you just want to run like hell
when you see death coming?

1332
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:04,530
What if, uh, we're like
your father, you know?

1333
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:08,599
What if we can't learn it
because we're not really like you?

1334
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:13,943
- Yeah, but you are like me.
Everybody is.
- Nobody's like you.

1335
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:19,317
And if it took your death
to teach me these things,
then I'd rather not learn 'em.

1336
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:22,948
All the things you said, I'd give
'em back in one minute. [Sniffles]

1337
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:28,194
- If this wasn't happening to you...
- It's happening.

1338
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:31,858
- It's-It's going to happen.
- Yeah, well, I don't want it to happen.

1339
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,867
I don't want you to die.

1340
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:38,167
That poem you're always quoting,
"We have to love one another or die"?

1341
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,434
We die anyway, don't we?

1342
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:44,205
We learn to love somebody
and they die, or-or we die or it dies.

1343
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,716
What's the point? Wha... What do we
learn really from all that suffering?

1344
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,413
Hold.

1345
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:59,123
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry.

1346
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:03,228
I just can't accept it.
I don't want you to die.

1347
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,893
I guess I flunked
the course, huh?

1348
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:13,271
Death ends a life,
not a relationship.

1349
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:21,071
Poor Mitch, you still don't know
how to say good-bye, do you?

1350
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:24,676
<i>Look at me.</i>

1351
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:26,720
[Sighs]

1352
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:31,725
Don't you understand?
You touched me.

1353
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:37,497
What if you hadn't
come back to see me? Huh?

1354
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,730
This is the way
we say good-bye.

1355
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:56,876
- Love you.
- [Shudders] I love you too, Coach.

1356
01:25:56,951 --> 01:26:01,320
I know. You wanna
know something else?

1357
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:04,153
You always will.

1358
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:08,662
[Sniffling]

1359
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,960
I'm gonna come back
next Tuesday, okay?

1360
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:15,560
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna bring, Janine
with me, okay, next Tuesday.

1361
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:20,973
- Yeah.
- [Weeping]
