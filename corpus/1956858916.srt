1
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,978
<i>No, I can't shoot this.</i>

2
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:23,995
<i>This is private.
This is private.</i>

3
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,987
<i>This is not important
to show. Okay.</i>

4
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,984
Clear the way.

5
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,008
Here we go.

6
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,989
Good morning, world.

7
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:34,982
Good morning, Evan.

8
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,986
Mikey. Get a shot of Mike.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,980
Good morning, Mike.

10
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:39,981
Good morning, D.

11
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:40,986
Good morning.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,002
Good morning, Michael.

13
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:44,987
So, Evan, where do you want me
to stand for the shot?

14
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,978
Uh...

15
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,984
Where do you want me to stand?

16
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,988
Right here? EVAN: A little back.

17
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,979
Take another step back? Yeah.

18
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,006
Big step back. Oh, no.

19
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,995
Oh, I'm so mad now.

20
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,004
Oh.

21
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:02,029
We'll see you later.

22
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,991
Whoo...

23
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:09,004
Look at the sky.

24
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,989
Okay, I'll interview you, Mom.

25
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:12,992
Okay, hi.

26
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:14,002
How do you like the trip?

27
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,029
I love this trip,

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,987
but I don't love it more
than you.

29
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,981
Are you sure? Yeah.

30
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,981
Paradise. I like paradise.

31
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:22,989
There's Daddy.

32
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:23,997
Dad, Yeah.

33
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,995
What do you think
about the trip?

34
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,985
Well, you know,

35
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,984
I'm really glad you asked me
that question, Evan.

36
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,985
Since I like this trip so much,

37
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:34,999
you know what it makes me do?

38
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:36,002
What?

39
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:38,998
It makes me want to jump
right over you.

40
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:41,007
Whoa...

41
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,027
- Very impressive.
- Yes.

42
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,019
So now we're going
to get the house.

43
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:53,001
There's Michael's room.

44
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,996
And we're getting closer
to Michael,

45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,022
the sleeping baby.

46
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,010
How do you like
the trip, Michael?

47
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:08,005
So now you have to meet

48
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:10,983
the cameraman.

49
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,987
Am I good or am I bad?

50
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,016
We'll have that in...

51
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,027
5.5 seconds.

52
00:03:58,014 --> 00:03:58,996
I was at my, uh...

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,985
In my room in my boarding
school when my, uh...

54
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:02,989
My dad called me

55
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,998
and told that Evan
had jumped out of the...

56
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,980
Out of his window.

57
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,028
It was sort of
the third week of school,

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,990
I think, that he...

59
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,029
He chose to take his life.

60
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:57,979
I went into my mother's room

61
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,995
and...

62
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,988
I realized the sentence that
had to come out of my mouth.

63
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,002
I had to communicate to them

64
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,986
why I was coming in there

65
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,998
and why I was reaching out
for them and...

66
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:11,996
You know, I had to say,

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,015
"Evan's killed himself."

68
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,979
One of the things
that you do, I think...

69
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:54,003
Or at least that I do
unconsciously,

70
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:58,992
to avoid things that are
really too painful to...

71
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,028
confront.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,996
...is just black them out.

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,988
<i>How... How can
you understand doing that?</i>

74
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,992
<i>It doesn't seem possible.</i>

75
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:12,981
<i>What on Earth has happened
to make your son so miserable</i>

76
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,983
<i>that he doesn't want
to be there anymore.</i>

77
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,002
<i>We'll never know
what was in Evan's head</i>

78
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,029
<i>the night he killed himself.</i>

79
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,987
<i>The mystery will always be</i>

80
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,991
what his thought was
when he was on the ledge.

81
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:44,987
You know,
as he put one foot over the...

82
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:45,997
The window,

83
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:48,000
and made that decision.

84
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,979
<i>Maybe he started to realize that</i>

85
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,980
<i>his mental illness
was so powerful</i>

86
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,990
<i>and that he couldn't win.</i>

87
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,992
<i>"He that raised up Jesus
from the dead</i>

88
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:03,987
<i>"will also give life
to our mortal bodies,</i>

89
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,002
"in the sure and certain hope

90
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,004
"of the resurrection
to eternal life

91
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,991
"through our Lord Jesus Christ,

92
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:13,979
"we commend to almighty God
our brother Evan,

93
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,990
"and we commit his body
to the ground.

94
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:18,979
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

95
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:20,027
dust to dust."

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,979
Amen.

97
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,979
Amen.

98
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,990
<i>How's it possible</i>

99
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:27,996
<i>that I found myself
at his funeral</i>

100
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>holding my baby
for the last time?</i>

101
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,981
<i>The day Evan was born</i>

102
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,015
<i>was the happiest day of my life.</i>

103
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:00,990
<i>It's indescribable.</i>

104
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,984
<i>It-it was indescribable
happiness</i>

105
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,999
<i>to finally see him,
because when you're pregnant</i>

106
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,998
<i>you start to have
a relationship with the baby</i>

107
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,985
<i>and it's, like,
moving around and...</i>

108
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,004
<i>You know, who are you?
Knock-knock.</i>

109
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,012
<i>Who's there?</i>

110
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:15,994
And then he comes out and, uh,

111
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:17,997
Evan was particularly pretty.

112
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:20,993
<i>I just fell in love
with him right away.</i>

113
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,005
<i>- Well, I actually filmed
- Evan getting born</i>

114
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,999
and I was very excited.

115
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:47,028
As I recall, I gave
the camera to the doctor

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,024
<i>and he did a shot also.</i>

117
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,001
<i>I was 26 when Evan was born.</i>

118
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,002
<i>Hart was 42,
he already had a son</i>

119
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,996
<i>from a previous relationship.</i>

120
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>But Evan was my first.</i>

121
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:04,983
<i>Hart and I are filmmakers</i>

122
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,997
<i>and at that time Hart was
shooting away a lot</i>

123
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,978
<i>and he was gone
a lot of the time.</i>

124
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,982
<i>So Evan and I ended up
being alone together.</i>

125
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,981
<i>He was young, I was young.</i>

126
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,985
<i>We were like these two
little creatures,</i>

127
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,991
<i>trying to help each other out
a little bit.</i>

128
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,003
Yes.

129
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,005
Yes.

130
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,029
What's this?

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,985
Okay, we...

132
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,982
We're gonna have
an interview with the mom.

133
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,997
So, Mom...

134
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:31,991
what do you think
about your kid?

135
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:32,994
Kid?

136
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,992
Oh, yeah, this thing.

137
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:37,982
Well, think that...
I think that it's really

138
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,984
just the most special thing,

139
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,992
to give him big kisses.

140
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,993
Really, I think
that's the best part

141
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,005
of it all.

142
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,998
<i>- I remember the first time
- I met Evan.</i>

143
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,991
Dana had come home
from the hospital.

144
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,981
I think I had actually
been away with my mother

145
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:01,004
while he was born
and my dad came

146
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,993
and picked
me up at my apartment.

147
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,004
<i>I was living on Mercer Street
with my mom.</i>

148
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,996
<i>And he said,</i>

149
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,980
<i>"We're going to meet
your little brother."</i>

150
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,978
There's this photograph
of me, um,

151
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,990
taken during my first
encounter with Evan

152
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:19,000
and my expression
sort of sums it all up.

153
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,989
<i>It's, "what the fuck is this?"</i>

154
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,982
<i>Sort of holding this baby
in my arms thinking,</i>

155
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,993
<i>you know,
"where did he come from?"</i>

156
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:30,005
So... So what...?
Who's your brother?

157
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,029
Nicky.

158
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,241
Do you like your brother Nicky?

159
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,981
So how old are you, Evan?

160
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,003
Um... I old...

161
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,984
I older.

162
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:40,997
You're older? How old?

163
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,985
Um, really old.

164
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,995
Look at Daddy. Look at Daddy's
camera when you say that.

165
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,986
I'm really old.

166
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,989
You're really old? How old?

167
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:50,028
Like, big old.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,995
Are you big? Yeah.

169
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,000
How big are you?

170
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:54,981
T...

171
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,989
Real big?

172
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,028
Big as a dinosaur?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,984
<i>I remember his first</i>

174
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,989
word that he used over
and over and over again,

175
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:02,991
was, "no."

176
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,985
<i>And we used to joke it was "no"</i>

177
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,987
<i>because he heard
the word "no" so much</i>

178
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:10,000
<i>because as soon
as he was walking around</i>

179
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:12,028
<i>he would get into everything.</i>

180
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:17,004
Aw...

181
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,980
Oh, how cute.

182
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,988
Evan, no, no. No.

183
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:26,001
Be gentle.

184
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,978
Oh, come on. "Please let me
punch him in the nose."

185
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,001
<i>I think I understood
from an early time</i>

186
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,997
<i>that he was a challenging kid.</i>

187
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,011
Russell, Russell.

188
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,992
<i>Getting dressed in the morning
I knew was a challenge</i>

189
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,993
<i>if he didn't have
the right outfit,</i>

190
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:46,983
<i>you know, you weren't gonna
be leaving the house</i>

191
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,007
<i>for a very long time.</i>

192
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,029
<i>One summer we were in Nantucket</i>

193
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,994
<i>and we were trying to leave
the beach at the end of the day</i>

194
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,984
<i>and I think it took us
45 minutes</i>

195
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:00,999
<i>to get the towels in the baskets</i>

196
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,992
<i>and start walking home
from the beach</i>

197
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,984
<i>because Evan wanted
the towels to be folded</i>

198
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:07,998
<i>a certain way,</i>

199
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,994
<i>and put in the basket
a certain way</i>

200
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,982
<i>and if they weren't</i>

201
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,005
<i>he would dump them out
in the sand</i>

202
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,005
<i>and he'd say,
"Start over, start over."</i>

203
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,979
<i>That was his big phrase.</i>

204
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,981
<i>He was a perfectionist.</i>

205
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:23,981
<i>And this persisted
throughout his whole life.</i>

206
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:26,029
<i>If he wasn't absolutely
the best at something,</i>

207
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,994
<i>then he would get frustrated.</i>

208
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,986
And discipline was
pretty much impossible.

209
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,983
I mean, the way
we used to handle it

210
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,984
is we'd say, okay,
so you have time-out

211
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:36,997
and put him in his room.

212
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,990
Well, you put him
in his room for time-out

213
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:41,983
it's like, you know,
Keith Moon in a hotel room.

214
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,978
You know,
the TV set's out the window,

215
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,997
bookshelves are, you know...

216
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,979
Crashing over.

217
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,002
And you come in and it's,
like, totally destroyed

218
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:53,999
and do you think he's at all...?

219
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:56,028
Uh, you know,
feels bad about it?

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,995
No, it's like,
"Okay, so put me in prison.

221
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,028
I wanna go to prison."

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,985
<i>There is no doubt in my mind</i>

223
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,005
<i>that he had
psychological issues.</i>

224
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,996
I guess the best way
I can describe it is

225
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,993
he lacked emotional
shock absorbers.

226
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,983
<i>And because of that</i>

227
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,003
<i>would react to situations</i>

228
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:18,996
<i>that you and I would see
as insignificant</i>

229
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,980
<i>in a really, really big way.</i>

230
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,005
<i>Well, really, it was almost like</i>

231
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,988
<i>there were two Evans.</i>

232
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,003
<i>He would be, on the one hand,
tantrumming</i>

233
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:32,998
<i>and being completely
impossible to reach.</i>

234
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,982
<i>On the other hand,
being this wonderful,</i>

235
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,987
<i>vibrant, vivacious kid.</i>

236
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:45,988
<i>Hello.</i>

237
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,002
Hello. What's your name?

238
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,998
My name is RoboCop,
what's yours?

239
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,981
Nobody.

240
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:52,996
Well, I'm pullin' you over,

241
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,984
Nobody, 'cause you're speeding.

242
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,990
Ease up on the throttle.

243
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:57,995
Okay, good night.

244
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,978
Have sweet dreams, goodbye.

245
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,978
<i>I mean, he was so much fun
to be around</i>

246
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,986
<i>and when Michael was born</i>

247
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,002
<i>Evan was thrilled.</i>

248
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,993
<i>He finally had a playmate.</i>

249
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,002
<i>They were roommates</i>

250
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,988
<i>and he adored Michael.</i>

251
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,983
Hi, it's me Evan.

252
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:19,009
That's my little brother
and that's my mom.

253
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,004
And what are they doing?

254
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:23,999
My mom's talk...

255
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,991
Trying to talk to somebody,

256
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:29,021
Michael's just sucking
on his pacifier.

257
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,005
I couldn't take 'em out

258
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,992
'cause that was
too hard to open.

259
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,995
- Okay, what's...?
- What's Michael saying?

260
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,028
He's saying that...

261
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,996
"I wanna get that dog."

262
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,000
That's what he's saying.

263
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,981
Okay, Evan, you wanna film now?

264
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,983
Yeah. Okay.

265
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,991
And that's...

266
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,995
formula.

267
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,979
There's a green shirt,

268
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,002
guess who, it's Daddy.

269
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,989
Four eyes.

270
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,978
Oh, there's inside the toilet.

271
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,013
And there's under the bed,
let's go see.

272
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,999
We see red gloves,

273
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,000
we see some socks.

274
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,004
Ready? HART: I'm ready.

275
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,984
Okay, action.

276
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:12,986
<i>He learned how to read
very quickly,</i>

277
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,980
<i>he loved books.</i>

278
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:17,980
<i>He loved talking
about what he was reading.</i>

279
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,979
And he was a great companion,
you know,

280
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:20,988
when you were doin' something.

281
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,988
Going on a trip...

282
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:23,996
<i>He was a guy who was,</i>

283
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,018
<i>you know, good for an adventure.</i>

284
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:30,981
All right, Hart.

285
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,979
Hart. And Evan.

286
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,981
I know, it's tough. And Evan.

287
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,983
And Evan.

288
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,023
He's a big one.

289
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,989
Beautiful.

290
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,994
Let's see
the triumphant fishermen.

291
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,992
Yes, Nicholas.

292
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:49,003
Yay!

293
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,982
What do you think, Evan?

294
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:51,998
What do you think?

295
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:53,993
Goody!

296
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:54,997
My camera.

297
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,986
Aw, poor baby boy.

298
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,001
He needs to go
to Mommy for help.

299
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,987
<i>Evan was incredibly
affectionate,</i>

300
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,990
<i>he was very physical.</i>

301
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,003
<i>Very cuddly. Always cuddling up.</i>

302
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:11,004
Ev, are you a little baby
still in Mommy's tummy?

303
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:14,028
Uh-huh. You haven't even
been born yet, have you?

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,001
<i>You have to take
that intense sweetness</i>

305
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,989
<i>and l... You know, sensitivity,</i>

306
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,093
<i>and just completely upended</i>

307
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,018
<i>into the darkest, scariest...</i>

308
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,024
Uh...

309
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:34,000
Scary, scary.
That's all I can say.

310
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:37,989
Scary person, scary soul.

311
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,978
The darkest of souls.

312
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,984
<i>When Evan was in kindergarten</i>

313
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,981
<i>I got a call
from the after-school teacher.</i>

314
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:48,987
<i>She was really concerned</i>

315
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:51,009
<i>about him talking about suicide.</i>

316
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,004
<i>I met Evan when he was 5,</i>

317
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,994
and he came to our program...
Performing arts school.

318
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,029
And, um,

319
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,801
he was probably the cutest kid
I've ever seen.

320
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,001
<i>You try not to have favorites</i>

321
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,987
<i>but sometimes it just happens</i>

322
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:11,028
<i>and he happened to be
all the teachers' favorite.</i>

323
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,001
<i>He was just one of the most
loving, creative kids,</i>

324
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:16,011
<i>I've ever met.</i>

325
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:18,993
Very righteous

326
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,998
and everything had to be fair.

327
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:24,981
<i>And if someone was giving
anyone a hard time</i>

328
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,003
<i>he would be the first one
to break it up</i>

329
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:27,992
<i>and say, "Do you think
that was fair?</i>

330
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,016
<i>It wasn't fair."</i>

331
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,997
<i>But when he was 5
and he was in the younger group</i>

332
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:38,025
<i>he was obsessed with dying.</i>

333
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:40,989
You know, jumping out the window

334
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,002
and saying, "I'll kill myself."

335
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:44,985
And he said
a relative had done that.

336
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,004
<i>Every day in group,
he would bring that up.</i>

337
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:50,979
<i>And he would say,
"I wanna jump out the window."</i>

338
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:52,996
<i>He'd say, "I don't care
if I die. I don't care."</i>

339
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,989
<i>And I said, "Well,
what about me?"</i>

340
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,992
<i>And he said,
"Well, I'd feel bad for you</i>

341
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,979
<i>"and my parents,
but I wouldn't mind</i>

342
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,001
<i>'cause I won't feel anything."</i>

343
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:02,997
And he would sit in my lap

344
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:05,987
and have his arm,
you know, around me

345
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,002
and he would talk about it,
he said,

346
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,001
"No, I would...
I would jump out."

347
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,003
You know, like... I'm like, wh...?

348
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:13,991
You know, without being upset,
without...

349
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:16,996
You know, just being loving
and affectionate and...

350
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,995
And I said, "Evan,
that's just weird talk."

351
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,004
All right? You know, come on.

352
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,018
That's... That's just weird.

353
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,001
<i>I've seen depressed kids</i>

354
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:26,005
<i>and I've seen,
you know, hyper kids.</i>

355
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,028
<i>But not kids who talk about...</i>

356
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,978
<i>you know, dying.</i>

357
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,987
He was just curious about death.

358
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:36,001
And even obsessed with it.

359
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:40,003
<i>The thing about Evan's
obsession with death</i>

360
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:42,028
<i>was that it was
so matter-of-fact.</i>

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,996
<i>A lot of times
it was just casual.</i>

362
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,991
Um, we're in Hawaii.

363
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:49,985
We were just snorkeling, I saw...

364
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,992
Uh, we saw an eel,

365
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,987
and now we're gonna go
look at some whales.

366
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:57,985
Maybe we can see
Moby Dick's son.

367
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:58,992
<i>Like, I remember</i>

368
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:01,979
one time in-in Hawaii...

369
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,994
We're just there snorkeling
or something

370
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:07,024
and he says something like,
"By the way, I've got a rifle."

371
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,996
Don't say this at home,

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,999
kids.

373
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,978
So what?

374
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,025
I got a rifle.

375
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,004
You got a rifle? Yeah.

376
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:20,983
What do you need a rifle for?

377
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:22,997
To shoot you.

378
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,988
And you just go, "what?"

379
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:27,985
Like, what do you mean to sh...?

380
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:28,997
I mean, that's not really funny.

381
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,985
It's not really expressed in a...

382
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,984
In a way that seems
attention-getting.

383
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,990
It seems like,

384
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:37,983
"Yeah. This is what
I think about."

385
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:41,982
"1997, Evan Perry.

386
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:44,003
"Perfectionistic, obsessive.

387
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:48,000
Doesn't like to have things..."

388
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:49,996
I stopped writing there.

389
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,995
"Good athlete, popular...

390
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,988
<i>When he was 5 we did start
seeing a psychiatrist.</i>

391
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,981
"Doing well in school.

392
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:00,005
Last year fighting, etc."

393
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,003
<i>And very early on,</i>

394
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,978
he diagnosed depression

395
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:05,000
in Evan and put him on Prozac.

396
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,003
We talked about Prozac,

397
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,991
September 25th, '97.

398
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,994
That was the heyday of where

399
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,028
people were
just really discovering

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,993
depression in children.

401
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:18,998
You know, before...
I don't know when.

402
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,979
When I started out training,

403
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,989
people didn't really think
children had depression.

404
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:23,992
It was just thought,

405
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,983
children don't get
depressed. Period.

406
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:27,984
I remember
when you prescribed Prozac

407
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:28,991
I was pretty surprised

408
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:30,986
because I'd never heard of that.

409
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,370
That was, like,
a really big thing.

410
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,979
"Positive, strong family history

411
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,001
of depression on both sides."

412
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,004
Should I say this part?
Or skip this?

413
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:41,028
"Parental uncle

414
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,990
committed suicide, age 21."

415
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,994
Your brother, yeah.

416
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:49,000
"Talks about death and murder."

417
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,998
He was just scary.
I don't know what to say.

418
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:54,002
He had already made
a suicide attempt.

419
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:55,996
Which one? "Ran to window

420
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,995
and threatened to jump
in front of parents," I wrote.

421
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,997
"Defiant, rebellious,
banged head.

422
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,983
"Threatened to kill
parents and brother.

423
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:06,993
I want cancer."

424
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:10,984
Well, he was such a baby,
you know, in the beginning.

425
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:11,993
He had such a baby face.

426
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:13,992
I mean, such a kind of...

427
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,991
Kind of, pink,
kind of, baby kid.

428
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:19,005
<i>And then it was this-that...</i>

429
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:21,999
<i>Kind of, visual contrast
between the...</i>

430
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:25,994
<i>You know, the demons inside him
and that, kind of, sweet look.</i>

431
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,979
<i>At one point,</i>

432
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:33,991
<i>I'd say, Evan was about...</i>

433
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:35,980
<i>Maybe 7 or 8.</i>

434
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,991
<i>He and I were home
and once again</i>

435
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:42,022
<i>he started to talk
about wanting to kill himself.</i>

436
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,985
A lot of times he would
tell me specifically

437
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:46,991
what he was gonna do.

438
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,003
He was gonna jump
out the window,

439
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:49,987
he was gonna jump
off a building,

440
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:51,002
he was gonna cut himself.

441
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,994
Or in this particular occasion,

442
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:55,001
he was gonna hang himself.

443
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,991
<i>He took this pillow thing</i>

444
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,028
<i>with a strap on it</i>

445
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,240
<i>and climbed up on his bunk bed,</i>

446
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,978
<i>then he affixed it up there.</i>

447
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:05,993
And then he put it
around his neck

448
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,004
and he showed me how he was
gonna jump off the bunk bed.

449
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:14,003
<i>He's gonna show Mom
how he's gonna hang himself,</i>

450
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,993
<i>right in front of her.</i>

451
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:19,029
<i>And I didn't let him.</i>

452
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,979
<i>But I'm tired of trying
to explain to people</i>

453
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:22,985
<i>what I'm hearing at home</i>

454
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,007
<i>and I'm just gonna record this.</i>

455
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:29,998
<i>I always felt so guilty
about taking those pictures,</i>

456
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:33,983
<i>but I was so tired
of explaining to people</i>

457
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,002
<i>my son wants to kill himself.</i>

458
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:40,996
I just needed some kind
of proof that, um...

459
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,999
That this is really happening.

460
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:46,008
Because it was
so impossible to believe.

461
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,979
Oh, God.

462
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:53,996
This is when
he tried to hang himself?

463
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah.

464
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,003
You know, there was a, uh...

465
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,981
idea that children
could not be suicidal

466
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,983
because they didn't understand
that death was, um,

467
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,002
irreversible.

468
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:17,004
<i>Um...</i>

469
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:20,002
I never really felt
like I knew Evan very well.

470
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,997
Um, he was the scariest kid
I ever saw in my life.

471
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:25,984
I'd never seen who'd been this...

472
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,982
Was this intent on, uh, death.

473
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,004
<i>It felt to me always
like there was</i>

474
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:36,004
<i>a mask or something there.</i>

475
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,982
And I remember that look
going over him.

476
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:41,012
That unreachable look.

477
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,991
<i>When Evan went through
a mood swing</i>

478
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:44,999
<i>his whole body changed.</i>

479
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,982
<i>His face changed,
his physical attitude changed.</i>

480
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:49,981
<i>His ability
to communicate changed.</i>

481
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,991
<i>And you literally saw it
in his face.</i>

482
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:54,993
<i>He became unreachable.</i>

483
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,997
<i>Hart and I started
to call it the fugue state.</i>

484
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:59,979
You'd sort of go like this:

485
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,028
<i>The physical change would be</i>

486
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,005
<i>like a slackening of his face.</i>

487
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:06,990
<i>It just wasn't engaged.</i>

488
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:08,998
<i>Something receded.</i>

489
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:11,988
And what you had was
this kind of thing:

490
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,020
This facade.

491
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,990
Some whales are real curious,
they come right up to the boat.

492
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:35,003
Some whales turn the other cheek
and leave, essentially.

493
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:37,991
<i>There was a tone of voice
that went along with it too.</i>

494
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:40,025
<i>A very flat tone of voice.</i>

495
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:45,019
They look like orcas to me.

496
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,001
Where'd you see the whale?

497
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:52,027
I saw it over there
and over there.

498
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:54,993
Pretty exciting seeing

499
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,005
the size of the whale,
wasn't it?

500
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,013
Yeah, it was cool.

501
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,023
<i>He could be very sullen.</i>

502
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,007
I... What do you mean?

503
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,017
Yeah, I am.

504
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:13,988
Five?

505
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:15,982
This is the sixth.

506
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,978
So this is pretty exciting...

507
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,979
<i>He definitely acted
like a teenager</i>

508
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:21,024
<i>at a very young age.</i>

509
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,993
You hungry?

510
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,983
Yeah.

511
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:29,007
Yeah, I want
a peanut butter sandwich.

512
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:35,005
There's my goddamn control.

513
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,981
What'd you say?

514
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,981
God. No, that's not nice.

515
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:41,986
<i>He seemed to have skipped
being a kid</i>

516
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,985
<i>and gone immediately
to being a adolescent.</i>

517
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,982
How was
the football game yesterday?

518
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,992
<i>That you expect
from your 15-year-old.</i>

519
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,980
You know,
"You're not the boss of me.

520
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:53,988
Come on, give me the car keys."

521
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,995
"Where you goin'?" "Out."

522
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,984
"What'd you do in school?"
"Nothin'."

523
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:57,994
I mean, that seems normal.

524
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,029
In a 7-year-old
it doesn't seem normal.

525
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,992
And he was very teenage it was...

526
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:05,989
Along with that though,
he was also very sophisticated.

527
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,688
<i>He did not have
a Britney Spears phase</i>

528
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,997
<i>he did not have
a Backstreet Boys phase,</i>

529
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:15,991
<i>he went straight to Dylan,
Neil Young, Nirvana.</i>

530
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:19,002
<i>And he wrote a lot of songs.</i>

531
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:34,982
<i>His lyrics touched on things
that you can't imagine</i>

532
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,994
<i>a kid that young
would even think about.</i>

533
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,999
Stop!

534
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,980
It's because I'm depressed.

535
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:31,003
Okay, that's it.

536
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,989
<i>- When he was maybe 8 or 9
- he kept a journal</i>

537
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,003
<i>and I saw it and took it out</i>

538
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:39,979
<i>and started reading it.</i>

539
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,980
<i>And there are these poems in it</i>

540
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:42,990
<i>essentially saying,</i>

541
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,001
<i>"I'm prepared for death.</i>

542
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:45,980
<i>I'm not afraid of death."</i>

543
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:46,986
<i>These really deep poems.</i>

544
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>And I was</i>

545
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:50,994
<i>probably 15-16</i>

546
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:52,978
and going through
my moody phase.

547
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:54,003
And I remember thinking, "Wow.

548
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:58,010
These are thoughts
I'm having right now."

549
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,989
<i>I felt there was something
really powerful</i>

550
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:03,978
<i>going on in his mind,</i>

551
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:05,999
<i>that he had a sensitivity,</i>

552
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:10,025
<i>a maturity that was
way beyond his years.</i>

553
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,987
<i>There's one play that Evan wrote</i>

554
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:17,979
<i>and his character was</i>

555
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:19,999
a depressed kid who just saw
the negativity in everything.

556
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,000
Hey, kid. Yeah?

557
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:24,994
It's not raining anymore.

558
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,004
Just give it some t...

559
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:28,984
Just give it some time,
it'll start up again.

560
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,002
<i>When he was 10 he said,</i>

561
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:32,981
"Let's do a play
about someone dying...

562
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:33,988
A boy dying."

563
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,979
I said, "Well,

564
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:36,991
what kind of story is that?"

565
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:39,028
He said, "What? It's a story
about a kid dying."

566
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,480
And all his friends
and they miss him.

567
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:44,990
How am I supposed to live
without you?

568
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:47,003
You were my big brother.

569
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,982
Who's gonna take care of me?

570
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:51,979
Walk me to school?

571
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,993
Calm me down when I'm upset?

572
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:56,986
Please, don't leave me.

573
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,004
We'll be there for you.

574
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,979
It will be okay.

575
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:01,003
I'll walk you to school.

576
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:02,994
I can't leave him!

577
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,982
<i>Evan came up with a story</i>

578
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:05,987
that didn't make any sense.

579
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,001
Just, someone died.

580
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:08,988
And, you know, that they cry.

581
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:11,989
You said you would
always be there for me.

582
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:12,992
Well, I need you

583
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:16,000
more than I ever have right now.

584
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,984
<i>I think he wanted the play</i>

585
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,003
<i>to be about the boy dying,</i>

586
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,984
<i>which obviously was
his character,</i>

587
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:25,996
<i>and to be able to see it
in a play</i>

588
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,978
<i>that everybody loves him.</i>

589
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:30,522
I know that.
<i>When you leave, it's like,</i>

590
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:31,994
<i>that's when everyone
gets together</i>

591
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,983
<i>and they miss you
and they honor you.</i>

592
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:34,997
He will always be with us.

593
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,989
You don't have to
look here, or in heaven.

594
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,989
Look in your heart
and he'll be there.

595
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,996
<i>So we decided to do the show</i>

596
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,983
and that's when, um...

597
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,979
you know, Evan attempted...

598
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:50,999
Or came close

599
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:53,981
to attempting suicide at PS-11.

600
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,004
<i>The fall semester of 2000,</i>

601
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,002
<i>when Evan was in fifth grade</i>

602
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,996
<i>he communicated</i>

603
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,004
<i>to the principal of his school</i>

604
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:09,015
<i>that he felt suicidal.</i>

605
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:11,994
<i>We get a letter and of course...</i>

606
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:14,098
<i>You know, it says, "just
a psychological evaluation."</i>

607
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,004
<i>Well, I'm already in therapy.</i>

608
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:17,992
I'm already seeing
a psychiatrist.

609
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,985
He was already on meds.
I don't know...

610
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:20,998
You know,
I don't know what to do.

611
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:23,003
I don't know what to do.

612
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,982
<i>And three weeks later,</i>

613
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,010
<i>he made an attempt at school.</i>

614
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,990
<i>I got a call at my office.</i>

615
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,983
<i>"This is Mr. Delmonico</i>

616
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:36,994
<i>from PS-11
and this is about Evan."</i>

617
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,997
He said,
"It's-it's very serious.

618
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,986
Um, you need to get here."

619
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,978
And I'm like, "You have to
tell me what's going on."

620
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,995
He said, "He's up on the roof
of his school."

621
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,004
PS-11, it's probably

622
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,003
<i>six stories.</i>

623
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:52,998
<i>And he took a chunk of pavement</i>

624
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:54,984
<i>about the size of a hamburger</i>

625
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,982
<i>and threw it down
onto the playground</i>

626
00:31:57,006 --> 00:31:58,046
<i>where the other kids were.</i>

627
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:01,990
<i>One of the teachers
went out on the roof</i>

628
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:05,979
<i>and there was Evan,
perched on a ledge.</i>

629
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:08,987
<i>And Evan told him
that he wanted to kill himself,</i>

630
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,982
<i>that he was gonna jump.</i>

631
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:13,988
<i>The teacher told him
that life was worth living</i>

632
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,001
<i>and what was good about Evan,</i>

633
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,994
<i>and that he was loved.</i>

634
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:21,016
<i>And eventually Evan
came down on his own.</i>

635
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,981
<i>By the time I got there,</i>

636
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:26,985
<i>he had been brought down
into the principal's office</i>

637
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:28,997
and we were there
in the principal's office

638
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:30,983
and we decided to go straight

639
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:33,987
from there to an emergency room.

640
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,983
<i>One of the residents asked him,</i>

641
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,984
<i>"Do you know what it's like
to be dead?"</i>

642
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,000
<i>He says, "Yeah,
everybody gathers around</i>

643
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:44,999
<i>and talks about
how great you were."</i>

644
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:46,994
<i>And for me it was like,</i>

645
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,981
this is my worst fear.

646
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,980
He is like my brother.

647
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,997
<i>My younger brother Scott
committed suicide</i>

648
00:32:56,021 --> 00:33:00,003
<i>by asphyxiating himself
in a car.</i>

649
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:08,995
<i>Because of my experience
with my brother</i>

650
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:12,978
<i>I wasn't going to fool around.</i>

651
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:15,990
We had Evan
involuntarily committed

652
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:17,992
to a mental institution.

653
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:20,982
Uh, 'cause we were...

654
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:23,983
very, very concerned
about his suicide attempt.

655
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:24,988
We took it very seriously.

656
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:28,980
<i>The place he went
was called Four Winds.</i>

657
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:29,999
<i>It's outside of New York,</i>

658
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:34,015
<i>and it's a lock-up
psychiatric facility.</i>

659
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:36,138
<i>Evan was brought in</i>

660
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,989
by ambulance after having
an incident at school.

661
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:42,985
Um, he was brought to
the Deerfield Unit

662
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:44,991
which is the unit
I was working on at the time.

663
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:46,994
<i>Which is for kids 8 to 12.</i>

664
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:50,984
<i>And immediately assessed
and evaluated.</i>

665
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:51,998
<i>We were able to establish</i>

666
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,000
a, uh... A pattern.

667
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,988
And saw that he definitely,

668
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:58,005
uh, met the criteria
for bipolar disorder.

669
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:03,029
<i>You know, known historically
as manic-depression.</i>

670
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,978
<i>This is a chemical imbalance,</i>

671
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,005
<i>a chemical illness in the brain.</i>

672
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:11,995
<i>Some kids have more of
a propensity towards depression</i>

673
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,980
<i>and some kids have more of
a propensity towards mania.</i>

674
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:15,986
<i>I think in Evan's case,</i>

675
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,016
<i>it was definitely
more depression.</i>

676
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:23,003
<i>Bipolar depression
is definitely more severe</i>

677
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,990
<i>than just depression.</i>

678
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:28,989
That's why suicide attempts
are more common

679
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,999
<i>in kids with bipolar depression.</i>

680
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:33,982
<i>And that's why it's scarier.</i>

681
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,992
<i>'Cause you don't know
how far he'll take it.</i>

682
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,992
<i>You know, you don't know
if he actually would</i>

683
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:41,993
<i>have jumped off that ledge
at school.</i>

684
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,985
You know,
he had a tendency to blame

685
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,987
other people or other situations

686
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,996
instead of being able to say,
"Okay, yeah, I get it.

687
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,997
"I did something
I probably shouldn't have done,

688
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,003
<i>it scared a lot of people
and that's why I'm here."</i>

689
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:54,984
<i>He just sort of said,</i>

690
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,002
<i>"All I wanted
was someone to listen."</i>

691
00:34:57,026 --> 00:34:58,990
And he just couldn't understand

692
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,028
that his behaviors
and the measure that he took

693
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,029
were scary to people.

694
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,999
He didn't think that if he went
and stood on the, uh...

695
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,984
The roof of the school,
that anything would happen.

696
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,001
So when he ended up
in a hospital

697
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,995
where it's lock down
and they watch you every second

698
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,983
and you're not allowed
to do anything

699
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:17,981
unless it's part of the schedule

700
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:19,001
and there are these
other damaged kids

701
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,000
and your parents can only visit
once in a while.

702
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:26,022
<i>I mean, he just fell apart.
He fell apart.</i>

703
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,999
<i>He was destroying property
on the unit.</i>

704
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:32,003
<i>He was very, very angry.</i>

705
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:34,993
<i>At one point I remember
he drew all over his walls</i>

706
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:38,983
<i>in his room and we had to
have him clean his walls.</i>

707
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,993
<i>He also was tantrumming a lot,
he was angry a lot.</i>

708
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:45,986
<i>He was banging his head
and his arms up against a wall.</i>

709
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,985
<i>When he was in the throes
of a manic episode</i>

710
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,980
<i>or a depressive episode,</i>

711
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>you know, you couldn't reason.</i>

712
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,978
<i>And you can't reason
with a kid who's bipolar.</i>

713
00:35:56,002 --> 00:35:57,985
<i>Visiting Evan at Four Winds</i>

714
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,997
<i>was agonizing.</i>

715
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:01,999
Here is a kid

716
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:05,978
who was in a lock-up
psychiatric facility

717
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,987
for seriously mentally ill kids.

718
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:10,997
And coming to terms
with your kid

719
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:13,004
who seemed to have
behavioral issues

720
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:15,028
but he could've just, you know...

721
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,981
Be like an adolescent,

722
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,980
that this is something
he'd go through.

723
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:19,997
Because he had so many really,

724
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:22,991
you know, charming,
bright qualities.

725
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,990
Four Winds was, uh,

726
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,992
a real body punch.

727
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:32,003
<i>Evan was given a variety
of medications.</i>

728
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:34,000
<i>Depakote was one of them.</i>

729
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,981
<i>Uh, he seemed really doped up.</i>

730
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:38,028
<i>And then they suggested</i>

731
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,988
<i>that he try lithium.</i>

732
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,989
<i>Lithium is a mood stabilizer</i>

733
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,992
<i>and it is used to level off</i>

734
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,993
<i>the serotonin in the brain</i>

735
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:49,005
<i>as opposed to having
the highs and lows</i>

736
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:53,987
<i>you kind of even off
the chemistry.</i>

737
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,990
<i>He really did start
to respond to lithium.</i>

738
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,997
<i>I mean, it was really,
pretty remarkable.</i>

739
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:01,980
<i>But he was still, you know,
profoundly ill.</i>

740
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:02,998
<i>So then the question
became like:</i>

741
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:05,993
<i>Well, what do we do after this?</i>

742
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,978
<i>PS-11 would not take him back</i>

743
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:12,993
<i>and there was no place
for him to go.</i>

744
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:15,983
<i>Uh, except for this
very expensive alternative</i>

745
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:18,989
<i>which turned out to,
I think, have saved his life</i>

746
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:21,981
<i>for a number of years.</i>

747
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:24,029
<i>Suzanne Hanna who was
his therapist</i>

748
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,981
<i>recommended this place
called Wellspring</i>

749
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,990
<i>which was what they call
Milieu Therapy.</i>

750
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:30,996
<i>Everything's an opportunity</i>

751
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,981
<i>to learn how to live
in the group.</i>

752
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:34,983
<i>From doing the dishes,
making meals,</i>

753
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:35,986
<i>to taking care of animals,</i>

754
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,993
<i>to taking care
of younger children,</i>

755
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:41,005
<i>to chores and things like that.</i>

756
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,029
<i>Evan came to us</i>

757
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,001
from Four Winds hospital

758
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:47,994
and they were pretty adamant
that the bipolar disorder was,

759
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,984
um, managed, medication-wise

760
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:53,004
and that he was on
the proper dosages

761
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:54,992
and, uh, that seemed
to be the case

762
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:56,005
on some level we saw.

763
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:58,992
And then, right away,
within a few days,

764
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:00,979
Evan decided to venture

765
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:03,000
off campus and, uh...

766
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:05,982
Obvious question
at that point was:

767
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:08,002
Was it really controlled?

768
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,983
<i>Three days in he decided
that he wasn't gonna have it.</i>

769
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:13,996
<i>You know, that this whole thing</i>

770
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,980
<i>about the adults being in charge</i>

771
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,004
<i>really wasn't for him.</i>

772
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:20,987
<i>He made it a little bit more
complicated than he had to.</i>

773
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:22,331
<i>Built in a little
dramatic effect,</i>

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,981
<i>he went out a window.
He could've went out the door.</i>

775
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,992
<i>We don't have...
The doors aren't locked.</i>

776
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:28,988
Oh, I see,
so he went out the window

777
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:30,982
and then went on the roof,

778
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:31,989
and then jumped down.

779
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,983
So this was like...
That involved some doing.

780
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:37,000
<i>Dana gets a phone call
from Evan,</i>

781
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,986
that he's climbed out a window

782
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,988
and escaped from Wellspring

783
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:44,003
and is in some guy's house.

784
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:45,995
Of course, we had to go
to juvenile court

785
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:48,982
because the guy whose house
he broke into,

786
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:50,985
uh, pressed charges.

787
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,004
I think the neighbor
whose house he was in

788
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,992
was quite unforgiving.

789
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,994
<i>You know, luckily,
he didn't do anything</i>

790
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,989
<i>with that man's house that day,</i>

791
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:01,998
<i>but he was trying to get</i>

792
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:04,004
<i>a rise out of his parents
to come rescue him.</i>

793
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,993
<i>Show them just how much
he's suffering</i>

794
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:07,996
<i>and he'll go home
and stir it all up again</i>

795
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,994
<i>and be back
in the hospital again in...</i>

796
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:11,028
<i>You know, another year.</i>

797
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,998
<i>It was as if he was in a game.</i>

798
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:16,005
<i>It was an important event,</i>

799
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:19,000
and it really kind of marked
that need for a switch.

800
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,986
That-that Evan really needed
to be held accountable

801
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,993
for the relational damage
he was doing.

802
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:27,982
So that event was a microcosm

803
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:29,981
of what had happened
in his life.

804
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:31,989
He wasn't being held
accountable on some level

805
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:33,986
for the damage he did
to you all.

806
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,984
That was the first night
we were here.

807
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:36,993
We sat right here, right?

808
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:37,995
Yup.

809
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:40,981
As I recall, um,
you had us in first

810
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,978
and kind of gave us
a little heads up

811
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:44,979
and then Evan came in

812
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:45,999
and he had us,
I think, sit on his...

813
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,999
Sit in our laps and... Right.

814
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:50,996
And you told him we had to talk
to him really honestly.

815
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,998
Right.

816
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,002
And I did and it was...

817
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,984
It was like
this incredible relief

818
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,999
because I had permission
to say what I was feeling

819
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,003
without being afraid
of breaking him.

820
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:02,979
You know? I remember.

821
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:03,993
And you-you were like, "Really?"

822
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,994
Yeah, I was like, really?

823
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,978
Well, if I tell him
that I'm afraid

824
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:08,999
I'm gonna find him dead,
he'll explode.

825
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,003
And the world will end
and, you know,

826
00:40:11,027 --> 00:40:12,992
all this stuff
will come rushing out,

827
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:13,996
and we'll be poisonous,

828
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,988
and we won't be
able to survive it.

829
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,983
And I think,
to all of our amazement,

830
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:20,979
we not only survived,

831
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,983
but started building,
you know, on that.

832
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:26,994
<i>Finally he started to work</i>

833
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,984
<i>with the therapy at Wellspring.</i>

834
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:31,004
<i>And slowly, bit by bit,</i>

835
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,994
<i>he started to come around
to their philosophy.</i>

836
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:37,978
We came frequently for,
you know, sessions,

837
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,986
<i>where we learned
how to communicate as a family.</i>

838
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,993
<i>With Evan...
With his unique needs.</i>

839
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:45,985
It was like learning
a new language.

840
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:48,989
<i>They basically say
that children are responsible</i>

841
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,004
<i>for their actions.</i>

842
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:51,978
Let's put it really simply:

843
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:53,402
If you make a mess,
you clean it up.

844
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:54,988
<i>Whether it's a physical mess</i>

845
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:56,996
<i>like you spilled something,
you need to clean up,</i>

846
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,002
<i>or an emotional mess.</i>

847
00:40:58,026 --> 00:40:59,988
I remember coming here

848
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:03,018
and seeing, uh, Evan working
on that stone wall over there.

849
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,990
For a child to think
they cleaned up their mess

850
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:08,986
and they made something
a little better,

851
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,988
rather than feeling
like you were punished

852
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,992
or you had consequences
or whatever.

853
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,000
But in this case you get to feel

854
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:16,003
like you really
repaired something.

855
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,988
Yeah, and maybe that's even
better than it was before.

856
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,992
<i>I think what happened
at Wellspring</i>

857
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:24,983
<i>is that they encouraged
Evan to be a boy.</i>

858
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:27,002
<i>I think a lot
of their philosophy is</i>

859
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,999
<i>to let children be children.</i>

860
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:31,996
<i>When he came he was
kind of running the show.</i>

861
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,983
<i>You know,
he was in adult conversations,</i>

862
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:38,978
and he would much prefer
being with the staff

863
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:39,996
than he would
with the other kids.

864
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,002
<i>He really needed
to be a kid again</i>

865
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:43,994
<i>and just have fun
and relax and...</i>

866
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:48,003
<i>And forget about all those
bigger issues.</i>

867
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,997
<i>Especially for Evan who was
really acting like</i>

868
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:52,984
<i>such a teenager
at such a young age,</i>

869
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:55,980
<i>it was a miracle
to see him get past</i>

870
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:57,004
<i>that facade of "I'm too cool."</i>

871
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:59,985
<i>And to just be a pure boy.</i>

872
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:02,978
And I remember a time
seeing him at Wellspring

873
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:05,001
playing in the yard
with pure boyness,

874
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,986
<i>that boy essence, which is what
you need at that age.</i>

875
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,986
<i>It's a beautiful day,
you're throwing a ball</i>

876
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,010
<i>with your friends.</i>

877
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:16,002
<i>Early on, I'd say in the first
four weeks or so,</i>

878
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,984
<i>he began to earn weekend passes,</i>

879
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,992
<i>so the weekend
of Michael's birthday,</i>

880
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:20,997
<i>he finally did get released,</i>

881
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,978
<i>and he was at the birthday party</i>

882
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:24,682
<i>and I remember looking at him
and thinking,</i>

883
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,019
<i>"Oh, he looks like a boy."</i>

884
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:32,028
<i>I mean, the old Evan
would've been too cool,</i>

885
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,997
<i>he would've been
turning up his nose,</i>

886
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:35,004
<i>and he would've been sneering,</i>

887
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:36,989
<i>he wouldn't have
in a million years</i>

888
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:40,003
<i>let the clown paint his face.
Okay, never.</i>

889
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:43,013
<i>He allowed himself to be a kid.</i>

890
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:50,983
<i>I... I saw those layers
peel away.</i>

891
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,989
<i>And a lot of it had to do with</i>

892
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:55,987
how strict the counselors were.
They weren't having it.

893
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:57,994
Evan could try to talk his way
out of anything.

894
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:00,993
<i>And Dan's just saying
"I'm not going anywhere."</i>

895
00:43:01,017 --> 00:43:03,992
<i>Remember, you know,
bipolar disorder is not just</i>

896
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:06,004
<i>a disorder of mood,
it's a disorder of judgment.</i>

897
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:08,984
<i>And for kids
that's so debilitating.</i>

898
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:10,005
<i>If the adults
don't hold them close</i>

899
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:11,988
<i>and make them responsible.</i>

900
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:14,992
What he needed to know
is that you guys were in charge,

901
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:17,003
and then he could build
from your judgment,

902
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,998
and that's what he allowed
us to do first,

903
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:20,992
'cause he looked around,
he said, "Okay,

904
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,004
I'm not getting over on these
guys, I'll let that happen."

905
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:25,004
And then we obviously
bridge that to you.

906
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:28,002
<i>It was one of the shortest
stays we've really ever had,</i>

907
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:30,990
<i>uh, of a boy with so much
going on in his life.</i>

908
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:33,986
<i>Three months
is really an unusual time</i>

909
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,991
<i>to get all that done.</i>

910
00:43:36,015 --> 00:43:38,001
<i>- By the time
- Evan finished at Wellspring,</i>

911
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:40,001
<i>the lithium had definitely
kicked in.</i>

912
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:42,029
<i>Along with the therapy,
it was working,</i>

913
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:44,990
<i>and you couldn't have
one without the other.</i>

914
00:43:45,014 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>He seemed well enough
to rejoin our family.</i>

915
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:52,001
<i>- The whole family went to
- Wellspring, and we all learned,</i>

916
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:56,981
and when it was over,
here we had this kid again,

917
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,022
and what do we do with him?

918
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,004
<i>So we decided to see
whether we could get him</i>

919
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,997
<i>into a mainstream school
which was sensitive</i>

920
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,988
<i>to kids who had issues.</i>

921
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,988
<i>So we got him into a school
called York Prep.</i>

922
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:13,999
<i>And suddenly everything
was different.</i>

923
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:20,990
<i>We would get a report card
and he was, like,</i>

924
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:23,982
<i>one of the best students
in the class.</i>

925
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,003
<i>The teachers were saying</i>

926
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:29,987
<i>"I wish all my students
were like Evan."</i>

927
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:33,004
<i>He got the prize
in the science project.</i>

928
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:37,004
So what's this? My science fair.

929
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:42,008
Now you've got the ribbon.

930
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,993
The ribbon.

931
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,997
It was so hard,
taking them so fast.

932
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:51,003
There are, like, 40 pictures
with digital camera,

933
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:52,988
and none of 'em worked.

934
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:54,998
<i>One of the great things
about Evan going to York</i>

935
00:44:55,022 --> 00:44:57,991
<i>is he found such a great group
of friends.</i>

936
00:44:58,015 --> 00:44:59,984
It took awhile for him to, like,

937
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:01,995
kind of gain your trust
and stuff like that,

938
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:03,985
and, um, after awhile, it was...

939
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:06,489
He was just one of those people
I could talk to about anything,

940
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,994
and come to him
with any problem.

941
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:10,979
Once we started hanging out,
I started to, like, you know,

942
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:11,989
figure out his interest in toys.

943
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,981
And I really liked toys,
like, toys was my thing,

944
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,988
and toys was his thing,
and cartoons were his thing.

945
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:17,992
And cartoons were my thing.

946
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,296
Well,
he was definitely different

947
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:21,989
from all the other kids
we hung out with.

948
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:25,994
Nobody seemed to have strong
opinions like him.

949
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:28,979
He was really set in his ways.

950
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:31,000
And once he had an idea
he wasn't gonna let it go.

951
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:33,988
Lot of stuff people say in high
school they don't really mean

952
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:36,000
or they're just trying to be
popular, but, like, you know,

953
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,994
Evan, he would just go right
into it, he wouldn't hold back.

954
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:43,981
What I liked about Evan was that
he, uh, was really creative,

955
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:46,995
and was interested in a lot of
things that, like, not like...

956
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,999
Not just TV. Like, a lot of kids
were just watching TV,

957
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:51,995
and he was making TV.

958
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:56,979
<i>Evan had various,
you know, movie ideas.</i>

959
00:45:57,003 --> 00:46:00,994
<i>When he was younger
he roped me into shooting them.</i>

960
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:02,994
Come on, let's start.
All right, ready.

961
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:05,029
It's rolling now.
You guys, shut up!

962
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:06,983
Okay, ready?

963
00:46:07,007 --> 00:46:09,002
Three, two, one, action.

964
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:13,001
Hi, I'm Adam Luke, and I'm here
to host a new reality TV show

965
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:15,995
titled, "What it Takes
to be an Astronaut."

966
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:17,990
<i>There was a certain
amount of chaos</i>

967
00:46:18,014 --> 00:46:19,986
<i>that was involved
in the creation of them.</i>

968
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,984
All right, a redneck, and then,
Gabe, you have to say something.

969
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:24,991
You have Chinese ADD,
don't forget.

970
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,004
I go to space all the time.

971
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:31,980
Spaces. Spaces. No gravity.

972
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:33,997
Okay, I'm not Chinese, 'cause
it's too hard to be Chinese.

973
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,998
You're Chi... You have ADD,
what's the ADD about?

974
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:38,000
ADD, ADD, no Chinese.

975
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,983
Do you know how long it took us

976
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:44,994
just to get through
these three lines? It took...

977
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:47,003
Just try to play it a little
more serious, okay?

978
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,997
You. Who are you supposed to be?

979
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:52,992
It doesn't really... At this
point, it doesn't matter.

980
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:54,996
I wanna do... I wanna do
the whole thing over again.

981
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,994
What do you mean,
"the whole thing"?

982
00:46:57,018 --> 00:46:58,989
'Cause I was...

983
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:09,984
<i>All the films we were making
were all disasters.</i>

984
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:11,408
We always got too excited
about 'em,

985
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,996
'cause, like,
we'd have microphones,

986
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,989
we have a nice camera,
and we'd, like,

987
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:17,002
talk about it and talk about it
and talk about it.

988
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:19,997
And then we'd just...
Wouldn't finish it.

989
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:25,005
<i>There was a summer Evan
went to New York Film Academy,</i>

990
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:27,022
and asked me to be
in one of his movies.

991
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,003
<i>The assignment was to shoot, uh,</i>

992
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:33,015
<i>in black and white and no sound.</i>

993
00:47:34,022 --> 00:47:36,005
<i>He made a movie
about me waking up</i>

994
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:38,996
<i>in a world with no sound
and no color.</i>

995
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,014
No!

996
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:11,028
I never knew that there was
anything wrong with him.

997
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,320
He took medication.
I had no idea.

998
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,994
Never brought it up.

999
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,979
Never talked about it.

1000
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:19,979
Sometimes we got a little
suspicious 'cause, like,

1001
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:22,004
he would just be really quiet
for a long period of time,

1002
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:25,996
but we just accustomed to it
because he did it a lot.

1003
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,987
He would miss school
every now and then.

1004
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:29,491
I can tell... I knew...
I would, like,

1005
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:30,992
I would tell him
he's on his period,

1006
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:34,004
because he's, like,
he looks like he... You know,

1007
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:36,989
<i>he would have a month where
he's just, like, moping around.</i>

1008
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:38,988
<i>And then he'd have a month
where's he's, like,</i>

1009
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:39,998
<i>really happy, really happy.</i>

1010
00:48:40,022 --> 00:48:42,003
<i>And he would tell me,
"Listen, the more happy I get,</i>

1011
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:43,995
<i>the more pissed off
I'm gonna get later."</i>

1012
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:46,989
<i>One time, I think,
going out to the roof,</i>

1013
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:49,984
I remember him sitting
on the ledge, like...

1014
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:50,992
And it really, like, scared me.

1015
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:52,989
And he just seemed to be
completely fearless,

1016
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,002
like, almost willing to just
walk... Like, walk on the edge.

1017
00:48:56,026 --> 00:48:58,990
And I really, like,
kind of yelled at him, like,

1018
00:48:59,014 --> 00:49:00,986
"Get down from the edge,"
you know.

1019
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,995
That's, like,
not something you do.

1020
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:06,002
And it just... He kind of
distanced himself like that.

1021
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,980
It was almost like showing...

1022
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:09,997
Showing me, like,
"I don't really care."

1023
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:11,004
We talked about it a little,

1024
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,992
but he always
sort of brushed it away,

1025
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:15,991
and he sort of said,
"But I'm over that now." And...

1026
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:17,990
<i>We all thought
he was pretty good,</i>

1027
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:19,005
<i>and he always acted
really great.</i>

1028
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:21,003
<i>And there were no real signs
of any, like,</i>

1029
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:22,982
<i>real depression or anything.</i>

1030
00:49:23,006 --> 00:49:26,988
I was totally optimistic
about his health

1031
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:28,990
and the direction
that he was gonna go.

1032
00:49:29,014 --> 00:49:32,981
<i>When I'd come home from school
and spend holidays,</i>

1033
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:34,986
<i>I remember remarking to myself,
you know,</i>

1034
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,984
<i>"This is a much more warm,
loving household</i>

1035
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:42,004
<i>then it was two years earlier.</i>

1036
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:45,004
I guess that's what I saw
after Wellspring,

1037
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:47,986
<i>that Dana and my father</i>

1038
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,002
<i>really showing him that</i>

1039
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:54,994
<i>within our family lies
a really strong foundation</i>

1040
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:56,980
<i>that he can trust.</i>

1041
00:49:57,004 --> 00:50:00,994
<i>And during that time
it really did seem like</i>

1042
00:50:01,018 --> 00:50:04,002
<i>everything was under control.</i>

1043
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:12,994
<i>As the years went by,
after Wellspring,</i>

1044
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:16,000
<i>and he continued to be
the top student in his class,</i>

1045
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:17,985
<i>he continued to have
good friends,</i>

1046
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:19,993
<i>that there weren't
any big issues.</i>

1047
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,981
<i>I thought that maybe
he was cured.</i>

1048
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:25,984
You know,
maybe he's gonna have a life.

1049
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:28,029
You know,
I'd go with Evan to visit

1050
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,002
<i>his older brother in college,</i>

1051
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,987
<i>and Evan was, like,
looking at college,</i>

1052
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:35,003
<i>and thinking,
"Well, I can do it.</i>

1053
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:39,010
<i>I can have a life like this."</i>

1054
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:42,987
<i>You know,
as the years proceeded,</i>

1055
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:46,983
I was not thinking that maybe
the telephone was going to ring,

1056
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:49,990
I was thinking that, "Hey,
this... This kid is different

1057
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,986
from my brother.
He's got a shot."

1058
00:50:57,013 --> 00:51:01,988
<i>My brother... There'd never
really been a diagnosis.</i>

1059
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,999
<i>He was a successful suicide.</i>

1060
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:09,022
<i>And that was my big fear
about Evan.</i>

1061
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:14,989
<i>From an early age,
both Scott and Evan,</i>

1062
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:18,998
<i>they were overwhelmed
by their emotions.</i>

1063
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:20,986
<i>With my brother, you know,</i>

1064
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,997
I had learned how to, you know,
be his guide.

1065
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:26,004
<i>You know,
we went to the same school,</i>

1066
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:27,983
<i>we went to the same college.</i>

1067
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:28,991
<i>We were very close.</i>

1068
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,002
<i>And I'd been my brother's keeper</i>

1069
00:51:31,026 --> 00:51:35,988
<i>up until the point really where
he started living with Martine,</i>

1070
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,015
<i>his girlfriend.</i>

1071
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:41,984
<i>Well, Scott was fun.</i>

1072
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,979
<i>He was brilliant.</i>

1073
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:46,996
<i>He was very creative,
he was a great skier,</i>

1074
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,990
<i>he was an athlete.
We went skiing together.</i>

1075
00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:51,984
<i>We really had a lot of fun</i>

1076
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,984
<i>and I was totally seduced
when I met him.</i>

1077
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:57,991
I knew he was
taking medication all along

1078
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:01,003
and I knew he was
seeing a psychiatrist.

1079
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:03,984
He was getting some help.

1080
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:06,987
I never really...
I had absolutely no experience

1081
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:10,005
with depression
before I met Scott.

1082
00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:12,005
<i>So I knew that there was
a problem,</i>

1083
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,002
<i>but I didn't really see it,</i>

1084
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:16,986
<i>because Scott was always
very optimistic,</i>

1085
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,002
<i>and he was very outgoing,</i>

1086
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:20,005
<i>but I think I was still
noticing something</i>

1087
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:22,001
<i>after the first year.</i>

1088
00:52:22,025 --> 00:52:25,981
<i>He had mood swings,
he had ups and downs.</i>

1089
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:28,995
<i>And the second year trying to
kill himself a couple of times</i>

1090
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:30,978
while he was with me.

1091
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:32,003
I was supposed to get up
in the morning

1092
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:35,005
and find him dead next to me.

1093
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:36,998
And he was amazed
when he woke up,

1094
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:38,980
I assume he didn't take enough.

1095
00:52:39,004 --> 00:52:40,990
You know, he was trying
to overdose with medication

1096
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:44,001
and maybe with drugs... Heroin.

1097
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:48,979
<i>After his two attempts, he was
really able to talk about it,</i>

1098
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:49,987
<i>and communicate about it,</i>

1099
00:52:50,011 --> 00:52:51,981
<i>and I could really understand,</i>

1100
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:52,995
<i>as much as I could,</i>

1101
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,994
<i>the depth of the desperation.</i>

1102
00:52:56,018 --> 00:52:58,029
<i>He said he was in a hole.</i>

1103
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:00,991
In a tunnel, in a hole.
There was no way out.

1104
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:04,002
The pain was...

1105
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:07,998
so profound, he...

1106
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:11,983
He could not imagine going on
with it, and living with it,

1107
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:12,987
even though I was there.

1108
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,002
<i>It did not matter.</i>

1109
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:17,001
<i>Me and his family were not
enough to keep him alive.</i>

1110
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:21,998
<i>At those moments
of such despair and pain,</i>

1111
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:25,029
<i>the only way out was to die.</i>

1112
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,978
I don't like to think that maybe
I wasn't really clued in

1113
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,995
to what was going on,
though I probably wasn't,

1114
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:33,002
because I wasn't willing
to accept the fact

1115
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:39,000
that, uh, anything so terrifying
to me could be on the way.

1116
00:53:39,024 --> 00:53:42,994
<i>And particularly because Scott
didn't seem like</i>

1117
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,992
<i>an unhappy person.</i>

1118
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:49,001
All it tells you is that
there is so much more

1119
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,988
to know about people you love

1120
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:55,029
<i>than you can
ever really uncover.</i>

1121
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,994
What happened that weekend
when Scott died?

1122
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,984
I don't know.

1123
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:02,993
Nope.
I have not the faintest idea.

1124
00:54:03,017 --> 00:54:05,003
Not the faintest idea.

1125
00:54:05,027 --> 00:54:06,981
You found him.

1126
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:07,997
What, what? You found him

1127
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:09,998
"Who found him"? You found him.

1128
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:12,987
I found him?

1129
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:16,029
I don't remember doing that. No.

1130
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:20,997
What's more, I think I can
get along without memory.

1131
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:23,991
I don't remember at all.

1132
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:36,978
<i>I think it was a Saturday.</i>

1133
00:54:37,002 --> 00:54:39,005
<i>We came for the weekend up here.</i>

1134
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,994
<i>Fourth of July weekend.</i>

1135
00:54:41,018 --> 00:54:43,002
<i>Scott was totally normal.</i>

1136
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:46,978
<i>Fun, nice.</i>

1137
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:49,984
Suddenly, we... You know,
it was a beautiful afternoon,

1138
00:54:50,008 --> 00:54:53,017
and we said, "Where is Scott?"

1139
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,000
<i>Scott was not around.</i>

1140
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,029
<i>I knew something was wrong.</i>

1141
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,997
<i>Because I knew
that the caretaker had guns.</i>

1142
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:10,990
And Scott knew that he had guns.

1143
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:15,981
<i>So I went there and Beati went
in another direction.</i>

1144
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:17,990
<i>I couldn't get inside the house
because it was locked.</i>

1145
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,002
<i>I don't exactly remember,</i>

1146
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:21,981
<i>but I knew he didn't have
the guns.</i>

1147
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:22,998
<i>When I came back</i>

1148
00:55:23,022 --> 00:55:26,988
I saw Beati came back,

1149
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:28,994
and her lipstick was smeared
around her mouth,

1150
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:31,991
and she said
"I just found Scott."

1151
00:55:32,015 --> 00:55:34,999
<i>And she found him in the jeep...
In the car...</i>

1152
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:36,981
<i>Near the carriage house.</i>

1153
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:38,987
<i>And what he had done</i>

1154
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:42,994
<i>was take the hose
from the vacuum cleaner,</i>

1155
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:45,984
<i>and put the hose
from the exhaust pipe</i>

1156
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:48,029
inside the car.

1157
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:03,978
<i>When my brother died,</i>

1158
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:07,025
<i>I decided to make a film.</i>

1159
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:13,988
<i>It was too painful for me to,
like,</i>

1160
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:15,982
<i>really deal with his suicide,</i>

1161
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,995
<i>So I made the film about a, uh,</i>

1162
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:22,986
<i>sculptor friend of my mother's
who came from Spain</i>

1163
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:26,014
<i>to make a sculpture
for the grave.</i>

1164
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:32,999
<i>I documented the process
of making the sculpture.</i>

1165
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,001
<i>And the instillation.</i>

1166
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:44,004
<i>I thought that maybe in
the course of making the film</i>

1167
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:48,024
<i>I could find some meaning
about my brother's suicide.</i>

1168
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:02,987
<i>It took me about seven,
eight years</i>

1169
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:05,987
<i>to come back to normal.</i>

1170
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:09,001
<i>I was mutilated when he died.
I was mutilated.</i>

1171
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,986
<i>Half of me was dead.</i>

1172
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,026
Completely dead.

1173
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,998
<i>My parents were shattered.</i>

1174
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:39,006
<i>It was like broken glass.
Shattered.</i>

1175
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:49,998
<i>What... What did happen to him?</i>

1176
00:57:50,022 --> 00:57:54,997
Well,
he obviously committed suicide.

1177
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:57,978
Why do you think he did it?

1178
00:57:58,002 --> 00:57:58,988
"Why did he do it?"

1179
00:57:59,012 --> 00:58:00,988
Well, he was...

1180
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:04,995
in a terrible state
of depression.

1181
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:08,024
What brought on the depression,
I don't know.

1182
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:17,023
I don't know. I don't know.

1183
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:28,011
I can't tell you.

1184
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,990
I can't tell you.

1185
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,987
I can't tell you.
The words don't exist

1186
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:43,989
to tell another person

1187
00:58:44,013 --> 00:58:46,995
how destroyed

1188
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:48,999
part of you has been.

1189
00:58:49,023 --> 00:58:50,985
They just don't exist.

1190
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:52,990
I can't tell you.
But I can tell you

1191
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:56,005
that it's something
you never recover from.

1192
00:58:57,017 --> 00:59:00,991
<i>What is true
is that life goes on,</i>

1193
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:02,986
<i>but not the way
you wanted it to,</i>

1194
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,992
<i>and not the way
you planned for it to.</i>

1195
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:08,983
<i>But you don't recover.</i>

1196
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,981
<i>I don't think.</i>

1197
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,993
<i>I thought if Evan
was going to kill himself,</i>

1198
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:34,002
<i>it'd be similar to my
experience with my brother.</i>

1199
00:59:34,026 --> 00:59:37,995
<i>It was like a slow decline.</i>

1200
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:41,998
<i>But Evan seemed to be
actually doing pretty well.</i>

1201
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:44,993
- What can I get you?
- I want a beer.

1202
00:59:45,017 --> 00:59:47,980
Light? Yeah.

1203
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:51,028
Ha-ha.

1204
00:59:53,015 --> 00:59:54,003
So why are you out so late?

1205
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:56,986
Well, I've just seen
a Kiss concert, man.

1206
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,002
Kiss rules! Kiss rocks!

1207
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:03,996
That's good,
now watch him leave.

1208
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,998
Hey, hey, hey.

1209
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:07,983
He didn't pay.

1210
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:11,002
Yeah. I just went like, "Hey!"

1211
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:12,990
Run, run, Mike.

1212
01:00:13,014 --> 01:00:14,986
Run, Evan.

1213
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,992
You know, I mean,
Evan was never, you know,

1214
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:20,989
like an over-the-top,
effervescent, happy kid.

1215
01:00:21,013 --> 01:00:23,997
But from all the... The markers:

1216
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,982
<i>Is he getting into trouble? No.</i>

1217
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:28,000
<i>Not at all.</i>

1218
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,995
Can you do the fish?

1219
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:31,997
The fish! Like this.

1220
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:34,999
I can do the snake. Like that.

1221
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:36,991
I can do the seashell.

1222
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:38,978
<i>Have we seen the police?</i>

1223
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:39,997
<i>And we certainly
did see the police</i>

1224
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:42,996
<i>for a number of occasions
before Wellspring.</i>

1225
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,029
<i>No police.</i>

1226
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:49,990
Take it with me.

1227
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:53,980
<i>- Evan was doing so well.
- It was like a miracle.</i>

1228
01:00:54,004 --> 01:00:57,015
<i>We couldn't believe it.
You just couldn't believe it.</i>

1229
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,986
<i>Is this the same kid? I mean,
here he is, and he's growing,</i>

1230
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,984
<i>and he's popular, and he has
his lovely friends,</i>

1231
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:06,994
<i>and they have a wonderful time.</i>

1232
01:01:07,018 --> 01:01:08,981
<i>Suddenly there's hair there</i>

1233
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:10,997
<i>and his jaw gets firmer
and he's taller than I am.</i>

1234
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:13,999
<i>And he's a man.
He's a young man.</i>

1235
01:01:14,023 --> 01:01:16,005
<i>Very handsome,
very popular with the girls.</i>

1236
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:18,991
<i>But not really
all that interested in them.</i>

1237
01:01:19,015 --> 01:01:20,995
His voice went from
like this to like this.

1238
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:23,002
Like, you're...
You're in the shot.

1239
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,980
Like...

1240
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:30,988
Like,
let's worry about the door shot,

1241
01:01:31,012 --> 01:01:32,372
let's do that
when I'm not filming.

1242
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:34,002
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, do the shot.

1243
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:36,996
You know, like after he comes in
you can do that...

1244
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,003
All right.

1245
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,993
<i>He really hated being sick.</i>

1246
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:42,988
- We went... We were like...
- Did you hear us yelling outside?

1247
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,000
We were like, "Evan!"

1248
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:45,989
Three E, 3W, whatever.

1249
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:46,997
<i>He didn't wanna be different.</i>

1250
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:48,003
<i>What teenage boy does?</i>

1251
01:01:48,027 --> 01:01:49,988
Yeah,
so I'll see you guys later.

1252
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:51,988
In, like, half an hour.
I just have to wait for...

1253
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,986
Okay, it's just Angela's
around the corner.

1254
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:54,989
All right. Bye.

1255
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:56,983
I'll see you soon. Bye!

1256
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,019
Oh, my gosh, what?

1257
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:06,023
Oh, are we talking
about this again?

1258
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,993
Are you better now? Yay.

1259
01:02:12,017 --> 01:02:13,980
High five.

1260
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:16,364
<i>A lot of the time he seemed
really out of it to me.</i>

1261
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,995
And I really attributed that
to his drugs.

1262
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:23,003
<i>'Cause I remember going through
a turnstile door with him</i>

1263
01:02:23,027 --> 01:02:25,993
<i>and him sort of just
stopping in the middle,</i>

1264
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,979
<i>or not really paying attention</i>

1265
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:28,999
<i>to what was going on around him,</i>

1266
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:31,984
<i>and I'd stop and say
"What is it with this kid?"</i>

1267
01:02:32,008 --> 01:02:33,997
And I'd say, "Oh, well,
he's taking lithium."

1268
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,998
<i>We had been talking for a while</i>

1269
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:38,000
<i>about trying
without the medication,</i>

1270
01:02:38,024 --> 01:02:40,001
<i>'cause it made him tired,
it made his mouth dry,</i>

1271
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:42,985
<i>it was really something
he didn't wanna do.</i>

1272
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,002
So we said "Okay.

1273
01:02:45,026 --> 01:02:48,989
You know, you...
You really wanna try this?"

1274
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:50,001
And he really did.

1275
01:02:50,025 --> 01:02:52,982
And the doctor said, "Okay."

1276
01:02:53,006 --> 01:02:56,005
<i>So he gradually went down
in the lithium dose</i>

1277
01:02:56,029 --> 01:02:58,996
<i>over a course
of four to six weeks.</i>

1278
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,979
<i>"March 30th, 2005.</i>

1279
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:04,981
"Lithium 0.56.

1280
01:03:05,005 --> 01:03:06,991
"Now sub therapeutic.

1281
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:10,004
"Was 1200 milligrams, didn't
take meds for a few days,

1282
01:03:10,028 --> 01:03:11,995
"became quote 'more talkative.'

1283
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:15,989
"At first,
decreased lithium was difficult,

1284
01:03:16,013 --> 01:03:17,988
"now fine.

1285
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:21,001
He feels better on lower dose."

1286
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,002
After awhile
I wasn't that conv...

1287
01:03:23,026 --> 01:03:24,998
You know, that he really was...

1288
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:27,005
I mean, I knew he was bipolar,
but...

1289
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:29,993
He seemed so fine.

1290
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:32,992
Also, I remember we talked
to him head on,

1291
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:36,000
"Do you have thoughts
of suicide?

1292
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:38,983
Do you wanna kill yourself?
Do you wanna harm yourself?"

1293
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,999
And he said no, you know.

1294
01:03:41,023 --> 01:03:42,997
"I don't."

1295
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:49,989
<i>Kids know that if they say
certain things,</i>

1296
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:52,995
<i>or if they do certain things,
they're gonna be stopped.</i>

1297
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:54,989
<i>You know.
Especially if they have parents</i>

1298
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:57,980
<i>who are attentive
to what's going on with them.</i>

1299
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:00,997
<i>So if a kid really
doesn't wanna be stopped,</i>

1300
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,984
<i>he's not gonna say anything.</i>

1301
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,999
Evan may have gotten to
the point where he got really...

1302
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:08,995
Just better
at masking it externally.

1303
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:12,990
<i>But internally,
it's a lot of suffering,</i>

1304
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:14,983
<i>and this was just
the beginning, I mean,</i>

1305
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:16,984
<i>it started when he was
much younger,</i>

1306
01:04:17,008 --> 01:04:19,991
<i>and it wasn't going away.</i>

1307
01:04:20,015 --> 01:04:22,997
<i>We went on vacation
for two weeks in Nantucket.</i>

1308
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:26,001
<i>And he seemed depressed.
He seemed subdued.</i>

1309
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:27,988
<i>Didn't seem too happy.</i>

1310
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:30,986
<i>He wasn't doing good.</i>

1311
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,980
<i>Then school started.</i>

1312
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:35,983
<i>He's sullen, he's depressed.</i>

1313
01:04:36,007 --> 01:04:38,002
<i>As the weeks unfolded
in September,</i>

1314
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:40,978
<i>he started getting more anxious
about his homework.</i>

1315
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,322
<i>And at one point, he came to me
and he said very seriously,</i>

1316
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:45,000
<i>"Mom, I need your help.</i>

1317
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:48,002
<i>I need you to stay after me."</i>

1318
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:50,996
<i>We had contacted
his psychiatrist</i>

1319
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,999
<i>and tried to make a meeting
as soon as possible</i>

1320
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,998
<i>to increase his dose of lithium.</i>

1321
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:59,028
<i>We said, "Let's get him back
on the lithium,</i>

1322
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,997
<i>this experiment didn't work."</i>

1323
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:02,995
<i>So we made an appointment
with the doctor</i>

1324
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:06,986
<i>for the following Tuesday.
October 4th.</i>

1325
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,983
<i>We hung out with him
that Friday night.</i>

1326
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:16,999
<i>We went to another teen club,
me and Nick.</i>

1327
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:20,979
We invited Evan to go,
but he just didn't want to.

1328
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:22,982
I mean, it might've been
his curfew or whatever,

1329
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:23,993
he just didn't wanna go.

1330
01:05:24,017 --> 01:05:26,004
And we didn't think it was
that big of a deal.

1331
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:27,984
We were just like, "Whatever,

1332
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,004
he wants to go home and chill,
so..."

1333
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:32,981
There was nothing
really beforehand

1334
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:34,000
that we could've seen.

1335
01:05:34,024 --> 01:05:36,982
I think if, like,

1336
01:05:37,006 --> 01:05:39,002
if someone is that sure

1337
01:05:39,026 --> 01:05:40,993
that they wanna do that
to themselves,

1338
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:44,013
they're gonna hide it
from someone, you know.

1339
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:50,003
<i>- The night he died
- I came over for dinner.</i>

1340
01:05:50,027 --> 01:05:52,999
<i>It was a Sunday evening.</i>

1341
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:54,143
We were all eating together,

1342
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:58,991
and I know Evan had some
homework that was unfinished,

1343
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:01,996
and he was...

1344
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,985
being a little obnoxious

1345
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:05,005
about not wanting
to do his homework,

1346
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,991
and started putting his feet
on the table,

1347
01:06:08,015 --> 01:06:11,982
<i>and, you know, his mom was
nagging him about his homework.</i>

1348
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:13,999
And they had a tiff.

1349
01:06:14,023 --> 01:06:15,995
And he was mad.

1350
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:18,983
The fight was very intense.

1351
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,994
As it often was.

1352
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,988
And, um, you know,
really just deeply intense.

1353
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:25,994
<i>I was doing the dishes,
and I was hot.</i>

1354
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:28,029
<i>You know. I was tired of this.</i>

1355
01:06:29,001 --> 01:06:32,001
And he goes up the stairs
and he said, "Mom, I hate you."

1356
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:35,001
<i>- And he shuts the door.
- And he locks it.</i>

1357
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:39,029
<i>- Leaving that night,
- I didn't think anything of it.</i>

1358
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:43,029
He wasn't behaving in any way
that would make me think,

1359
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,988
"This child is gonna
end his life tonight."

1360
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:50,002
Not in a million,
million, million years.

1361
01:06:50,026 --> 01:06:53,001
I mean, on my good days

1362
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:55,996
I've acted worse
than him at dinner.

1363
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,998
By this time it's around 10:00,

1364
01:06:58,022 --> 01:07:02,005
and I went into our bedroom
with Mikey,

1365
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,992
<i>and we're both reading.</i>

1366
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:05,999
<i>I was reading for a little bit,</i>

1367
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:08,998
and I go to check in on Evan.

1368
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:10,102
And he's unlocked the door.

1369
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,997
<i>I go in he's sitting
in his underwear</i>

1370
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:15,991
<i>on his bed with his computer</i>

1371
01:07:16,015 --> 01:07:17,990
And, you know,
I came over and I said,

1372
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:21,997
"Well, how you doing?
What's... What's happening?"

1373
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,982
And he said, "I'm fine, Dad.

1374
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:26,993
I'm doing my homework."

1375
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:29,029
<i>His computer,
it looked as though he was</i>

1376
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,001
<i>doing his homework,</i>

1377
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:34,000
so I go back to read with Mikey

1378
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:38,981
for another five minutes,
and, uh,

1379
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:40,982
you know, it's Mikey's bedtime.

1380
01:07:41,006 --> 01:07:42,989
So I bring Mikey into the room

1381
01:07:43,013 --> 01:07:46,984
and Evan's not there.

1382
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:52,024
<i>I immediately thought that
he had jumped out the window.</i>

1383
01:07:54,013 --> 01:07:58,010
<i>But it was an airshaft so you
couldn't really see anything.</i>

1384
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:03,003
Mikey shows up with this
little penlight

1385
01:08:03,027 --> 01:08:04,994
and I shine it down the shaft,

1386
01:08:05,018 --> 01:08:08,002
and I think I see something
but it's hard to tell.

1387
01:08:08,026 --> 01:08:10,992
Uh, and I'm starting to,
you know,

1388
01:08:11,016 --> 01:08:13,028
feel pretty concerned
at this point,

1389
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,982
and I run downstairs
to find the super,

1390
01:08:17,006 --> 01:08:19,986
<i>who had access to the airshaft.</i>

1391
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,003
I guess I was downstairs and,
uh,

1392
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:26,996
about to recline and watch TV

1393
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,991
and I was, uh,
half asleep, I guess.

1394
01:08:30,015 --> 01:08:32,983
And nothing unusual,

1395
01:08:33,007 --> 01:08:34,999
I just heard a noise.

1396
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:37,029
And I thought nothing of it.

1397
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:41,003
I thought maybe the girl
upstairs dropped something.

1398
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:42,997
Nothing. Nothing.

1399
01:08:43,021 --> 01:08:46,987
And I guess, I don't know
how many minutes later,

1400
01:08:47,011 --> 01:08:50,002
uh, somebody came banging on...
Was banging on my door.

1401
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:52,991
We were with Roger,
we had the light.

1402
01:08:53,015 --> 01:08:55,996
I had, um,
a cell phone and keys.

1403
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,991
And, uh, we went through this
labyrinth, some kind of way.

1404
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:02,002
And Hart got there first.
And, um, and Evan was there.

1405
01:09:02,026 --> 01:09:05,993
And, um, he was on his back,

1406
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,005
and there was blood.

1407
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:09,999
I thought he might be alive.

1408
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:15,024
But I... I felt his pulse,
and he wasn't.

1409
01:09:21,027 --> 01:09:23,029
So it got pretty chaotic.

1410
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:24,994
I was screaming, "Evan, Evan,

1411
01:09:25,018 --> 01:09:27,004
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan!"

1412
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:30,978
You know,
"Evan." I just... "Please."

1413
01:09:31,002 --> 01:09:32,992
And I went...
And Hart was in front of me,

1414
01:09:33,016 --> 01:09:36,983
and I said, "Get out of the way,
I wanna give him mouth-to-mouth,

1415
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,996
I wanna... Move out of the way."

1416
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,989
And he said, "Dana, just go...

1417
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:44,979
The paramedics are coming, go
upstairs, take care of Michael,

1418
01:09:45,003 --> 01:09:46,990
take care of... It's okay.
And he was very calm.

1419
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:48,989
I called Nick

1420
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:52,028
to come and look after

1421
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,002
Mikey and Dana,

1422
01:09:54,026 --> 01:09:58,978
'cause I had to go to
the hospital with... With Evan.

1423
01:09:59,002 --> 01:09:59,988
I was there comforting Michael,

1424
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:01,978
and we were praying
and I thought

1425
01:10:02,002 --> 01:10:02,994
that maybe he'd still live,

1426
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:05,999
maybe he's just broken
some bones, maybe he'll live.

1427
01:10:06,023 --> 01:10:07,029
And, um, at some point,

1428
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:08,992
I don't know when,
but Nick showed up.

1429
01:10:09,016 --> 01:10:11,981
<i>We pulled up
in front of the house,</i>

1430
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:12,994
<i>there were police cars outside,</i>

1431
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:15,983
<i>it was, like, "This is
fucking real. This is real."</i>

1432
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:17,990
And I walked into the apartment,

1433
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:21,984
and there were
police officers downstairs.

1434
01:10:22,008 --> 01:10:23,003
<i>You know, they looked at me</i>

1435
01:10:23,027 --> 01:10:25,997
<i>and started approaching me to
say, you know, "Who are you?"</i>

1436
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:29,983
And I pushed them out of the way
and just ran to Dana.

1437
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:31,987
And Michael was so amazing,
'cause he kept saying,

1438
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:34,005
"Mom, he's gonna be okay,
Mom, he's gonna be okay.

1439
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,997
Mom, he's gonna be okay,
Mom, he's gonna be okay."

1440
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:39,979
And we're just holding each
other, and then, you know,

1441
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,004
then Hart called
and I just knew immediately...

1442
01:10:42,028 --> 01:10:44,985
Just knew immediately
what happened, that he was dead.

1443
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:47,021
I just couldn't believe it.

1444
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,994
So then, um, Jean drove me
to the hospital,

1445
01:10:52,018 --> 01:10:55,002
and he was at St. Vincent's,
where he had been before,

1446
01:10:55,026 --> 01:10:58,988
and I was taken
into the room where he was,

1447
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:01,029
on the stretcher, and, um...

1448
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:10,979
Um, you know, he wasn't cold,
and he had his, um,

1449
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:11,989
he had his boxer shorts on.

1450
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:14,981
I took the sheet down like this,
I held him,

1451
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,982
and, um, I closed his eyes.

1452
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:20,009
And that was it.

1453
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:24,998
And then...

1454
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:28,978
I got a call in the car

1455
01:11:29,002 --> 01:11:31,029
from Nick,

1456
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:34,987
and he said, "I found his note.

1457
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:36,011
I found his note."

1458
01:11:40,005 --> 01:11:42,994
<i>I remember the officers
asking me</i>

1459
01:11:43,018 --> 01:11:44,990
<i>whether there was
a suicide note,</i>

1460
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:47,984
<i>and I hadn't even
thought about that,</i>

1461
01:11:48,008 --> 01:11:50,980
<i>and we looked around his room,</i>

1462
01:11:51,004 --> 01:11:53,003
<i>and there was nothing, and then
he pointed to the computer,</i>

1463
01:11:53,027 --> 01:11:56,990
<i>and opened it,
touched the screen,</i>

1464
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,981
<i>and, sure enough,</i>

1465
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:02,986
<i>a letter came up.</i>

1466
01:13:15,002 --> 01:13:15,982
To be honest,

1467
01:13:16,006 --> 01:13:19,981
the gist of the letter was...

1468
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:22,982
what every fucking 15-year-old

1469
01:13:23,006 --> 01:13:24,978
thinks about themself.

1470
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:27,003
That "I'm not good enough,

1471
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,989
"no one likes me,

1472
01:13:30,013 --> 01:13:32,028
things won't get better."

1473
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,982
The difference is Evan felt that

1474
01:13:36,006 --> 01:13:38,004
20,000 times stronger

1475
01:13:38,028 --> 01:13:40,986
than any normal 15-year-old,

1476
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:44,004
and he believed more strongly

1477
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,991
that things wouldn't get better

1478
01:13:46,015 --> 01:13:47,989
and that there was no future,

1479
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:52,980
and living was too painful,

1480
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:56,029
too difficult, and...

1481
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:59,990
death was his only answer.

1482
01:14:00,014 --> 01:14:02,982
But it was, I mean, verbatim...

1483
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:06,982
I could've checked off
that list and, you know,

1484
01:14:07,006 --> 01:14:10,988
if he had showed me that note
before he made his decision,

1485
01:14:11,012 --> 01:14:12,986
I could've gone through it
with him and said,

1486
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,991
"Thought that, thought that,
thought that.

1487
01:14:16,015 --> 01:14:18,979
"I realized they're all
untrue for me,

1488
01:14:19,003 --> 01:14:22,978
"they're definitely
all untrue for you.

1489
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:25,002
"You know, and some of
the qualities about yourself

1490
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:26,995
"that make you feel
different right now,

1491
01:14:27,019 --> 01:14:28,992
"you're gonna learn
in five years

1492
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:30,980
"that those are your
best qualities,

1493
01:14:31,004 --> 01:14:33,992
"and those are what
set you apart from people

1494
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:35,028
"and make you interesting

1495
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,001
and attract others to you."

1496
01:14:39,025 --> 01:14:42,984
But, you know,

1497
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:46,022
that opportunity did not arise.

1498
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:58,013
So, what do you make of that?

1499
01:15:00,025 --> 01:15:01,984
I think

1500
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:05,003
that he foresaw...

1501
01:15:05,027 --> 01:15:06,992
He must have been getting

1502
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:10,978
a glimpse of adult life,

1503
01:15:11,002 --> 01:15:12,984
and that he foresaw

1504
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,984
that he was not going to make it

1505
01:15:16,008 --> 01:15:18,011
in the way that he
wanted to make it.

1506
01:15:19,012 --> 01:15:21,986
You know, in psychiatry,

1507
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,979
bipolar is our cancer.

1508
01:15:24,003 --> 01:15:25,028
It kills people.

1509
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,200
You do everything you can,
and some people can be saved,

1510
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:30,000
and probably we could've saved...

1511
01:15:30,024 --> 01:15:33,999
Definitely we could've
saved him for a while,

1512
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:36,983
but he would have gone
off his medication,

1513
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:39,995
They... All these kids do,
they all go off them.

1514
01:15:40,019 --> 01:15:42,998
And when he went off,
he just went so fast.

1515
01:15:43,022 --> 01:15:44,996
Maybe his illness was changing

1516
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,997
into the type where people
really do get crazy.

1517
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:49,981
He never talked
about any of this?

1518
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:50,982
Any of that. No.

1519
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:52,978
No? He never talked...?
Any of that.

1520
01:15:53,002 --> 01:15:54,992
He denied feeling it, he never
talked about any of this.

1521
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:58,993
Never did he say anything like
he didn't trust his friends?

1522
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,990
But this is crazy talk.
That's crazy talk.

1523
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:02,983
I mean, you know... Crazy talk,

1524
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:03,989
but it's done so sanely.

1525
01:16:04,013 --> 01:16:06,029
Numbered, and so precise.

1526
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:09,999
That's what makes me so mad
with all the portrayals of, uh,

1527
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,991
mental illness that you see
on TV and movies,

1528
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:17,993
it's like raving, crazy,
foaming at the mouth,

1529
01:16:18,017 --> 01:16:21,002
not, you know,
"sanely" sitting there...

1530
01:16:21,026 --> 01:16:25,986
Hyper-sanely... typing this,
you know, horrible thing out.

1531
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:26,998
Ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.

1532
01:16:27,022 --> 01:16:30,987
Just with thought, already
knowing he was gonna do it.

1533
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:33,028
You know, that's insanity.

1534
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:37,997
On behalf of the congregation
of this church

1535
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:39,988
I would like to welcome
all of you

1536
01:17:40,012 --> 01:17:43,986
in mourning the passing
of Evan today.

1537
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,997
This is a place...

1538
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:47,996
<i>When I went to Evan's funeral,</i>

1539
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:52,979
<i>I felt that I was going through
the same thing again,</i>

1540
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:54,991
<i>it was like a repeat.
It was the same church,</i>

1541
01:17:55,015 --> 01:17:57,029
<i>it was the same family.</i>

1542
01:17:58,001 --> 01:18:01,989
<i>It was that little boy,
35 years later.</i>

1543
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:03,991
And Beati was with me.

1544
01:18:04,015 --> 01:18:07,996
Scott's mother...
And Evan's grandmother,

1545
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,003
and Hart's mother...
Was sitting next to me

1546
01:18:10,027 --> 01:18:12,983
and hold... Hanging onto me,

1547
01:18:13,007 --> 01:18:14,989
and she would say
during the ceremony,

1548
01:18:15,013 --> 01:18:17,983
she would say,
"Martine, why did Scott die?

1549
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:19,005
Why did Scott kill himself?"

1550
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:22,029
<i>And, you know,
she knew that she had a son</i>

1551
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,027
<i>who committed suicide,</i>

1552
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,029
<i>and who died,
but she could not remember.</i>

1553
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:37,991
I was briefly
trying to explain to her

1554
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:40,995
that it was the same disease,

1555
01:18:41,019 --> 01:18:44,001
that he died for the same
reasons Evan died.

1556
01:18:44,025 --> 01:18:47,028
I feel relieved to know
that Evan has found peace,

1557
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,999
even if it means
that we must take on pain.

1558
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:52,029
Through his memory we realize

1559
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:55,992
the extreme precariousness
and preciousness of life.

1560
01:18:56,016 --> 01:18:58,990
We must cherish and savor
the lives we have,

1561
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:00,989
the relationships we enjoy,

1562
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:05,002
as much as we can
for as long as we can.

1563
01:19:40,015 --> 01:19:42,001
A lot of the time,
before I go to sleep,

1564
01:19:42,025 --> 01:19:44,993
sometimes I just, I mean,

1565
01:19:45,017 --> 01:19:47,984
I can't help
but think about him.

1566
01:19:48,008 --> 01:19:49,981
You don't wanna, like,

1567
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:51,984
make everything depressed

1568
01:19:52,008 --> 01:19:56,001
by talking about it every day,
you know?

1569
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:59,000
But it's always there, you know.

1570
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:01,028
I mean,
you can't not talk about it.

1571
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,985
When I read his note,

1572
01:20:03,009 --> 01:20:05,982
I could tell that it was
spirit of the moment,

1573
01:20:06,006 --> 01:20:07,990
and that, hopefully at least,

1574
01:20:08,014 --> 01:20:10,989
he didn't mean
some of the stuff that he said.

1575
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:13,989
His note, it didn't come
from the Evan I knew.

1576
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:16,985
It was just... It was depressing

1577
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:20,986
to see, like, just the horrible
stuff he said

1578
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:25,012
about not having friends, and...

1579
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:29,009
I know he didn't mean it.

1580
01:20:45,019 --> 01:20:47,986
To thy hands,
oh merciful savior,

1581
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,987
we command thy servant, Evan.

1582
01:20:52,011 --> 01:20:55,984
Receive him into the arms
of thy mercy,

1583
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:59,983
into the blessed rest
of everlasting peace,

1584
01:21:00,007 --> 01:21:01,991
and into the glorious company

1585
01:21:02,015 --> 01:21:04,987
of the saints in light.

1586
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,013
Amen.

1587
01:22:09,017 --> 01:22:12,002
They forgot to, uh, dig the...

1588
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,012
Everything but the hole.

1589
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:23,000
Well, anyway, who would've
told them where to dig it?

1590
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:25,002
I don't know
how these things work.

1591
01:22:25,026 --> 01:22:27,982
I don't know, you know.

1592
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:29,326
Somebody has to mark off where...

1593
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:32,001
All right, we'll do it,
we'll do it.

1594
01:22:35,007 --> 01:22:37,009
Oh, you.

1595
01:22:42,014 --> 01:22:43,001
Oh, he's laughing, all right.

1596
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:44,989
Mm-hm. You better believe it.

1597
01:22:45,013 --> 01:22:48,005
He's roaring over this weather.

1598
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,981
He that raised up
Jesus from the dead

1599
01:22:51,005 --> 01:22:53,005
will also give life
to our mortal bodies

1600
01:22:53,029 --> 01:22:57,987
in the sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life

1601
01:22:58,011 --> 01:22:59,998
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1602
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:03,985
We command to almighty God
our brother, Evan,

1603
01:23:04,009 --> 01:23:05,994
and we commit his body
to the ground,

1604
01:23:06,018 --> 01:23:08,986
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

1605
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,985
dust to dust. Amen.

1606
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:13,983
Amen.

1607
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:54,984
<i>When somebody is that deep</i>

1608
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,982
and far into depression,

1609
01:23:58,006 --> 01:24:02,006
in such incredible pain,
there's nothing we can do.

1610
01:24:03,021 --> 01:24:05,019
Nothing.

1611
01:24:08,024 --> 01:24:09,064
<i>It's survival...</i>

1612
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:13,029
<i>Is really very difficult.</i>

1613
01:24:15,029 --> 01:24:18,005
But, anyway,
you do the best you can.

1614
01:24:18,029 --> 01:24:20,982
Why else does he put us there?

1615
01:24:21,006 --> 01:24:22,986
You know that. There isn't any...

1616
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:25,978
There isn't any choice.

1617
01:24:26,002 --> 01:24:29,995
If you found one, believe me,
deary, pass it along.

1618
01:24:30,019 --> 01:24:34,980
'Cause there is no choice.

1619
01:24:35,004 --> 01:24:37,029
There isn't a choice to cope.

1620
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:38,999
There isn't.

1621
01:24:39,023 --> 01:24:42,978
I have a family. I have people
I love and people who love me,

1622
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:45,986
and, uh, you really have
no choice

1623
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,993
but to get up and put one foot
in front of the other.

1624
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:51,991
And, um, basically,

1625
01:24:52,015 --> 01:24:53,992
I think the thing
that I think about most is, uh,

1626
01:24:54,016 --> 01:24:55,997
is I just can't believe it.

1627
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:58,003
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it.

1628
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:59,991
I can't believe
I'm sitting here.

1629
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:03,994
I can't believe...

1630
01:25:04,018 --> 01:25:07,983
that, um...

1631
01:25:08,007 --> 01:25:12,001
that I gave birth to this boy
and raised him...

1632
01:25:13,005 --> 01:25:14,978
and buried him.
I can't believe it.

1633
01:25:15,002 --> 01:25:15,995
It's just a sense of disbelief.

1634
01:25:16,019 --> 01:25:18,982
I don't know if I'll ever really
understand that it's true.

1635
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:19,987
That this really happened.

1636
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:21,005
I can't believe
it really happened.

1637
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:22,983
Tell me it's a dream.

1638
01:25:23,007 --> 01:25:24,982
I can't believe it. I can't.

1639
01:25:25,006 --> 01:25:28,978
And I can't believe
that the days continue to go by,

1640
01:25:29,002 --> 01:25:30,021
and the...

1641
01:25:32,006 --> 01:25:35,986
And that the world
continues to rotate

1642
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,010
without him.

1643
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,990
Oh, nice. Here, look at that.

1644
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,002
Into the ground again.

1645
01:25:58,017 --> 01:26:01,978
I hope this tree grows
strong and proud,

1646
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:04,990
and beautiful,
to remind us of Evan.

1647
01:26:05,014 --> 01:26:07,998
And always provide
beauty and shade

1648
01:26:08,022 --> 01:26:10,003
for future generations.

1649
01:26:10,027 --> 01:26:12,028
And that every time we see it,

1650
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,990
we'll always think
of how much we loved him,

1651
01:26:15,014 --> 01:26:17,029
and how we'll always
remember him.

1652
01:26:24,001 --> 01:26:28,005
That's the part
that is gonna, I guess, change,

1653
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:30,028
which is that as time passes

1654
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,001
I'll begin to believe
that it's true,

1655
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:35,997
and that, basically,
what I have left of him

1656
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:39,993
is those...
The 15 years that we had,

1657
01:26:40,017 --> 01:26:42,985
and, uh...

1658
01:26:43,009 --> 01:26:45,994
that there was beauty in that.

1659
01:26:46,018 --> 01:26:48,980
And joy, and, uh,

1660
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:50,998
that maybe there's a lesson,
or maybe we can learn something,

1661
01:26:51,022 --> 01:26:55,001
or... Or communicate something,
but, um,

1662
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:56,994
you know,
in terms of coping it's just,

1663
01:26:57,018 --> 01:27:00,000
you know, it's our choice.

1664
01:27:00,024 --> 01:27:02,029
I don't have a choice.

1665
01:27:04,005 --> 01:27:06,000
There is none.

1666
01:28:01,013 --> 01:28:04,000
<i>Even though we lost this battle,</i>

1667
01:28:04,024 --> 01:28:05,995
<i>we'll never forget
the experience we had</i>

1668
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:08,008
<i>at Wellspring.</i>

1669
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:16,983
<i>I volunteered to make beams</i>

1670
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:19,018
<i>for the barn at Wellspring.</i>

1671
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:23,996
<i>By the farm and sawmill.</i>

1672
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:28,991
<i>And it was a way of giving
something back to Wellspring,</i>

1673
01:28:29,015 --> 01:28:31,024
<i>that had given us so much.</i>

1674
01:28:39,007 --> 01:28:40,993
<i>And that's gonna be a building
where other kids</i>

1675
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:46,002
<i>are gonna be able to get the
kind of therapy that Evan got.</i>

1676
01:28:49,014 --> 01:28:52,982
These beams here,
these are ours.

1677
01:28:53,006 --> 01:28:54,993
All the side beams,

1678
01:28:55,017 --> 01:28:59,007
and look at that inscription
over there.

1679
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:13,999
<i>Here was an opportunity
to make something physical</i>

1680
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:16,003
<i>in memory of Evan.</i>

1681
01:29:19,027 --> 01:29:21,984
People can say, "Well,
who's Evan?" It doesn't matter.

1682
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:26,983
What matters is,
is that, you know,

1683
01:29:27,007 --> 01:29:31,980
somebody loved Evan enough to...

1684
01:29:32,004 --> 01:29:34,996
want to remember his name.

1685
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:01,985
So we come thanking God
for what he has blessed,

1686
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:03,993
for the sacredness of this land,

1687
01:30:04,017 --> 01:30:05,993
asking that God will continue
to watch over

1688
01:30:06,017 --> 01:30:09,005
everyone who works here and all
those who've been part of it.
