{y:i}when you realize that the threshold{y}
{y:i}to the UnderVerse will be crossed...{y}

321
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:53,385
{y:i}only by those who have{y}
{y:i}embraced the Necromonger faith.{y}

322
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,597
For those of you
who will right now...

323
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,726
drop to your knees
and ask to be purified.

324
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,313
We will not renounce our faith!
No one here
will do what you ask.

325
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,191
It is unthinkable!

326
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:12,654
{y:i}This is a world of many peoples,{y}
{y:i}many religions.!{y}

327
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:17,117
And we simply cannot
and will not be converted!

328
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,995
[Gasps]
Then I'll take your soul.

329
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,884
{y:i}- Join him...{y}
{y:i}- [Body Thuds]{y}

330
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:37,179
Or join me.

331
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,743
This is your one chance.

332
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,287
Take the Lord Marshal's offer
and bow.

333
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,207
I bow to no man.

334
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,383
He's not a man.

335
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,136
He's the holy Half-Dead
who has seen the UnderVerse.

336
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,681
Look, I'm not
with everyone here.

337
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,392
But I will take a piece of him.

338
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,942
A piece you will have.

339
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,161
- [Growls]
{y:i}- [People Gasping]{y}

340
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:55,841
[People Gasping]

341
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,972
{y:i}Stop him.!{y}

342
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,820
Irgun. One of my best.

343
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,364
If you say so.

344
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,329
What do you think of this blade?

345
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,466
I think it's a half-gram heavy
on the back end.

346
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,510
In our faith,

347
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,720
you keep what you kill.

348
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,223
[Straining]

349
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,063
Are you familiar to me?

350
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:57,402
Have we met
on some distant field?

351
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,322
You'd think I'd remember.

352
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,118
You'd think I would too.

353
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,747
Take him before the Quasi-Deads.

354
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,091
Perhaps the breeder
would do it...

355
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,635
if somebody just asked him.

356
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,014
It is a rare offer.

357
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,894
A visit inside Necropolis.

358
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:36,191
It's been a long time
since I smelled beautiful.

359
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,153
Let me show you the way.

360
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,084
Beautiful eyes.

361
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,170
Come.

362
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:45,010
The last six Lord Marshals
have called this home.

363
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,346
Magnificent, isn't it?

364
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:51,183
I might have gone
a different way.
True of us all.

365
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:57,272
{y:i}Converts receiving the mark{y}
{y:i}of the Necromonger.{y}

366
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:02,778
They learn how one pain
can lessen another.

367
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,919
There now.

368
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,882
That is just... perfect.

369
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,472
The more you resist them,

370
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,891
the greater the damage will be.

371
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:38,480

{y:i}[High-pitched Whining]{y}

374

{y:i}- [Female Voice] Furyans.{y}

386
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:57,226
Where does he come from?

387
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:01,772
Who are his people?
These are the things I need to know.

388

{y:i}[Female Voice]{y}
{y:i}We find energy.{y}

Kill the Riddick.

400
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,523
Who is this man?

401
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,361
Find him. Whatever it takes. Find him!

402
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:11,151
Let me guess.
A five-man crew this time.

403
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,529
Couple of things
you could have done better.

404
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:22,538
First, trash the locator beacon
inside my ship... the one you jacked.

405
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,958
{y:i}And second... and this is really{y}
{y:i}the more important part...{y}

406
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,253
dust my dick
when you get the chance.

407
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,048
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

408
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,219
What took you so long?

409
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,770
Let's go, big boy.

410
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,787
In and out, unsuspected and undetected.
Damn, I love a good smash-and-grab.

411
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,415
Not so fast. Not so fast.

412
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,917
Dickheads.
We're pickin' up fields here.

413
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,920
{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Unknown fields detected on hull.{y}

414
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,549
I knew it. Here it comes.
This is some kind of scan.

415
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,593
I don't know.
Readin' our Btus, maybe?

416
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:21,180
- Let's drop one.
- Dropping.

417
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:31,190
{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Decoy launched.{y}

418
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,948
{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Preparing to engage ion drive.{y}
So,

419
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:43,952
where do we drop
your merc-killin' ass?

420
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:46,330
{y:i}Who's gonna pay{y}
{y:i}the most for you now?{y}

421
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:50,125
- Butcher Bay?
- Butcher Bay.

422
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,961
Ten minutes every other day
on the dog run.

423
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:56,006
Protein waffles aren't bad.

424
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,968
Hey, how 'bout Ursa Luna?
Nice little double-max prison.

425
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,431
They keep a cell open for me...
just in case I drop in.

426
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:06,433
Y{y:i}ou know the problem{y}
{y:i}with thesejoints now?{y}

427
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:09,478
Health clubs
for waffle-eatin' pussies.

428
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,272
Maybe we should think about
uppin' our game here a little bit.

429
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,691
Think about someplace
truly diabolical.

430
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,777
What the hell is he thinkin' now?

431
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,363
{y:i}[Riddick]{y}
{y:i}He's thinkin'a triple-max prison.{y}

432
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,824
{y:i}A no-daylight slam.{y}
{y:i}Only three of'em left in this system...{y}

433
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:27,204
two of'em outta range
for a shitty little undercutter
like this one with no legs.

434
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:30,791
Leavin'just... one...

435
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,836
Crematoria.

436
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,672
That is what you had in mind,
right, Toombs?

437
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:40,384
- Hey, how does he know
where we're goin', and we don't?
- Dope it out.

438
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:43,220
- I hate this run.
- Just do it!

439
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,973
Don't know about this
new crew of yours.

440
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,351
They seem a bit skittish.

441
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:52,980
Probably shouldn't tell 'em
what happened to the last crew.

442
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:05,158
You know, you supposed
to be some slick-shit killer.

443
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:07,786
Now look at you...

444
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,039
all back-of-the-bus
and shit.

445
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,245
{y:i}I say we attack Helion Two next.{y}

446
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:52,247
Take it straight
into their teeth.

447
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:55,751
It'll cost you 20,000 heads,
five warrior ships.
Nothing more, I swear it.

448
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,129
While I do prize brute force,

449
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,341
this approach
is perhaps more artful.

450
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:05,260
Start at the end.

451
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,304
Go straight to Helion Five,

452
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,598
the last planet
in the system.

453
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,267
We approach from the night side.

454
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:15,312
{y:i}Remove these cannon first,{y}

455
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:18,232
then attack
the larger placements at speed.

456
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:21,109
{y:i}We'll catch them on their rear flank.{y}
{y:i}And in ten days'time,{y}

457
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:25,489
{y:i}the rest of those worlds{y}
{y:i}will tumble before us.{y}

458
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,908
You see, as with most,
their blind spot...

459
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,285
is right behind them.

460
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:35,916
I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

461
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,669
Then you should be
off-world, Vaako.

462
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:41,338
I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.

463
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:45,133
Wherever Riddick has gone,
you lens him out and cleanse him.

464
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:50,097
- You.
- You want me to take a frigate
for one breeder?

465
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,266
Don't question it, Vaako!

466
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:57,354
Take it on faith.

467
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:03,944
He's always been unsettled around you...

468
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,029
the Lord Marshal.

469
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,991
Unsteady.

470
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:12,744
Perhaps because he knows
he's half the warrior you are.

471
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:15,873
{y:i}Some say he's too artistic{y}
{y:i}for thejob.{y}

472
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,002
I wouldn't be surprised
if someone promoted him soon...

473
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:23,005
{y:i}to full dead.{y}

474
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:27,342
Take care what you say.

475
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:30,345
Should I say it softly?

476
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,348
So it sounds more
like conspiracy?

477
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:37,269
Oh, why is it that when anyone
breathes about the demise of him
on the throne...

478
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:40,022

983
01:46:55,165 --> 01:46:57,167
where they shall begin true life.

984
01:46:57,251 --> 01:46:59,545
Tell me what I want to hear, Aereon,

985
01:46:59,628 --> 01:47:03,715
and maybe
I'll save your home world... for last.

986
01:47:08,554 --> 01:47:11,056
- The odds are good...
- That?

987
01:47:11,139 --> 01:47:13,684
That you will reach the UnderVerse...

988
01:47:16,895 --> 01:47:18,897
{y:i}soon.{y}

989
01:47:57,269 --> 01:47:59,062
Ascension protocol!

990
01:47:59,146 --> 01:48:02,858
We still have numbers
out there, Lord Marshal...
sweep teams, recon ships.

991
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:04,985
They would be hard-pressed
to make it back...

992
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:13,577
Get my armada off the ground!

993
01:48:16,371 --> 01:48:19,041
{y:i}[Engines Thrumming]{y}
{y:i}[Large Machinery Noises]{y}

[Heavy Slam]

996
01:49:02,251 --> 01:49:04,419
- [Chattering Continues]
- [Heavy Slam]

997
01:49:15,138 --> 01:49:18,684
- You mean on Helion?
- I mean here, on this very ship!

998
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:23,063
Could you be wrong?
Mind fabricates fear.

999
01:49:23,146 --> 01:49:27,401
Could you be wrong?
Not so wrong as you
when you left him alive!

1000
01:49:27,484 --> 01:49:29,403
It's twice a mistake.

1001
01:49:29,486 --> 01:49:32,739
Not only your failure,
but now the report of success.

1002
01:49:32,823 --> 01:49:36,410
How do we salvage this? How? How?

1003
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:39,037
Lord Marshal's got to be warned.

1004
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:41,039
You will never see the UnderVerse!

1005
01:49:42,374 --> 01:49:44,501
He will kill us both
before our due time.

1006
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:49,590
I say give Riddick his chance.

1007
01:49:54,428 --> 01:49:57,014
If he is half of what you think,

1008
01:49:57,097 --> 01:49:59,141
he can at least wound the Lord Marshal...

1009
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:01,685
and that is when you must act.

1010
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:04,146
Just to take his place?
Just to keep what I kill?

1011
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:06,940
- That is the Necromonger way.
- It is not enough!

1012
01:50:07,024 --> 01:50:09,776
Then you do it for the faith!

1013
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:12,571
If he has fear, he has weakness.

1014
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:14,573
If he has weakness, Vaako...

1015
01:50:16,617 --> 01:50:18,785
He is unworthy of lordship.

1016
01:50:19,786 --> 01:50:22,122
We do it for all Necromongers.

1017
01:50:23,624 --> 01:50:25,792
Protect the faith.

1018
01:50:25,876 --> 01:50:28,879
This can still be a day of days,

1019
01:50:28,962 --> 01:50:31,048
but the timing...

1020
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:34,134
must be flawless.

1021
01:50:55,948 --> 01:50:59,493
Final protocol.
Execute on my order.

1025

Are they leaving now?

1026
01:51:39,825 --> 01:51:42,619
Ziza! Go inside!

1027
01:52:22,618 --> 01:52:24,661

1028
01:52:34,379 --> 01:52:36,632

1031
01:52:56,818 --> 01:52:58,820
He won't escape twice.

- [Grunts]
- Stay your weapons!

1038
01:54:55,771 --> 01:54:57,773
He came for me.

1039
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:26,885
{y:i}[Lord Marshal]{y}
{y:i}Consider this;{y}

1040
01:55:31,765 --> 01:55:35,853
{y:i}If you fall here now,{y}

1041
01:55:35,936 --> 01:55:37,855
you'll never rise.

1042
01:55:37,938 --> 01:55:41,066
{y:i}But if you choose another way...{y}

1043
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:44,403
{y:i}the Necromonger way...{y}

1044
01:55:44,486 --> 01:55:46,989
{y:i}you'll die in due time...{y}

1045
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:50,826
and rise again in the UnderVerse.

1046
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,671
Go to him.

1047
01:56:10,179 --> 01:56:12,181
It hurts...

1048
01:56:13,182 --> 01:56:15,434
at first.

1049
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:19,104
But after a while,
the pain goes away,
just as they promise.

1050
01:56:21,523 --> 01:56:24,026
- Are you with me, Kyra?
- There's a moment...

1051
01:56:24,109 --> 01:56:26,528
when you can almost
see the UnderVerse through his eyes.

1052
01:56:27,863 --> 01:56:30,616
It makes it sound perfect...

1053
01:56:30,699 --> 01:56:32,618
a place where anyone
can start over.

1054
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:35,162
Are you with me, Kyra?

1055
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:50,135
Convert now...

1056
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:52,387
or fall forever.

1057
01:56:57,142 --> 01:56:59,436
You killed everything I know.

1058
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:05,776
Vaako.

1059
01:57:05,817 --> 01:57:07,778
[Grunts]

1060
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:10,113
Not yet.

1061
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:24,628
Been a long time
since I've seen my own blood.

1062
01:58:42,915 --> 01:58:45,918
These are his last moments.

1063

[Grunting]

1064
01:59:05,521 --> 01:59:08,357
Give me your soul.

Help me, Vaako. Kill him.

Vaako?

1081
02:01:20,447 --> 02:01:22,449
Forgive me.

1082

No.

No-o-o!
[Echoing]

1085
02:02:07,077 --> 02:02:10,205
Now what would be
the odds of that?

1086
02:02:23,177 --> 02:02:25,762
I thought you were dead.

1087
02:02:28,015 --> 02:02:30,559
Are you with me, Kyra?

1088
02:02:32,644 --> 02:02:35,230
[Sighs]
I was always with you.

1089
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:39,568
I was.

You keep what you kill.
