1
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,829
Just you...

2
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,999
just me.

3
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,919
Let’s find
a cosy spot...

4
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,256
where no one can see.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,051
Just us...

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,346
just we.

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,933
We’ve missed
an awful lot...

8
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,311
what bliss it’ll be!

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,189
Oh gee!

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,943
What are your charms for?

11
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,405
What are
my arms for?

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,033
Use your imagination!

13
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,456
Just you...

14
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,294
just me.

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,380
We’ll tie a lover’s knot...

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,508
just say you love me.

17
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,651
Just he...

18
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,905
just she.

19
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,365
And what a perfect plot...

20
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,285
just say you love me.

21
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,455
Oh gee!

22
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,123
Oh my!

23
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,209
It’s finally springtime...

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,837
birds-on-the-wing time...

25
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,341
and what a lovely
day for love.

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,093
Just me...

27
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,512
just you.

28
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,388
Just you...

29
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,640
just me.

30
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,226
A bit of paradise...

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,978
right here for us two.

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,440
Just you...

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,860
Just me.

34
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,614
Let’s find
a cosy spot...

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,700
where no one can see.

36
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,286
Just us...

37
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,247
just the two of us...

38
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,540
just we...

39
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,250
mighty few of us.

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,752
We’ve missed
an awful lot...

41
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,463
what bliss it’ll be!

42
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,356
Just you...

43
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,277
just me.

44
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,738
We’ll tie a lover’s knot...

45
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,868
just say you love me.

46
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,624
That’s my sister Skylar and
her boyfriend Holden.

47
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,001
And that’s me.

48
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,712
I’m Djuna:
D-J-U-N-A.

49
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,047
Everyone calls me DJ.

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,966
I’m gonna level with you.

51
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,636
We’re not the typical family
from a musical comedy.

52
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,555
For one thing,
we got dough.

53
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,517
And we live on Park Avenue
in a penthouse apartment.

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,938
Dad’s a lawyer. I mean, I call him ‘Dad’,
but really he’s ‘Stepdad.’

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,608
Because there’s
original Dad, right...?

56
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,568
who married Mom,
and they had me.

57
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,322
And then there’s Stepdad, who
had 2 kids with his first wife...

58
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,533
Okay, look, maybe this
is getting confusing for you.

59
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,452
You see, there’s Lane and Laura.

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,913
My half-sisters. They’re great.

61
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,123
A little twitty at times, but...

62
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,293
we love each other and have
a million laughs together.

63
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,129
And my stepbrother Scott,
who’s very smart...

64
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,133
but he’s in trouble with the family
because he’s a Republican...

65
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,429
which made my stepfather have
a stroke, since we’re Democrats.

66
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,142
How do you expect people on
welfare to develop initiative?

67
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,771
You mean someone who can’t
work should just be discarded?

68
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,733
Welfare does not work. It’s
the same liberal fantasy world...

69
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,487
as not allowing school prayer
and coddling criminals.

70
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,782
I can’t believe I’m having
this talk with my own son.

71
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,952
Unless Republican pods
in the basement took over your body.

72
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,828
Not pods, Dad.

73
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,790
Ideas. Virile, modern ideas.

74
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,751
A strong America. The
right to bear arms.

75
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,419
Arms? Guns?

76
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,382
Are you crazy? What’s up with
you? I just don’t understand you!

77
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,008
Relax.

78
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,805
Excuse me. Steffi, bring down
a copy of my will and an eraser.

79
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:09,810
If Dad’s a Liberal Democrat,
then Mom’s even more extreme.

80
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,812
She’s a guilty
Liberal Democrat.

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,566
He grew up poor and knows
what it’s like to work like a dog.

82
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,193
Mom came from money and
luxury and...

83
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,905
spends all her time doing
volunteer work for everybody.

84
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,410
She’s with the Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales...

85
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,080
and raises dough for the Whitney
museum and the hospital...

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
and she’s always
doing something...

87
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,420
Iike throwing some chic soirée
to help the N. Y. Philharmonic.

88
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,695
Lane and Laura go to Nightingale,
a ritzy school on 92nd street.

89
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,948
White truffles are
so much better...

90
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,950
Better than dark truffles.

91
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:48,909
My God!

92
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,827
My God, there he is!

93
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,996
-He’s so gorgeous.
-Who is he?

94
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,333
We don’t know. We always
see him round here.

95
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,252
She’s in love from afar.

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,462
We’ll find a way to get
her to meet him.

97
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,257
Please, no
humiliating schemes.

98
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,678
My mom is in with a patient.

99
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,515
Claire’s their best friend.
Her mom’s a shrink.

100
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,226
Years ago, Claire drilled
a hole in the wall.

101
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,605
We get our kicks after school
by tuning in on her clientele.

102
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,193
I’ve been having
these fantasies about...

103
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,696
other men and...

104
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,407
it makes me feel...

105
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,158
bad, and...

106
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,035
guilty.

107
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,330
I had that
elevator dream...

108
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,832
again...

109
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,125
and...

110
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,836
I’m in the elevator and...

111
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,173
it just keeps
going up and up...

112
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,674
and up.

113
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,677
Now you must
meet Grandpa.

114
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,971
88 years old.

115
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,767
Found him at Grand Central.
He thought he was in the park.

116
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,019
You must watch him.

117
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,480
Last year he wandered
out in a towel...

118
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,816
and got in line
in Times Square.

119
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,943
We sent Frieda
to get him back.

120
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:09,114
She’s our maid. I think she was
Hitler’s maid at Berchtesgaden.

121
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,242
But she’s the only one
who can handle Grandpa.

122
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,162
I found your
arch supports...

123
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,081
in the stew. How did
they get there?

124
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,630
Finally, there’s my dad, who
lives in Paris, but visits a lot.

125
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,174
He and my stepdad
are great friends.

126
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,678
I think he still loves Mom, though
they’ve been divorced for years.

127
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,390
They’re all friends, and they come
to each other with their problems.

128
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,352
I can’t believe it.
Giselle left me.

129
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,770
Look at this face.

130
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,189
She suddenly left me
with my best friend.

131
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,357
No warning?

132
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,360
Nothing. The two of them...
Did you ever see anyone so...?

133
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,154
I’m so distraught, over
this, I can’t tell you.

134
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,405
I’ll kill myself.

135
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,159
I’ll go back to Paris and jump
off the Eiffel Tower. I’ll be dead.

136
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,080
If I get the Concorde, I could
be dead 3 hours earlier.

137
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,873
Or, wait a minute...

138
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,416
with the time change...

139
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,128
I could be alive 6 hours in New
York, but dead 3 hours in Paris.

140
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,589
I could get things done,
and also be dead.

141
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,385
You didn’t see the signs. She
must have given you some signs.

142
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,053
You think I’m an idiot?

143
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,057
What kind of signs? Finding his
photo in her underwear drawer?

144
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,476
Or saying his name
as she climaxed?

145
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,646
-I don’t mean that.
-No, that’s what happened.

146
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,648
I just couldn’t put it together.

147
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,484
I’m glad you didn’t marry her.
I told you, ‘Don’t do it.’

148
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,444
I’d have been happy to.

149
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,948
I’m really glad. Want
some wine or something?

150
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,158
Anything. I must
have a drink.

151
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,702
You know what’s sad?

152
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,205
I thought everything was
going well, that things were...

153
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,083
You always pick
the wrong women.

154
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,502
-I picked you.
-We got divorced.

155
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,880
You were impossible to live with.

156
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,048
I was impossible? I love this!

157
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,094
You couldn’t decide whether to be
a psychoanalyst or a writer.

158
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,972
So I compromised. I became
a writer and a patient.

159
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,267
Wail find you someone.
We know a lot of people.

160
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,104
I’ve been trying since we got
divorced to find him someone.

161
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,648
Someone to match
his personality.

162
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,109
Honey, bring another glass!

163
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,155
I’m wondering if the world
female population isn’t too limited.

164
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,992
-You’ve had rotten luck.
-No, he hasn’t.

165
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,994
He makes rotten choices.

166
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:23,040
But does he want to spend his
golden years with someone?

167
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,209
Why my golden years?

168
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,169
You must think about those things.

169
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,215
Men age different to women. 2 more
years, lilt look like your son.

170
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,217
That was so mean!

171
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,594
Don’t you laugh.

172
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,222
-That’s not funny.
-She’s got me in a home already.

173
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,058
Look, what about
Madeline, after me?

174
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,770
She was an archaeologist.
She was fabulous.

175
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,605
She was a nymphomaniac.

176
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,233
Okay, she had a
problem with fidelity.

177
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn’t happen to see it.
But she was brilliant.

178
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,655
What about Carol? What
was her last name?

179
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,032
Carol was a poet and
a member of Mensa.

180
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,742
She was a heroin addict.

181
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,161
Yes, but I thought
it was insulin!

182
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,330
You know what
the problem is? Listen.

183
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,123
This is the problem!

184
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,210
He’s still in love with you.
I always said this.

185
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,754
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.

186
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,465
-That’s the problem.
-Come here, my two men.

187
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,759
I’m pining after Giselle.

188
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,719
Wail find someone.

189
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,680
I don’t know if we will.

190
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,266
-We will. I know.
-This is the problem.

191
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,190
What’s all the secrecy?
Why Harry Winston’s?

192
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,278
I want you to help me pick
an engagement ring for Skylar.

193
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,821
Congratulations.

194
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,283
You want an
engagement ring.

195
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,786
Right, we’re getting married.
Or I am, not to her.

196
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,206
I see. What size did
you have in mind?

197
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,666
What size?

198
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,212
Well, I know she’s not huge.

199
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,089
She’s not bony, either.

200
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,009
-Something simple but elegant?
-That’s it.

201
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,053
Simple but elegant. Exactly.
I told you he was the guy.

202
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,513
Like this one.

203
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,265
God, that’s beautiful.

204
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,391
It’s perfect.

205
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,312
It’s the most beautiful
ring I ever saw.

206
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,564
What would that cost? I like it.

207
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,940
$55,000.

208
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,901
$55,000, you said?

209
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,114
Let me take it off then,
because I don’t think...

210
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,825
Actually, as I look at it...

211
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,286
it’s not to Skylar’s taste.
It’s tacky.

212
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,538
She’s not a Mafia bride.
Help me.

213
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,248
Here’s a lovely one.

214
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,500
That is pretty.

215
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,088
What’ll it cost me?
$1 ,500? $2,000?

216
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,757
$8,000.

217
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,303
It’s more in the ballpark, in
the right neighbourhood.

218
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,640
-Not my neighbourhood, but...
-It’s a better neighbourhood.

219
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,185
What the hell, right?
We’re getting married.

220
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,436
Let’s do it.

221
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,940
I think it’s an absolutely
exquisite ring.

222
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,733
My baby don’t
care for rings...

223
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,653
or other expensive
things.

224
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,281
My baby just cares for me.

225
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,869
My baby don’t go for...

226
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,913
big Rolls-Royces.

227
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,501
There’s sometimes a doubt
about her choices.

228
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,548
My baby don’t care to own...

229
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,050
some 14-carat stone.

230
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,554
She’s sensible as can be.

231
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,726
My baby don’t
care who knows it.

232
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,940
My baby just cares for me.

233
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,071
He’s so happy since the day...

234
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,949
he fell in love in a real big way.

235
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,369
And the big surprise is
someone loves him too.

236
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,999
It’s difficult for us to see...

237
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,252
just what she could
possibly see in he.

238
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,630
But it simply goes to
prove what love can do.

239
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,970
His baby don’t
care for shows.

240
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,848
His baby don’t
care for clothes.

241
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,059
My baby just cares for me!

242
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,729
Nobody else will do!

243
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,608
His baby don’t care
for furs and laces.

244
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,696
His baby don’t care for races...

245
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,657
or high-toned places.

246
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,203
-My baby’s not much for sports...
-Gets out of sorts.

247
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,830
Like running round tennis courts.

248
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,083
I must say I’m glad that she...

249
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,961
He’s glad to say that she...

250
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,172
has made such a fine selection.

251
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,595
My baby just cares for me!

252
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,101
My baby just cares for me!

253
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,645
His baby just cares for...

254
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,690
My baby just cares for me!

255
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,614
Mrs Holden Spence.

256
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,491
Skylar Spence. I love it.

257
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,035
He’s taking her
to Le Cirque tonight.

258
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,621
-No kidding?
-I think he’s going to propose.

259
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,999
And I introduced them.

260
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,792
We’ve heard it, Dad.

261
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,587
I did. He came to work
at our law firm.

262
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,172
The first day I said:

263
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,050
‘This kid’s great. His feet are on
the ground. He’s perfect for her.’

264
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,011
Frieda, the pasta
has no sauce.

265
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,471
Bavarian pasta
doesn’t need sauce.

266
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,474
Italian pasta needs sauce.
The italians were weak.

267
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,351
Fine. Give me some pepper.

268
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:21,231
Your solution to rampant crime
is just to let criminals go free?

269
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,067
No. Charles Ferry
deserves a parole.

270
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,696
You want someone like
this out on the streets?

271
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,325
Armed robbery, assault,
attempted escape.

272
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,994
-He was an abused child.
-Have some compassion.

273
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,498
He went to prison for life because
of his horrible childhood.

274
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,625
Something you know nothing about.

275
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,627
-Then one mistake...
-Are you kidding?

276
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,337
A bad trial,
corrupt judges...

277
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,297
Calm down, both of you.

278
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,842
-I don’t want to discuss this.
-I can’t listen to this.

279
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,802
-I need my wallet.
-Where’re you going?

280
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,722
The Polo Grounds.
Giants and Cardinals are playing.

281
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,809
You can’t go out. If you want to
take a walk, go with Frieda.

282
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,395
But they’re playing
today, Labour Day.

283
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,772
It’s June, Grandpa.

284
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,691
The Polo Grounds
closed years ago.

285
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,361
-Rained out?
-Take him for a short walk.

286
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,363
No, I’m not going with Frieda.

287
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,075
No, no, not with her. I don’t
need a German Shepherd.

288
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,618
Take a nice walk.

289
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,495
You know what the kids say?

290
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,499
They think Holden’s giving a
surprise to Skylar tonight.

291
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,710
If you keep gossiping about
it, it won’t be a surprise.

292
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,254
I told you not to tell.

293
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,424
I’m going out. If Minnie calls,
tell her I’m at the Polo Grounds.

294
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,677
Minnie’s been dead 20 years.

295
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,347
I’m not arguing that. But if
she calls, i’ll be home later.

296
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,100
21 is too young to get married.

297
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,186
If this was anyone but
Holden, i’d be against it.

298
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,814
No way I’m getting
married till I’m 35.

299
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,233
Then I’ll probably
live with a woman.

300
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,734
Why do you make these jokes?

301
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,361
You like Holden, right?

302
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,282
The problem is Skylar.
She’s a romantic twit.

303
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,617
Holden’s not romantic
enough for her.

304
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,287
So what? She’s going
to marry him, right?

305
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,831
I hope so. I want her
room when she does.

306
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,833
She should leap at this guy.

307
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,669
Skylar suffers from
white knight syndrome.

308
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,089
Since her hormones kicked in,
she’s hoped for some...

309
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,425
charismatic guy to
sweep her off her feet.

310
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,887
So Holden is that young
Lochinvar, all right?

311
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,263
He’s a young schnook.

312
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,266
He’s a schnook, but
he’s a loveable schnook.

313
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,436
What an endorsement! I’m
never bringing a guy home.

314
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,856
In the first place,
he’s not a schnook.

315
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,705
I’m a dreamer...

316
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,876
aren’t we all?

317
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,255
Just a dreamer...

318
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,009
aren’t we all?

319
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,223
In my dreams, each
night it seems...

320
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,271
my sweetheart comes to call.

321
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,114
He’s so charming,
strong and tall.

322
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,331
It’s alarming
howl fall.

323
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,004
He’s ideal.

324
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,342
But then he isn’t
real and I’m a fool.

325
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,183
But aren’t we all?

326
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,655
Can I tell you
how I see us?

327
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:57,656
How?

328
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,493
We get married and we live
by my parents in Sharon.

329
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,704
I could never
leave New York.

330
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,249
We leave my parents in Sharon,
right? We live in New York.

331
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,919
It’s just that we may want
more space if we have 4 kids.

332
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,588
I want two children.

333
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,215
Two is perfect.

334
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,176
Two is perfect for me...

335
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:18,886
because four is...

336
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,345
really a lot and...

337
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,514
you’ll stay at home...

338
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,141
No, I’ll be working.

339
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,687
When not working full-time.
You’ll have a career. Journalism.

340
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,355
Architecture.

341
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,567
Architecture? Since when?

342
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,361
I don’t know, just
some thoughts I’ve had.

343
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,072
I mean, you majored
in journalism, but...

344
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,825
The important thing is...

345
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,287
that we agree on just about
everything, it seems.

346
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,456
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?

347
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,043
It’s time for
dessert? Yes, it is.

348
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,087
Excuse me a second. I’ll
just tend to a small matter.

349
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,132
It’s ready, just as you wished.

350
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,550
Think it’ll work?

351
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,053
That’s perfect, Umberto.

352
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,262
Glad you like it, sir.

353
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,765
Let me show you
my end of the deal.

354
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,600
That’s a honey, huh?

355
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,269
Set me back a bit,
I don’t mind saying.

356
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,689
I’m sure. A brilliant
idea. Very romantic.

357
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,900
That’s the kind of guy I am.

358
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,235
I can see that.

359
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,154
Here we go. I’m just going
to lay that right there.

360
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,740
Will that knock her socks off?

361
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:22,491
Shall we?

362
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,493
Go ahead. I’m relying on you.

363
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,619
Good luck.

364
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,623
Everything okay?

365
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,707
No problem.

366
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,543
-Shall we order dessert?
-I did.

367
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,293
You did?

368
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,630
You like take-charge guys, and
I’m coming through for you.

369
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,423
It’s not like you.

370
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:42,344
Anything for you. Umberto,
will you do the honours?

371
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,930
My God, it’s delicious!

372
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,307
Peach, my
favourite flavour.

373
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,228
-It’s delicious.
-What are you doing? Stop!

374
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,146
-Where’s the rest of it?
-What?

375
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,107
The cream and the cherry!

376
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,192
-I ate them.
-You ate the ring?

377
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:57,943
What?

378
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,195
-I bought you a diamond ring.
-You did?

379
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,530
At Harry Winston’s.

380
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,739
Where is it?

381
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,032
It was on the dessert.

382
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:04,950
Why?

383
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,704
-I thought it’d be romantic!
-To put a ring on ice cream?

384
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,832
It wasn’t my idea,
it was DJ’s.

385
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,793
She said it would give
it dramatic flair.

386
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,295
I ate a diamond ring?

387
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,007
I turn round for 2 seconds and
$8,000 goes down your throat.

388
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,925
Oh, my God!

389
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,135
Stay calm.

390
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,511
How big was it?

391
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,929
It was a big rock.

392
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,016
-I swallowed what, a carat?
-A karat-and-a-half.

393
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,225
You’d like two carrots?

394
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,351
I’m dying!

395
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,186
You’re not.

396
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,270
Something wrong, sir?

397
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,356
Just swallowed a little
jewelry, it’s all right.

398
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,649
-How could you?
-Enjoy your dinner.

399
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,196
How could l? Most people look at
their food before plunging into it.

400
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,864
Let me check your mouth.

401
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,618
This isn’t much of a problem.

402
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,204
It’s in an accessible place.

403
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,664
It’s an absolutely
beautiful ring.

404
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,666
A brilliant choice.

405
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,793
Congratulations, girl.

406
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,754
It is beautiful.

407
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,048
Look, she got engaged.

408
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,175
What is it, two karats?

409
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,009
One-and-a-half.

410
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,135
White gold?

411
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,303
Solid platinum.

412
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,387
That’s good.

413
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,889
-Harry Winston’s.
-How much?

414
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,224
8,000.

415
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,810
I can get the same ring for you
for 6 from my brother-in-law.

416
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,604
You’re paying for the name.

417
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,689
He’s a wonderful man.

418
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,858
Am I going to scar?

419
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,529
Doctors look at X-rays
but they seldom grin.

420
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,490
I’m always on the
outside...

421
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,200
looking in.

422
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,119
Maybe that’s why
I see the funny side...

423
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,415
When I see a fallen
brother take a bride.

424
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,294
Weddings make a
lot of people sad.

425
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,840
But if you're not the groom...

426
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,509
you’re not so bad.

427
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,806
Another bride,
anothergroom...

428
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,809
another sunny honeymoon.

429
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,479
Another season...

430
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,273
another reason...

431
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,567
for making whoopee.

432
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,445
A lot of shoes...

433
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,406
a lot of rice...

434
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,158
the groom is nervous...

435
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,326
he answers twice.

436
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,203
It’s really killing...

437
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,913
that’s he’s so willing...

438
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,207
to make whoopee.

439
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,129
Picture a little
love nest...

440
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,300
down where the roses cling...

441
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,137
picture the same
sweet love nest...

442
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,891
think what a year can bring.

443
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,643
He’s washing dishes...

444
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,228
and baby clothes...

445
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,439
he’s so ambitious...

446
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,649
he even sews.

447
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,693
But don’t forget folks...

448
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,737
that’s what you get, folks...

449
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,405
for making whoopee.

450
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,491
Just for making whoopee.

451
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:35,953
He’s washing dishes...

452
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,830
and baby clothes...

453
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,957
he’s so ambitious...

454
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,875
he even sews.

455
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,794
But don’t forget folks...

456
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,173
that’s what you get, folks...

457
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,568
Summer came, and Lane and
Laura got jobs at the Met...

458
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,820
and spent weekends
at the beach.

459
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,449
Mom organised a petition for
Charles Ferry’s parole.

460
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,410
Her new pet cause.

461
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,205
She even visited the prison and
was appalled by the conditions.

462
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,125
What we need are open prisons.

463
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,171
Space where the damaged
human spirit can heal.

464
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:32,426
Give them an opportunity to
decorate their own cells...

465
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,220
with their own
personal decorators.

466
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,306
And better cuisine.

467
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,099
European menus.

468
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,187
As for me, over the years I was
used to splitting summers up...

469
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,607
July with Mom in New York,
and August with Dad in Europe.

470
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,985
Usually it was Paris, but this
time he took me to Venice.

471
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,906
I think he wanted to get over
memories of losing Giselle.

472
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,659
All I can say is if we’re
talking about romantic cities...

473
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,496
they’ve got the most
gorgeous guys there...

474
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,624
and they can’t keep their
hands off you. It’s great.

475
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,711
The first week was just heaven
for me. Having a ball...

476
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,546
sailing on gondolas.

477
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,382
But Dad just seemed to
hang around the hotel.

478
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,219
Giselle was still
haunting him.

479
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,429
I’m through with love.

480
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,933
I’ll never fall again.

481
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,269
Said ‘adieu’ to love.

482
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,856
Don’t ever call again.

483
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,943
For I must have you or no-one.

484
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,951
And so I’m through with love.

485
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,790
I’ve locked my heart...

486
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,210
I’ll keep my
feelings there.

487
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,172
I’ve stocked my heart...

488
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,008
with icy frigid air.

489
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:59,054
And I mean to
fall for no-one...

490
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,645
because I’m through with love.

491
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,734
I feel so guilty.

492
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:14,862
-You should have fun.
-I am.

493
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,781
I still can’t figure out what
went wrong with Giselle.

494
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,576
I always thought she
was a little flighty.

495
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,245
Want a drink?
I’ll have a beer.

496
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,538
A Bellini.

497
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,332
Let me give you this advice.

498
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:31,378
When a relationship breaks
up, and I hope they don’t...

499
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,300
Better to be the leaver than the
leavee, ‘cause the leaver leaves.

500
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,302
But the leavee is left.

501
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,428
It’s terrible.

502
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,390
The worst that happens to the
leaver is a little survivor guilt.

503
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,102
Survivor guilt is the worst thing
that should ever happen to you.

504
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,396
Tomorrow i'll spend with you.

505
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,648
It’s not necessary, really.

506
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:54,276
Don’t turn round. That couple!

507
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,653
-Don’t turn round.
-Who?

508
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,615
I told you about her. I saw
her check in the other day.

509
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,618
She’s lovely, but I
think she’s married.

510
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:03,619
Isn’t she?

511
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,162
Oh, my God!

512
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:06,330
Beautiful, right?

513
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,956
I know who she is.

514
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,124
You’re kidding.

515
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,794
Why didn’t I think of it?
She’s perfect for you.

516
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,088
How can she be?
She’s married.

517
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,883
Not happily married.
You’d love her.

518
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,427
Who is she? How’d
you know her?

519
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,972
My friend’s mother’s her shrink.
I know everything about her.

520
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,433
-What’s her name?
-I don’t know.

521
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,684
What do you mean?

522
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,021
What’s wrong with you?
Stop teasing me.

523
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,858
She’s an art historian, and she’s
here to see the Tintorettos.

524
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,944
Know what I’m thinking?

525
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,196
You’ve got that
look on your face.

526
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,534
She jogs every morning.
You can bump into her.

527
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,328
No thanks. She’s married.

528
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,581
I’m telling you, not
happily married.

529
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,793
Complete mismatch.
The guy is some actor.

530
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:57,256
He won’t interfere tomorrow,
he sleeps late. No problem.

531
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:02,052
You can meet her. She’ll be
alone. I know it for a fact.

532
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,513
I’m out of shape.
I can’t jog.

533
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,766
I haven’t touched my
treadmill in weeks.

534
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,686
572 weeks, that’s 11 years.

535
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:13,355
Stop looking at me
like that. I won’t do it.

536
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:16,483
We’re going to get you some
jogging clothes. Tomorrow...

537
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,193
She is really something.

538
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,862
You’re going to jog.

539
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,119
Sorry, are you okay?

540
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,205
Yes, are you all right?

541
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,041
Do you know where
the Hotel Gritti is?

542
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,793
I think it’s that way.

543
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:21,340
Over there? Because I...
jogging in Venice is so...

544
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,966
Labyrinthine.

545
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:24,551
You okay?

546
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:28,931
Yes, I’m fine. You must keep
in shape. I jog every day. You?

547
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:29,890
I do.

548
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,475
You’re American?

549
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,269
It’s a great country.

550
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,481
The mountains and the prairies...

551
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,401
the oceans, you know, white
foam and everything...

552
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:43,946
Are you okay?

553
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,199
-Sit down.
-No, I’m okay.

554
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,830
Just a chest pain radiating
down my arm, but...

555
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,248
That’s your heart.

556
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,417
No, it’s stress. I get
it every other day.

557
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,711
What’s your name?

558
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,171
Here you are.

559
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,675
I was giving him directions.
You okay?

560
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,135
You wanted to do 3 miles.

561
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,303
You okay?

562
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,681
-Yes, I’m fine.
-Just breathe. Breathe.

563
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,021
I nearly died. Couldn’t breathe.
Then her husband showed up.

564
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,482
Her husband came?
That’s rare.

565
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,193
So is coronary thrombosis
in our family.

566
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,070
Did you get her name?

567
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,322
Von. Vonnie.

568
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,910
She’s passionate about Tintoretto.
She’s writing a book about him.

569
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:35,122
She’s obviously here to visit the
Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

570
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,250
I don’t know what this means.
Why all these art books?

571
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:42,129
She’ll be at the Scuola. He won’t.
They have nothing in common.

572
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,465
You bump into her. The groundwork’s
been laid. You say...

573
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,259
‘Didn’t we
meet jogging?’

574
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:50,012
‘The guy with the stroke.’
She’ll remember.

575
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,390
Then you impress her with your
knowledge of her favourite painter.

576
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:54,641
You’re kidding.

577
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,937
My art knowledge is limited
to Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh.

578
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,064
What do I know about this?

579
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,360
Trust me. Before we leave Venice,
your lips will be pressed to hers.

580
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,032
Unfortunately I left my
Chapstick in New York.

581
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,368
What is this?

582
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,538
‘The rapidity of
his brush strokes...’

583
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,248
‘Chiaroscuro.’

584
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,209
‘Outbursts of colour.’

585
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,920
I told Dad everything
I knew about Von.

586
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,755
He studied his Tintoretto book.

587
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,675
I told him her likes, her
dislikes, her deepest feelings...

588
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,221
everything from her passion for
Bora-Bora and Mahler’s 4th...

589
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,890
to her favourite flower,
the African Daisy.

590
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,517
I mean, everything.

591
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,144
When he went to the
museum that day...

592
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,772
he could’ve given a
course on the subject.

593
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:43,982
Hello again.

594
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:46,693
Goodness!

595
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,196
You lived. How are you?
I was concerned.

596
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,699
No, no, I was fine.
I went back to the hotel and...

597
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:57,204
had the concierge oil my
pacemaker and, you know, l...

598
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,748
Incidentally, my
name’s Joe Berlin.

599
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:00,624
Vonnie Sydell.

600
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,503
A funny coincidence. I see
you here, two New Yorkers...

601
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,798
jogging in Venice and we
bump into each other.

602
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,466
How’d you know
I was a New Yorker?

603
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,803
No, I didn’t.
I just assumed...

604
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,348
But you’re completely correct
to ask that question.

605
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:19,685
It’s a good question. You
shouldn’t be ashamed of it.

606
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,479
I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?

607
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:26,650
In Paris. I was a New Yorker
but I settled in Paris.

608
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,195
But I come back to New York
all the time. I love it there.

609
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,406
What brings you here?

610
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,994
I wouldn’t come to Venice
without checking out the Tintorettos.

611
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,372
Because he’s my favourite
master in the world.

612
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,208
I just adore his work.
I’m crazy about it.

613
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,043
He was a deep genius.

614
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,920
The deepest.

615
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,090
The rapidity of
his brush strokes...

616
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,842
Chiaroscuro...

617
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,635
Outbursts of colour...

618
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,388
His capacity for
controlled gesture...

619
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,517
Born in 1519, only to
die again in 1594...

620
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,771
but that’s the way it
happens to most of us.

621
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,566
You have a real appreciation
of his work.

622
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:12,154
How could I not appreciate a
man who was short in stature...

623
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,407
but with a proud
and obstinate nature...

624
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,409
who painted outside the...

625
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:21,413
the academic conventions
of 16th century Venice?

626
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:23,999
What do you do?

627
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,459
Call me Joe.

628
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,670
I’m a writer.
A novelist, mostly.

629
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:29,922
Joe Berlin...

630
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:31,632
I saw one of your books.

631
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,093
I remember it had
a very sexy cover.

632
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,847
It was at the stalls
on 5th Avenue, the 99 cent bin.

633
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:42,142
You know, probably the
get-acquainted price.

634
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,393
They’ll do that.

635
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,396
In the United States I’m
considered controversial...

636
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:50,108
but in Paris, where they
have an ear for literature...

637
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,903
they were quick to
recognise the genius of...

638
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:55,489
Poe and Faulkner
and myself.

639
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,910
Basically, you see,
I’m a simple guy.

640
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,996
My idea is just to live
in Paris and maybe...

641
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,749
you know, fall in love and...

642
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,168
take walks...

643
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,462
in the rain and...

644
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:12,506
Listen to music like...

645
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:15,425
particularly maybe
Mahler’s 4th.

646
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,887
This could be me talking.

647
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:19,972
Could it?

648
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,641
Mahler’s 4th, no question.

649
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,768
See, I’m not a...

650
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,563
what you’d call
a technology guy.

651
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:28,480
I hate it.

652
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,148
I know, I can tell.

653
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,442
I still work on...

654
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:36,280
one of those old-fashioned
portable typewriters...

655
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:40,450
So you haven’t succumbed
to the computer age?

656
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:44,955
I like the simple life. I like to
sit at home in Paris and write...

657
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,001
maybe visit New York a
certain amount, and in summer...

658
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,961
maybe spend some time...

659
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,547
someplace romantic,
like...

660
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,132
Bora-Bora.

661
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:59,970
I love Bora-Bora. Since I first
went, I still think about it.

662
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,681
Naturally, it’s beautiful.

663
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,602
At night, the stars are so luminous
you can practically read by them.

664
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,812
Read by them, yes.

665
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,689
Are you okay?

666
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:12,733
You got a...a little...

667
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,235
mist appeared
in your eye then.

668
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,071
I thought you were
going to cry, I swear.

669
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,699
No, I’m okay.

670
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,243
Is something wrong?

671
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,287
What’s wrong?

672
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,540
Nothing’s wrong. Something’s
exactly so right.

673
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,668
Wait here. I’ll
be right back.

674
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,386
All my life...

675
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,768
I’ve been waiting for you.

676
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,649
My wonderful one.

677
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,069
I’ve begun living.

678
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,826
All my life...

679
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,458
All my love...

680
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,965
has been waiting for you.

681
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,762
My life is sublime...

682
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,766
now that I’m giving...

683
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,690
All my love...

684
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,069
I got you a present.

685
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:42,489
An African Daisy.
My favourite.

686
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,033
What are you
doing tonight?

687
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,120
I think Greg
and I have plans.

688
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:51,290
How’d it go?

689
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:54,918
She was great. Whatever you
told me was right on the money.

690
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,336
I feel guilty.

691
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:57,379
Why?

692
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,675
Because I made her cry. She
said she felt close to me.

693
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:05,846
So? You’ve established a beachhead.
Now win the battle.

694
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:09,975
Remember to blow between
her shoulder blades. She goes crazy.

695
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,688
I won’t do it. What’s between her
and her shrink is private.

696
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,025
Are you going to give me a
map of her erogenous zones?

697
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,985
Are you seeing her tonight?

698
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,820
No. She’s married.

699
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:25,866
Listen, I don’t know Bora-
Bora from Walla-walla.

700
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,160
What do I know about Tintoretto?

701
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:32,039
I can’t tell the difference between
chiaroscuro and spaghetti sauce.

702
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,625
Remember to blow
between her shoulder blades.

703
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:39,213
I won’t do it. Plus, I use a word
processor, not a typewriter.

704
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,634
I hope you have something great
to wear. There’s a party tonight.

705
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,260
Party?

706
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,888
I want to introduce you to someone.

707
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:51,892
Dad...

708
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,978
this is Alberto.

709
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:56,647
Nice to meet you.

710
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,233
Hello. Who are all
these people?

711
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,444
Venetians. Friends,
guests in town.

712
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,322
Enjoying your
stay in Venice?

713
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,699
It’s the best.
She’ll tell you.

714
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,453
Dad, you should be
the first to know.

715
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,330
We’re getting married.

716
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,667
Wonderful. Tell me what
century and i’ll rent a tux.

717
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,418
This January.

718
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,211
Pardon me?

719
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:20,838
This January.

720
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,798
You’re joking.

721
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,467
I’m in love with Djuna.

722
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,429
We all love her, because
she’s adorable, but you are...

723
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:30,764
This is a jest.

724
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,809
January 15th, to be exact.

725
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,435
It’s his
mother’s birthday.

726
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,354
A joke, am I right?

727
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,564
Not at all.

728
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,275
Excuse me a second.

729
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,570
Come. I want to
talk a minute.

730
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,780
What are you talking about?

731
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:47,990
Sorry.

732
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,368
Tell me it’s a joke, or
there’ll be carnage.

733
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:53,203
We’re crazy about each other.

734
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,374
How can you be...? You
met this guy 5 days ago.

735
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,500
So?

736
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,127
Are you having a breakdown?

737
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,920
Why, because I’m in love?

738
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,631
What do you mean, in love?
What does he do?

739
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,425
He’s a gondolier.

740
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,386
One of the guys with
a striped shirt and a hat?

741
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:10,762
No hat.

742
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,265
-What do you mean?
-He doesn’t wear a hat.

743
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,643
This is crazy! What
are you gonna...

744
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,605
Talk to me. You’re talking
about getting married?

745
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,939
That’s insanity!

746
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,773
Why?

747
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,943
‘Cause you’re going
to school, to Columbia.

748
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,113
You’re going to major in journalism
or law, not rowing.

749
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,700
People have dropped out
of Columbia before.

750
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,245
You’re not going to run off
with a guy you just met...

751
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,289
and who’s a gondolier.

752
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:38,874
He’s a poet.

753
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,250
A poet?

754
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,587
Know what rhymes with
gondolier? No Lira. Okay?

755
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,005
So forget it.

756
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,475
Hello again. God, what
a coincidence.

757
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,352
This is Joe, Greg.

758
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,645
How are you?

759
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,316
-The one with the heart attack?
-That was me.

760
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,151
Is Bernardo Bertolucci here?

761
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,737
-I wouldn’t recognise him.
-I have to meet him.

762
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,656
Mind if I go on?

763
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:13,784
-It’s a madhouse.
-I’Il get you a drink.

764
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:16,245
-Incredible.
-Is it?

765
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,831
Have you seen this place?

766
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,624
It’s unbelievable.

767
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:25,170
The whole thing is
like an old palazzo.

768
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,299
And it’s really beautiful.
But it’s frantic in there.

769
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,134
You look great.

770
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,054
Don’t say that.

771
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:35,305
Why?

772
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,474
I can’t take a compliment.

773
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,602
You’re terrific. Why
not? I’m sorry.

774
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,187
No, it’s my problem.

775
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,731
Why? Does it make
you feel guilty?

776
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,819
Maybe. I don’t know.
You’ve got all the answers.

777
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,363
I think it makes
you feel guilty.

778
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:53,615
You must have fantasies of...

779
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:56,785
maybe someone
coming along that...

780
00:42:57,077 --> 00:43:00,497
You probably have
dreams about boats...

781
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,333
or ships maybe, or even...

782
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,836
an elevator that...

783
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,756
You’re on an elevator that goes
higher and higher to the top floor.

784
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:13,010
And then it doesn’t
stop, it just goes...

785
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,179
through the roof and...

786
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,890
it sort of flies
you over the ocean...

787
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,268
I think I’m going to faint.

788
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:22,728
I do.

789
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,105
Are you okay?

790
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:29,485
I’m a little overwhelmed and...

791
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:31,820
I’m glad you’re
leaving tomorrow.

792
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:56,512
Next morning,
we left Venice.

793
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,515
Dad flew to Paris,
I went to New York.

794
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,559
I couldn’t wait to tell Mom
about marrying Alberto.

795
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:05,145
He was so beautiful,
so sensitive.

796
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:09,441
My plan was to leave Columbia
and go to Italy after the fall.

797
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,362
Excuse me, that’s mine.

798
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,031
I’m sorry.

799
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,325
I’m sorry. It’s not mine.

800
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,993
We both shop at
‘Hunting World.’

801
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,537
That’s where I got it.

802
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,163
Now I know it’s mine.

803
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:24,957
I’ll give you a hand.

804
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,251
Bra, underwear.

805
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,461
Petrarch's sonnets.

806
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,672
What do you do?

807
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,715
Depends on the guy.

808
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,009
No, just kidding.

809
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,096
I work for the Columbian
drug cartel.

810
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,390
I gift-wrap
the cocaine.

811
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,018
Why am I so nervous?
I study at Columbia.

812
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:47,312
Is that right? My uncle
teaches there.

813
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,774
Math department.
I’m Ken Grisley.

814
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,442
Djuna Berlin.

815
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:57,781
Do I want to spend my life
making pasta and riding in gondolas?

816
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:01,702
The truth is, those canals
are awfully polluted.

817
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,455
Alberto was cute,
but Ken was...

818
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,790
hot.

819
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:09,418
Cuddle up...

820
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,962
a little closer.

821
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,298
Lovely mine.

822
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,135
Cuddle up...

823
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,972
and be my little
clinging vine.

824
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:28,520
Like to feel your
cheeks so rosy.

825
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:32,858
Like to make
you comfy-cosy.

826
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:37,279
‘Cause I love you
from head to toesy.

827
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:40,449
Lovely mine.

828
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,703
While i'd been away,
an awful lot had happened.

829
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:29,915
Mom bought Skylar a
drop-dead wedding dress.

830
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,709
Holden’s father and
my father made friends.

831
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:35,587
They discovered a common
interest - horse racing.

832
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:38,298
So they chipped in and
bought a thoroughbred.

833
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:41,343
And Lane and Laura had a
great summer at the beach.

834
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:45,097
But one hot weekend, with
everyone else out of New York...

835
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,516
they found
themselves in town.

836
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,996
We’re probably the
only ones in the city.

837
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:12,875
We usually go to Southampton,
but we have tickets to a show.

838
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,961
I love the city
when it’s empty.

839
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,046
Me too.

840
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:19,256
Me too.

841
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:23,927
To make a long story short,
they’ve all become close.

842
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:27,598
His name, if you can believe
it, is Jeffrey Vandermost.

843
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,892
He’s heir to the
Vandermost millions.

844
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,812
They both love him and one of
them'll have a broken heart.

845
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,901
Fall was especially
beautiful this year.

846
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:41,278
I like it better
than spring.

847
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:44,448
And with October
comes Mom’s birthday.

848
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:48,035
This year we invited Holden’s
parents to celebrate.

849
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:52,039
But just before they arrived
we had an unexpected visitor.

850
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,167
Happy birthday!

851
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:58,086
These are from my biological
father, all the way from Paris.

852
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,006
-Look, everybody!
-Know what it is? Caviar!

853
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,926
Could you put
this on ice, Frieda?

854
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,386
-Are you expecting a Mr Ferry?
-I am, yes.

855
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:07,513
You are?

856
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:10,516
He just got out of prison.
He has no family...

857
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,684
but we can be his friends.

858
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,937
You’re letting a
criminal in our house?

859
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:17,314
He’s paid his
debt to society.

860
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,650
-He has not paid...
-Don’t start.

861
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,778
Society forgave him his debt,
he didn’t pay his debt to society.

862
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:26,573
How’d I get a kid on the other end
of the political scale? I failed.

863
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:28,408
You didn’t fail.

864
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:31,078
If I was you, i’d
hide the silverware.

865
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:34,164
Don’t be rude. He’s
coming for just a drink.

866
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,416
You guys have everything.

867
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:40,128
Mr Ferry, hi. I’m Bob Dandridge.
This is my wife, Steffi.

868
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:43,423
Hello, Mr Ferry. Welcome
to our home.

869
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:46,385
I’d like you to meet
my daughter, Skylar.

870
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,096
This is Skylar,
and her fiancé, Holden.

871
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,974
-I’m the fiancé.
-Can I get you something?

872
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,600
Nobody gets behind me.

873
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:57,187
Right, sure. Can I
get you a drink?

874
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,188
Vodka.

875
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:01,066
Right, well, maybe
on the...? Or just...?

876
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:04,486
Straight up.

877
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,032
Honey, Mr Perr...Ferry. Sorry,
he’s lived among vicious killers.

878
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,535
-You said it.
-No wonder he’s skittish.

879
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:14,454
A lot of times a guy'll come
up behind you and swish.

880
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:17,833
You must get your blade out
quick. Stick him or you’re dead.

881
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:22,004
God! Have you stuck a
lot of inmates, Mr Ferry?

882
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:23,380
Enough.

883
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,506
The doorbell.

884
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:27,467
Excuse me, I need to
get in front of you here.

885
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,094
Would you like another?

886
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,972
Hi. Hello.
How are you?

887
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,932
Happy birthday, Steffi.

888
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,353
Thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.

889
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,273
I have someone I want
you to meet, Mr Ferry.

890
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,526
This is my good friend, Lynn.

891
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,737
And Arnold. This is my friend.

892
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,615
Mr Ferry is
just out of prison.

893
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,743
Parole came through, but
i’d have got out anyway.

894
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,120
-Really?
-What do you mean?

895
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,248
Ice the guard.
No pictures, sister.

896
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,209
What do you mean?

897
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:02,544
Ice him, and get out
through the air shaft.

898
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,757
Get behind him with a box
cutter, rip out his carotid artery.

899
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,384
May I have a glass
of white wine?

900
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:11,136
We have some inside.

901
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,222
You must be careful though.

902
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,517
Guy on Cell Block 4 tried it and
didn’t have the angles figured.

903
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,393
Got his tit caught in the wringer.

904
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,939
-Take him on the terrace.
-I need to sit down.

905
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,691
Yes, the terrace. Big,
wide-open spaces.

906
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,319
You sure this guy
is rehabilitated?

907
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,155
He was in prison,
not a finishing school.

908
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:33,742
You know my sentiments,
but very happy birthday.

909
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,578
A birthday song
for Steffi.

910
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:42,793
Looking at you while
troubles are fleeing...

911
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,629
I’m admiring the view...

912
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,006
‘Cause it’s you that I’m seeing.

913
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:52,094
And the sweet honeydew
of well-being...

914
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:54,179
settles on me.

915
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,895
What is this light that
shines when you enter...

916
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,148
Iike a star
in the night?

917
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:09,027
And what’s to prevent her
from destroying my sight...

918
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,656
if you centre it all on me?

919
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:20,914
Looking at you, I’m
filled with the essence of...

920
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,209
the quintessence of joy.

921
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:29,506
Looking at you, I
hear poets tellin' of...

922
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,177
Lovely Helen of Troy.

923
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,555
Darling, life
seemed so grey...

924
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,934
I’ve wanted to end it.

925
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,187
Till that marvellous day...

926
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,023
you started to mend it.

927
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,066
And if you'll only stay...

928
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,612
then i’ll spend it with you.

929
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:00,954
Sweetie.

930
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:07,669
I’m gonna get some drinks.
Want anything?

931
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:12,216
No thanks, but can you get
Steffi's present from the car?

932
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:13,800
Here.

933
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,555
Enjoying the view?

934
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:22,267
I like any view after years
in that stinking rat hole.

935
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:25,938
Very vividly put.
Sweetly honest.

936
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,607
You know what solitary’s like?

937
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:31,151
No, I can’t say I do.

938
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,695
I went to NYU. I
didn’t live in the dorm.

939
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,281
Been a long time
since I smelled perfume.

940
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,408
Do I have too much on?

941
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:41,245
You smell like what I think
heaven would smell like.

942
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:44,373
Well, thank you. Very nice.

943
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,625
When you shook my hand...

944
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,585
I thought my heart would stop.

945
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:50,587
Oh, that’s sweet.

946
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:54,007
But remember, you’ve been
deprived of female contact.

947
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:57,636
I used to lie in my cell and
dream of someone like you.

948
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:03,642
I took a Criminology course
at college. Very insightful.

949
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,103
You got very sensual lips.

950
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:09,314
It’s a part of me
I rarely think of.

951
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:10,482
Can I smell your hair?

952
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,485
Smell my hair? Okay.

953
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:17,489
You know what? it'll be gone soon.
I’m thinking of cutting it.

954
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,283
Holden might like that.

955
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,201
If you were my girl...

956
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,996
It’s a little chilly outside.

957
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,625
I’d make love to you
in every room in the house.

958
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,211
On every bed.

959
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:33,797
On every rug.

960
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,258
On every tabletop.

961
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,888
We also have some lovely
Early-American chandeliers.

962
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,308
Let’s go
for a drive.

963
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:49,813
I don’t think it’s
such a good idea.

964
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:53,317
I haven’t seen the ocean or been
to Harlem or Chinatown in years.

965
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,861
No, it’s out of the question.

966
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:58,238
Okay, but you can’t
blame me for trying.

967
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:01,074
No, I think we should
go inside before...

968
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:02,409
Before what?

969
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,662
Before you break
your parole.

970
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:10,334
If I took you in my arms and kissed
you, would you dime on me?

971
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,377
Dime?

972
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:13,754
Turn me in.

973
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,006
Let’s not find out.

974
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:29,311
How was it?

975
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,818
Very interesting.

976
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,404
I’ve never been kissed
by a sociopath before.

977
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:45,035
I kissed you the best I could. The
only practice I had in 10 years...

978
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,038
is with Vincent ‘The
Thumb’ Adatto.

979
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,679
Vincent ‘The Thumb’ doesn’t
know what he’s missing.

980
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,849
Can I see you again?

981
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:13,188
You know I’m getting married.

982
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,653
I could show the
world how to smile.

983
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,114
I could be glad...

984
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:24,992
all of the while.

985
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:29,997
I could change the
grey skies to blue.

986
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:32,416
If i had you.

987
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:40,257
I could leave the
old days behind...

988
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,468
Leave all my pals,
i’d never mind.

989
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,017
I could start
my life all anew.

990
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,187
If i had you..

991
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,028
I could climb the
snow-capped mountains...

992
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,282
sail the mighty ocean wide.

993
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:09,995
I could cross the
burning desert.

994
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,167
If i had you by my side.

995
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:20,839
I could be a king, uncrowned...

996
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,927
Humble, poor, rich, renowned.

997
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:31,350
There is nothing I couldn’t do.

998
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,520
If i had you.

999
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,537
He’s en route to New York
now, and he’s wonderful.

1000
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:53,580
It’s been like...

1001
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:57,292
a chance meeting after all these
years with a true soul mate.

1002
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:01,088
He senses my every need. Like
he knows what I’m thinking.

1003
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,173
It’s your fantasy come true.

1004
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:06,552
It is. I still
can’t believe it.

1005
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:09,304
You know, it’s not that he’s tall...

1006
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,849
or handsome, but he’s...

1007
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:13,809
He’s magical.

1008
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:18,522
And he feels me in a way no
man ever has done before.

1009
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,234
He’s romantic and sexy and...

1010
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,194
I had this dream...

1011
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,989
that I was in bed with him...

1012
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,825
and he was kissing my earlobes...

1013
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:32,870
and then he started stroking
my shoulder blades.

1014
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,955
And I nearly had an orgasm.

1015
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,167
I had a lot of neat
stuff to tell Dad.

1016
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,961
He’d really made a
big score with Von.

1017
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,714
But now i've got to
stop for a minute...

1018
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:47,384
because no matter how we humans
like to think we control things...

1019
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,261
that’s not how it works.

1020
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,513
Suddenly, with no warning...

1021
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,098
Grandpa died.

1022
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:56,727
It was in his sleep, peaceful,
with no suffering...

1023
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:59,271
but it made
philosophers of us all.

1024
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,274
When your number is up,
your number is up.

1025
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,568
That’s why it’s important that...

1026
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:08,489
we cherish each
moment of our lives.

1027
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,449
And not smoke.

1028
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:11,742
Smoke?

1029
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,705
Pop smoked for 70
years, you know?

1030
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:21,168
He never exercised. He ate
cholesterol and fatty foods.

1031
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,129
He died at a healthy,
ripe old age.

1032
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,798
I haven’t had steak
for so long. I love steak.

1033
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:28,008
That’s disgusting.

1034
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,302
I’d kill for some
marbleised meat.

1035
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,097
Now they say 6
cups of coffee a day...

1036
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,808
prevents colon
cancer.

1037
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,436
Last week it was
bad for you.

1038
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,147
What’s it all about?
I mean, what...?

1039
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,192
What are we doing?
We’re rushing!

1040
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,276
That’s right.

1041
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,237
Where are we going?

1042
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:49,738
Into the void.

1043
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,240
-The void.
-That’s it.

1044
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,575
-I never believed in God.
-Oh, come.

1045
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:56,995
No, I didn’t, even as a kid.
I remember I used to think...

1046
00:58:57,204 --> 00:59:00,833
‘Even if He exists, He’s
done such a terrible job...’

1047
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,837
‘it’s a wonder people don’t file
a class action suit against Him.’

1048
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:06,088
You shouldn’t say that.

1049
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,049
We’re not here just because
of the new physics.

1050
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:10,467
You must believe in something.

1051
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,553
The dignity of man.

1052
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:15,389
The flat tax, the right to bear
arms and school prayer.

1053
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,559
If nobody’s out there,
who’re they praying to?

1054
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,981
Don’t start arguing in
front of Grandpa now.

1055
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:25,190
I can’t believe you.

1056
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:29,361
One moment. He wasn’t an atheist
or a Republican, or a Democrat.

1057
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:31,113
He must’ve been something.

1058
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,073
He was a foot fetishist.

1059
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:35,534
The only group I
remember he belonged to.

1060
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:38,120
-That’s true.
-It drove your mother crazy.

1061
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,123
Pop, is that you?

1062
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,208
I have one message for you.

1063
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:46,003
You work and work
for years and years...

1064
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,796
always on the go.

1065
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,756
You never take a minute off...

1066
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,633
too busy making dough.

1067
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,802
Someday, you say,
you’ll have your fun...

1068
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:58,098
when you’re a millionaire.
Imagine all the fun you’ll have...

1069
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,309
in your old rocking chair.

1070
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,151
Enjoy yourself...

1071
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,153
it’s later than you think.

1072
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,447
Enjoy yourself...

1073
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,449
while you’re still in the pink.

1074
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,576
The years go by...

1075
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,703
as quickly as a wink.

1076
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:21,914
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself...

1077
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,124
it’s later than you think.

1078
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:30,839
Another birthday’s here and
gone, you’ve turned another page.

1079
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:33,258
Suddenly you realise...

1080
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,260
that you’ve reached middle age.

1081
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:39,348
Think of all the fun you’ve
missed, makes you kind of sad...

1082
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:43,477
It’s better to have had your
wish than to have wished you had.

1083
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,013
Enjoy yourself...

1084
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:22,182
it’s later than you think.

1085
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:24,226
Enjoy yourself...

1086
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:26,436
while you’re still in the pink.

1087
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:28,313
The years go by...

1088
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:30,274
as quickly as a wink.

1089
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:32,568
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself...

1090
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,570
it’s later than you think.

1091
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:44,371
That was ...

1092
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,456
unbelievable.

1093
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,627
Just every...

1094
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:54,339
thing you did...

1095
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,508
and all the...

1096
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,468
things you did.

1097
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,722
Absolutely perfect.

1098
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:04,725
Actually, it wasn’t perfect.

1099
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,895
At one point I stroked when
I should have hick eyed...

1100
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,689
but you know, I apologise.

1101
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:13,859
I feel limp.

1102
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:17,821
You know, I’d really love you
to come to Paris with me.

1103
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:19,531
I’m serious.

1104
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,366
Paris?

1105
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,202
And then Bora-Bora?

1106
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:26,830
Well, yes. Bora-Bora, but
Paris first and then...

1107
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,209
we’d work our way down
to at least one of the Boras.

1108
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,294
We can live in
your garret.

1109
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,172
Technically,
when I say garret...

1110
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:37,216
it is a garret, yet...

1111
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:40,969
And drink wine and eat snails
till the dawn comes up.

1112
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,221
Snails?

1113
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:46,225
Remember? You said you also
loved waking up in the night...

1114
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:48,352
drinking wine and eating snails.

1115
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,188
I said it was such a coincidence.

1116
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:52,981
Well, they’re molluscs.

1117
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,400
I love a good mollusc.

1118
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,822
What? The wedding’s off?

1119
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,282
Exactly. I gave back his ring.

1120
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,116
Why?

1121
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:05,786
There’s someone else
I can’t get out of my mind.

1122
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:07,538
But you’re in love with Holden.

1123
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,498
No. At least, I’m not sure.

1124
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:12,334
And I can’t cheat on
him while I decide.

1125
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:14,795
Cheat? He’s going to
be your husband!

1126
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:17,631
In November. I’ll show you
the receipts from the caterers.

1127
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,550
Calm your
denial mechanism.

1128
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,971
Holden is wonderful, but
someone else came into my life.

1129
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,599
I must see where it goes. It'd
be unfair to Holden if not.

1130
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:29,768
Now we’ve bought the
wedding dress...

1131
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,521
tell us who this new Prince
Charming is.

1132
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:35,482
You don’t know him. Well,
you do, but not like I do.

1133
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:36,650
I’m sick.

1134
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,068
My oesophagus is in spasms.

1135
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:39,987
Go have a drink of water.

1136
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:42,698
Look what you’re
doing to your father.

1137
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,492
Who has come between
you and Holden?

1138
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,828
Well, he’s bright and charming.

1139
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,289
Rough on the outside,
but that can change.

1140
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:53,375
Who is it? Will you tell us,
or is this like a game show?

1141
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:56,336
You remember Charles Ferry?

1142
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,172
Pardon me?

1143
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,675
For a minute I thought
she said Charles Ferry.

1144
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:04,136
Now my oesophagus
is starting to move.

1145
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,346
The escaped convict?

1146
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:10,142
Ex-convict. He has
a college degree.

1147
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,769
This is a psychotic episode.

1148
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,773
You need shock treatment, or
industrial-strength Prozac.

1149
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:18,400
Mom, you understand.

1150
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,944
He’s incredibly animalistic.

1151
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,113
So we turn him
over to the zoo.

1152
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:24,823
And yet, he’s a child.

1153
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,326
Okay, we’ll make
it the children’s zoo.

1154
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,952
He’s a criminal!

1155
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:32,623
I’m shocked. You’ve been
singing his praises for months.

1156
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:37,002
As a social symbol, not as
a person to be with my child...

1157
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:39,880
How are you going to
go out with this man?

1158
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,966
You can’t get behind him.
He won’t let you.

1159
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,302
You scratch his back,
he’ll knife you.

1160
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:48,430
Under all that veneer is a
very soulful young attorney.

1161
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,642
I was hoping you’d find a
place for him in your firm.

1162
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,852
Sure, as treasurer.
With Holden.

1163
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:57,564
Speaking as a woman, Holden
can be very animal, too.

1164
01:04:57,898 --> 01:05:00,317
Yes, Mom, but it’s of
the gerbil family.

1165
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:04,029
As your father, I forbid you
to see this man Charles Ferry!

1166
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,698
You will marry Holden!

1167
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:10,369
As head of this house, I
command it! I decree it!

1168
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:13,205
Thou shalt wed thy intended!

1169
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,582
Okay, let’s get a drink.

1170
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:17,793
You sound tiresomely Biblical.

1171
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:21,338
‘Tiresomely BiblicaI’? is this
Noel Coward with hockey?

1172
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,008
-I won’t let her waste her life.
-She’s a grown woman.

1173
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:25,926
You!

1174
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,928
You got him out of jail!

1175
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,888
This is my fault now?

1176
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,932
Honey, what’s wrong?

1177
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:36,145
Jeffrey Vandermost
asked Lane out, not me.

1178
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:40,065
My God! How will I face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?

1179
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,192
Is that all you’re thinking about?

1180
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:46,196
We bought a racehorse together.
He’ll want to cut it in half!

1181
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:48,448
We both liked him, and today...

1182
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:51,618
he asked if we could talk
alone so I got all excited.

1183
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:55,247
Then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him...

1184
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:57,249
to a dance in Connecticut.

1185
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,209
He has a mad crush on her.

1186
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,003
These things happen.

1187
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,338
Feelings are feeling
and sometimes...

1188
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:05,841
I’m through with love.

1189
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,010
I’ll never fall again.

1190
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,929
What are you saying?
You’re 14! You’ll fall again.

1191
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,849
Look, guys, I’m sorry.

1192
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,561
I thought you’d be happy for me.
I hope in time you understand.

1193
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,522
I’m through with love.
I’ll never fall again.

1194
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:24,109
What are you singing about?
You’re not in love with Holden!

1195
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:27,112
I’m through with love.

1196
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:30,782
I’ll never fall again.

1197
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:33,619
said ‘adieu’ to love...

1198
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,789
‘Don’t ever call again.’

1199
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:40,918
Incidentally, while Skylar was
breaking up with Holden...

1200
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:44,046
I broke up with Ken, the one
I met at the airport.

1201
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:45,964
Because I met this rap singer.

1202
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:50,135
This guy is just so talented
and sexy and...

1203
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:52,137
he just says it all.

1204
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:55,140
I’m through with love and through
with all you motherfuckers.

1205
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,392
Feeling mad shitty?
Burn down the city!

1206
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:59,895
Take it over for the brothers.

1207
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,481
Burn it up! Come
on! Blow it up!

1208
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:07,361
Your eyes of blue...

1209
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:09,488
your kisses too.

1210
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:12,241
I never knew what
they could do.

1211
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,577
I can’t believe...

1212
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,121
that you’re in love with me.

1213
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,049
I love the country.
The air smells so fresh.

1214
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:34,096
Charles...

1215
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:38,225
where did you get the money
for everything, and the car?

1216
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,062
You know. Loans.

1217
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:47,151
It’s a great idea to take
a walk here. It’s beautiful.

1218
01:07:47,693 --> 01:07:49,486
Yeah. What time is it?

1219
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:51,697
Four o'clock.

1220
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:52,990
Oh, good.

1221
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:57,661
Just thought you’d want to walk
around and see the fall leaves.

1222
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,414
They are stunning.

1223
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:04,626
Amazing what you miss in the
joint. No seasons. A grey nothing.

1224
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:09,089
What are your plans? Not to
work in the restaurant forever.

1225
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:13,802
You’re right. Work all day for a
few lousy bucks? I got big plans.

1226
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:16,096
Like pursuing a law career?

1227
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,264
What?

1228
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:18,515
A lawyer?

1229
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:20,809
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1230
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:24,021
You hear something?

1231
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,439
A bird?

1232
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:28,108
Here they come. Timing’s perfect.

1233
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:29,776
I’m running as fast as I can.

1234
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:30,944
Move it!

1235
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,529
Gotta get out of here!

1236
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,239
I’m going!

1237
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:39,036
Back in action!

1238
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:41,705
-Way to go, Ferry!
-Got anything lined up?

1239
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:43,248
Who’s she?

1240
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:44,416
She’s a friend.

1241
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,591
Why’d you shoot? He
was emptying the register.

1242
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,885
Take it easy! I got nervous!

1243
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:58,555
Just let me out at the
corner of Park and 93rd.

1244
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,688
Let me out! I want
out of this car!

1245
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,148
Shut up!

1246
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:13,028
I’ll be quiet!
Just let me out!

1247
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:15,155
Shut her up, or I shut her up.

1248
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,201
Get out!

1249
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:34,633
By October, Von had gotten
up the nerve to leave Greg.

1250
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:38,303
She got a ticket on Air France
and took the first plane to Paris.

1251
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:41,890
Dad had given up his
flat on the Left Bank...

1252
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:45,769
moving into a place he knew
would be Von's Parisian fantasy.

1253
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:48,021
He began guitar lessons...

1254
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:52,151
and even exchanged his word processor
for an old typewriter.

1255
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,158
I’m so happy to see you.

1256
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,702
God, look at your place!

1257
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:06,039
This is out of a movie. Or a...
This is like my dream.

1258
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,960
This is my dream apartment.
My dream view, right here.

1259
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,630
Back in New York, it was Halloween.

1260
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,299
That’s my favourite holiday.

1261
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:18,802
All the kids in the building
come trick-or-treating and...

1262
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:20,637
they all just look so great.

1263
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:25,559
What a little moonlight can do.

1264
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:33,400
What a little moonlight
can do to you!

1265
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:40,616
Chinatown, my Chinatown...

1266
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:43,577
where the lights are low.

1267
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,539
In some secluded rendevouz...

1268
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:55,297
I’m Chiquita Banana
and I’ve come to say...

1269
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:58,634
bananas have to ripen
in a certain way.

1270
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,929
When they’re flecked with brown
and have a golden hue...

1271
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:05,349
bananas taste the best
and are the best for you.

1272
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:08,519
You can put them in a salad.

1273
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:12,314
You can put them
in a pie...yie-yie!

1274
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:15,359
Any way you want to eat them.

1275
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,028
It’s impossible to beat them!

1276
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:20,489
But bananas like the climate...

1277
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:24,159
of the very tropical equator.

1278
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,329
So you should never put...

1279
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,790
bananas in the refrigerator.

1280
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,084
No, no, no, no!

1281
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,337
That was great. Terrific.

1282
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,798
Would you like some candy?

1283
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:39,675
What a banana!

1284
01:11:49,184 --> 01:11:51,645
I’m so happy to see you!

1285
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,814
I wasn’t sure. I was worried.

1286
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,358
Holden, I’m so sorry.

1287
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:00,612
It doesn’t matter.

1288
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,824
-I behaved terribly.
-It was me, too.

1289
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,243
-No, it was me.
-I missed you.

1290
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:07,452
Me too.

1291
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:09,454
I brought you some Cracker Jack.

1292
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:11,874
He was so in love
with my sister...

1293
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:15,085
that it didn’t matter that
She’d given him a hard time.

1294
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:18,172
And Mom and Dad were so
glad to see them reunited.

1295
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:22,134
He gave her back the ring,
but he wanted to be romantic.

1296
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,430
So he put it in the CrackerJacks
and she swallowed it again.

1297
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,600
The rest of fall was normal...

1298
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:30,809
for us.

1299
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:33,312
The only glitch was
on Thanksgiving.

1300
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:34,730
Just after dinner...

1301
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,773
Scott suddenly collapsed.

1302
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,525
Everybody panicked.

1303
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:41,028
There’s no cause for alarm.

1304
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:44,823
There was a blockage in the
artery, but it’s been dissolved.

1305
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,408
There’s no problem?

1306
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,076
No, he’s fine. 100% .

1307
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:52,456
Our scan indicated that the
condition began some time ago...

1308
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:56,668
so if he’s shown any kind of
strange or weird behaviour...

1309
01:12:56,877 --> 01:13:00,088
It’s because his brain wasn’t
getting enough oxygen.

1310
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:04,760
But as soon as his brain
started functioning properly...

1311
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:07,721
Scott resigned from the
Conservative Republican Club...

1312
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:11,391
and started espousing left-wing
Democratic philosophy.

1313
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:14,812
Dad was overjoyed.
Just as proud as can be.

1314
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:19,399
Remember I said New York
was most beautiful in fall?

1315
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,943
I meant the winter.

1316
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,112
At least, when it snows. Because
Under a blanket of snow...

1317
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,907
New York is truly
gorgeous and...

1318
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,368
surprisingly peaceful.

1319
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:30,744
But when Christmas comes...

1320
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:34,248
we’re not the kind of family
that sings carols...

1321
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:37,042
and we don’t have a
goose or anything.

1322
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:41,088
What we do is head for Paris,
to spend Christmas at the Ritz.

1323
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,468
Put your finger here.

1324
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:33,348
He has a fever...it’s a cold.

1325
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,852
Should have put on dry clothes
after you fell in the fountain.

1326
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,813
I’m okay. Go without me.
I’ll be all right.

1327
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:43,817
We don’t want to go without you.
You love the Marx brothers.

1328
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:46,445
I just need some sleep.
I’ll be fine.

1329
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,197
I’m so excited.

1330
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:52,659
I’m meeting this guy named Guy...
or this guy named Guy.

1331
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:54,995
I brought you some tea.

1332
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:58,207
It won’t keep me
awake, will it?

1333
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:01,418
No, it’s herbal.
It’s peppermint.

1334
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:08,550
I’d say hello, but I’m sick and
you always catch everything.

1335
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,677
-What happened?
-What’s wrong?

1336
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:12,930
I’m not going tonight.

1337
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,264
I knew it!

1338
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:17,100
-Nobody’s going?
-Von left me.

1339
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:18,644
-What happened?

1340
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:22,481
I have no idea, but she’s on
her way back to New York.

1341
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:25,150
When she first came,
everything was perfect.

1342
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,654
She said it was like a dream
had come true for her.

1343
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:30,197
And then, suddenly...

1344
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:31,657
this morning...

1345
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:35,953
I want to go back home...

1346
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,454
to Greg.

1347
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:40,749
Really?

1348
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,585
I don’t know what’s up with me.

1349
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:45,337
Since when?

1350
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:46,797
I don’t know.

1351
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:50,300
Why?

1352
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:53,804
I don’t know how
to explain it exactly.

1353
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:56,390
Just tell me.
You know, just...

1354
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:59,977
It’s not that I don’t
think you’re great.

1355
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,895
I think you’re great.

1356
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:06,608
Just for years i've
been married to Greg.

1357
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:10,612
And he can be difficult,
and we’ve had...

1358
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:12,781
our ups and downs...

1359
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,949
certainly.

1360
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:15,117
Since when...?

1361
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:17,661
Look, I don’t know. It’s just...

1362
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,289
I’ve always had
this fantasy...

1363
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,961
that one day i’d meet
the perfect man...

1364
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:29,423
and he’d fulfil my dreams
and I would have...

1365
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:31,049
a perfect life.

1366
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,385
And that fantasy...

1367
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,847
I think, always sort of...

1368
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:41,059
was part of this dissatisfaction
I had with Greg...

1369
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,394
and my life.

1370
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,521
And then you came along...

1371
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:48,567
and you seemed to know every
secret thing about me.

1372
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,738
Let me put it this way...

1373
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:56,492
I have seen my
dream come true...

1374
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:58,494
and my fantasy...

1375
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,412
no longer tortures me.

1376
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:02,706
I can deal with it.

1377
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,585
But that’s so neurotic.

1378
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:08,587
I know.

1379
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,255
I’m crazy.

1380
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:13,926
But suppose I said to you that...

1381
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:17,513
none of this was really
true, that this is all...

1382
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,057
a façade i’ve
been putting on.

1383
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,476
That somehow I had access to...

1384
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:27,397
your deepest feelings, needs
and thoughts...

1385
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:31,151
and that I've been playing
this character just to...

1386
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,780
win you over, to get you to
like me, make you happy?

1387
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:37,449
If that’s what you told me...

1388
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:41,078
then I'd say you were crazy.

1389
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:45,958
So that’s exactly why
I’m not going tonight.

1390
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:50,420
I plan to go to Napoleon’s tomb.
To lie down next to him.

1391
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,923
-That’ll be my Christmas Eve.
-That’s so sad!

1392
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:54,299
The women you pick!

1393
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,344
No, you’re going out.
Someone’s got to take Mom.

1394
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,221
You’re too sick?

1395
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,307
-He looks terrible.
-I’m fine if I don’t move my eyes.

1396
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:06,103
He has a 101 temperature.
You’re not going anywhere.

1397
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,771
I’m not in a Groucho mood.

1398
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:12,526
It’s Christmas Eve, it’s Paris.
There’s a ball...

1399
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,486
that you helped organise.

1400
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:16,196
I’ll go for a couple hours.

1401
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,614
Enjoy yourself.

1402
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:20,492
I must stay here, but there’s
no reason you don’t go.

1403
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,494
It’s later than you think.

1404
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,155
Remember our first
Christmas in Paris...

1405
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,240
the month before we married?

1406
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:25,450
I do, because that was when...

1407
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,329
I knew that someday I
would have to live there.

1408
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,124
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

1409
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:37,296
I don’t want to panic you, but
that was decades ago. Decades.

1410
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:39,673
I know. I know
it was decades ago.

1411
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:42,092
Remember that café
we used to go to?

1412
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:46,305
Café Terèse or whatever,
with the cats. Remember?

1413
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:48,265
Now i’ll tell you the truth.

1414
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:49,808
I hated that cat.

1415
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:55,230
Maybe that’s why you were
scratching yourself all night.

1416
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:56,899
Was I scratching myself?

1417
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,068
-That’s what you noticed?
-I certainly did.

1418
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:01,445
I hated that cat.

1419
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:02,863
I couldn’t stand it...

1420
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:06,283
but now that café is round
the corner from my home.

1421
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:07,534
You’re joking!

1422
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:10,162
Why would I joke about
something like that?

1423
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,289
You want to have
a drink there?

1424
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,625
-Why not?
-Because we’re drinking here.

1425
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,376
Why would I want to go?

1426
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:18,128
We can take our moustaches off.

1427
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:20,172
You’re having a nostalgic...?

1428
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:24,134
I’m having a thing. Sue me.
I just thought it'd be fun.

1429
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,302
We can’t...

1430
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:28,555
Come on, we’ll take our
moustaches off, no problem.

1431
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,766
-That I’d like to do.
-Me too.

1432
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,019
Never thought I’d hear you
say, ‘Take my moustache off.’

1433
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,646
Please.

1434
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:37,022
Wail go.

1435
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:41,026
I feel good.
I’ve had 3 glasses of champagne.

1436
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:43,695
Let’s go see this place.

1437
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:45,364
You want to sneak out?

1438
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:48,951
I do. We snuck out
before, remember?

1439
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:53,038
Remember that boring party we
went to with the Wainwrights?

1440
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,582
Yes, I remember, because...

1441
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,502
we left through
the toilet window.

1442
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,380
A guy was singing,
‘Climb Every Mountain.’

1443
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:04,591
And you knocked over the punch
bowl, if I remember correctly.

1444
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:08,887
Yes, but you let out the
shriek that got us caught.

1445
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,974
Remember how we made love?
Do you remember?

1446
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:13,559
-You dropped your cigar.
-I know.

1447
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:16,311
I dropped the cigar and l...

1448
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,313
You’re so drunk.

1449
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,775
I remember us making love.

1450
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:23,610
Remember the candles?

1451
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:26,572
I remember the candles,
the hotel, but not you.

1452
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:29,158
Unless you were
the one under me.

1453
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:31,368
-Now you’re in character.
-I don’t know where I am.

1454
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,912
-I’m lost.
-Come on. Let’s go.

1455
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,915
-Our coats are in the car.
-Forget it.

1456
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:40,335
It’s a warm night. Come
on. Pretend you’re young.

1457
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,588
I could do for you.

1458
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:47,259
You’re better off without her.

1459
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:50,846
How do you know?
You never met her.

1460
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:52,264
I know you.

1461
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:53,932
So what does that mean?

1462
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:55,726
A good psychiatrist...

1463
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,478
that listened to you...

1464
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:01,231
would think every time I’m with
a woman, you get jealous.

1465
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:02,900
Why are you laughing?

1466
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,819
I just wish you’d pick someone
who’d make you happy.

1467
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:07,237
Like who?

1468
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:08,572
I made you happy.

1469
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,950
-I didn’t say you didn’t.
-I made you very happy.

1470
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,411
When we weren’t at
each other’s throats.

1471
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,539
Does this ring a bell? This
is why I took you here.

1472
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,291
Does this mean anything?

1473
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,084
Is this where we...?

1474
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:24,463
This is it, yes. That’s why I
dragged you all over town.

1475
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,131
My God!

1476
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,967
-You remember this?
-We stayed up all night here.

1477
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:32,471
I know. I held you in my
arms till the light came up.

1478
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:34,223
Remember the song?

1479
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:36,433
-I do.
-I still sing that song.

1480
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:40,479
I learned it from you. That was
the first time. Remember?

1481
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:43,106
I’m through with love...

1482
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,567
I’ll never fall again.

1483
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:48,862
Said ‘adieu’ to love...

1484
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:51,949
‘Don’t ever call again.’

1485
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:55,077
For I must have you...

1486
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,454
or no one.

1487
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:01,959
And so I’m through with love.

1488
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:07,130
I’ve locked my heart.

1489
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:09,716
I’ll keep my feelings there.

1490
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:12,761
I have stocked my heart...

1491
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:15,264
with icy frigidaire.

1492
01:24:15,973 --> 01:24:18,350
And I mean to care for no one...

1493
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:25,524
because I’m through with love.

1494
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:30,529
Why did you lead me to think...

1495
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:33,157
you could care?

1496
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,742
You didn’t need me...

1497
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,537
for you had your share...

1498
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:40,998
of friends around you...

1499
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:43,750
to hound you and swear...

1500
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:46,420
with deep emotion...

1501
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:49,131
devotion to you.

1502
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,760
Goodbye to spring...

1503
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:56,513
and all it meant to me.

1504
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,683
It can never bring...

1505
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,811
the things that used to be.

1506
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:05,898
For I must have you...

1507
01:25:06,857 --> 01:25:08,650
or no one.

1508
01:25:11,528 --> 01:25:13,614
And so I’m through with love.

1509
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:11,231
I wonder what would’ve
happened if we’d stayed together.

1510
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:16,612
That’s something
we’ll never know.

1511
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:19,406
We’ve managed to produce...

1512
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:21,283
a fabulous daughter.

1513
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:23,911
She is unbelievable.

1514
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:27,581
She’s got your looks,
fortunately...

1515
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,917
and my magic personality.

1516
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:31,877
She is wonderful.

1517
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:35,506
And you’ve been very happy
with Bob, so that’s good.

1518
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:36,799
He’s wonderful.

1519
01:27:37,049 --> 01:27:38,884
-You couldn’t have done better.
-No.

1520
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:43,889
There have been a few
times, you’ll admit...

1521
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:48,393
you did call me in an emergency
and I had to come bail you out.

1522
01:27:48,811 --> 01:27:50,270
I know.

1523
01:27:50,604 --> 01:27:53,315
Two major fights
with Bob, and...

1524
01:27:53,524 --> 01:27:57,653
one disgusting lump that turned
out to be benign...

1525
01:27:57,903 --> 01:27:59,112
though you were in a panic.

1526
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:00,823
You were there for me.

1527
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,574
And you for me.

1528
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:03,909
And I appreciate it.

1529
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,496
I think we’ve been
better friends...

1530
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,164
than husband and wife.

1531
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:11,291
Yeah, we probably have.

1532
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,753
But nobody made me
laugh the way you did.

1533
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:17,297
I love Bob with all my
heart, it isn’t that.

1534
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:21,260
It’s just that you could always
push that button in me.

1535
01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:24,179
So why is that so important?

1536
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:25,973
I don’t know.

1537
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:27,683
Maybe we’re crazy.

1538
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:35,566
That girl that dumped you
today, did she make you laugh?

1539
01:28:35,858 --> 01:28:36,984
I don’t know.

1540
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:39,278
I have to put that...

1541
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:40,696
behind.

1542
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,493
Funny how life goes.

1543
01:28:46,702 --> 01:28:48,579
It’s amazing. Amazing.

1544
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:16,940
Let’s go. It’s late.

1545
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:19,234
It’s definitely late.

1546
01:29:19,485 --> 01:29:21,445
Christmas Eve, and late.

1547
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:22,613
Let’s go.

1548
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:27,284
Everyone says ‘I love you...’

1549
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:30,454
the cop on the corner
and the burglar too.

1550
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:32,998
Christmas Eve in Paris.

1551
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:34,458
What a year!

1552
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,878
And that sort of brings us
to the end of our story.

1553
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,756
I told Skylar someone should
write it up as a movie.

1554
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:44,968
She said ‘Better be a musical,
or no one will believe it.’

1555
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:46,053
By the way...

1556
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,348
that night
I met a terrific guy.

1557
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:51,934
I mean, talk about sexy!
