1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,045
Hi. I'm Billy.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,095
Billy Dooley.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,865
That's me. I'm asleep.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,490
I hate to start this whole thing
off in a state of unconsciousness

5
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,907
but I was having this weird
dream about my relatives.

6
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:11,544
For some reason we were all on the beach

7
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:12,935
playing volleyball.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,115
Look Joe, our grandson Billy Dooley.

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,393
Come here and give your
grandma a great big kiss.

10
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:20,858
No, grandma is OK.

11
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:24,995
Throw yourself into the game boy.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,930
You're not gonna embarrass yourself
in front of people like you did last year.

13
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,296
No, I promise grandpa.
It won't happen again.

14
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,330
Of course not, not with moves like yours.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,400
Sorry, hurt your Billy?

16
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:39,758
Only when I breathe.

17
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:42,498
No, cousins.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,020
Don't worry.
It's okay for second cousins to kiss.

19
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,206
I want my piggy back ride.

20
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:49,624
Wanna lick my Popsicle?

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,649
No, thank you.

22
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,954
Pimples. I gotta kiss those pimples.

23
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,814
- Hello Billy
- Meema.

24
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:56,630
Mom, dad. This is hell.

25
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,895
Honey, they're just happy to see you.

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,151
They sure are, son.

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,495
That's right.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,273
- And you know who's dying to see you?
- Who aunt Margaret?

29
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,950
Your cousin Mark.

30
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,631
Come here Billy, see.

31
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,950
No, not Mark Jr.

32
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:26,186
Hurt your Billy?

33
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,582
I'm gonna get you Billy.

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,060
You have our attention now Billy.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
What is it?

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,884
Nothing, I'm fine.

37
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,510
You think that dream was insane?

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,451
You should see some of the
others I've been having this week.

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,390
If you ever been to a family reunion,
I'm sure you can relate.

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,240
My family, the Dooley’s, have
these dreaded events every year.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,890
By now, you'd think we'd know better.

42
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,553
He's even more uptight
about this thing than you are.

43
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,023
Grace. I'm not uptight.

44
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:09,048
Really?

45
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:11,440
Why are you driving on
the wrong side of the road?

46
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,090
This is good. This is really good.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,838
We've been on the road two hours yet

48
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,033
it feels like two weeks.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,530
Mom, a suggestion. We could turn
back the clock, turn around and go home.

50
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,200
- Got my vote.
- I'm there.

51
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,490
Kevin.

52
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,990
It is your grandmother's 100th birthday,
we told everyone we're going.

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
We're committed.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,000
Believe me, after a weekend
with my family we will be.

55
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,420
Dad, I told Keith I would call him.

56
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,519
Yeah, but every ten minutes?

57
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:49,586
Dad, come on.

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,110
I told you a hundred times.

59
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,666
If you're gonna talk to Keith.

60
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,424
You get a job. You get a car.
You get a car phone.

61
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,615
- Why are you yelling at her?
- I'm not yelling at her.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,209
- Now you're yelling at me.
- Because you're yelling at me.

63
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,514
You know why everyone's yelling?

64
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:06,169
Because we're driving to the murky
depths from which there is no return.

65
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:10,410
They made disguises in this reunion but
all these people want do is compete,

66
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:14,035
show each other up and put each other down.
Why are we putting ourselves through this?

67
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:17,526
Because

68
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,503
we are family.

69
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,941
If someone would have given me a
choice between parting with my relatives

70
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,610
or spending the weekend
in a maggot infested barrel.

71
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,740
The maggots would have won hands down.

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,590
Some of you may think I'm overreacting

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
just wait.

74
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,691
Isn't that the exact same
position we left them in last year?

75
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:45,310
The only thing that's changed is they
filed down the horns of Mark Jr.'s head.

76
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:48,555
How much time do you think I'd get about
knocked them over like bowling pins.

77
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:51,599
A lot if I testify against you.

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Say hello.

79
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Hello sister.

80
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,640
OK, here's how it works.

81
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,010
I cannot stand my cousin Mark Jr.

82
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,203
My dad is not too fond of Mark senior,

83
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,410
my mom is not exactly
thrilled with aunt Margaret.

84
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,889
My sister

85
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,680
she hates them all.

86
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,705
Well

87
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,370
if it isn't my brother
and his lovely family.

88
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,681
I didn't think you'd show.

89
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,730
Why would you think that sister?

90
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,710
Shall I list the reasons?

91
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:17,735
No, don't.

92
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,903
We're just here to have
a good time this year.

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,656
I'm glad you're here

94
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,330
makes things a little
more competitive.

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Very little.

96
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,250
So, moron.

97
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,450
Are you gonna humiliate
yourself again this year?

98
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,970
Stuff it Mark.

99
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,710
Clever.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,853
With that steel trap of a mind of yours
that I heard get you thrown back

101
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,029
into summer school.

102
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,962
- Smooth move.
- Thank you.

103
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,831
Race you to the front door.

104
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,814
My brother hasn't got a chance.

105
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,011
Kevin don't do it.

106
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,265
I can beat him, he's on a bike.

107
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,570
That's not the point.

108
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,063
Yes, it is.

109
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:03,374
He's cheating.

110
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:05,759
And this surprises you?

111
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,673
I can't believe it.

112
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:27,600
Pretty good driving there, pal.

113
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,624
I hope you're not too tired
later for a round of golf.

114
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,534
See you.

115
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:35,195
Don't worry dad.

116
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,780
Maybe he'll get a massive
coronary like on Ethel's first husband.

117
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,325
That's not a very nice thing to say.

118
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,150
No, but it's optimistic.

119
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,231
Alright.

120
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,850
Let's get this over with.

121
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Let's go.

122
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,473
Jeez, did I hurt you?

123
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,132
No.

124
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,953
No, that's all right.
It happens all the time.

125
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,440
Welcome to Jameson Bluffs.

126
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,505
I'm Donald Jameson, your concierge.

127
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,630
I'll get the boy to help
you with your bags.

128
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:05,806
Douglas!

129
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:11,286
Hello, I'm bellhop Douglas.

130
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,373
Welcome to Jameson Bluffs.

131
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,580
How may I help you take your bags?

132
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,000
How how did you do that?

133
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Do what?

134
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,159
Never mind.

135
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,729
It's a nice place in here.

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,590
Welcome to the Jameson Bluffs.

137
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,806
A family run resort.

138
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,092
I think family run is
the operative word here.

139
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,117
Yes.

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,999
Mom, don't you think
that's a little creepy?

141
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,815
You want creepy?

142
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Turn around.

143
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,138
Boo-Boo. Cuddles.

144
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:58,406
Aunt Kate,
don't call us that we're not kids anymore

145
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:02,340
To me you'll always be Boo-Boo and Cuddles.

146
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,069
Isn't that right?

147
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,403
You're right aunt Kate.

148
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:14,649
Cute?

149
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:15,756
So cute.

150
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:20,430
Billy, I'm so glad you're here.
Your cousins have been dying to see you.

151
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,260
Every family has a few

152
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,470
losers cousins.

153
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,250
Unfortunately, all of
mine fit that description

154
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Billy.

155
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,530
Want a piece of gum?

156
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:30,936
What are you worried about?

157
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:31,961
I don't got cooties.

158
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,322
I want a piggyback ride right now.

159
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:39,000
Later, later.

160
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:41,975
Look.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,748
I get the complete mint stamp
collection of the Elvis commemorative.

162
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,270
Greg still doesn't talk

163
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,650
just like aunt Seal.

164
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,543
She didn't say giddily squad
until her first communion

165
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:53,928
and then you couldn't shut her up.

166
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:56,376
Yada yadada. Right?

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,290
Yada yadada Greg.

168
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,999
Can you say yada yadada?

169
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:04,156
William.

170
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,370
Hello William.

171
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,529
Amber, it's good to see you again.

172
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,048
I've grown up William.

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Can't you tell?

174
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,890
I can actually.

175
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,680
My dad needs help with the bags.

176
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,456
But I need help too.

177
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,009
Smell me William.

178
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,690
It's obsession.

179
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,899
It certainly is.

180
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,872
I know you've been
uncomfortable in the past

181
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:28,715
but great news.

182
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,060
I've done all the research.

183
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,240
Second cousins can propagate.

184
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,356
Amber, you're very weird.

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I can't help it.

186
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,190
You bring out my dark side.

187
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:48,180
Through your left you will notice
the children's recreation area.

188
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,510
And to you're right you
will notice a fully equipped

189
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
heated pool

190
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
loaded with water.

191
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:00,446
They're your parents.

192
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,860
They're your parents. There's your father.

193
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,485
- Say hello.
- Do I have to?

194
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,997
You better think of something,
here they come.

195
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,729
Douglas, could you stop the car please?

196
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,930
Thanks.

197
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,600
Great darling.

198
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,746
Daddy.

199
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:20,285
Kevin, give your mom a big kiss.

200
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:27,390
And look at that boy and
how much he's grown.

201
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,810
Connie, you are so beautiful.

202
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,760
I love you both.

203
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, come on you too say hello.

204
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:44,280
They hadn't spoken in a long time

205
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,527
so getting them to say hello is like
getting rid of a pimple on prom night.

206
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,283
Hello.

207
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:51,845
Hello.

208
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,039
See. That wasn't so hard, was it?

209
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:55,290
As a matter of fact it was.

210
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,374
Now that I think about it.

211
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,772
I take the hello back.

212
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,518
You know your father,
he doesn't mean anything he says.

213
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,720
Yeah, except in my case.

214
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,334
So.

215
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:12,944
Where's the guest of honor?

216
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,581
Meema, she's lying down
for her afternoon nap.

217
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:31,655
Are you sure she's asleep?

218
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,514
You never can be sure with that one.

219
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,850
But I did lock her in.

220
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,419
Yeah.

221
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,084
What did I do with that key?

222
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,610
I think I've lost it.

223
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,134
Here we go.

224
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,973
This will be your home for a while.

225
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,434
I hope you enjoy your lagoon view.

226
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,344
And your television set.

227
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,569
It will be cable compatible

228
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,893
with 105 channels except for
some reason it doesn't get channel 2.

229
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:04,700
I don't know why.
Crazy day.

230
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,664
But I certainly hope you enjoy
your commendations here

231
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,679
at the fabulous Jameson Bluffs.

232
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:10,704
Thank you.

233
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,550
Welcome.

234
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,647
I just put some fresh
towels in your bathroom.

235
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:20,414
If there's anything you need

236
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,439
I'm Donna

237
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,625
and if there's anything you
don't need I'm still Donna.

238
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,643
Thank God we're not
at their family reunion.

239
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:35,675
How clever, Margaret and Mark
have made up a whole itinerary.

240
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Golf.

241
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,725
Tennis.

242
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,670
Volleyball. 500 meter swim?

243
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,224
Only thing they left out is the luge.

244
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,654
Wrong honey, look,
page three you missed it.

245
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,424
10:30 Sunday.

246
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,157
My back is hurting just thinking about it.

247
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,224
I'm gonna need a chiropractor.

248
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:53,504
Connie, get off the phone.

249
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:56,484
He's not home.

250
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:58,844
Where else would he
be on a Friday afternoon?

251
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:00,524
He'll probably went to the movies

252
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,594
with Mary Ellen Jenkins.

253
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,628
The first time I saw her

254
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,653
it was like

255
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:19,733
a fantasy

256
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:22,184
a mist filled vision.

257
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,237
The real fun begins

258
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,654
in 20 minutes

259
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,598
at the family reception.

260
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,384
In an instant the vision was gone

261
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,409
and so was the mist.

262
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,549
Just put a bullet in me now.

263
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,661
It's your family.

264
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,634
The Dooley's.

265
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:47,053
A proud and prosperous clan.

266
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,294
Who over the centuries
fell into two categories.

267
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:51,864
Crooks

268
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,084
and lawyers

269
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:55,334
and the occasional
disgruntled postal worker.

270
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,561
Every year my aunt Kate

271
00:12:57,586 --> 00:13:01,664
would recount the stories of
every generation in minute detail

272
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,694
and I, every year, would
follow in my own tradition

273
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,724
of making shadow
puppets while she talked

274
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,244
Then in 1668

275
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:11,620
Ezekiel Dooley

276
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:13,992
became the first Dooley to reach America

277
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,964
aboard the prison ship Oglethorpe

278
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,664
landing in the penal colony in Georgia.

279
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,294
His son

280
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,344
Zachariah

281
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,284
carried on the family tradition

282
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,995
by being the first person in the original
13 colonies to be convicted of horse theft.

283
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:32,037
What an incredible family history.

284
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,608
I'm swelling with pride.

285
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,321
Makes me want to go out and

286
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,799
hold up a convenience store.

287
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,564
That's not funny.

288
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,507
No, it's genetics.

289
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:42,120
use of religious objects.

290
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:45,854
As I look out among
our ever-growing clan

291
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,644
I am filled with pride

292
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:49,843
and just

293
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,428
a touch of sadness.

294
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,623
God.

295
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,063
I hope she doesn't do the
I only wish I had children's speech.

296
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,949
I only wish that I

297
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,471
I could have had children.

298
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,247
It's alright. I'm fine.

299
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:09,654
Anyway.

300
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:13,494
You will see.

301
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,434
You are all my children.

302
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,974
And that's why I'm
looking forward to spending

303
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:22,034
some time with each and
every one of you this year.

304
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,803
That's the way to celebrate

305
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,084
a Dooley milestone.

306
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:30,074
Our Meema's 100th birthday.

307
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,305
Knock it off.

308
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:50,904
Sit down.

309
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,904
Big deal I'm old

310
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,474
and I hate to burst your
bubble but I'm only 98.

311
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,430
So don't rush me.

312
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:07,454
And who do I have to kill
to get an ice tea in this joint?

313
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:12,384
Thank you.

314
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,094
And now I'd like to turn the floor
over to Margaret's husband Mark.

315
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:23,771
A Dooley in-law

316
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:29,414
and a fine lawyer in his own right who will
go over tomorrow's family Olympic events.

317
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,444
Come on Mark.

318
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,094
Thank you.

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,274
Thank you all very much. We have a
very exciting day planned for you tomorrow

320
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:41,774
and as I look at the

321
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:45,944
overwhelming number of you who've
signed up on these registration sheets.

322
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,488
I can see how truly pumped

323
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:49,794
you all are.

324
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,502
What kind of person
describes people as pumped?

325
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:54,793
You're looking at him, honey.

326
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:57,521
This year's new event
the luge competition.

327
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,244
Radical little trouble getting the
city to cooperate, they don't know...

328
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:09,584
It was at this moment that I was amazed to
find that I was actually glad I was here.

329
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,797
I'd never seen anything like her.

330
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:12,979
I had to meet her.

331
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:14,004
Talk to her.

332
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:15,584
Nothing could stop me.

333
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,077
You're not going anywhere.

334
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,730
Nothing except mom.

335
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:20,755
Sit.

336
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,781
Mom, I just want to

337
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,795
Sit.

338
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,024
Sit, I just want to sit.

339
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,934
You're including Tom Dooley.

340
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:29,144
Don't hang your head down pal,
we're happy you're here

341
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:35,714
But there is one Dooley family
who's not represented on this list and

342
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:40,004
when you recall their
performance at last year's event.

343
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,384
It's not surprising.

344
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:45,410
He's just trying to get to you

345
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:46,803
do not react.

346
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,644
How can I not react to that?

347
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,737
Because you promised me you wouldn't.

348
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,732
Your family is a bunch of wusses.

349
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,840
Mom, is it okay if I react?

350
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:57,865
Neither of you.

351
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,014
Kevin never did have any guts.

352
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,703
Why can't you just forgive and forget?

353
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,714
Because that's not what I do.

354
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,093
But maybe that the

355
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:12,347
unnamed family could be persuaded
to participate if we added an event

356
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,060
which they felt they might excel.

357
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,825
How does concussion volleyball sound?

358
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:30,500
No, not last year.
Why did you have to bring up last year?

359
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,557
Alright.

360
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,090
Aim for their weakest link.

361
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,363
- Billy?
- Right.

362
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,089
Yeah, one more point

363
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:39,524
and we win. Win.

364
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,549
- Win.
- Win.

365
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:41,574
Win!

366
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,151
I got it.

367
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:57,348
Mom?

368
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:00,706
Meanwhile, back at the
banquet of humiliation.

369
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:08,454
And maybe we can play every event
this year until somebody gets K.O.

370
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,559
I don't know what it was

371
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,362
some uncontrollable urge just
took hold of me and before I knew it

372
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:16,142
I was on my feet and a voice I didn't
recognize come out of my mouth.

373
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,167
We're in!

374
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:19,327
Good.

375
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:22,540
And we're gonna kick your butts!

376
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,409
Yes, we were strong.

377
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,434
We were proud.

378
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,269
And we had no idea what
we were getting ourselves into.

379
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,284
OK, come on Billy
time to hit the floor pal.

380
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:45,815
I thought I was dreaming

381
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:47,924
then when I realized I wasn't.

382
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:49,964
A nightmare really began.

383
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:52,754
We're in training.

384
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,284
- Let's go.
- Honey.

385
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,070
This is supposed to be a vacation,
not boot camp

386
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,017
You're forgetting sweetheart,
a Dooley reunion

387
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,234
is boot camp.

388
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:01,434
Let's go, come on.

389
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:02,754
Everybody.

390
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,437
I'm a Dooley and I'm proud.

391
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,377
Come along and shout a lot.

392
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,975
Dad, I'm exhausted.

393
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,453
Don't worry,
I got something to wake you up.

394
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,792
Charge!

395
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:17,393
Let's go, come on

396
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:18,692
into the water.

397
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,725
Everybody.

398
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,205
This is gonna be fun.

399
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,230
Here we go.

400
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,071
It's cold.

401
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:29,550
Don't go in there. Don't go in.

402
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,278
Don't go in.

403
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,263
And one, two, three.

404
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:37,223
And one, and two

405
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,216
three

406
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,530
Keep moving.

407
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,456
Follow me, let's go.

408
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,629
Why do I feel like this is
a metaphor for my life?

409
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,204
No pain, no gain.

410
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:12,024
What idiot came up with?

411
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,783
I think I might have some idea.

412
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,012
Eat this!

413
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:49,960
One of the huge preoccupations
of my life was trying to figure out

414
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,250
when exactly I would be considered old
enough not to have to sit at the dreaded

415
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
kids table.

416
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,501
This looks like your dog.

417
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm dying.

418
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,600
Save a coffin for me.

419
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:08,936
Look what I made out of my eggs.

420
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,370
- Are you hungry Billy?
- Thank you no.

421
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,641
I'm just gonna stick
with my cheese Danish.

422
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,926
Billy take a look at this.

423
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,759
I caught him in the bushes last night.

424
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,675
You want to help me dissect him later?

425
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:21,764
I...

426
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:23,303
I don't do lizards.

427
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,890
Hi.

428
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
How you doing?

429
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:31,453
Good, glad to hear it.

430
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,506
Yeah? Great.

431
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,872
Look, Haley's coming. Look, look.

432
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,419
Why does he keep staring at me?

433
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:43,785
Is he like a moony or something?

434
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,043
- He really likes you Billy.
- Really?

435
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:47,592
How can you tell?
Is he like

436
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,447
blinking in Morse code?

437
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,890
A grandmother can tell.

438
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,126
Wave goodbye Greg.

439
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,259
- Bye Greg.
- Bye.

440
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:59,379
I'm sorry you have to put up
with these children William.

441
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,745
Why do we get together later for more

442
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,257
adult activities.

443
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,809
My dad's card is full Amber.

444
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,355
I'm not talking about dancing.

445
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,416
I gotta go, I mean that literally.

446
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,447
I gotta run.

447
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:14,069
I gotta go to a race

448
00:22:14,094 --> 00:22:15,200
in a few minutes.

449
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:16,513
Bye.

450
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:19,884
There she is again.

451
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
What would you do?

452
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,970
You'd follow her.

453
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Am I right?

454
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:41,832
Look, there she goes.

455
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:43,906
Do I look like I need a seeing-eye dog?

456
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:46,252
So, what do we do?

457
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,930
We wait.

458
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,106
For what?

459
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,376
Excuse me sir.

460
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,664
Ma’ams.

461
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,203
As I was soon to find out.

462
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,969
I wouldn't be the only one
looking for this mysterious girl.

463
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:08,703
Kid.

464
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:10,395
What for can I do you?

465
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,890
Would you like a massage?

466
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,280
Would you like a herbal wrap?
Maybe a salt rub? What do you say?

467
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,343
No thanks, I'm just waiting for somebody.

468
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,983
Just waiting for someone.

469
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:22,981
Why don't you wait for someone somewhere
else? If you know what I'm saying.

470
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:26,287
Spa. Dave speaking.

471
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:28,800
Hi cousin Donald. How are you?

472
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,825
What?

473
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,280
No. The 26th. I don't know.

474
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:34,573
It looks OK to me, but it's only me.

475
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:36,791
Yeah, I can call cousin Thomas.

476
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,658
No, you may not want him.
He's a little funny.

477
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:07,377
Alright, now relax. You're not relaxing

478
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:10,142
Let it out.

479
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Now.

480
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,677
Goodbye Samantha Avondale.

481
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,780
Face to face at last.

482
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:00,455
Excuse me,
do you realize you're in the women's spa?

483
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:01,737
Yeah, well I'm

484
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:03,490
I'm sorry, I was just looking for somebody.

485
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:04,515
Who?

486
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,670
Well, she's about your height,
your hair color

487
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:07,695
You're her.

488
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,813
All right, who sent you?

489
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,430
Well.

490
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,030
My cool line would be

491
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,490
destiny.

492
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,100
An even cooler line would be

493
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
get lost.

494
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:19,507
No.

495
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Destiny was cooler.

496
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:26,313
Will you stop following me?

497
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,458
I just wanna talk.

498
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:29,949
- I'm stuck in this boring family.
- I'm sorry.

499
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:32,431
I don't have time to cry for you,
I've got problems of my own.

500
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
What are you doing?

501
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,266
This is no time to be scoping out guys.

502
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,404
But Jacquelyn, that guy looks familiar.

503
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,289
To you, every guy looks familiar.

504
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,840
True or false, you're one of
those people who can't take a hint?

505
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,548
True, I am unrelentingly persistent
it's one of my better qualities.

506
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:55,015
Let me help you with your pack here.

507
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,686
- Give me that.
- Come on, it looks heavy.

508
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:57,711
- Let me help.
- No.

509
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:59,469
- If anyone needs help it's you.
- Wait.

510
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:01,021
- Now leave me alone.
- Look, I just...

511
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:04,060
You see,
I told you that guy looked familiar.

512
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:06,032
She wasn't a guy at all he was a she.

513
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:07,139
Will you just drive?

514
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,799
Great, this is just great.

515
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,692
- Drive.
- I am driving.

516
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:20,358
- She's getting away.
- No, we've got her.

517
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,402
Hop on.

518
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,715
Normally I don't take rides from strangers
but in this case I'll make an exception.

519
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,387
- They're moving. I'm going.
- Can't you even catch a bicycle?

520
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:32,226
- Go, go. They're going away.
- I'm going. I'm going.

521
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,193
Excuse me, coming through.

522
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Samantha.

523
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:49,724
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.

524
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:50,749
Move away.

525
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,736
Go. Get her.

526
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,184
Look out.

527
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,130
What the...

528
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:14,810
Don't you dare.

529
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:16,724
Come on. Come on.

530
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,583
Sorry I was so mean before,
I kind of have a lot of my mind.

531
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:22,334
Who are those girls? Why are they
after you? Why are you dressing up?

532
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,399
What are you?
The cub reporter for the daily planet?

533
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:26,417
- Just call me curious.
- Call me out of here.

534
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,390
Wait, wait a second.

535
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,886
- Well, thanks...
- Billy.

536
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:37,272
Sam.

537
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:47,652
Come here.

538
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:56,902
We're just about to start Meema.

539
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,668
Hi Meema.
How you doing?

540
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:00,693
Just perfect.

541
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:03,346
You keep me prisoner in the attic room

542
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:06,753
then once a year you parade
me out for all the relatives

543
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,107
in the hot sun hoping I'll kill over
and you can get the inheritance

544
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,490
Meema.

545
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,290
Can you say a thing like that?

546
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:18,028
When you're as old as I am you
can call them as you see them.

547
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,735
So don't mess with me.

548
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,213
OK. Bye.

549
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:28,420
He's not showing up,
I can't believe he's not showing up.

550
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,978
Just relax, will you?

551
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,338
It's bad for him to have a nervous
breakdown before the start of the race.

552
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,954
You're missing a teammate.

553
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:39,939
They still have to forfeit.

554
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:44,255
Your family.

555
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:47,348
- Give me that.
- Come back here.

556
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:51,188
It's such a shame Billy's not here.

557
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:52,908
Just like his father.

558
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:54,721
Never there when you need him.

559
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,367
Ready?

560
00:28:58,273 --> 00:28:59,273
On your Mark.

561
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,373
Get set.

562
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Go.

563
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,880
There is Billy.

564
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:13,047
Are you alright?

565
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,979
Jacquelyn, what do we do now?

566
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,330
We wait till she gets
off the bike, Raffiella.

567
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Good thinking.

568
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,396
God, I could go for a nice latte right now.

569
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
How about you?

570
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:30,342
What?

571
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:31,701
What?

572
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,421
Look who's here.

573
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:38,754
Where were you?

574
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,873
I was practicing my pedaling technique.

575
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:43,580
Who's the ornament?

576
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,506
This? This is a...

577
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,264
cousin Bernice.

578
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,582
That's Bernice?

579
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,729
Aunt Patricia's Bernice?

580
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:52,186
She filled out.

581
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,949
Well, California will do that for you.

582
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:57,460
Hi everyone, mom says to say hi.

583
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,027
Let's go.

584
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,096
Just a word of advice.

585
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,983
If you want to win a race

586
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,809
don't pick up any passengers.

587
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:26,993
And you are?

588
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:28,349
I'm Bernice.

589
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,630
You remember

590
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:30,796
Aunt Patricia's daughter.

591
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,230
If you're Bernice.

592
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,530
I'm Michael Jackson.

593
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:34,732
Really?

594
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,816
Where's Lisa Marie?

595
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,089
She filled out in California.

596
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:40,114
Yeah.

597
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,659
Also had some major
plastic surgery on her face.

598
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:45,359
Well, you would know about that Michael.

599
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:47,644
By the way, I loved "Thriller".

600
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,234
She loved "Thriller". Bye Mike.

601
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:57,121
Sweetheart, are you okay?

602
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,704
Do you need anything? Some water?

603
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,149
CPR?

604
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:01,174
All of the above.

605
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,942
Some of these people's been
training for this for months.

606
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,468
I must be out of my mind.

607
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:08,279
I know sweetie that's why I love you.

608
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:09,304
Not to close.

609
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,831
My stomach's a little unsettled.

610
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:16,769
We were supposed to let them win,
remember? Build their confidence.

611
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:19,270
Yeah, but not on the first event.
It's too obvious.

612
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,329
I know how you hate to lose but if we don't

613
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:24,161
we are never going to get away with this.

614
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:31,460
15 serving lot.

615
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,505
Hell of a birthday.

616
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:45,258
Watching the stinking
ball bounce back and forth.

617
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:49,824
What mental midget
thought I would like this?

618
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,010
40 lot.

619
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:55,943
That mouth of hers is the reason
my father died a young man.

620
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,370
I heard that Joe.

621
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:01,734
She hears everything.

622
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,921
Who says your senses are supposed to fade?
Mine are getting better.

623
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,374
I think I broke it.

624
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,472
Well, it's not broken but
you're gonna have to stay off it.

625
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:30,617
Hi.
I'm Dale Jameson, tennis pro.

626
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:32,044
You're a Jameson?

627
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:33,668
Asked my father.

628
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:35,044
Hello son.

629
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,234
But you're not weird.

630
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:38,303
I mean, you're normal.

631
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:40,597
Thanks, my father says
I'm a freak of nature.

632
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,464
Well, let's hear for the freaks.

633
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,637
Gee, that is a bad break.

634
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,896
Not that I wish anything

635
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:54,629
broke, you know.

636
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:58,929
It must be wonderful to have a
completely inappropriate way with words.

637
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:01,068
There goes your partner.

638
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,828
Looks like another loss.

639
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:04,269
Loser.

640
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:06,940
Even though you lost 15, love.

641
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,014
Love will keep us together.

642
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:12,837
I'll take her place.

643
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:14,750
Who's she with my man?

644
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,704
She claims she is Bernice.

645
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:18,664
You play?

646
00:33:18,774 --> 00:33:21,484
I blow the ball back and
forth before on the coast.

647
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:24,697
Okay.

648
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,704
Your serve.

649
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:27,964
Play tough.

650
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:32,164
I hope you know what you're doing.

651
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:33,189
Just give me the ball.

652
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,729
She wasn't just good.

653
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,764
She was grand slam material.

654
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:51,849
I think you've done a
little more than a lot.

655
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,715
I will rip those freckles
off your face one by one.

656
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,376
I got it covered.

657
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:01,901
And she slammed into oblivion.

658
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:02,926
Boom.

659
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,647
Boom.

660
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
What happened?

661
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:09,534
Boom.

662
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,480
Game set. Match.

663
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,366
Alright.

664
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,246
Billy.

665
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:23,232
We did it. Thank you.

666
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:24,690
No problem, cousin.

667
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,383
Welcome to the family.

668
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,408
Thanks.

669
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:33,509
Do you have to make it look so damn bad?

670
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,173
This is a good thing, all right?

671
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:37,335
That puts Kevin Dooley

672
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,487
and Margaret Dooley McKenna
at an exact tie.

673
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,049
Now the winner of the sudden death game

674
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:46,805
will determine the winner of
the Dooley family Olympics.

675
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,780
So proud of you. You did a great
job throwing the 100 meter swim.

676
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,356
And losing the full-court basketball.

677
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,198
Now, go in there for the kill.

678
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,143
How are you?

679
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:06,204
Pretty lucky so far.

680
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,220
Luck had nothing to do with it.

681
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:09,407
Pure skill.

682
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,414
You think you got a shot of winning this?

683
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:13,144
I don't think. I know.

684
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,704
Scared to make a little wager?

685
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:16,784
How much?

686
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,072
Not money, just a..

687
00:35:19,314 --> 00:35:20,830
Friendly bet, you know,

688
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:21,855
for

689
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,264
let's see, let's say...

690
00:35:26,364 --> 00:35:28,517
loser takes Meema home.

691
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:32,577
You're wagering my
grandmother on a volleyball game?

692
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,983
It's just what I thought,
choking the clutch.

693
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,396
Wait a minute. I never choke.

694
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:41,794
You're on.

695
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,054
Fine.

696
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,847
Did you hear that?

697
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:49,566
They're betting on me.

698
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,457
I didn't hear anything.

699
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,854
Swear I can hear what people
are saying the other side of town.

700
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,663
Okay, dad

701
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,811
plan your position and
this time keep your head up.

702
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:01,847
Don't worry Billy,
this time we're gonna kill them.

703
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:02,872
- Yes.
- Yes.

704
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:05,504
Really good to know you guys
aren't taking this thing too serious.

705
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:06,645
- Of course not. Yes.
- Yes.

706
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,670
Kill them.

707
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:17,776
Billy. Billy.

708
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:21,242
All right, it's okay. All right.

709
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,259
Now, you're probably too
young to remember this

710
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,344
but I used to babysit
you when you were young

711
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,644
You did?

712
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:30,694
Sure.

713
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:34,020
I'd rock you in my arms
and you'd drool on my dress.

714
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:37,526
Well, you know, I still have
a slight drooling problem.

715
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,518
Guess what, so do I.

716
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,163
Star.

717
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,656
I can't stand this.
It's just like last year.

718
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,349
It's better than last year,
nobody got hit in the head yet.

719
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:28,648
Star.

720
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,341
Can we just grab her
now and get out of here?

721
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:38,815
All of these tourists give me the creeps.

722
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,324
No.

723
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:42,824
We have to wait until
the tourists are gone.

724
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:44,604
Then we take her.

725
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:58,259
Star.

726
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:00,937
Poor Kevin.

727
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,925
He's going to be so
upset if he loses again.

728
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:07,443
Why do you people put
yourselves through this craziness?

729
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:09,310
Because we're Dooley’s.

730
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:10,414
You know that.

731
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:11,844
Yeah.

732
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:12,869
Right.

733
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,070
Go boys.

734
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,183
- Out.
- Yes.

735
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,883
It's good. It's a good game.

736
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,750
Come on guys, we're almost there,
hang in there.

737
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:35,839
Show no mercy.

738
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,557
- Win.
- Win.

739
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:38,906
- Win.
- Win!

740
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,240
This was my moment.

741
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:51,265
I knew it.

742
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,451
Everyone knew it.

743
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:08,299
Yes.

744
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,493
- I did it
- You did it.

745
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,210
How can you do that?

746
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,787
It's one thing about fantasy

747
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:24,540
they always come back to reality.

748
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,092
Winner McKennas.

749
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,052
Loser.

750
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:49,692
Yes.

751
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:52,235
I don't believe it.

752
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:54,101
How could you miss that shot?

753
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,412
Take it easy Kevin.
You've missed plenty of shots.

754
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,052
Not a shot like that.

755
00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:00,079
You completely lost concentration.

756
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:01,809
Dad, I'm sorry.

757
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,043
I don't believe it.

758
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,563
Honey, it's just a game.

759
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,223
Billy, he doesn't mean it, he's just...

760
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:09,668
No, he's right I...

761
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,539
I blew it again.

762
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,397
No, you didn't honey.

763
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:16,958
Yeah.

764
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:19,049
You win some, you lose some.

765
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:21,113
And you lost this one buddy.

766
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:22,138
But, you know what?

767
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:25,877
You did win yourself a
lovely consolation prize.

768
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,310
You can pick her up tonight

769
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,875
right after the birthday cake.

770
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:32,464
Well brother.

771
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,140
She drove mom and dad crazy for years and

772
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,520
I did my time.

773
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:38,005
Now it's your turn.

774
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:39,031
Good luck.

775
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,124
They don't want me

776
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:43,804
I don't want them.

777
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:46,884
What was that all about?

778
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:49,742
Well, I...

779
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:51,832
made a bet.

780
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,834
Meema's going to come to live with us.

781
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Good.

782
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:03,305
We could take much better
care of her than they could.

783
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:09,936
Now, go talk to Billy.

784
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:11,432
Thanks.

785
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:13,136
I don't know how you put up with me.

786
00:41:13,364 --> 00:41:14,597
That makes two of us.

787
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:15,622
Go.

788
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,480
You can imagine how
I felt at this moment.

789
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,822
And the last thing I needed
was Mark Jr. in my face.

790
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:25,346
Nice going.

791
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:26,946
Loser.

792
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:33,153
Dead.

793
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:34,931
Come on, break it up.

794
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:35,956
Break it up.

795
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,631
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

796
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:46,418
Billy.

797
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:48,525
Look, about the game I was

798
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,676
- completely out of...
- I don't want to hear it, dad.

799
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,443
I just don't want to hear it.

800
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:53,975
Billy.

801
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:18,727
I know it probably doesn't do any
good to say I know how you feel.

802
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,426
I know how you feel.

803
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,441
When I got into into cheerleading.

804
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,260
My dad was really proud of me.

805
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:30,633
On the night of the championship game,
he was there on the stands.

806
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:34,125
We're doing this cheer where
you have to spin around in a circle.

807
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:36,929
And I hear the crowd starting to laugh

808
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,934
and, you know,
I don't pay any attention to them.

809
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:43,533
Until I realized the safety pin
holding up my skirt had come undone.

810
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:47,192
I looked down,
I'm doing a high kick in my underwear.

811
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:49,964
Most humiliating
moment of my entire life.

812
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:53,424
I look up in the stands and

813
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:54,449
my dad's up there

814
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:55,474
flipping out

815
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,611
totally freaked.

816
00:42:57,582 --> 00:42:58,582
So what happened?

817
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:00,259
Nothing.

818
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,502
When dad was mad at me
he never said anything.

819
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:05,158
I wish he would have yelled
or said something, anything.

820
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:07,722
When he died.

821
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:09,712
I was the one that was mad.

822
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:13,464
There are so many
things I wanted to tell him

823
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,731
and so many things I know
he wanted to tell me.

824
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,392
Kevin.

825
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,852
- Kevin.
- Don't race.

826
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:48,515
I've learned one great lesson.

827
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,622
After 40 years of living with a Dooley man.

828
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:55,140
They need stewing time.

829
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:57,726
So let them stew.

830
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,915
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

831
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:16,041
Like father like son.
Like son like father.

832
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,725
Like father like son.

833
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,362
The family's been here for 400 years.

834
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:26,132
And they keep passing down the
same legacy of pride and stupidity.

835
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,962
And not necessarily in that order.

836
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:34,925
It's like an endless
marathon on a vicious cycle.

837
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:38,782
Yeah, and it's high time Joe
and Kevin got off their bikes.

838
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:43,552
Is this wishful thinking?

839
00:44:44,122 --> 00:44:45,770
Or, do you have plan?

840
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:47,968
Honey, I always have a plan.

841
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,055
Yeah.

842
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,075
Billy, come and play with us.

843
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:57,355
I can't today, I'm booked. Sorry.

844
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:02,840
Billy.
I can't stand that girl.

845
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:05,115
Billy, want to go find some red ants?

846
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,453
I can't. I did that yesterday.

847
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:09,115
Billy, want to catch?

848
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,595
I can't. My tendons are weaken.

849
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,018
Are they your cousins?

850
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,406
Yeah, don't make eye contact.

851
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:17,577
Let go of her.

852
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:19,962
- Time to go home sister.
- Is your sister?

853
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:20,987
Step sisters.

854
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:22,400
I'm not going anywhere with you.

855
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:24,452
Look.

856
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:26,212
Billy's in trouble.

857
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:27,979
- Get away.
- Come on.

858
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:34,479
I'm not letting any more chicks
come between me and my man.

859
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,539
Get them!

860
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:36,598
Yeah!

861
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:52,465
Thanks Greg.

862
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,503
You think they'll be okay?

863
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:03,045
Who? The kids or my evil stepsisters?

864
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:05,972
So.

865
00:46:06,142 --> 00:46:07,334
Why are they after you?

866
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,265
When my dad died.

867
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:12,112
My stepmother did this
whole Cinderella thing.

868
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:13,527
Suddenly I'm like

869
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:16,332
in the attic talking to mice and
they're going to the prince concerts.

870
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:18,182
So, you ran away?

871
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:20,487
I do it like every other week.

872
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:21,512
They always find me.

873
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:23,102
I ran away once.

874
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:24,482
When I was five

875
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,155
I got all the way to the corner

876
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,835
and I realized I wasn't
allowed to cross the street.

877
00:46:29,556 --> 00:46:31,955
So I did what any sensible
five-year-old would do, I...

878
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,943
turn around and went right back home.

879
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:35,544
You're lucky.

880
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,199
If I have your family.

881
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,433
I wouldn't go anywhere either.

882
00:46:40,805 --> 00:46:42,325
I'll tell you, if I was gonna run away

883
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:45,205
this would be the day to do it.

884
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:47,918
See what a bad influence I am on you.

885
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
No. No.

886
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:50,525
It's not you.

887
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,738
Trust me, it's not your problem it's mine.

888
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:07,304
Doing really well for someone
who thought her ankle was broken.

889
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:11,191
You healed it, your magic touch.

890
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,875
Billy.

891
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:15,895
Billy, may I cut in?

892
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,481
I'm not dancing Amber.

893
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:19,046
But if you do dance.

894
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:20,528
Be warned, I'm cutting in.

895
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:22,037
Can I talk to you son?

896
00:47:22,062 --> 00:47:23,062
Excuse us Bernice.

897
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:26,675
Back off Jezebel.

898
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:30,788
I'm really sorry about what
I said about you this afternoon.

899
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:31,922
You played a great game.

900
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:34,595
No, I didn't. I sucked. Don't patronize me.

901
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,846
Well, allow me to make my case.

902
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:37,871
Don't bother.

903
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:39,911
Guilty as charge counselor.

904
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,139
I take it that didn't go too well.

905
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:51,806
No, he's furious with me

906
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,152
after I blamed him.

907
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:55,897
Just have to figure
out a way to talk to him.

908
00:47:56,997 --> 00:47:59,630
Why don't you start by
practicing on your father?

909
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:06,772
Now Joe.

910
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,752
Talk to your son.

911
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:17,322
You know what?

912
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,700
What?

913
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,188
You're getting a little thin up there.

914
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,333
Well, you're pretty sparse yourself.

915
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,078
That's it I'm getting out of here.

916
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:32,799
I think we'd better switch to plan B.

917
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:53,422
Everything all right Meema?

918
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:54,952
The best.

919
00:48:55,948 --> 00:49:00,736
How could it be otherwise?
You can just feel the love in this room.

920
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,234
Good, because we going to start now.

921
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:12,122
I'm gonna start now too.

922
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:14,641
Settle down everyone.

923
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:18,394
Kids quiet.

924
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:20,568
The first point of business

925
00:49:20,593 --> 00:49:21,593
is to present

926
00:49:21,622 --> 00:49:22,622
the trophy

927
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:25,328
to the winner of this
year's family Olympics

928
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,353
Margaret,

929
00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:28,058
Mark and Mark Jr.

930
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,083
Come on up.

931
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:41,212
On behalf of Mark and Mark Jr. we want
to thank you. We owe you all a great deal.

932
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:43,072
Because if you hadn't lost

933
00:49:43,582 --> 00:49:44,582
we couldn't have won.

934
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:49,044
It's hard to believe you're
from the same family.

935
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:50,122
No, it isn't.

936
00:49:59,152 --> 00:50:01,791
And now let's bring up
grandpa Joe and grandma Dotty.

937
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:03,719
Come on.

938
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:20,005
Now, let's cut through it.

939
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:22,711
You all know why you came here tonight.

940
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,152
To honor my mother.

941
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:27,028
Who, in one way or another,
is related to all of you.

942
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:30,618
I can't make a great speech but I
don't make great speeches off the cuff.

943
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:31,862
So.

944
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,125
I wrote something down.

945
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:37,282
M is for the many years
you've been on this planet.

946
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:42,978
O is for other people your
age who are no longer with us.

947
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:48,280
T is for time which
somehow you have beaten.

948
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:51,424
H is for your health

949
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:54,687
which is a constant amazement to me.

950
00:50:57,774 --> 00:50:59,684
E is for your energy

951
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:01,749
which is more than people

952
00:51:01,774 --> 00:51:04,430
Are you sure that she's
got all her bags packed?

953
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,367
R is for reinforces.

954
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:07,392
Where is she?

955
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:10,005
Don't need to worry.
She's sitting right over there.

956
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:11,864
Have another look.

957
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:13,384
for another 100 years.

958
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,374
What would you expect? Shakespeare?

959
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,449
And now is the perfect time

960
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:23,844
for all of us to sing.

961
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,196
All right.

962
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,914
You bring out the cake.

963
00:51:27,857 --> 00:51:29,910
All right everybody.

964
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:33,163
For she's a jolly good Meema.

965
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:35,594
For she's a jolly good Meema.

966
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,620
For she's a jolly good Meema.

967
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:43,207
Happy birthday to you.

968
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:44,445
Again everybody.

969
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,096
Could you bring that cake up?

970
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,983
For she's a jolly good Meema.

971
00:51:50,008 --> 00:51:51,008
She's gone.

972
00:51:52,744 --> 00:51:54,047
Meema is gone.

973
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:56,352
Joe. Where is she Joe?

974
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:58,784
How could they lose a 100 year old woman?

975
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:00,091
Good question.

976
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:07,540
Okay folks, we're about to
take our special sunset flight.

977
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,913
Let's go before the sun goes down,
and remember.

978
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,704
Safety first and foremost.

979
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:14,478
It's the most important
thing no matter what.

980
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,199
I always wanted to take a
ride in one of those things.

981
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:19,497
Sorry ma'am, but this balloon's
already been chartered.

982
00:52:19,522 --> 00:52:21,242
For more than this?

983
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,750
Hop on.

984
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,242
You folks next, okay?
I'll get to you next please.

985
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,906
Backup. Okay, here we go.

986
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:31,574
There you go.

987
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:32,667
Watch your step.

988
00:52:33,013 --> 00:52:34,013
All right.

989
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:36,030
Okay, give me a minute
and let me untie these, OK?

990
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:37,055
OK.

991
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,137
What happens if a I pull this?

992
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:40,597
The balloon goes down.

993
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:42,962
And this?

994
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:44,502
It goes up.

995
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,195
That's all I needed to know.

996
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:49,017
Don't. My god.

997
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:51,004
No, I'm gonna search for this.

998
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:52,729
Lady don't.

999
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:53,962
We're talking fun.

1000
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:55,489
No.

1001
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:01,805
We gotta find her.

1002
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:03,084
Meema.

1003
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:05,144
People, let's not lose our heads now.

1004
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:08,249
We have to stay together, I know
what I'm talking about I was in the army.

1005
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:09,274
Enough.

1006
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,162
Mark give it up, all right?

1007
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:14,879
Why are we running?

1008
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:16,652
I thought we wanted to get rid of her.

1009
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:17,930
Not like this.

1010
00:53:18,837 --> 00:53:19,837
Don't you have eyes?

1011
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,103
Well, we see them now mother.

1012
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:23,901
Do I have to come down there myself?
Can't you do a simple kidnapping?

1013
00:53:23,926 --> 00:53:24,994
We've been trying.

1014
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:26,119
So, what's the problem?

1015
00:53:26,144 --> 00:53:28,312
She's claiming to be these
people's long-lost cousin

1016
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:29,613
We just can't get to her.

1017
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:30,866
That lying little brat.

1018
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:32,164
All of her relatives are dead.

1019
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:33,189
And if they weren't.

1020
00:53:33,214 --> 00:53:34,214
Ladies.

1021
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:35,239
Ladies?

1022
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:36,617
I think I might be able to help.

1023
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:39,004
- One of her dead relatives?
- No, I don't know who that is.

1024
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:40,269
Well, find out.

1025
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:41,745
- Who are you?
- Yeah.

1026
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:43,437
The family's Dooley.

1027
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:44,522
Dooley?

1028
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:46,600
And I'd turn my own mother in for a price.

1029
00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:50,052
Okay.

1030
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:51,958
I'll take the back nine,
you take the clubhouse.

1031
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Billy.

1032
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,490
I'm really enjoying being a Dooley.

1033
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,004
Meema.

1034
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:04,504
Meema.

1035
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:07,582
Meema.

1036
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,609
I heard you.

1037
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:12,544
Why does everybody have to scream?

1038
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,014
When they want to talk to me.

1039
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,159
Meema?

1040
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,123
Where are you?

1041
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:22,354
Right in front of your face.

1042
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,010
What are you doing?

1043
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,864
I had to wait almost 100
years to have this much fun.

1044
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,024
Fortunately, you don't have to.

1045
00:54:34,414 --> 00:54:35,464
Come on, get in.

1046
00:54:36,844 --> 00:54:38,935
I can't.
People are looking all over for you.

1047
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,837
I'm going to get you back
to the banquet Meema.

1048
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:42,862
Meema.

1049
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:47,862
Hop, hop and away.

1050
00:54:48,815 --> 00:54:50,295
So long suckers.

1051
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:53,111
I suddenly knew what Dorothy felt like

1052
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:55,402
but I was in no mood to take a trip to Oz.

1053
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,341
Did you find him?

1054
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:05,487
He's not anywhere.

1055
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:07,858
I left him alone for two minutes.

1056
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:10,398
Well, he's a big boy.

1057
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,195
He can take care of himself.

1058
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:15,134
I'm calling the cops.

1059
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:16,719
Wait a minute just

1060
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:18,172
calm down for a moment, will you?

1061
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:20,464
I'm lieutenant Jameson,
the house detective.

1062
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:24,084
And I have complete confidence
that I can bring this woman back.

1063
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:25,364
In one piece.

1064
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:27,544
But my son is missing also.

1065
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:29,575
All right then,
I'll bring them back in two pieces.

1066
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:33,055
And what makes you so
sure you can find anybody?

1067
00:55:34,954 --> 00:55:36,708
Well, I haven't lost a guest yet.

1068
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:37,899
No, untrue.

1069
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,610
There was one but he wasn't a guest.

1070
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,415
He was a magician

1071
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,788
and he was playing the luau lounge.

1072
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:45,224
Well.

1073
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:46,527
It's too bad.

1074
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,189
It would have been a great trick.

1075
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,924
Why am I not comforted by this?

1076
00:55:50,524 --> 00:55:52,457
Honey, I'm sure he's going to be okay.

1077
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,784
Don't worry. Look.

1078
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,204
The best thing you can do

1079
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:57,544
is just get some sleep, relax

1080
00:55:57,904 --> 00:55:59,224
and let the professionals

1081
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:00,674
do our thing.

1082
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:15,799
Where are you going?

1083
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:18,204
I'm certainly not going to
wait for lieutenant dumbo here.

1084
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:19,617
I'm looking for Meema myself.

1085
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:20,721
Where?

1086
00:56:20,746 --> 00:56:21,746
Everywhere.

1087
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:25,248
If anything happens to Meema.

1088
00:56:25,974 --> 00:56:27,268
I'll never forgive you.

1089
00:56:27,664 --> 00:56:28,664
Me?

1090
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:30,613
You wanted to get rid
of her as much as I did.

1091
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:33,000
I wanted her to move in with Kevin.

1092
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:36,454
I didn't want her to become an
episode of Unsolved Mysteries.

1093
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:40,484
Are you going to stand there?
Or are you coming?

1094
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:41,509
I'm coming.

1095
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,838
You heard your mother.

1096
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,772
- Wait. What's going on?
- I can't talk.

1097
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:54,230
- Move it Mark.
- Get out of here.

1098
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,524
That was the best night of my life

1099
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,900
and the dawn

1100
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,041
those colors.

1101
00:57:05,104 --> 00:57:06,984
I could stay up here forever.

1102
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,717
Yeah, me too.

1103
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:11,389
But, don't you think we
should be getting back?

1104
00:57:11,413 --> 00:57:12,513
Back to what?

1105
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:14,930
A bunch of loudmouth blowhards

1106
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,804
who only think about themselves.

1107
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:18,772
This is what it's all about.

1108
00:57:18,797 --> 00:57:21,604
Flying high free as a pelican.

1109
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:24,903
Well, even pelicans have to eat.

1110
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:26,199
I'm starving.

1111
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:28,034
Well, why didn't you say so?

1112
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:30,483
Breakfast is being served.

1113
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,349
How do you like your chocolate?

1114
00:57:33,374 --> 00:57:34,789
Light or dark?

1115
00:57:36,214 --> 00:57:37,214
Yes.

1116
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:38,301
Thank you.

1117
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,014
Good news people, we know where they are.

1118
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:48,481
Spit it out.

1119
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,250
They're a couple of
thousand feet up in the air.

1120
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,100
Wait, what are you talking about?

1121
00:57:53,524 --> 00:57:55,608
Well, according to our cabana boy.

1122
00:57:55,633 --> 00:57:56,633
Raoul.

1123
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:01,298
A hot air balloon

1124
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:06,334
was hijacked yesterday by a woman answering
to the description of your grandmother.

1125
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:08,434
Who later abducted

1126
00:58:08,627 --> 00:58:12,514
a teenage boy on the 14th Fairway,
isn't that right Raoul?

1127
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,407
Well.

1128
00:58:15,432 --> 00:58:16,472
At least they're together.

1129
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,559
Yeah, that's true.

1130
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:20,404
I don't know whether
that's a blessing or a curse.

1131
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:21,940
Well, which way were they going?

1132
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,311
Due west.

1133
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,638
I'm gonna wait here in
case they come back here.

1134
00:58:29,663 --> 00:58:30,743
Don't worry, I'll find her.

1135
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,141
- Be careful.
- OK.

1136
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:34,508
Kevin. Kevin.

1137
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:36,194
You got room for another passenger?

1138
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:38,254
- Sure mom, come on.
- Not me.

1139
00:58:39,956 --> 00:58:40,956
Him.

1140
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:45,034
I don't want to hear a word, I mean it.

1141
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,523
Now, you get in there.

1142
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:08,074
How did you get him to do that?

1143
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,444
My usual threat.

1144
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:11,894
Which is?

1145
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:13,767
He does what I tell him

1146
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:16,978
or I stopped programming the VCR for him.

1147
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:29,941
Bernice.

1148
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:32,389
Why don't you come with me honey?

1149
00:59:32,414 --> 00:59:34,476
- I could sure use the help.
- I'd love to.

1150
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:35,624
Come on, hop in.

1151
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:38,234
Seat belt on.

1152
00:59:51,124 --> 00:59:52,924
Was that a breakfast or what?

1153
00:59:53,884 --> 00:59:55,819
Definitely the breakfast of champions.

1154
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:57,754
When I was a kid

1155
00:59:58,517 --> 01:00:00,990
I used to eat by weight in candy.

1156
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:04,354
In fact I ate my weight in everything.

1157
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,207
The word junk food
hadn't been invented yet.

1158
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:08,684
A good thing too.

1159
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:10,714
Because that's all I ever ate.

1160
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:12,824
Between you and me.

1161
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:16,864
I raid Margaret freezer every
night just to get out the ice cream

1162
01:00:17,854 --> 01:00:20,587
and everybody always blames Mark Jr.

1163
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,854
Why don't you just tell him it's you?

1164
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:25,315
Why?

1165
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,553
I like to see that kid squirm.

1166
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,574
And then everybody
gets into a big argument.

1167
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,624
You enjoy watching them fight?

1168
01:00:35,957 --> 01:00:38,950
Well, if they didn't fight
they'd never talk to each other.

1169
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:41,696
I'm just helping them communicate.

1170
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:42,786
You see Billy

1171
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:44,371
all those people down there

1172
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:45,720
every one of them

1173
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:47,994
has problems with their families

1174
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,215
that drives them up the wall

1175
01:00:50,725 --> 01:00:52,745
and it all gets so important,

1176
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,785
they forget what really is.

1177
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,130
So that's why you have to
eat all the ice cream you can

1178
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,141
while you can still
sink your teeth into it.

1179
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:02,835
I think you're trying to tell me
something, aren't you Meema?

1180
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:04,214
No.

1181
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,700
If I wanted to say something direct.

1182
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:08,762
I'd say talk to your father.

1183
01:01:09,425 --> 01:01:11,872
Like your father should talk to his father

1184
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:13,865
and his father should talk to me.

1185
01:01:14,372 --> 01:01:18,270
But if I talk direct to anybody,
do you think they'd listen to me?

1186
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:19,295
No.

1187
01:01:20,072 --> 01:01:22,472
It's a lot more fun just
stealing their ice cream.

1188
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:25,392
Say. Look at that.

1189
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,292
Everybody's naked.

1190
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:29,703
It's a nudist colony.

1191
01:01:30,452 --> 01:01:31,452
Let's buzz them.

1192
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:37,662
Take a right up there.

1193
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:41,791
Why?

1194
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:43,152
We don't know where we're going.

1195
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:45,789
My instinct says take a right.

1196
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:48,528
Yeah, but your instinct could be wrong.

1197
01:01:48,553 --> 01:01:49,658
But it could be right.

1198
01:01:50,178 --> 01:01:51,992
Why are you so afraid of making a mistake?

1199
01:01:52,468 --> 01:01:54,557
You just want to go in
the direction you're going in

1200
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:56,321
because that's the
direction you're going in.

1201
01:01:57,216 --> 01:02:00,151
No dad, I'm not afraid
to go in another direction.

1202
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:02,622
Right and take half my clients with you.

1203
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:05,107
Look, when I left the
practice I didn't take anybody.

1204
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:08,762
They chose to come with me,
you were the one who was afraid to change.

1205
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:10,707
All right, so I'm not afraid anymore.

1206
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:11,732
Okay?

1207
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:14,987
Wait a minute.

1208
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,488
Are you admitting you were wrong?

1209
01:02:18,962 --> 01:02:20,268
Will you make a right?

1210
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:21,406
Please.

1211
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,886
Look, it's her.

1212
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:35,439
Where is she going?

1213
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:36,825
What am I? A mind reader?

1214
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:37,850
Follow her.

1215
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,702
Aunt Kate,
do you mind if I change the radio?

1216
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:47,356
Go ahead dear.

1217
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:50,937
I love rap.

1218
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:52,332
You're kidding, right?

1219
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:55,670
Well, not at all.
I like the beat and the social commentary.

1220
01:02:56,283 --> 01:02:57,283
You know aunt Kate.

1221
01:02:57,308 --> 01:02:58,308
You're really cool.

1222
01:02:58,333 --> 01:02:59,333
No.

1223
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,358
I'm fresh.

1224
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:03,692
If you're gonna walk the
walk you got to talk the talk.

1225
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,368
Are you down with that?

1226
01:03:06,393 --> 01:03:07,393
You bet.

1227
01:03:13,566 --> 01:03:14,566
What is it?

1228
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:16,376
Nothing.

1229
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,967
Aunt Kate, do you think I could drive?

1230
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:20,914
You know, I have my learner's permit
but my mom never has time to take me.

1231
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:22,184
I don't see why not.

1232
01:03:22,411 --> 01:03:23,411
Thanks.

1233
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:26,417
She's pulling over.

1234
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:27,792
I can see that.

1235
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:33,221
- What is she doing?
- What does it look like they're doing?

1236
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,286
Well, it looks like she's
going to go out and drive

1237
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,197
and then the older
woman is going to get into...

1238
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:38,737
Follow her.

1239
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:40,562
Okay. Okay.

1240
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:47,962
Teacher, this is driver's education.

1241
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:52,708
Look.

1242
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:54,068
Everyone's going the other way.

1243
01:04:04,232 --> 01:04:05,719
What do we do now?

1244
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,672
What do I look like? The auto club?

1245
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:10,231
Get out of the car.

1246
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:13,047
No.

1247
01:04:17,009 --> 01:04:18,009
Witch.

1248
01:04:20,252 --> 01:04:21,252
Not bad?

1249
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:23,962
Not bad at all.

1250
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:25,641
I wouldn't get so excited.

1251
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:28,988
Another few years and
gravity will attack them too.

1252
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:32,444
It'll take a forklift to keep their
butts from hitting the ground.

1253
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,795
Meema, speaking of gravity
I think we got a problem here.

1254
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:36,762
We're out of gas.

1255
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:38,497
- Look, there they are.
- Where?

1256
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:39,522
Over there.

1257
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:40,547
Look.

1258
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,610
Sam, we got a break-in.

1259
01:05:01,842 --> 01:05:03,242
People wearing clothes.

1260
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,223
That's right, I repeat,
people wearing clothes.

1261
01:05:09,382 --> 01:05:12,661
Nothing brings a family closer
together than a stint in the big house.

1262
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:13,686
In fact,

1263
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:17,161
this is the most time any of us had
spent together in one place in years.

1264
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:22,076
Let us out of here, you dirty rats.

1265
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:25,349
I've always wanted to be able to say that.

1266
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:28,154
I'm thrilled that somebody's
having a good time.

1267
01:05:30,415 --> 01:05:31,828
A nudist colony.

1268
01:05:32,288 --> 01:05:33,834
I've never seen so many...

1269
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:35,334
Neither have I.

1270
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:36,912
Well, I hope not young lady.

1271
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:39,185
What's the matter with you?

1272
01:05:39,632 --> 01:05:42,919
Bodies are beautiful no
matter what shape they're in.

1273
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:45,665
Considering the last time I worked out was

1274
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,690
1952

1275
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:49,116
I have to say that.

1276
01:05:52,802 --> 01:05:56,372
How about some grub back here,
this place isn't fit for dogs.

1277
01:05:57,175 --> 01:05:58,175
Jeez lady.

1278
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,455
Put a lid on it.

1279
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:01,661
We didn't get any sleep last night.

1280
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:05,492
You shouldn't be sleeping,
you should be working on a jailbreak plan.

1281
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:08,781
I want to hear shovels digging a tunnel.

1282
01:06:09,055 --> 01:06:10,055
Let's go.

1283
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:13,321
Maybe someone give
us a cake with a file in it.

1284
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:14,940
You think this is funny?

1285
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:17,358
I want to go to law school, pal.

1286
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:19,665
This might go on my permanent record.

1287
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:24,669
How depressed will I be when the
world is deprived of one less slimy lawyer.

1288
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:28,262
Wise guy, this whole thing is your fault.

1289
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,552
- His fault?
- Yeah.

1290
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:32,556
- How is it his fault?
- Because he encouraged her.

1291
01:06:32,581 --> 01:06:35,627
He went along for the ride instead
of trying to talk some sense into her.

1292
01:06:35,652 --> 01:06:37,754
Have you tried talking sense to Meema?

1293
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:39,587
Don't mouth off to me.

1294
01:06:39,612 --> 01:06:40,662
That's right.

1295
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:42,778
Who said sense is such a good thing?

1296
01:06:42,803 --> 01:06:44,723
Well, he just should
have stopped it, that's all.

1297
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:47,289
Look dad, things happen all right.

1298
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:49,622
Somebody isn't always to blame.

1299
01:06:50,192 --> 01:06:52,682
He try so hard to control everybody.

1300
01:06:53,012 --> 01:06:55,272
Instead of just seeing who they are

1301
01:06:55,498 --> 01:06:57,482
and just loving them for it.

1302
01:06:57,784 --> 01:06:59,478
Look, don't lecture me, all right?

1303
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,784
Well, somebody's gotta talk to you.

1304
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:06,872
Just because people don't
do what you want them to do.

1305
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:08,868
Doesn't mean they're wrong.

1306
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:11,004
It just means they're...

1307
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,861
people.

1308
01:07:25,745 --> 01:07:26,745
Thanks dad.

1309
01:07:27,038 --> 01:07:28,438
No, thank you.

1310
01:07:29,104 --> 01:07:31,211
Sometimes a father can learn from his son.

1311
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,530
Why don't you just kiss
him and get it over with?

1312
01:07:36,945 --> 01:07:38,185
And you too Joe.

1313
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,763
Get your butt off that
bunk and get in there.

1314
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:43,043
Alright, the old lady's got a point but

1315
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:45,938
I don't want anyone kissing me.

1316
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:48,678
Come on, plant one right here buddy.

1317
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:50,264
Yeah.

1318
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:53,171
All right Dooley’s.

1319
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,075
Come on out, you made bail.

1320
01:07:57,315 --> 01:07:58,315
Too bad.

1321
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:01,515
I was really hoping for a dramatic escape.

1322
01:08:11,432 --> 01:08:13,205
- We made it.
- Thank you brother.

1323
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:14,518
Thank you.

1324
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:18,370
I'm gonna take a nice hot shower.

1325
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:22,371
Look, I just want you all to know I do
expect to be reimbursed for the bail, OK?

1326
01:08:22,803 --> 01:08:26,053
Because trust me, the money I put up we
could have bought our own hot air balloon.

1327
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:27,536
Well, that's great.

1328
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:30,221
We're checking out,
I'll get your mother's stuff for you.

1329
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:33,181
Well, hurry up.
Because we're out of here too.

1330
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:37,317
What's your hurry?

1331
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:40,611
Nobody goes anywhere
till I get my birthday cake.

1332
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:44,305
M is for the many years
you've been on this planet.

1333
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:48,317
O is for other people

1334
01:08:48,577 --> 01:08:49,577
your age

1335
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:51,512
who are no longer with us.

1336
01:08:53,105 --> 01:08:55,152
I'm really having a deja vu here.

1337
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:56,525
Trust me, you're not alone.

1338
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:59,845
T is for time which somehow

1339
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,076
you have beaten.

1340
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:04,134
H is for your health

1341
01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:07,187
- which is a constant amazement to me.
- How do they do it?

1342
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:09,938
When do they breathe?

1343
01:09:09,963 --> 01:09:11,883
E is for your energy

1344
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:14,943
which is more than
people half your age have.

1345
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,773
Kids. Kids. Sit down.

1346
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:19,406
R it's for reincarnation

1347
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:22,404
because we hope you'll
come back as someone else

1348
01:09:22,832 --> 01:09:24,351
for another 100 years.

1349
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:29,567
Ladies.

1350
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:32,918
Ladies.

1351
01:09:33,785 --> 01:09:34,785
How you doing?

1352
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:37,798
Look. I get the picture.

1353
01:09:37,823 --> 01:09:38,892
You're mad.

1354
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,400
Come on.

1355
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:41,699
I'm doing the best I can.

1356
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:43,305
Yeah, well that isn't good enough.

1357
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,136
You promise you deliver her.

1358
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:46,161
So deliver.

1359
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,692
I know, I know. I'm just having
a hard time getting her alone.

1360
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,717
That's all.

1361
01:09:50,968 --> 01:09:51,968
Aunt Patricia.

1362
01:09:52,014 --> 01:09:53,014
Bernice.

1363
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:54,245
What luck.

1364
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:55,715
Ladies.

1365
01:09:55,861 --> 01:09:56,861
Wait.

1366
01:09:57,178 --> 01:09:58,178
Ladies.

1367
01:10:00,138 --> 01:10:01,684
I think our problem has been solved.

1368
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:04,051
The real Bernice.

1369
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:10,394
For she's a jolly good Meema.

1370
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,483
For she's a jolly good Meema.

1371
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:17,404
For she's a jolly good Meema.

1372
01:10:18,138 --> 01:10:21,751
Happy birthday to you.

1373
01:10:33,302 --> 01:10:35,282
So much for birthday wishes.

1374
01:10:36,092 --> 01:10:37,585
You're all still here.

1375
01:10:39,345 --> 01:10:40,798
As long as you are

1376
01:10:40,823 --> 01:10:45,422
I want you to know that this
was the best birthday of my life.

1377
01:10:46,652 --> 01:10:48,532
Good luck topping it next year.

1378
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:54,165
Look Meema, a special surprise.

1379
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:55,961
It's aunt Patricia from California.

1380
01:10:57,676 --> 01:10:58,870
Who's the kid with her?

1381
01:10:59,656 --> 01:11:00,656
Bernice.

1382
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:05,926
If that's Bernice

1383
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:07,532
then, who's?

1384
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:11,348
Sam wait, don't go.

1385
01:11:11,373 --> 01:11:14,535
Billy, if there's one thing I'm an expert
on, it's knowing when it's time to go.

1386
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,975
Don't understand?

1387
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,206
They like you.
They won't care if you're Bernice or not.

1388
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:21,553
Look. Soon you have to
go home to your family and

1389
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:23,386
I have to get on with my life.

1390
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:26,918
Just...

1391
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,964
promise that you'll call me
and let me know where you are.

1392
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:31,976
I promise.

1393
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:33,995
Thanks for everything.

1394
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:35,042
Cousin.

1395
01:11:45,626 --> 01:11:47,799
It's okay, I didn't need to breathe yet.

1396
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,001
Wait, I didn't give you
my phone number. Wait

1397
01:11:55,314 --> 01:11:56,314
Sam.

1398
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
Let me go.

1399
01:11:58,433 --> 01:11:59,433
Samantha.

1400
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:00,846
Let go of me.

1401
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:01,871
Sam!

1402
01:12:02,522 --> 01:12:03,844
I won't let you do this.

1403
01:12:05,286 --> 01:12:06,819
Get in the car and stay there.

1404
01:12:07,086 --> 01:12:08,239
Let her go.

1405
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:11,372
You guys are nuts.

1406
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,410
Stop.

1407
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:14,208
- Let me out.
- Not just sit there Jacquelyn.

1408
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:15,656
Let me out.

1409
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:19,822
Get your father.

1410
01:12:31,338 --> 01:12:32,338
She'll

1411
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:35,942
be coming round the mountain when she comes

1412
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,175
she'll be coming around the
mountain when she comes

1413
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,200
They've taken her.

1414
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:41,373
Taken who?

1415
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:42,398
Sam.

1416
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:43,526
Who's Sam?

1417
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:44,599
Bernice.

1418
01:12:44,669 --> 01:12:46,302
Bernice is right here.

1419
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:49,156
Not the real Bernice.
The Bernice you thought was Bernice.

1420
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:50,335
To tell you the truth

1421
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:52,634
that one was a lot more fun.

1422
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,687
Come on, we gotta go get her.

1423
01:12:55,018 --> 01:12:56,498
Billy slow down.

1424
01:12:56,523 --> 01:12:59,469
We haven't got time. We have
to go stop Raffiella and Jacquelyn.

1425
01:12:59,494 --> 01:13:00,494
Who?

1426
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:10,926
Let go of me.

1427
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,485
- Come on. Come on.
- No.

1428
01:13:13,365 --> 01:13:14,365
Let go of me.

1429
01:13:16,006 --> 01:13:17,235
Welcome home Samantha.

1430
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:19,136
Take her in.

1431
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:20,651
Come on.

1432
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:33,689
In my opinion,
we would be putting ourselves

1433
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:37,089
in a position of liability if we
acted in the girl's behalf at this time.

1434
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:38,572
Marks right, Billy.

1435
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,332
We could get in serious
trouble if we helped her.

1436
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:43,012
Fine, I'm going after her myself.

1437
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,477
No, no Billy wait a minute. Hold on.

1438
01:13:44,593 --> 01:13:46,937
Now, give us a chance to
plan the appropriate action.

1439
01:13:46,962 --> 01:13:48,706
What's the matter with you stiffs?

1440
01:13:49,276 --> 01:13:52,126
You think you're only supposed
to care for blood relatives?

1441
01:13:52,246 --> 01:13:54,436
We're living proof of that contradiction.

1442
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:57,256
We've been at each
other's throats for years.

1443
01:13:57,586 --> 01:13:59,316
You know, Meema does have a point.

1444
01:13:59,806 --> 01:14:01,786
When we thought this girl
was family we loved her.

1445
01:14:02,306 --> 01:14:05,285
Now, just because it turns
out she isn't. Do we stop?

1446
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:06,719
Yes.

1447
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:07,822
Definitely.

1448
01:14:08,839 --> 01:14:10,486
Well, I'm gonna help Billy.

1449
01:14:11,176 --> 01:14:12,376
Anybody wants to come with us?

1450
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:13,976
It's up to you.

1451
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,140
I hate it when you look at me like that.

1452
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:27,239
Anyone mind if I stay here?

1453
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,338
Okay.

1454
01:14:34,756 --> 01:14:36,226
It's very simple darling.

1455
01:14:36,745 --> 01:14:37,854
You sign.

1456
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:40,575
I get power of attorney and
then become your legal guardian.

1457
01:14:41,086 --> 01:14:43,439
Then, I invest all that money
that your father left you

1458
01:14:43,464 --> 01:14:45,476
which is yours when you turn 18

1459
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:49,744
and to express my gratitude you
get to go to a fine Swiss school

1460
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:51,706
and speak French

1461
01:14:51,856 --> 01:14:52,856
in the alps.

1462
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:54,445
I'm not going to sign anything.

1463
01:14:55,179 --> 01:14:56,179
No?

1464
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:58,106
I think you will.

1465
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:07,366
You monster,
she didn't do anything to you, let her go.

1466
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:09,661
I'd be more than happy to, darling

1467
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:11,708
when you're on your merry way

1468
01:15:11,866 --> 01:15:12,866
to Europe.

1469
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:17,275
You know how much I hate it
when we argue Samantha.

1470
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:21,113
Here you go.

1471
01:15:25,911 --> 01:15:26,911
Good girl.

1472
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:28,076
Your bags are packed.

1473
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:31,802
I'd kiss you but you know how
much I hate unnecessary sentiment.

1474
01:15:36,302 --> 01:15:39,382
We've already been arrested
for trespassing once today.

1475
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:42,215
We have a chance to
become two-time offenders.

1476
01:15:42,322 --> 01:15:45,762
What's the worst thing that could happen?
We could lose our bar cards and

1477
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:47,608
switch to a life of crime.

1478
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:50,499
And our family will go back to their roots.

1479
01:15:56,028 --> 01:15:57,028
Okay I got a plan.

1480
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,933
I'm gonna climb the fence and see
if I can open it up from the other side

1481
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,127
I've got a better plan.

1482
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:03,294
Why don't I just open it for you?

1483
01:16:13,246 --> 01:16:15,539
Can I interest anyone in a bit of tea or

1484
01:16:15,976 --> 01:16:17,416
cold beverage perhaps.

1485
01:16:17,898 --> 01:16:18,898
We want Sam.

1486
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:22,442
I'm sorry, you just missed her.

1487
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:27,816
Look.

1488
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:29,760
She's one of your relatives I believe.

1489
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:30,869
Aunt Kate.

1490
01:16:33,374 --> 01:16:35,041
They took her to the airport.

1491
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:36,066
Let's go get her.

1492
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:37,281
No one's going anywhere.

1493
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:40,247
I'm her legal guardian if anyone
tries to interfere in any way.

1494
01:16:40,486 --> 01:16:41,692
I will press charges

1495
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:44,686
Well, I hope you do press
charges because as of now.

1496
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,066
We're Sam's attorneys.

1497
01:16:49,036 --> 01:16:50,036
Right.

1498
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:51,659
Dooley and Dooley.

1499
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:54,801
Now look.

1500
01:16:54,826 --> 01:16:57,516
We need Sam here to testify
on our own behalf so you guys

1501
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:58,806
go stop the plane.

1502
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:00,182
Go ahead.

1503
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,701
Dad.

1504
01:17:01,726 --> 01:17:03,646
We have some legal work to attend to.

1505
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:05,841
Now.

1506
01:17:05,866 --> 01:17:08,059
Would you like your attorney to be present?

1507
01:17:18,355 --> 01:17:20,618
Well sister,
have a wonderful four years in Europe.

1508
01:17:20,643 --> 01:17:22,046
And please forget to write.

1509
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:23,071
Don't worry,

1510
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,096
if I send you a letter

1511
01:17:24,121 --> 01:17:25,121
it'll be a bomb in it.

1512
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:28,447
Final call for flight 307...

1513
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:30,505
All right move it and quit stalling.

1514
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:33,316
Final call for flight 307...

1515
01:17:33,341 --> 01:17:35,321
A final word of advice for both of you

1516
01:17:35,654 --> 01:17:37,554
use a couple pounds less of makeup and

1517
01:17:38,056 --> 01:17:39,334
leather is way out.

1518
01:17:39,676 --> 01:17:40,676
Bye bye.

1519
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,424
All right let's go.

1520
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,375
Not until that plane leaves.

1521
01:17:44,402 --> 01:17:48,255
106 to Paris now boarding in gate 62...

1522
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:10,238
Get out of our way.

1523
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:13,310
Back off kid.

1524
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:16,732
Don't you touch my son.

1525
01:18:16,756 --> 01:18:18,556
Are you looking for a fight lady?

1526
01:18:21,678 --> 01:18:22,678
Yeah.

1527
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:23,864
Maybe I am.

1528
01:18:24,472 --> 01:18:26,577
Yeah, maybe we are.

1529
01:18:28,598 --> 01:18:29,598
Left or right?

1530
01:18:33,398 --> 01:18:34,398
No.

1531
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,131
No, we're too late.

1532
01:18:52,909 --> 01:18:54,441
I should have gotten there sooner.

1533
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:56,746
Billy, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

1534
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,292
That poor kid.

1535
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:02,292
Well, she's going to a good school,
she'll be provided for.

1536
01:19:02,406 --> 01:19:04,461
She's going to hate it there,
she needs her family.

1537
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:06,772
- She doesn't need those people.
- Not talking about them.

1538
01:19:06,797 --> 01:19:07,797
I talk about us.

1539
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:08,930
Hi cousin.

1540
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:10,543
Sam.

1541
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:12,696
How did you get?

1542
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:13,721
We thought that you...

1543
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:16,346
No, I've been slipping out of
places I don't like my whole life.

1544
01:19:16,602 --> 01:19:18,783
Your stepmother's gonna
be very upset about this.

1545
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:19,808
Yeah.

1546
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:20,833
Isn't it great?

1547
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:24,706
So great in fact that I think
we should pay her a little visit.

1548
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:28,665
I've never been a believer in revenge but I
think I'll make an exception in this case.

1549
01:19:29,656 --> 01:19:31,258
Wait, I've got my own wheels.

1550
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:35,369
I know, pretty crafty with my hands.

1551
01:19:35,626 --> 01:19:37,409
- You want a ride?
- I'd love to.

1552
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,792
I've always wanted to
drive one of these babies.

1553
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:41,225
Be my guess.

1554
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,250
Catch.

1555
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,050
Get in.

1556
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:50,422
Seat belt.

1557
01:19:52,548 --> 01:19:54,021
- No.
- No.

1558
01:20:06,372 --> 01:20:07,372
Well.

1559
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:08,843
Just a minute.

1560
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:15,199
What do you think?

1561
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:17,581
Looks like she took care of everything.

1562
01:20:17,606 --> 01:20:18,706
That's correct gentlemen.

1563
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:21,679
I have the best lawyers
that money can buy which

1564
01:20:21,704 --> 01:20:23,635
obviously you are not.

1565
01:20:26,035 --> 01:20:27,035
Look lady.

1566
01:20:27,248 --> 01:20:29,868
Both, you and I know that the
only way to contest this thing

1567
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:31,126
is if Sam is here.

1568
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:32,729
Only she can tell us

1569
01:20:32,754 --> 01:20:34,546
if she signed this of her own free will.

1570
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:35,762
You're right

1571
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:40,193
and unfortunately at this very
moment she's 30 000 feet and climbing.

1572
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,520
So, if you're done wasting my time.

1573
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:45,175
Please, allow me to show you to the door.

1574
01:20:49,922 --> 01:20:50,922
Gentlemen.

1575
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:54,946
We're not giving up lady, if we find out
your was daughter denied in the wrong way.

1576
01:20:55,276 --> 01:20:56,556
We're gonna haul you into court.

1577
01:20:56,596 --> 01:20:58,066
Please, please.

1578
01:20:58,246 --> 01:20:59,246
You're scaring.

1579
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:01,766
Good day gentlemen.

1580
01:21:08,722 --> 01:21:09,916
I mom.

1581
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:10,941
I'm home.

1582
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:14,138
You know, I just decided leaving
the country just wasn't for me.

1583
01:21:14,755 --> 01:21:15,755
Dad grab her.

1584
01:21:16,848 --> 01:21:19,468
I think you ought to call those
brilliant attorneys of yours.

1585
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:22,606
We scaring you yet?

1586
01:21:24,851 --> 01:21:25,851
So.

1587
01:21:25,876 --> 01:21:27,571
What did you say your hourly rate was?

1588
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:29,322
Don't worry. Dad and grandpa are great.

1589
01:21:29,855 --> 01:21:30,921
She doesn't have a chance.

1590
01:21:30,946 --> 01:21:33,268
Good, she deserves
everything that's coming to her.

1591
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:37,019
Well, you can't live in this
big place all by yourself.

1592
01:21:37,456 --> 01:21:39,499
Thought about what you're gonna do now?

1593
01:21:40,156 --> 01:21:41,776
Yeah I have, right now.

1594
01:21:42,142 --> 01:21:44,256
I'd like to go back and wish
Meema a happy birthday.

1595
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:47,427
Okay, but after that,
you open to some suggestions?

1596
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:52,606
- I hate this.
- Me too.

1597
01:21:53,426 --> 01:21:56,879
My dad won't let me use the car phone so
I won't be able to call you till I get home

1598
01:21:57,099 --> 01:21:59,626
but when I get there I will call
you morning, noon and nights.

1599
01:21:59,651 --> 01:22:01,445
And I'll call you noon between times.

1600
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:10,876
Well, the children seem
to be getting along just fine.

1601
01:22:12,722 --> 01:22:17,027
Who knows, maybe someday
soon we'll all be one big happy family.

1602
01:22:21,345 --> 01:22:22,345
Help.

1603
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,774
Okay, come on kids let's go.

1604
01:22:31,966 --> 01:22:35,524
Well, thanks for visiting Jameson Bluffs.
You come back see us, yeah?

1605
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,675
Well, I hope you've enjoyed
your stay at Jameson Bluffs.

1606
01:22:51,894 --> 01:22:53,314
That's good to hear.

1607
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,974
This must be yours.

1608
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:55,999
Yes.

1609
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:58,992
It's just wonderful to have you here.

1610
01:23:00,774 --> 01:23:01,774
All right?

1611
01:23:01,799 --> 01:23:04,756
Yeah, it's all right.
No, that happens all the time.

1612
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:16,221
Can I have everyone's attention?

1613
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,376
In the 100 years that I've been around.

1614
01:23:21,886 --> 01:23:23,296
I've seen movies,

1615
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:24,566
television

1616
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:26,296
and the fax invented.

1617
01:23:27,093 --> 01:23:29,012
I've seen people go from

1618
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,037
horses

1619
01:23:30,062 --> 01:23:31,062
to cars

1620
01:23:31,087 --> 01:23:32,087
to planes.

1621
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:35,776
But I never thought I'd
live to see this family

1622
01:23:36,076 --> 01:23:38,446
stop competing with each other

1623
01:23:39,016 --> 01:23:42,516
while you people actually
appear to like one another.

1624
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:45,916
Now, it finally makes sense why the

1625
01:23:46,216 --> 01:23:49,306
almighty kept me around so long.

1626
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:51,676
But please

1627
01:23:52,186 --> 01:23:53,659
don't let that stop you from

1628
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:54,796
fighting now and then.

1629
01:23:55,366 --> 01:23:57,248
It's what keeps things interesting.

1630
01:23:58,246 --> 01:23:59,246
See you all

1631
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:00,266
next year.

1632
01:24:02,276 --> 01:24:03,276
Bye Meema.

1633
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,170
Jeez, that's good.

1634
01:24:05,195 --> 01:24:06,929
Where did you come up with this stuff Greg?

1635
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:07,954
See you next year.

1636
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:08,979
I'll take it.

1637
01:24:09,254 --> 01:24:10,254
Just talks.

1638
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,279
Julie.

1639
01:24:11,304 --> 01:24:12,304
Billy.

1640
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:13,845
I got your farewell present.

1641
01:24:14,192 --> 01:24:15,408
Stick them in paint

1642
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,785
and let them roll around on the sidewalk

1643
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,425
They make great designs.

1644
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:20,726
Gee thanks.

1645
01:24:22,209 --> 01:24:23,209
Look.

1646
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,102
What is this?

1647
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,388
Swamp scum. Take it.

1648
01:24:26,512 --> 01:24:29,352
You can look at it under a microscope
at your leisure when you get home.

1649
01:24:29,377 --> 01:24:31,163
Alright, thanks a lot. See you later.

1650
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:32,624
Are you ready?

1651
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:39,030
I want my piggyback ride. You
promised you'd give it to me and I want it.

1652
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,845
- Now
- Okay, okay. All right.

1653
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,288
I'll be right back.

1654
01:24:44,415 --> 01:24:47,415
I just spoke to grandpa Joe.
He and Kevin are gonna represent me.

1655
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:49,495
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

1656
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,681
Well, I do if you do.

1657
01:24:50,746 --> 01:24:52,013
Well, I guess you know by now.

1658
01:24:52,106 --> 01:24:53,225
I'm not perfect.

1659
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:54,692
No.

1660
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:58,232
But you are exactly the
daughter I always wanted.

1661
01:24:59,116 --> 01:25:00,116
Give me this bag.

1662
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:01,141
Thanks.

1663
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:04,029
Okay, that's enough I need to graze.

1664
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,784
Thanks for the ride,
next time I want a full gallon.

1665
01:25:08,809 --> 01:25:10,369
All right, could you hold these for me?

1666
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:12,082
Thank you.

1667
01:25:13,095 --> 01:25:15,795
So, do you have time for a quick moment?

1668
01:25:16,148 --> 01:25:17,601
I have time for a slow one.

1669
01:25:19,074 --> 01:25:20,074
All right.

1670
01:25:36,353 --> 01:25:38,820
I never did get a chance
to thank you for everything.

1671
01:25:39,726 --> 01:25:41,399
That's okay, I didn't do anything.

1672
01:25:42,115 --> 01:25:43,115
You did.

1673
01:25:44,112 --> 01:25:45,252
When I lost my dad.

1674
01:25:46,246 --> 01:25:48,126
I never thanked him
for all the things I should.

1675
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:52,036
And I made up my mind not do that
again to people who matter in my life.

1676
01:25:57,934 --> 01:26:00,234
You're right. I did deserve the thanks.

1677
01:26:01,769 --> 01:26:02,769
But you know I

1678
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,527
I should thank you too.

1679
01:26:04,946 --> 01:26:05,946
For what?

1680
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:07,626
You heard Meema.

1681
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:10,532
You helped change your family's history.

1682
01:26:11,697 --> 01:26:12,775
I don't think so.

1683
01:26:14,805 --> 01:26:15,805
Okay then.

1684
01:26:17,918 --> 01:26:19,064
You change mine.

1685
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:28,229
Now that we're gonna be relatives,
do you think it's okay to do this?

1686
01:26:29,056 --> 01:26:30,775
I can't believe you Billy.

1687
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:32,866
You had a perfectly good cousin right here.

1688
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:35,481
You didn't have to bring
one in from the outside.

1689
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:37,776
Well.

1690
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:39,960
May the best cousin win.

1691
01:26:46,486 --> 01:26:49,925
I just got word that Sam stepmother's
been turned into the authorities.

1692
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:53,077
Even a brilliant lawyer is
going to have a tough time

1693
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:54,771
explaining how she's been treating Sam.

1694
01:26:56,806 --> 01:26:57,806
But

1695
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,439
we still got a lot of work to do.

1696
01:26:59,722 --> 01:27:01,012
See you in the office on Monday?

1697
01:27:01,037 --> 01:27:02,037
I'll be there.

1698
01:27:03,185 --> 01:27:04,185
You know.

1699
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:05,789
I never moved your desk.

1700
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:07,292
I wish you did.

1701
01:27:07,386 --> 01:27:08,526
I hated that view.

1702
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:11,479
I think something could be worked out.

1703
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:13,694
Come here.

1704
01:27:30,264 --> 01:27:32,056
It took us a while

1705
01:27:32,536 --> 01:27:36,406
but I think we might have
put that vicious cycle to rest

1706
01:27:36,556 --> 01:27:37,949
We are good, aren't we?

1707
01:27:38,402 --> 01:27:39,402
The best.

1708
01:27:39,676 --> 01:27:41,769
Well, of course you're good.

1709
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:43,279
You're Dooley women

1710
01:27:43,304 --> 01:27:47,030
if it weren't for us this family would
have gone up in smoke years ago.

1711
01:27:54,982 --> 01:27:56,962
Are we going to get this show on the road?

1712
01:27:56,987 --> 01:27:59,536
Or are you waiting for me
to turn to slush back here?

1713
01:28:00,345 --> 01:28:01,345
Let's get going.

1714
01:28:04,953 --> 01:28:05,953
Let's go.

1715
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:08,742
Just wanted to ask you a little favor.

1716
01:28:08,894 --> 01:28:11,736
You know, Margaret and I are
going to go to Hawaii for a couple of...

1717
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,189
a little visit and

1718
01:28:14,214 --> 01:28:15,800
we just wondered if you'd like to

1719
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:17,374
look after Mark Jr. for us.

1720
01:28:17,602 --> 01:28:18,602
Dad.

1721
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:20,462
I don't want to go with them.

1722
01:28:20,487 --> 01:28:21,487
Mark.

1723
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:23,334
You want us to watch Mark Jr.?

1724
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:25,365
You gotta be kidding.

1725
01:28:25,397 --> 01:28:27,255
Well, we kind of figured you'd say that

1726
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,850
so just to make it interesting.

1727
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,810
How about one more challenge?

1728
01:28:32,442 --> 01:28:33,442
Kevin.

1729
01:28:33,687 --> 01:28:34,687
Don't do it.

1730
01:28:36,073 --> 01:28:37,693
I told you he wouldn't go for it.

1731
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:41,053
My brother never could take real pressure.

1732
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:21,622
Could I?

1733
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:41,576
Families

1734
01:29:41,866 --> 01:29:43,696
are very weird things

1735
01:29:44,236 --> 01:29:46,989
you come into this world and
you are automatically a part of one.

1736
01:29:47,537 --> 01:29:50,139
Unlike Sam, usually you don't get a choice

1737
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:53,143
but, you know, as nutty as my
family is if I did have to choose

1738
01:29:53,506 --> 01:29:55,026
I'd still pick mine every time.

1739
01:29:55,966 --> 01:29:57,292
Could you move over a little?

1740
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:58,872
I don't want you touching me.

1741
01:30:00,578 --> 01:30:03,551
Not that it would be so bad if
you could trade a relative or two

1742
01:30:03,576 --> 01:30:05,929
you know, like they do with
players and professional sports

1743
01:30:06,177 --> 01:30:07,177
Okay,

1744
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:08,608
we're ready to make the trade.

1745
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,273
Yes.

1746
01:30:13,835 --> 01:30:14,835
This way.

1747
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:24,785
Yes.

1748
01:30:27,406 --> 01:30:28,406
Big smile.
