- At 8 o'clock?
- Perfect.

352
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:22,872
I have a degree in journalism.

353
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:26,459
I thought to take MA
but instead of that I am committed.

354
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,629
And I was once married
but did not work.

355
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,006
Imagine your.

356
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:37,012
And it took me a few years to me
realize ...

357
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:41,934
but I got over it and it's time
for a change. You know what I mean?

358
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:44,770
I think it's a pretty good idea.

359
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:49,233
I was born and raised in Los Angeles
ECAC is wonderful.

360
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,277
But sometimes I think

361
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,491
to leave everything behind and do not
I'm never going back to L.A.

362
00:37:56,533 --> 00:38:03,081
Dangerous to live. This is
meu.Care motto is your motto?

363
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:17,263
You were just like dreptate.Este
and my room.

364
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:21,309
Thank you for support.

365
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:27,441
Good night.

366
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,186
Jake.

367
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:28,278
I call on our friends and tell them
be here in an hour or business spades.

368
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,156
Tonight? Tomorrow ought
you to encounter.

369
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:34,326
I know, but something is not right.

370
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:09,822
What?

371
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:12,992
Listen, Phillips has changed the schedule.

372
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:14,828
I need you in one hour.

373
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,663
- We are already on the road.
, This is a mistake.

374
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:18,582
Must do this.

375
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:20,375
We need you there.

376
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:23,086
We talked about that already.
It's the only chance we have.

377
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:24,338
I'll be there.

378
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:05,632
He left.

379
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,261
Okay, to be careful.

380
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:11,221
See you soon.

381
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:54,540
Leave your weapons in the van.

382
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,458
And why I want to do this?

383
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,377
I said you that you want.

384
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,386
- Any problem?
- Yes, we have a problem.

385
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:08,638
My people want to keep and
and weapons just like yours.

386
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,433
People, we are here for business
not to fight.

387
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:14,144
All right. Phillips, guys you want
gonna give you a hand?

388
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:17,606
Jimmy helps him,
Chris looks into them.

389
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:18,941
Come on.

390
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,294
This way.

391
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:27,013
Nice place you got here.

392
00:45:27,055 --> 00:45:27,973
Thank you.

393
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:31,685
Trophy of war, other people.

394
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,728
So this is a system
missile guidance.

395
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:26,869
It's fantastic.

396
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:31,582
Like all things, the systems become
increasingly smaller and more powerful.

397
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:38,715
I know where that works?

398
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,511
Working lights.

399
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:04,785
Do not mind if you
examines and this young man?

400
00:47:04,826 --> 00:47:06,161
Hardly.

401
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:07,496
Not as long as I get my money.

402
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:09,414
Not asked your permission, you know.

403
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:13,294
No, but surely you need the code
activation.

404
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:16,881
Okay.

405
00:47:16,922 --> 00:47:19,217
Jake, give the man money.

406
00:47:19,217 --> 00:47:23,054
Million in notes.
24 million in bonds, right?

407
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:25,014
All right.

408
00:47:55,714 --> 00:47:57,424
Take him into the house.

409
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,383
Get up.

410
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,439
- Man, that's fine.
- Okay.

411
00:48:35,757 --> 00:48:37,467
There was a problem that
I need to do.

412
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,344
Make your pleasure.

413
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:42,722
Andrew continues the examination.

414
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,147
I got it.

415
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:04,454
Who are you and why are you here?

416
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:21,722
Are you a professional?

417
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:30,815
You watched the house these days
I've tested and security systems.

418
00:49:30,857 --> 00:49:34,194
Am I right, huh?

419
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:35,529
I know you did it.

420
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:38,115
Because of this we have changed
location.

421
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:40,075
Who are?

422
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:45,164
I'll ask again.

423
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:46,874
Who are you?

424
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:15,905
Who sent you?

425
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:38,930
Who sent you?

426
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:46,605
Who sent you?

427
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:06,668
Kill him quickly and have come up
need you.

428
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:10,046
Jack, we change the style
negotiating with our top friends

429
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,966
What, your wait?
Opcupati-like him.

430
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:35,323
The plane is ready?

431
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:45,376
We'll get there soon.

432
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:49,088
Come on.

433
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:13,531
Unfortunately it took the so long.

434
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:15,158
Problem?

435
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:17,118
Not me.

436
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:38,391
Hey, not shoot.
You can get our man.

437
00:52:58,037 --> 00:53:02,291
Andrew Phillips says he does not know
what it is.

438
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,292
The art. The system is good.
I do not have to and managed better.

439
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:06,462
All right.

440
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:03,982
Thank you.

441
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:14,535
Before he was working for me
analyst at the MoD.

442
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:13,014
Okay, gave me your 25 million.
Now give me the activation code.

443
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:17,561
I let you examine the system and the so
as your man said and everything is okay.

444
00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:19,062
So we climb into the car.

445
00:55:19,104 --> 00:55:22,524
And if everything is ok, and I call
I'll give the code.

446
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:24,568
Gentlemen.

447
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:31,284
No, not want to die.

00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:37,916
Who rush and you? Time for
divertisment.Ia least one rope.

449
00:55:45,632 --> 00:55:48,469
Make a mistake, man.

450
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:53,682
No, you made a mistake.

451
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:00,940
Lift.

452
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,859

I've never seen anything like that. Telescopic
the infrared device.

457
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,395
Very good.

458
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:43,819
There seems to be that type
put you to kill me, right?

459
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:46,239
Oh, I'm right, right?

460
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,282
Well your friend is dead.

461
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,916
Who are you?

462
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:59,211

- Keep shooting.
- I see it.

468
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:22,174
You see, you see.

00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:22,447
Come on, shoot me that.

470
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:25,242

- You killed people like to live.
- I kill people for my country.

478

Dylan, you want to retire with a
watch engraved with "Much gratitude?

479
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,658

I know that.

483
01:00:47,496 --> 01:00:49,915
Phillips is powered plane

01:00:49,957 --> 01:00:51,584
Come with me.

485
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:54,462
You planned this from the outset.

486
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:56,589
Do not make me do ECAC
I do not want Dylan.

487
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:59,300
What? If you do not want to take money
kill me?

488
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,219
I put in a difficult sitautie.

489
01:01:01,219 --> 01:01:03,221
You son of a bitch.

490
01:01:33,879 --> 01:01:35,714
Yes, hear me, I am.

491
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:37,341

I did the right thing to do.

01:02:41,493 --> 01:02:42,953
You did.

502
01:02:42,994 --> 01:02:45,205
You did your job.
And his machine?

503
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,416
Everything is arranged.
He can not go anywhere.

504
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,209
Why should you go after him?

505
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:52,963
He does not want money. So what?
This leaves more money for us.

506
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:54,507
He took the money.

507
01:02:54,548 --> 01:02:56,008
- What?
-A and the is.

Not only took part.
It took them all.

01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:03,641
Yes, and now it as part of this project
is no longer an option.

That said, you and the phone.

It's about John Stevens?

529
