1
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:34,878
Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon.

2
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,165
Why were you yelling ?

3
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:46,834
The girl at the check-in counter ?

4
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:49,889
I'm sorry, uh...

5
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:51,952
Do I know you ?

6
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,277
I'm on your flight.

7
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:55,363
L. A. ?

8
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,848
No ring 'cause you're single or
because you don't like wearing one ?

9
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:06,994
You're asking me if I'm married ?

10
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,844
Are you married ?

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,072
No. No, not anymore.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,103
So what's your name ?

13
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:18,807
Ana-Lucia.

14
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,214
So tell me, Ana-Lucia,

15
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,950
why are you drinkin' tequila
and tonics at ten to noon ?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,647
I hate flying,

17
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:30,940
and they stuck me all the
way in the back of the plane.

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,459
So where are you sitting ?

19
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:37,245
23B.

20
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,027
42F.

21
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:40,894
Wanna trade ?

22
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:48,851
<i>Oceanic flight 815 departing
Sydney for Los Angeles...</i>

23
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,092
<i>a flight like any other.</i>

24
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,435
<i>A plane full of strangers,</i>

25
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:57,301
<i>among them a doctor</i>

<i>a soldier</i>

28

<i>and a prisoner.</i>

31
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,254
<i>But en route to its destination,</i>

32
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:17,004
<i>something goes wrong.</i>

33
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:23,943
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please return to
your seats and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

34
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:25,929
It's normal.

35
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,615
Oh, I know.

36
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,383
Just never been a very good flier.

37
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:35,951
My husband keeps reminding me
that planes wanna be in the air.

38
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,100
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

39
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:41,210
I'll be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

40
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:06,580
<i>and somehow 48 passengers...</i>

41
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:08,810
<i>survived.</i>

42
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:12,582
Walt !

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,551
Haa... my leg...

44
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,194
Help !

45
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,517
Please help me !

46
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:31,199
Help me ! I'm having contractions.

47
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,972
Aah ! Get away ! Get away from...

48
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:44,705
Excuse me.

49
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,253
Did you ever use a needle ?

50
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,165
I made the drapes in my apartment.

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,868
That's fantastic. Listen,

52
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,341
do you have a second ? I
could use a little help here.

53
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,292
Help with what ?

54
00:03:59,018 --> 00:03:59,699
With this.

55
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:02,212
Look, I'd do it myself. I'm a
doctor. But I just can't reach it.

56
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:03,607
You want me to sew that up ?

57
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,368
If you wouldn't mind.

58
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,698
Of course I'll.

59
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,532
Thank you.

60
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:17,360
<i>They are complete strangers,
stranded on a faraway island,</i>

61
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,096
<i>scared and waiting.</i>

62
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,527
You'd think they would have come by now.

63
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,134
What ?

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,625
Who ?

65
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,198
Anyone.

66
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,993
I don't know your name.

67
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,771
I'm Kate.

68
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:35,955
Jack.

69
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:46,037
<i>and the only thing more mysterious
than the people they're stranded with...</i>

70
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,227
<i>is the island itself.</i>

71
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:55,696
Terrific.

72
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:00,510
<i>A new day arrives,</i>

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,105
<i>and still no rescue.</i>

74
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:06,791
I used to have a stomach.

75
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,629
How do you know how to do all that ?

76
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,977
I was a military communications officer.

77
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:14,811
Oh, yeah ?

78
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,455
You ever see battle ?

79
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,076
I fought in the Gulf War.

80
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,965
No way. What were
you, Air Force ? Army ?

81
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,172
The republican guard.

82
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:26,706
The comic's in spanish.

83
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,572
You read spanish ?

84
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:30,357
No.

85
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:31,966
I found it.

86
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:37,079
<i>But in the face of
disaster, hope remains.</i>

87
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:38,054
Is it working ?

88
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,146
It seems to be,

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,166
except we're not picking up a signal.

90
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:43,602
There is one thing we could try.

91
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:44,236
What ?

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,620
Seeing if we can get a
signal from high ground.

93
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,238
Hey !

94
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,541
We've got a bar.

95
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,997
Mayday ! Mayday !

96
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,116
What is that ?

97
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,774
Feedback.

98
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,447
Feedback from what ?
What would do that ?

99
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:10,965
We can't transmit because something
else is already transmitting.

100
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,550
- Transmitting from where ?
- What ?

101
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,335
Somewhere close. The signal's strong.

102
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,449
It's  the rescue party. It has to be.

103
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,723
That's french ! The french are coming !

104
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,543
I've never been so happy
to hear the french !

105
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:22,869
Does anyone speak french ?

106
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:23,914
She does.

107
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,009
"I'm alone now.

108
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:31,897
I'm  on the island alone.

109
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:34,246
Please, someone, come.

110
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,591
The others... they're...

111
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,611
they're dead.

112
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,098
It... it killed them all.

113
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:47,660
It's a loop.

114
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,900
Iteration... it's
repeating the same message.

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,904
It's a distress call. It's
been playing over and over...

116
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,322
for 16 years.

117
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,106
Guys...

118
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,523
where are we ?

119
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,936
There's gonna be a memorial service
back at the camp for those...

120
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,200
for those who didn't make it,

121
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,726
for everyone to say good-bye.

122
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:19,359
I'd like to be there for that.

123
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:20,979
Okay.

124
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:32,100
Maybe if you wanted to
say something, you know,

125
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,685
about your husband ?

126
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:34,648
Doctor,

127
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:37,090
my husband is not dead.

128
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:40,847
Rose,

129
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,276
he was in the tail section of the plane.

130
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,815
It broke off in mid-flight. I'm sorry,

131
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,339
but everyone who was in the
rear of the plane is gone.

132
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,188
They're probably thinking
the same thing about us.

133
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:08,633
<i>The mysteries of the
island begin to unfold.</i>

134
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:10,536
Doctor ?

135
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,036
You coming ?

136
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,944
<i>And as one man looks for answers...</i>

137
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:24,200
<i>another finds purpose.</i>

138
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:34,869
How are they...

139
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:36,830
the others ?

140
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,169
Thirsty.

141
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:40,752
Hungry.

142
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,546
Waiting to be rescued.

143
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:45,399
And they need someoneto
tell them what to do.

144
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,442
Me ?

145
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,063
I can't.

146
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,307
Why can't you ?

147
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,006
Because I'm not a leader.

148
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,049
And yet they all treat you like one.

149
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,010
I don't know how to help them.

150
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:58,874
I'll fail. I'll...

151
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,514
I don't have what it takes.

152
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,402
Why are you out here, Jack ?

153
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,253
I think I'm going crazy.

154
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,998
No, crazy people don't know they're going
crazy. They think they're getting saner.

155
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:15,905
I'm an ordinary man, Jack.
I live in the real world.

156
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,467
But this place

157
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:19,052
is different.

158
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:20,365
It's special.

159
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:25,766
The others don't want to talk
about it because it scares them,

160
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,034
but we all know it.

161
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,560
We all feel it.

162
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,616
I've looked into the eye of this island,

163
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,624
and what I saw

164
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,608
was beautiful.

165
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,997
What if everything that happened here

166
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:43,521
happened for a reason ?

167
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,494
So... why are you out here ?

168
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,116
Chasing something.

169
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,467
The white rabbit.

170
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,743
"Alice in Wonderland."

171
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,694
Yeah.

172
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,700
Wonderland, because who I'm chasing,

173
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:00,990
he's not there.

174
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,537
But you see him ?

175
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:03,324
Yes.

176
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,836
But he's not there.

177
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,817
<i>What if your leader is a reluctant one ?</i>

178
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:15,019
<i>What if the pain he
holds gets in the way ?</i>

179
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,206
you want to tell me what happened ?

180
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:28,854
Couple guys jumped mark silverman.

181
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,784
But they didn't jump you ?

182
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,285
You don't want to be a hero.

183
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:36,396
You don't want to try
and save everyone. Because

184
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,965
when you fail...

185
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,723
you just don't have what it takes.

186
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:00,149
Never thought I'd see the day, Jack.

187
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:04,974
You barge into my O. R.
You work on my patient.

188
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,591
How many drinks did
you have at lunch, dad ?

189
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:17,211
Now in my professional opinion, ladies
and gentlemen, and that's all I have,

190
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,888
by the time I was called in,

191
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,627
the damage was irreversible.

192
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:27,430
Okay then. I think we're done
here. A final report will be filed.

193
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:28,824
Okay.

194
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:31,478
I need to...

195
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:34,695
revise my statement.

196
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:41,373
I didn't come into the O. R.
until well into the procedure.

197
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:41,901
J ack...

198
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,608
I was warned by one of the nurses

199
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,869
that my father was operating

200
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,877
under the influence.

201
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,558
Jack, this is not the time...

202
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:52,658
by the time I got there, it
was clear that my father was

203
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,922
not  only incapacitated
but that he had also

204
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,732
severed the patient's hepatic artery,

205
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,254
which, in my professional opinion...

206
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,171
caused the crisis
which led to her death.

207
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,476
He's gone, Jack.

208
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:16,823
He'll be back.

209
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,300
This time it's different.

210
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,359
I want you to bring him back.

211
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,407
I can't.

212
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,144
"I can't ?"

213
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,902
You don't get to say "I can't,"

214
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,968
not after what you did.

215
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,424
You bring your father home, Jack.

216
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,655
Where is he ?

217
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,545
Australia.

218
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,854
The maid says he hasn't used
the bed in the past three days.

219
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:47,304
Did he rent a car from the concierge ?

220
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,443
No, sir.

221
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,729
Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard,

222
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,351
I don't think any rental agent in Sydney
would lease your father a car in his condition.

223
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,603
He left his wallet.

224
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,746
Perhaps you should talk to
the police, Mr. Shephard.

225
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,953
That's him.

226
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,230
What do you mean, you
won't put it on the plane ?

227
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,692
I'm sorry, Mr. Shephard, but our policy is that
the body must have the proper documentation.

228
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:35,073
- There's just no latitude.
- No latitude.

229
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,259
Chrissy,

230
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:39,335
in 16 hours, I need to land at L. A. X.

231
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:43,923
And I need that coffin to clear customs,
because there's gonna be a hearse waiting there.

232
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:48,456
And I need that hearse to take me
and that coffin to a cemetery. Why ?

233
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:52,558
Chrissy ? Why can't I just bring him to a
funeral home and make all the arrangements ?

234
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,335
Why can't I really take my
time with it ? Because...

235
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,044
Because I need it to be done.

236
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:00,651
I need it to be over.

237
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,757
<i>How great is the need for the leader</i>

238
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,434
<i>to finally emerge ?</i>

239
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,140
It's been six days.

240
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,181
We're all still waiting,

241
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,257
waiting for someone to come.

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,192
But what if they don't ?

243
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:24,996
Last week, most of us were strangers.

244
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,284
But we're all here now.

245
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:31,363
And God knows how long
we're gonna be here.

246
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,210
But if we can't live together...

247
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,013
we're gonna die alone.

248
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:54,522
Hey, hey !

249
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,471
What's the matter ?

250
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:58,490
That pregnant lady fell down.

251
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:01,824
Claire, can you hear me ?

252
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:02,717
Hi.

253
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:05,593
It's me. It's Kate.
Just take it easy, okay ?

254
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:06,801
She needs water.

255
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,480
Don't move, okay ?

256
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:11,028
<i>How do you survive on an island</i>

257
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,542
The water's gone.

258
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,381
Someone stole it !

259
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:19,044
<i>When you don't know who you can trust ?</i>

260
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,004
Well, it's about time.

261
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,990
For what ?

262
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:27,434
Where's the water ?

263
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:31,919
That's  better.

264
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,186
Get off of me.

265
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,342
Give us the water now !

266
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:38,857
Touch me again, huh ?

267
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:40,700
Do you really think I
stoled your damn water ?

268
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,764
We know you gave two
bottles to the korean.

269
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:43,598
It's not here.

270
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:47,566
I traded Mr. Miyagi the last of
my water for a fish he caught.

271
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,281
You gave him your last two bottles ?

272
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,394
Water has no value, freckles.

273
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,386
It's gonna rain sooner or later.

274
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,346
And hell, I'm an optimist.

275
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:56,673
Here.

276
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,984
Figure that makes us
even for the tampa job.

277
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,491
What could possibly make
us even for the tampa job ?

278
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,741
How about the known whereabouts
of the man who ruined your life ?

279
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:12,121
That guy... Frank Duckett... runs
a shrimp truck down in Sydney.

280
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,355
This is him ?

281
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:18,092
That's him.

282
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:22,707
What brings you to Sydney ?

283
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,926
Business.

284
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,722
What's your handle

285
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,775
back in the states ?

286
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:40,614
I was a

287
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,939
a chief of surgery.

288
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,242
Was ?

289
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,309
Yeah, was.

290
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,150
I have a

291
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,992
a son. He's about your age.

292
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,224
Right now,

293
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,289
he thinks that I hate him.

294
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,140
There's a pay phoneover here.

295
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,777
One simple phone call,
and I could fix everything.

296
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,973
Why don't you ?

297
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:12,813
Because I am weak.

298
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:14,897
It's fate.

299
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,774
Some people are just supposed to suffer.

300
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,410
That's why the Red Sox will
never win the damn series.

301
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,257
This, uh,

302
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,157
this business that you have,

303
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,222
will it ease your suffering ?

304
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:33,948
Yeah.

305
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:36,905
Then what are you doing here ?

306
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,016
<i>Can vengeance be so blind</i>

307
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,063
<i>that a man is unable to see...</i>

308
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:58,448
<i>the man he's killed is
not the man he sought ?</i>

309
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,184
Tell Hibbs I would have paid.

310
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,850
How do you know Hibbs ?

311
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:06,817
You don't know what
you're doing, do you ?

312
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:13,122
It'll come back around.

313
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,074
That's why the Sox will
never win the series.

314
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,059
What did you just say ?

315
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,004
I said that's why the Red
Sox will never win the series.

316
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,965
What the hell's that supposed to mean ?

317
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:29,177
It's just something
my father used to say.

318
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,396
Your daddy...

319
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,249
he a doctor, too ?

320
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,548
Was.

321
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,120
He's dead.

322
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,017
Why do you want to
know about my father ?

323
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:51,013
No reason.

324
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,245
What do you think his story is ?

325
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:01,876
Who ?

326
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:03,180
Locke ?

327
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,305
No offense, mate, but

328
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,462
if there was one person on this island I
would put my absolute faith in to save us all,

329
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,000
it would be John Locke.

330
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,422
- Hand 'em over !
- How about no ?

331
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,207
There's other people here,
or don't you give a crap ?

332
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,284
- Knock it off !
- Stay out !

333
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,523
<i>In the absence of law,
how do 48 people coexist ?</i>

334
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:24,568
What's going on ?

335
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,679
Jethro here is hoarding
the last of the peanuts.

336
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,029
What about the rest of the food ?

337
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,027
We  kinda

338
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:30,295
ate it all.

339
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,035
What ?

340
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,463
How are we gonna find sustenance ?

341
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,350
We hunt.

342
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:47,969
Who is this guy ?

343
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,868
You've got to move, colonel.

344
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,733
Your troops are across enemy lines.

345
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:53,895
Patience...

346
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:58,664
the quality which you lack,
GL-12... is the hallmark of a leader.

347
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:00,144
Hallmark, huh ?

348
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,367
Tell me more about
being a leader, Locke.

349
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,883
I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's
my lunch hour. I can play a game.

350
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,705
Yeah.

351
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,802
Tell me, what's a walkabout ?

352
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:21,213
"Experience the dream journeys
of the fabled australian outback."

353
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,538
You have no right
taking that off my desk.

354
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:24,533
So you

355
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,706
wander around

356
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,218
hunting and gathering food, right ?

357
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,850
On foot ?

358
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,560
Not that you would
understand, but a walkabout

359
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:37,787
is a journey of spiritual renewal where
one derives strength from the earth

360
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,324
and becomes inseparable from it.

361
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,938
I have vacation days. I'm going,
Randy. I already made a reservation.

362
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,582
Why do you torture yourself ?

363
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:49,010
I mean, imagining you're some hunter

364
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:51,297
on walkabouts ? Wake up.

365
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,551
You can't do any of that.

366
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,275
Just...

367
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,077
don't tell me what I can't do.

368
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,602
I booked this tour a month ago.
You've already got my money.

369
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,562
Now I demand a place on that bus.

370
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,535
- You misrepresented yourself.
- I never lied.

371
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,621
You neglected to tell
us about your condition.

372
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:10,688
My condition is not an issue.

373
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:13,565
I've lived with it for four years.
It's never kept me from doing anything.

374
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,817
Unfortunately, it is an issue
for our insurance company.

375
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,549
I can't keep the bus waiting any longer.
It isn't fair to the other people.

376
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,727
Hey, don't talk to me about fair !

377
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,117
Hey. Hey, don't you walk away from me.

378
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,184
You don't know who you're dealing with !

379
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,755
Don't ever tell me
what I can't do, ever !

380
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,583
This is destiny. This is my destiny.

381
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:36,955
I'm supposed to do this, damn it !

382
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:39,573
Don't tell me what I can't do !

383
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:46,833
<i>How common is the common man ?</i>

384
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,230
<i>Does he have potential ?</i>

385
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,613
Locke.

386
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,004
<i>Does his destiny ultimately matter ?</i>

387
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:12,211
<i>In the search for answers
to the island's mysteries,</i>

388
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,501
<i>they find proof</i>

389
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,391
<i>that they are not alone.</i>

390
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,541
Please just listen to me !

391
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:38,772
I'm a survivor of a plane crash.

392
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,015
I found the wire on the beach.

393
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,562
I followed it.

394
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,826
I thought it might have
something to do with

395
00:22:46,437 --> 00:22:48,727
the transmission we
picked up on the receiver

396
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:52,532
with a french woman repeating
on a loop for 16 years.

397
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:55,726
Has it really been that long ?

398
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:57,910
You.

399
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:03,369
Nearly two months we survived here.

400
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,406
Two months before...

401
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,566
your distress signal...

402
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:10,997
the message I heard...

403
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,053
you said,

404
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,953
"It killed them all."

405
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:15,973
It was them.

406
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:18,706
The others.

407
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,078
What others ?

408
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,046
Have you seen other
people on this island ?

409
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:25,809
No.

410
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,204
But I hear them...

411
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,833
out there in the jungle.

412
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,355
They whisper.

413
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,713
Help me !

414
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,651
He held me down.

415
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,461
Which way did he go ?

416
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:46,917
I don't know. I couldn't see.

417
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:47,809
What's going on ?

418
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:48,946
He just ran away.

419
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:52,269
He was trying to hurt my baby.

420
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:54,066
It's okay.

421
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:58,971
We're so intent on pointing the finger
at one another that we're ignoring

422
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:03,257
the simple, undeniable truth that
the problem isn't here, it's there !

423
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:04,886
They've attacked us !

424
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:08,655
Maybe it's time we stopped blaming
us and started worrying about them !

425
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:13,610
We're not the only people on
this island, and we all know it !

426
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,884
<i>scared and in danger,</i>

427
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,518
<i>and looking for any way to get home...</i>

428
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:26,279
What are we talking about doing now...

429
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,197
looking for another excuse to get chased down
and killed by whatever lives in the jungle ?

430
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,910
We can't keep doing this.

431
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,636
We need to get off this island.

432
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:36,606
You think any of us want to be here ?

433
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,240
No.

434
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,118
So are you suggesting something ?

435
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:39,774
Yeah.

436
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,641
We build a raft.

437
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:43,343
What are we looking for again ?

438
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,054
Any long piece of metal or plastic
tubing. Anything that looks like a...

439
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:48,447
That could work as a frame.

440
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,136
Am I being punished ?

441
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,484
What, you think working with
your old man is punishment ?

442
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:54,670
Feels like punishment.

443
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:57,674
This is us taking
control of our destiny.

444
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,113
We've talked about
taking some time apart.

445
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:04,050
You're not taking my son.

446
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:07,017
You can go if you want
to, but Walt stays with me.

447
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,285
I'll give him everything he needs.

448
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,845
Except for his dad. He's
not going with you, no !

449
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,712
We're not married, Michael.

450
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,835
I'm his mother, and
I'm steadily employed.

451
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:16,913
Who do you think the
court's gonna side with ?

452
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:20,811
Michael Dawson ?

453
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,091
Can I help you ?

454
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:23,767
I'm Brian Porter.

455
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:25,528
Susan's Brian ?

456
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,710
Susan know you're here, man ?

457
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,493
Susan died yesterday.

458
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:38,567
Hey, Walt.

459
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:43,275
Who are you ?

460
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm your father.

461
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:51,250
Where's Brian ?

462
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:53,856
Brian's not here.

463
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:56,291
I come to...

464
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:59,015
bring you home with me.

465
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,021
I'm not going anywhere with you.

466
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,654
See this knife Walt ?

467
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:08,944
Right here.

468
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,774
Focus on it. Picture
it in your mind's eye.

469
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,852
Now do it again, but see it.

470
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:19,373
Wow...

471
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,277
Yes !

472
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,697
You had it in you, Walt.

473
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:25,384
It was weird. I actually saw it in my
mind or something, like it was real.

474
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,462
Who's to say it wasn't ?

475
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:27,061
Hey !

476
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:29,304
What the hell is going on ?

477
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:30,748
Give me that.

478
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:31,650
But I...

479
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,200
Take Vincent and go back to camp.

480
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,796
- But Mr. Locke was...
- now, little man...

481
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:36,264
Michael...

482
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,106
I know it's been difficult
to bond with your son.

483
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,882
You know why he's formed
an attachment to me ?

484
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:44,102
Because I treat him like an adult
and you still treat him like a boy.

485
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,569
He's 10 years old !

486
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:48,481
He's been through more than most
people in their entire lifetimes.

487
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:50,865
You haven't spent enough
time with him to see it, but

488
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,084
he's different.

489
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,596
You stay away from my son...

490
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:56,886
and me.

491
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,152
Wow, you're making a lot of progress.

492
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:01,920
Got this bamboo for the decking,

493
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:05,373
got a piece of the fuselage for a cabin.

494
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:07,697
It's not the Queen Mary.

495
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:09,399
I only got room for

496
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:10,808
four people.

497
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:12,475
What's the matter, doc ?

498
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,528
Feeling left out ?

499
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,924
You're taking Sawyer with you ?

500
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,578
I needed a halyard to the mast.

501
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,335
Good thing I'm a saver,
not a spender, huh, doc ?

502
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,742
<i>With some determined to leave,</i>

503
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:30,615
<i>the island reveals itself to others</i>

504
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:32,388
<i>with a reason to stay.</i>

505
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:33,914
I think we should go back, man,

506
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,544
suit yourself.

507
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:40,918
Boone !

508
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,124
You need this more than I do.

509
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:51,769
What is that ?

510
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,405
That's what we're gonna find out.

511
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,040
<i>A mysterious hatch...</i>

512
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:09,138
<i>is it the key to survival
or the path to disaster ?</i>

513
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,500
My god.

514
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:13,521
What is this thing ?

515
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,763
I guess it's time we talked about this.

516
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,699
How long have you known about this ?

517
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:22,045
Three weeks, give or take.

518
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:26,375
You've been out here for three weeks digging
this thing up, and you never told me about it.

519
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:29,945
All due respect, Jack, but
since when do I report to you ?

520
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,585
So how do we open it ?

521
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:34,512
What ?

522
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:36,863
You want to open it ?

523
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:38,354
Yeah.

524
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,637
I brought you here to talk
him out of this insanity.

525
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:43,812
Anything could be inside.

526
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,592
Best case scenario, there's supplies.
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

527
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:50,743
Actually, Jack I can think
of much worse cases than that.

528
00:28:56,156 --> 00:28:57,871
Dad ! Dad, wake up !

529
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:59,197
- What ?
- Somebody's here !

530
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,169
Who is that ? Calm down, everyone.

531
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,296
It's all right.

532
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:07,069
Danielle ?

533
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:10,921
What are you doing here ?

534
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:13,405
The others are coming.

535
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,845
You have only three choices...

536
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:18,383
Run,

537
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,837
hide...

538
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:23,277
or die.

539
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:26,025
Look, I know you're all scared.

540
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:28,794
All I can tell you right now
is that we do have a plan.

541
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,774
We've gotta go into the jungle to get some
supplies. We'll be back in a few hours.

542
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,801
Do everything you can to help
Michael get that raft on the water.

543
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:37,023
And after that,

544
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:38,725
go to the caves.

545
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,050
We'll be back as soon as we can.

546
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:42,635
Promise.

547
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:45,345
Hey, nice speech.

548
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:47,893
Plan's a little flawed,
but hey, nobody's perfect.

549
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,642
- My plan ?
- Yeah, your plan.

550
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:53,259
You're gonna go into the jungle and
get some dynamite and blow open a hatch,

551
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,088
and then you're gonna
hide everyone inside.

552
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,869
You want to keep a secret,
don't tell the fat guy.

553
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:02,483
I salvaged a few things for you.

554
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:04,620
This is the plane's radar emitter.

555
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:07,837
It needs to be mounted on the
mast or the top of the cabin.

556
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,880
This was in the plane's toolbox.

557
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,286
There's only one flare.

558
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,914
Choose wisely when you use it.

559
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:18,719
Going into the jungle
after the boom sticks, huh ?

560
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,611
Yeah.

561
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,889
By the time you get back,
we'll be in the water.

562
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,637
Guess this is pretty
much good-bye then.

563
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:28,852
Good luck, Sawyer.

564
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,019
Jack.

565
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:39,575
About a week before we
all got on the plane,

566
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:43,895
got to talking with this
man at a bar in Sydney.

567
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,891
He was an american, too.

568
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:47,769
Doctor.

569
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:51,515
It turns out this guy has a son.

570
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,949
Son's a doctor, too.

571
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,565
They'd had some kind
of big-time falling out.

572
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,875
The guy knew it was his fault,

573
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,988
even though his son was back in the
States thinking the same damn thing.

574
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:10,309
There's a pay phone in this bar,

575
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,153
and this guy...

576
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,065
tells me he wishes he had the stones
to pick up the phone and call his kid...

577
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:22,527
to tell him he's sorry,

578
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,843
and he's a better doctor
than he'll ever be...

579
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:28,637
that he's proud...

580
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,911
and he loves him.

581
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,220
I had to take off, but...

582
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,504
something tells me he never
got around to making that call.

583
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:54,232
One, two, three, lift !

584
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,017
and keep it straight !

585
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:57,517
Go, go !

586
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:58,855
Come on, go !

587
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:03,482
That's it !

588
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:10,583
We did it !

589
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:11,980
You...

590
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:17,739
<i>as one ship sets sail,</i>

591
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:22,577
<i>another provides needed supplies.</i>

592
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:29,951
Jack. John.

593
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:31,357
Over here.

594
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:35,608
How many do we need to blow the hatch ?

595
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:37,252
Two should take care of the hinge,

596
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:38,978
three to be safe.

597
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:39,777
"Safe."

598
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,198
So what's this stuff even do ?

599
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,370
Well, the transmitter
sends out an S. O. S.

600
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:51,967
in case someone's listening.

601
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:54,444
And if there's anything out there,

602
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,851
we'll see it on this radar screen here.

603
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,623
<i>In the journey to the hatch,</i>

604
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:02,901
<i>danger threatens.</i>

605
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:11,784
Yeah. I saw it.

606
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,667
Locke, what are you doing ?

607
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,720
- Locke ?
- Just let me go !

608
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:39,223
- What ?
- I'll be all right.

609
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:41,787
No ! Let me go ! I'll be all right.

610
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,255
I got it. I got it.

611
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,322
Be careful unwrapping it.

612
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:47,423
- Now throw it in.
- No ! It'll blow us up !

613
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:50,464
- Just do it ! Hurry ! I can't hold him !
- Don't do this, Kate ! Kate !

614
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,853
Know what I like about you, Mike ?

615
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,824
You got the patience of a saint.

616
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:05,283
Why do you say that ?

617
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:07,878
I've seen the way he talks to you.

618
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,696
I'd have showed him the back
of my hand a long time ago.

619
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,528
Is that what your father did to you ?

620
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:15,118
Daddy never got a chance to beat me.

621
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:17,994
Shot himself when I was 8.

622
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,579
That why you want to die, man ?

623
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:24,219
Since the day you told me you wanted
on this raft, I couldn't figure it out.

624
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:29,221
Why does a guy who only cares about himself
want to risk his life to save everyone else ?

625
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:31,511
You're either a hero,

626
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,252
or you want to die.

627
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,299
I ain't no hero, Mike.

628
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,479
What the hell was all that
about back there, John,

629
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:41,724
what was what about ?

630
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:42,964
You asked me to let you go.

631
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,833
That's right.

632
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,038
Now that thing was taking you down the
hole, and you asked me to let you go.

633
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,012
It wasn't gonna hurt me

634
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:48,421
No, John. It was gonna kill ya.

635
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:50,112
I seriously doubt that.

636
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:53,306
I need to know why you believe
that that thing wasn't...

637
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,335
I believe that I was being tested.

638
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:00,419
I think that's why you and i don't
see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

639
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,451
Because you're a man of science.

640
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,045
What does that make you ?

641
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,877
Well, I'm a man of faith.

642
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:10,409
Do you really think all this

643
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:11,818
is an accident ?

644
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:14,868
Do you think we crashed on
this place by coincidence ?

645
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,524
Especially this place ?

646
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,717
We were brought here for a purpose.

647
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:21,397
And who brought us here, John ?

648
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:23,139
The island.

649
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:25,487
It's destiny.

650
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,730
I don't believe in destiny.

651
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:29,972
Yes, you do.

652
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,019
You just don't know it yet.

653
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:37,342
Nothin'.

654
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:45,909
Is that what I think it is ?

655
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:48,011
Something's out there.

656
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:50,277
It's closer.

657
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,834
So what was that about back there ?

658
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,372
There's something that you need to know.

659
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,633
If we survive this, if
we survive tonight...

660
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:09,814
we're gonna have a Locke problem.

661
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:11,469
Are we ready ?

662
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:12,676
Wait a sec.

663
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,975
And I have to know
that you've got my back.

664
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:18,218
I got your back.

665
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:26,300
Hurley ! You've gotta get back.

666
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:51,342
<i>What does destiny hold for the
survivors of Oceanic flight 815 ?</i>

667
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:58,404
<i>And was it destiny that brought
them to this place of mystery ?</i>

668
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,797
<i>Where does their salvation lie ?</i>

669
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,216
Yo ! Hey !

670
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:26,097
Hey !

671
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,868
- We're saved !
- Oh, man,

672
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,324
are we glad to see you.

673
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,825
What are you folks
doing this far out here ?

674
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:36,921
We were in a plane... the plane crashed.
We've been on a island for months, man.

675
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,412
A plane crash, huh ?

676
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,185
Well, how about that ?

677
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,939
We're on an island. Flight
815. Hey, where are we ?

678
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:45,500
Hey, it's a good thing we found you.

679
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:49,011
Yeah, we survived, and there's a
whole group of people on the island.

680
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,256
Well, ain't that somethin' ?

681
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,207
Yeah !

682
00:37:53,496 --> 00:37:55,149
Only the thing is,

683
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:57,521
we're gonna have to take the boy.

684
00:37:59,117 --> 00:37:59,763
What ?

685
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,160
What did you say ?

686
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,403
The boy...

687
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:04,540
we're gonna have to take him.

688
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:07,311
Hey, what the hell is goin' on here ?

689
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,506
Who are you people ?

690
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:11,547
Just give us the boy.

691
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,099
I'm not givin' you anybody.

692
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,255
Well, all right, then.

693
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:26,989
Hey, hey !

694
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:28,739
Sawyer !

695
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,633
Dad ! Dad !

696
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,617
No ! Walt, no !

697
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:37,130
Dad !

698
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,402
Dad !

699
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:43,445
Walt !

700
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,662
No, dad, help me ! Dad !

701
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,689
Dad, help me !

702
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:53,880
Dad ! Please !

703
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:55,939
Dad !

704
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,254
Walt !

705
00:38:57,677 --> 00:38:59,508
Help me, dad !

706
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,469
Please, no !

707
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:02,749
Walt !

708
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:04,409
Walt !
