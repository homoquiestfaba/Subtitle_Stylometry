1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,052
Based on the book
<i>El Cartel de los Sapos </i>by Andrés López

2
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:13,055
and the characters in <i>El Cartel,
</i>the Caracol Television series

3
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:43,187
IN 1993, COLOMBIA PRODUCED 80%
OF THE WORLD'S COCAINE.

4
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,731
THE DRUG INDUSTRY
TAINTED THE COUNTRY

5
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,317
WITH BLOOD, VIOLENCE,
AND CORRUPTION.

6
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,868
<i>I swore to her
that I would never kill anyone.</i>

7
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,580
<i>That's what I promised her.</i>

8
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,499
<i>How did I get here?</i>

9
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,045
<i>How did this day come?</i>

10
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,259
<i>My name is Martín Gonzales.
They call me "Fresita."</i>

11
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,513
<i>Like many before me,
this story begins with someone...</i>

12
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>...picking cocaine leaves
in the Colombian jungle.</i>

13
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,981
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

14
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,822
<i>All right, let's begin.</i>

15
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:03,327
<i>We are in Cali, Colombia.
It is 1993.</i>

16
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,831
<i>I am at the wedding of Pepe,
my best friend, business partner...</i>

17
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,084
<i>...and the reason why
I got into drug trafficking ten years ago.</i>

18
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,629
<i>At that time,
there were two important Cartels:</i>

19
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,007
<i>the Medellin Cartel,
led by Pablo Escobar...</i>

20
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,720
<i>...and ours, the Cali Cartel.</i>

21
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:26,976
<i>Both Cartels were at war,
so we always had to watch our backs.</i>

22
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,530
Son, before you learn to speak,
you have to learn to dance.

23
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,909
This is boring.
Let's get this party started!

24
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,537
- Should I get the Mariachis?
- Forget them! Pay attention.

25
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:52,543
This is how you get
a party started!

26
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,922
Bunch of assholes!

27
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,716
Long live my brother Pepe!

28
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,346
11 YEARS EARLIER

29
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,770
Pay attention, boys.
This cutting cocaine thing isn't easy.

30
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,317
- Don Oscar, but what do we cut it with?
- With flour, with...

31
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,280
Shut up and pay attention!
With flour, with chalk, with anything.

32
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,992
Come on, Oscar.
Stop getting the kids into trouble.

33
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,496
From 1 kilo, you will get
1 1/3 kilos. No more.

34
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:34,085
If you get more, you fucked up.
Don't be greedy. Keep the client happy.

35
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,922
You cut it, others are going to cut it,
so what do you have left?

36
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,300
If you want to be in this business,
you have to buy socks.

37
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,803
- You can't go around looking like fools.
- Fools?

38
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:48,641
Listen! If you want people to fear
and respect you, you have to dress right.

39
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,852
Everything comes in
through the eyes.

40
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:54,647
In this business, you have to stand
in front of a lot of people.

41
00:05:55,565 --> 00:06:00,236
Fresita, with those eyes and a nice shirt,
you're going to get all the pussy.

42
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,280
No, Don Oscar.
I just want one.

43
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:06,826
- Look at this idiot. He's in love.
- You fool.

44
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:12,457
<i>That's Sofía, the girl I've been
in love with my entire life.</i>

45
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:19,130
Damn, she's fine!

46
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,631
Right?

47
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:24,427
Don't be a bum.
She's a good girl.

48
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,725
You've had me out here
hung-over for three hours!

49
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:36,397
You should pick up a better chick.
That bimbo doesn't even give you a glance.

50
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:43,279
Just because you only like skanks,
it doesn't make her a bimbo!

51
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,746
Why are you such a pig?

52
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,583
There she is.
Look! That's right stupid.

53
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,669
Seriously, look!

54
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,717
Wow. Sophie got hot.

55
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,981
- Who's that? Her boyfriend?
- No, it's just her friend from school.

56
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:24,112
Friend? Listen to this idiot.
You're the friend.

57
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:28,407
An imaginary one at that.

58
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,245
He's the trophy,
and you're the dirty little secret.

59
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:36,207
Dude, with those clothes,
they're never going to let you in there.

60
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,253
Listen, that girl is a princess,
the queen of her castle.

61
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:44,340
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're a rat. Hey mama, look up here!

62
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,093
My friend wants to meet you!
Up here!

63
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,516
Get up asshole, she's about to leave.
Won't you invite her to my wedding?

64
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:54,892
Later.

65
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,771
What? You make me wait here for
three hours to tell me that?

66
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,566
At least kick the shit out
that asshole. Asshole!

67
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,905
You pussy!

68
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,992
Who else?

69
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:16,247
Don't tell me you're
like this because of that bimbo!

70
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,126
No, I'm fine.
I just have a headache.

71
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,004
That's because you're
not fucking stupid.

72
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,508
- Stop being so annoying!
- Martín, listen to me, no listen!

73
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,636
Chicks...

74
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:36,558
Chicks like Sofía
aren't for people like you and me.

75
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,230
We're drug dealers, Martín.

76
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,653
We're not doctors or dentists.
We're drug dealers.

77
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,408
When you get that through your head,
you'll stop suffering.

78
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:57,955
Get up, asshole! I just got married!
Get up! Let's celebrate.

79
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:02,794
Are you gonna make me kick your ass?
Come on and make me!

80
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,927
<i>When Pepe got married,
we were living a great moment.</i>

81
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,304
<i>We had the world
at our fingertips.</i>

82
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,307
<i>We were in business.
We were all friends.</i>

83
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,852
<i>We sent massive drug shipments
to the U.S.A.</i>

84
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:24,023
<i>Except for the war
with Pablo Escobar...</i>

85
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:27,110
<i>...we were the kings of the world.</i>

86
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,781
<i>The Mambo Kings,
as they used to say.</i>

87
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,790
What's up, Cabo?

88
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,502
I don't know, Guadaña.

89
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,506
Something doesn't feel right.

90
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:56,347
Move, son.
Where is Pepe?

91
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,641
What?

92
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,437
Surprise!

93
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,814
What a great gift!
Oh, man!

94
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,317
Let's see what kind of stud
we're talking about.

95
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,987
Smell it, baby!
Smell it!

96
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,741
Get that cow out of here
and bring the next present! Let's see it!

97
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:21,289
Look son,
with a lot of love, you hear?

98
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,124
- Open up!
- What is it?

99
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,710
Open it, man!
Don't be so paranoid.

100
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,046
All right! Let's see.

101
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,965
Assholes!

102
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,762
Your firstborn!
Your firstborn!

103
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,812
- Where did you get this motherfucker?
- Your firstborn!

104
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:49,734
What a great doll!
Where do the batteries go?

105
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:53,279
Baby, come say hi to your son,
come on. Look at him!

106
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,374
<i>Do you know why the war
between the Cartels started?</i>

107
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,585
<i>Because of a woman.</i>

108
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,465
<i>A guy from the Cali Cartel had an affair with
the woman of a guy from the Medellín Cartel.</i>

109
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:16,177
<i>Pablo Escobar asked for his head,
but we refused.</i>

110
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,888
<i>So the war started.</i>

111
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:04,767
THE SNITCH CARTEL

112
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,697
I hope that will be enough
to get Escobar off our backs.

113
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,541
When we need more, I'll let you know.
This could get complicated.

114
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:33,379
<i>My head was somewhere else.</i>

115
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,301
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm late for class.

116
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,178
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

117
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:44,265
I was driving by and I thought
to myself, "I should study."

118
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,350
You should.

119
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,854
How are you girls doing?

120
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,940
Wait for me out there,
but don't leave without me.

121
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,988
- Why do you look so good?
- What do you want?

122
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,365
You smell good.

123
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,659
- What was our deal?
- Nice.

124
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,244
- What?
- What?

125
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,163
Why are you here?

126
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,583
Because I wanted to see you.

127
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,378
I was dying to see you.
Let's go grab a bite, or...

128
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,422
...what do you want to do?

129
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,217
I can't.
I have to go home and study.

130
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,929
- Ok, let's go. I'll take you.
- No.

131
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,765
You know I can't show up
at my house with you...

132
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,893
...and you can't come here
to look for me either.

133
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,230
- So?
- I have to go. Bye.

134
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,148
Hold on a sec.

135
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:37,443
- I brought you something.
- Put that away.

136
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:42,073
- Are you embarrassed? Open it.
- Don't bring me things at school...

137
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,784
...and don't send things
to my house.

138
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,661
Hey.

139
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:51,666
When are we going out?

140
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,000
I said I can't.

141
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,546
I can't, Martín.
How can I make you understand that?

142
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,756
What time? Where?

143
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,887
At 8:00.

144
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,559
Sharp!

145
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,203
How nice.

146
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:34,876
Guadañita, for you, man.
She's lactating.

147
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:42,175
My God, what a beautiful thing!
Where did you get her?

148
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:46,554
Were you simmering in the kitchen?

149
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:55,521
Gentlemen! Listen up!

150
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,690
A toast...

151
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:02,069
...to that piece of shit
that was making our lives a living hell!

152
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:06,032
Now he is in hell!

153
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,951
Cheers!

154
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,397
I'll be right back.

155
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:39,941
Hey!

156
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,610
- Hello, sir.
- <i>Fresita.</i>

157
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,072
<i>We are celebrating.</i>

158
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,074
<i>Come down to the farm.</i>

159
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,216
Let me guess.

160
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,469
It was the office
at 1:00 in the morning.

161
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,351
And you have to go.

162
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:20,398
Something came up.

163
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:26,070
I don't know anyone
that has something come up at this hour.

164
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:30,032
As far as I know,
you're not a doctor.

165
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,370
Martín, what are you
involved with?

166
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:40,668
You know I'm a businessman.

167
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:43,045
What kind of business
are you in?

168
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,215
All kinds of things.

169
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,968
- Cars, motorcycles, bicycles...
- Guns?

170
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,304
Drugs?

171
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,099
Why would you say that?

172
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,895
- Why?
- You think I was born yesterday?

173
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:04,901
You don't just leave me in the middle
of the dance floor to answer the phone.

174
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,361
- You have to take care of me!
- Hold on...

175
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,196
What? Why did you
bring me here?

176
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,865
- Relax. Come.
- Tell me.

177
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,452
- Let's dance the last song.
- What are you talking about?

178
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,790
What do you want? Why do you ask me out?
You always do this!

179
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,166
I want to be with you.

180
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,921
You're the most important thing to me
and that's what matters.

181
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,716
- Relax...
- Don't touch me.

182
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,677
I can really tell how
important I am to you.

183
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,014
When you have the balls to tell me
the truth, call me.

184
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:37,225
In the meantime
don't come near me!

185
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,627
Listen, Grillo.

186
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:09,882
Have you thought about how far
we're gonna go with all this?

187
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:12,844
Have you thought about it?

188
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:22,395
I think you and I
are gonna end up...

189
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:30,111
...rich as hell.

190
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,283
We're pussies if we don't.

191
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:40,079
Being friends with all these bosses.

192
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,375
I'm gonna tell you something Martín...

193
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:51,174
...my friend, these mother
fuckers better watch out.

194
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:55,178
Pablo Escobar can come back from
the dead and even he better watch out.

195
00:18:55,261 --> 00:19:00,475
My own brother is gonna have
to kiss my ass.

196
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,063
I'm gonna have a conversation
with God.

197
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:15,156
Carmen. God uses
her ass to speak to me.

198
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,001
What did you assholes
do with Carmen?

199
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,989
I love those flowers.

200
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,408
Who are they for?

201
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:09,794
You will catch a cold.
Take your shirt off.

202
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:14,841
<i>This is the other woman in my life.
May she forgive me for not naming her first.</i>

203
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,467
<i>My Grandmother.</i>

204
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:20,304
<i>My family.
She was my mother, my father.</i>

205
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,851
<i>She stood behind me,
even though she hated what I was doing.</i>

206
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,003
<i>The harbor of Buenaventura, where drugs
were leaving from, was well guarded.</i>

207
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,673
<i>So Pepe and I were looking for
a better way to send the drugs.</i>

208
00:20:56,007 --> 00:21:01,721
<i>Where we would make more
money and cut the Mexicans out.</i>

209
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:15,735
All right, Pepe. So, tell me,
what's this deal you keep going on about?

210
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:19,864
Listen up. First, you're crazy,
giving the Mexicans work.

211
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,159
They're paying you
with your own money...

212
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,453
...from your coke,
from your kitchen.

213
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:29,457
And this bullshit of sending tiny planes
with 1000 kilos. That's not gonna work.

214
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,586
Hold your horses! This shipment
was already promised to the Mexicans.

215
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,296
Break your promise.

216
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,635
These guys pay for 6000 kilos every 30 days.
We'll pay you every 7.

217
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:47,934
If you do the math, that's a margin
increase of 23.2%. You follow?

218
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:51,145
Add to that the fact that...

219
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:56,067
...the Mexicans cry about everything,
their crates, their fajitas,

220
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,903
We're gonna pay you
an extra five hundred a kilo.

221
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,157
Do the math again and
now your margin is up 108.3%.

222
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:07,703
Plus, I'll throw in the pilot
for free who charges 11%.

223
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:12,375
That puts the margin at 148.3%...

224
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,920
...more than you're making with
the Mexicans. What do you think?

225
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,721
Hey, how does this thing work?

226
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:39,444
<i>Don't worry, Oscar.</i>

227
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:44,365
No, there is no problem, seriously.
Goodbye, Oscar.

228
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,493
That motherfucker...

229
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,454
Fuck him!

230
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,169
All set, uncle.

231
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,090
Everything at the airport is good to go.
Whatever we need.

232
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:02,842
Don't worry about it.

233
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,260
What?

234
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:07,513
Fucking Colombians
cancelled the shipment.

235
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:10,892
- What happened?
- I don't know! He just canceled it!

236
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,102
- Damn it!
- So?

237
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:17,398
So we have to cancel the airport,
the captain and the plane.

238
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,150
Go, hurry up!

239
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,988
You're so cheap.

240
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,783
At least hire some people
to help us load this shit.

241
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:30,077
Not cheap, cautious.
There's a difference.

242
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,247
The less amount of people
that know about this the better.

243
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:36,834
- What about when we take it to Miami?
- Listen to him. Are you stupid?

244
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,670
Do you think I've been shopping
for eight days?

245
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:43,633
Don't worry about it.
I have everything ready.

246
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:45,968
All right, but come help.

247
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:50,264
What don't you understand about
me having a small hernia in my back!?

248
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,187
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

249
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,903
WHEN AND WHERE?
I MISS YOU. Martín

250
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:08,116
- We have to put in a little extra work.
- We have to?

251
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:11,786
Yes. Coke doesn't have legs.
We can't teach it to walk.

252
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,956
I'll tell you something else,
this route is perfect...

253
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,166
...because it's discrete, understand?

254
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,919
We'll be suck on this titty
for two or three years...

255
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,964
And the boat? It's poetry in motion.
Did you think we were going in a canoe?

256
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,924
This is American gold, my friend.

257
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:59,584
Stop, stop.

258
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,086
Put it in there!

259
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,713
Where are you going?

260
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,134
- Watch out!
- Don't worry!

261
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,388
Relax, dude!

262
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:13,848
Dude!

263
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:21,022
That was lovely.

264
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:34,660
<i>Before 9/11 sending money through
the airport from Miami to Colombia...</i>

265
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:37,413
<i>...was as easy as spending it.</i>

266
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,958
<i>Ten hundreds to a guy in Miami...</i>

267
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,629
<i>...five to another guy in Cali,
and mission accomplished.</i>

268
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,208
- Cool!
- Here!

269
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:32,927
This motherfucker.

270
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,221
Come here, Fresita!

271
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,436
You're learning fast.

272
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:05,293
That's right. Keep coming.

273
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,336
Fine. Follow my voice.

274
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,130
Here.

275
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,257
Here, here. Come here.

276
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,884
- Martín!
- Okay, stop.

277
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,511
One...

278
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:17,346
...two...

279
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,098
...three!

280
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,318
That house you see there...

281
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,528
...is yours.

282
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,616
That car is also yours.

283
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:41,537
I am yours.

284
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:47,001
<i>I'll show you the rest of the house, dear.
There are four bedrooms here, right?</i>

285
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:50,755
Since we'll have a bunch of kids,
we can put one in each room.

286
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:55,968
If we want to have more, we can build
a tall tower over there to put the rest.

287
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:59,180
You know,
where we can keep all our kids.

288
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:04,352
Look at this pool, for example.
I already want to rebuild this.

289
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:07,480
We can make it
about 12 feet longer that way.

290
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,524
If this house is too small,
we can buy another.

291
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,777
I will buy you whatever you want.
What do you want?

292
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,905
I don't want to suffer.

293
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:23,121
I'm not gonna
let you suffer, my love.

294
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:27,917
I want you to be
the happiest woman in the world.

295
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:32,713
I don't want you to worry about anything.
I will always take care of you.

296
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,507
Okay?

297
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,386
You know, I've been thinking...

298
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,268
...and I want to get out of this business
so we can live in peace.

299
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,148
Promise.

300
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:54,235
I don't wanna live without you.
I can't...

301
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,154
Promise.

302
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,202
I promise.

303
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,310
<i>Sofía!</i>

304
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:32,815
<i>Sofía is a name of Greek origin
that means "wisdom."</i>

305
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:37,361
<i>They say that people named Sofía
have strong personalities.</i>

306
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:39,864
<i>They are kind, easy-going...</i>

307
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:45,578
<i>...gentle, well mannered, and sharp.</i>

308
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:49,832
<i>And they like everything
that is pure and luminous...</i>

309
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,628
<i>...two qualities I didn't have
at the time.</i>

310
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:34,168
<i>With Escobar dead,
the heat was back on us.</i>

311
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,720
<i>The Colombian government signed
an extradition agreement with the U.S.A...</i>

312
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:47,765
<i>...to send drug dealers
to American prisons.</i>

313
00:30:55,648 --> 00:31:00,445
<i>Heads of the Cali Cartel made a decision
that could've changed everything.</i>

314
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:07,326
First of all, Don Oscar,
thank you for coming to my house.

315
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,453
Excuse us.

316
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,584
With all of your people.

317
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:19,255
Of course.
We did exactly as you asked.

318
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,217
I called all of you down here
to make you a proposition.

319
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,013
It is something that will change...

320
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:30,975
...the course of our lives
and the history...

321
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:33,311
...of this country.

322
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:43,905
Today we want to dismantle
the drug trade in Colombia.

323
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:50,578
This, of course, comes with
some very important guarantees for us.

324
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,539
We've already talked
to the District Attorney.

325
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,542
Hold on a minute.

326
00:31:58,044 --> 00:32:01,756
It's one thing for you
to make a proposition...

327
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,969
...and another for you to tell us
that we have to end the drug trade.

328
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,555
Will someone please clear that up?

329
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,475
Don Oscar, this business
has to come to an end.

330
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,186
It's the best thing for all of us.

331
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,980
We only have to serve out
a short prison sentence.

332
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,690
Five years maximum.

333
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:22,944
The government is even going
to let us keep our money...

334
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,197
...without having to pay any taxes.

335
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:29,033
With such guarantees...

336
00:32:29,117 --> 00:32:31,953
...why would we keep trafficking?

337
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:38,918
I know that
what you're saying is good.

338
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:45,007
But just because you made
a deal with the D.A...

339
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,929
...doesn't mean we have to stop
doing what we do. Right?

340
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,307
Why don't you speak up, son?
Let us all hear you.

341
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:00,773
What was I gonna say?

342
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:02,984
I admire and respect you, but...

343
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:08,906
...it's easy to retire
when you're already rich.

344
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,701
What about us?
We're just starting out.

345
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,329
I didn't go to school,
and I'm not going back now.

346
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,875
I also don't agree.

347
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:23,129
I owe a lot of money
from my production.

348
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,341
Who's going to be
responsible for that?

349
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,719
The money you have now
is not enough?

350
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:31,679
Of course it's enough.

351
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,682
But why would I pay it out
if I don't have to?

352
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:37,602
All of us here
have a lot of debt.

353
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:42,565
If your proposition
includes you paying them...

354
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:46,652
Listen, son, no one here is going
to pay the debts of anyone.

355
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:49,405
In a couple of days,
the business is over.

356
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:55,036
Don Oscar, when this meeting is over,
I ask you to talk to your people.

357
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:04,545
Well, I'm afraid will have
to do it yourself.

358
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,255
Look.

359
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,301
Here they are.

360
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,306
Excuse me.

361
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,163
Anyone else?

362
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:43,333
You know how we fix this?

363
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,254
Bullets.

364
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:51,551
We can't let our guard down.

365
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,846
Guadañita is right, Don Oscar.

366
00:34:56,054 --> 00:35:02,186
This got sour and we need
to take them out of circulation.

367
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:14,031
- We will not solve this with guns.
- Don Oscar.

368
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:16,659
Don Leonardo...

369
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,744
A minute, please.

370
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:29,672
Listen, if you want to stay
in the business, fine...

371
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,799
...but do it outside of Cali.

372
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:33,634
Not in our city.

373
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,263
Since when do you own this city,
Don Leonardo?

374
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:39,140
With all due respect.

375
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,144
I know you. You're not looking
to start any problems with us.

376
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:46,147
I know you feel the same way.

377
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:50,693
Fortunately, Colombia and the Valley
are big enough for the both of us.

378
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:55,198
<i>Don Oscar had become so powerful that
he faced the top bosses of the Cali cartel.</i>

379
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:59,202
<i>That is how the Cartel del Norte del Valle
was officially born.</i>

380
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:04,415
<i>- With it came another power struggle.
</i>- My proposal is simple.

381
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,461
I am under pressure
from the competition.

382
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:11,130
<i>They don't let me work in peace.</i>

383
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,883
<i>They are affecting my business.</i>

384
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:17,053
<i>That is why...</i>

385
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:21,390
...I would like for them to travel.

386
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,106
A tour or something temporary?

387
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:33,736
Freeze!
National Police! Hands up!

388
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,154
Temporary.

389
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,074
A paid vacation.

390
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:47,125
A permanent visa would be nice.
A resident visa, for example.

391
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,626
Mr. Nacho Soto Mayor?

392
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:53,381
Can I finish eating?

393
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:55,716
How much is a
permanent resident visa?

394
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:58,970
We have always
come to an agreement.

395
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,181
I like doing business with you.

396
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:12,775
<i>By handing the Cali bosses over to
the police, Don Oscar was winning the war...</i>

397
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,195
<i>...and we were gaining confidence.</i>

398
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,115
<i>Then our biggest adversary
came into the picture:</i>

399
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:21,117
<i>the DEA.</i>

400
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:28,958
<i>Becoming a snitch is easy.</i>

401
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:34,964
<i>First, you have to tell them everything
you know in exchange for future benefits.</i>

402
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:39,886
<i>Then you negotiate your sentence,
and hand over most of your money...</i>

403
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:43,848
<i>...and finally,
you agree to protective custody.</i>

404
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:47,018
<i>The temptation was great...</i>

405
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,815
<i>...for a lot of people, even if it meant
looking over their shoulder...</i>

406
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,151
<i>...for the rest of their lives.</i>

407
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,790
Thank you for cooperating.

408
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:15,505
Amen.

409
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:23,930
<i>In the meantime, I repeat the same thing
to myself 33,000 times a day:</i>

410
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:27,183
<i>pure and luminous,
pure and luminous...</i>

411
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:31,687
<i>...pure and luminous,
pure and luminous, pure and luminous...</i>

412
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,081
- What is this asshole's problem?
- Shut up.

413
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:53,084
I can't hear what he's saying.
He talks really fast.

414
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,365
- What is he saying?
- This piece of shit is pissing me off.

415
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,292
- What does he want?
- Quiet!

416
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,822
Tell me.
What did he say?

417
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,618
I'll explain everything.

418
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:13,748
Check it out: 21 karats.

419
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:18,628
Figures. You start doing well
and you start showing off.

420
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:21,631
What do you mean?
I don't work in a bank. I'm a thug.

421
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:24,759
I am serious, Pepe.
Stop fooling around.

422
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:29,472
Take off all of those chains.
I don't want you showing off.

423
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,809
The Mexicans are fuming
because I didn't send them that shipment.

424
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm sending them a boat
with 15 tons of coke.

425
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,232
- What?
- How many?

426
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,984
15,000 kilos, son.
That's how this business works.

427
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:47,615
You bet small, you win small.
You bet big, you win big.

428
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:51,619
- What about us?
- Like wet dogs, outside looking in.

429
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,830
That's why I called you.

430
00:40:53,913 --> 00:40:58,376
I want you to go in
with me, 50/50.

431
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,170
Are you serious?

432
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:02,672
I'm very serious.

433
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:08,636
Let's do it! But we're low on cash right now.
This is what we can do.

434
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,473
We put down $3 million,
and you put up the other $3 million.

435
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,186
- Damn it.
- What do you think, bro?

436
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,776
That's why you're the boss.

437
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,988
<i>I promised Sofía that
I was getting out of the business...</i>

438
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,074
<i>...but every day
I was getting in deeper.</i>

439
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,663
Good morning, gentlemen.

440
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,298
Can you explain what Oscar Cadena's boat
is doing on my ocean?

441
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,135
This is a fishing boat, sir.

442
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:57,977
Get the shipment out of the cabin,
kill these assholes, and sink the boat.

443
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:03,524
No, Pepe!
That is not how things work.

444
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:06,611
You cannot tell me you lost it,

445
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,489
it got confiscated,
or someone stole it.

446
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:14,160
This is a serious business,
and you have to own up.

447
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:18,664
You and Martín have one month
to get me my money.

448
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,876
One month! Goodbye!
I will see you here.

449
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:28,424
<i>Pure and luminous,
pure and luminous...</i>

450
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,094
<i>Pure and luminous,
pure and luminous...</i>

451
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,556
Can you pass me the lime,
my love?

452
00:42:42,438 --> 00:42:44,190
Someone came
by here yesterday.

453
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:46,275
Who?

454
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,694
Someone asking about you.

455
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,950
They said
you owe them money.

456
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:00,373
And?

457
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:02,583
Did they hurt you?

458
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,962
They came for the deed
of the house.

459
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:07,171
What house?

460
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:12,093
This one.
The only one I have.

461
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,934
What did they look like?

462
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:23,521
They were thugs.
Like you.

463
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,046
What's going on, bro?

464
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,300
Aren't we supposed to have a month
to pay your brother back?

465
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:57,138
Someone shook my grandma down.
My grandma!

466
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:01,225
- Who's the asshole?
- How the fuck would I know?

467
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:04,103
Why do you think
I'm looking for your ass?

468
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:09,442
For once in your life,
stop acting like such a little bitch.

469
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,029
Don't fuck with me
right now, asshole.

470
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,243
Martín.

471
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:21,496
What?

472
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:22,705
Come over here.

473
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:25,082
- Just tell me, man.
- Come over here.

474
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:30,338
What?

475
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:33,716
Did you hear the DEA
came down on Hugo?

476
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,093
What?

477
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,971
Supposedly they offered him a deal
to lower his sentence.

478
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:42,642
Said they would get his family
a house in Miami.

479
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,103
And?

480
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:48,898
Guess.

481
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:58,407
<i>Now what?</i>

482
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:01,160
"Now what?"

483
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:04,872
Now we celebrate the fact that
that piece of shit is dead.

484
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:07,166
Celebrate?

485
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,794
Cele...

486
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:13,172
Celebrate what, asshole?

487
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:16,634
I just told you someone went
to my grandmother's house!

488
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,345
Celebrate what, motherfucker?

489
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,725
<i>Pure and luminous,
pure and luminous...</i>

490
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,644
<i>...pure and luminous...</i>

491
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:31,357
Pack that shit well. I don't have
any cash right now, but pack it up.

492
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,026
Don Pepe,
I'll have to ask Don Oscar.

493
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:40,908
You call him. You're the one
that's gonna get it. Call him.

494
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,954
He's actually calling.

495
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:48,541
We're going from bad to worse.

496
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:53,379
You're like a porcelain thug.
You get dropped and you break.

497
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:57,550
My brother gave us a month
to pay him back. What else we can do?

498
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:00,762
You gonna sell the house
you bought that bimbo? Your car?

499
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:03,723
The only thing
you know how to do is this.

500
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:07,268
A thug's debt gets paid with thug's work.
We do this deal...

501
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:10,813
...and pray we have something left.
Maybe we get up from this one.

502
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:13,191
- How do we do it?
- With the Mexicans.

503
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:16,611
- They pay $6,000 a kilo.
- What? Did you forget what happened?

504
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:19,614
If you're afraid,
then let's stay home.

505
00:46:19,697 --> 00:46:22,492
Why don't you call the Mexicans?
You're the one who knows them.

506
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:25,203
No?

507
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:27,455
Son of a bitch!

508
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:32,543
Don't even think about asking me
for the car again!

509
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:39,759
- Now what?
- I don't know. Let's sell the house.

510
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:44,180
<i>Don Oscar found out
that Don Nacho...</i>

511
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:48,643
<i>...escaped from prison
and had plans to kill him.</i>

512
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:50,353
Fuck you!

513
00:47:15,753 --> 00:47:17,672
Hello, Emanuel.

514
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:22,301
Don Leonardo.

515
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:24,178
Oscar.

516
00:47:24,262 --> 00:47:25,763
Excuse me.

517
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:27,348
Come in.

518
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,528
Hey, Cabito.

519
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:43,072
Nice to see you, sir.

520
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:49,287
What are you thinking?

521
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:51,831
Do you want to start a war?

522
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,749
<i>War is what they got.</i>

523
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:22,445
I can't wait till this comes through
and we each buy a plane...

524
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:25,281
...so we can smoke weed in it.
Yo, mama!

525
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,576
Come here!
What's going on with the food?

526
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:31,037
Do we have to wait
for these assholes to get hungry?

527
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,831
No, sir, in a few minutes,
we will begin our services.

528
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:37,794
If she's not back soon, I'm gonna
go up there for some self service.

529
00:48:37,877 --> 00:48:41,297
Damn, what's that smell?
Are you nervous or something?

530
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:45,510
<i>Pepe was the top boss' brother,
and that's what was saving his ass.</i>

531
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:50,598
<i>I, on the other hand,
was already planning my own funeral.</i>

532
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:54,560
<i>We needed help
getting rid of our debt...</i>

533
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:58,564
<i>...and we were both desperate enough
to ask the enemy for help.</i>

534
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:01,192
Do you know what I like
about this restaurant?

535
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:08,116
That it's nice and calm.
All the customers are serene.

536
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:11,828
Well, getting back to our business,

537
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:16,415
I'll buy the merchandise here
but nothing else.

538
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,253
Well, Don Modesto,
we were thinking that maybe...

539
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:24,048
...we could pick up
some cargo here in Mexico...

540
00:49:24,132 --> 00:49:27,593
...and we could go in as partners
when it crosses the border.

541
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:33,766
That is exactly what cannot happen.
I work alone.

542
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:35,643
- Don Modesto...
- Stop.

543
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,728
That's final.

544
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:40,106
Waiter! Come here.

545
00:49:41,941 --> 00:49:43,109
Take this money.

546
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:46,904
Pay everyone's bill.
You can keep the rest as a tip.

547
00:49:46,988 --> 00:49:50,074
Go. Courtesy of Modesto.

548
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:53,077
We also ask you
about something else.

549
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:57,165
I don't know if you heard, but a few days ago
we lost a shipment in these waters.

550
00:49:57,248 --> 00:50:00,376
- Do you know anything about it?
- Yes, yes.

551
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,544
Yes?

552
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:04,672
Here in Mexico
we call that "sinking."

553
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:07,967
Of course.

554
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:14,265
Since these are your waters.
I mean you control them, we thought...

555
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,726
- You don't believe me?
- Of course we do!

556
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:20,521
He means since that was my brother's boat,
there was a lot of money invested...

557
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:22,106
You don't believe me.

558
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,317
No, sir, we believe you.

559
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,569
Okay, enough!

560
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:30,698
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

561
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:32,784
- Goodbye.
- Bye, sir.

562
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:38,831
The bill is settled, but in Oscar's name,
you two will pay for my meal.

563
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,626
- Of course, sir. It's our pleasure.
- Bye.

564
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:42,794
Let's go.

565
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,421
- Old faggot fuck.
- Shut up, you idiot.

566
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:59,894
Listen, man, you know
who I have to deal with.

567
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:03,314
500 kilos isn't enough
for the truck driver.

568
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:08,194
God is the one that makes
miracles happen, not me.

569
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:14,200
500 kilos. Listen to this guy.
We're not street dealers.

570
00:51:14,784 --> 00:51:18,663
We have to go in with
at least--at least 1500.

571
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:23,376
1500 is another conversation.
With 1500 we can make something happen.

572
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:28,005
Where are we gonna
get 1500 kilos?

573
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,760
His name is Grenade.
Guadaña gave him to me.

574
00:51:33,219 --> 00:51:35,012
- It's perfect.
- Right?

575
00:51:35,096 --> 00:51:36,889
For Christmas dinner.

576
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,146
No, I kind of like him.
I'm thinking of keeping him as a mascot.

577
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:46,691
Watch, he listens.

578
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:49,402
Give me your hand.

579
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:52,780
Give me your hand.

580
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:55,116
Give me your hand, motherfucker!

581
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,244
I think I can train him
in a month.

582
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:07,295
Cabo, listen...
We were thinking...

583
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:10,465
What are the odds of you doing
a little business with us?

584
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:14,260
Eat shit.

585
00:52:15,136 --> 00:52:17,263
A business deal?

586
00:52:19,182 --> 00:52:22,477
You still owe Don Oscar
a lot of money.

587
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,272
Come on, man. You know
I'm gonna come through for you.

588
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,983
We need you to lend us
a couple kilos to do a run.

589
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:32,820
Get some cash to take our girlfriends out
to suck on some lollipops.

590
00:52:32,904 --> 00:52:35,531
How much?

591
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,576
With like 1500,
I think we're good.

592
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:39,702
1500?

593
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:43,539
Come on. You're gonna
hold on to 1500 kilos?

594
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:46,876
You have that shit under your mattress.
Come on, man.

595
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:50,338
Aren't you gonna
say anything, Fresita?

596
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,593
Borrow us that shit, Cabo.
You know I'll come through. I'm your guy.

597
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:01,766
- I really wanted to see you.
- How bad?

598
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,811
- Really bad.
- Oh, yeah?

599
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:08,272
Me, too.

600
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:14,779
I love you.

601
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:37,135
Is it good?

602
00:53:39,637 --> 00:53:42,223
Nasty. Get that shit
out of my face.

603
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,394
- How is it?
- Pure and luminous.

604
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,730
"Pure and luminous"?

605
00:53:57,947 --> 00:54:01,993
<i>Any way you can think of
to get cocaine into the United States...</i>

606
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:06,205
<i>...you can be sure it has been tried
by a drug trafficker.</i>

607
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:10,126
<i>Cars, submarines,
airplanes, helicopters...</i>

608
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:13,212
<i>...boats, trucks, tunnels,
and the classic one:</i>

609
00:54:13,296 --> 00:54:19,093
<i>a set of balls big enough to take it
over the border yourself, like we were doing.</i>

610
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:31,731
<i>While we were in Tijuana,
crossing the border...</i>

611
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:34,942
<i>...in Colombia,
Don Oscar was turning himself in.</i>

612
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:43,117
<i>Just like he'd agreed to do
with Colonel Ramiro Gutierrez.</i>

613
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:53,544
<i>I need to speak to you.</i>

614
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:58,216
I want to be with you.
I miss you too much.

615
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:00,384
Did you get the flowers I sent?

616
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:04,847
I don't want your flowers. I want you
to come home, to be here with me.

617
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:08,226
What's wrong, my love?
I'll be back soon. Two or three days.

618
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:13,022
- You said that last week.
<i>- I promise. I'll be home soon.</i>

619
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:15,191
Don't make promises.

620
00:55:16,192 --> 00:55:20,238
I really need to talk to you.
If you really care, come home now.

621
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,210
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

622
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:39,006
...pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

623
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:53,980
What?

624
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:56,732
Shit! Motherfucker!
No! Shit!

625
00:55:56,816 --> 00:56:01,946
No! Motherfucker, motherfucker!
Motherfucker, motherfucker!

626
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:04,949
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

627
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:14,584
Are you okay?
What happened?

628
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:18,629
Dude, what happened?
What is it?

629
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,466
Dude, what is it?
What is it?

630
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:23,843
They killed my brother,
Goddamn it!

631
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,136
What?

632
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,264
They killed my brother, man.

633
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:29,640
No way.

634
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,727
They killed my brother.

635
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,813
<i>When people start talking
and giving other people up...</i>

636
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:38,733
<i>...paranoia sets in
and people start getting killed.</i>

637
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:41,277
<i>Eventually, your past catches you up.</i>

638
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,615
<i>Don Oscar's past
had a proper name:</i>

639
00:56:47,283 --> 00:56:48,367
<i>Two Wheels.</i>

640
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:51,579
<i>...and suddenly, the TV signal cut out.</i>

641
00:56:52,163 --> 00:56:55,458
When the signal came back,
America had already lost the game.

642
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,586
This guy, Aguirre Peña,
scored a goal.

643
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:00,338
<i>Another drink?</i>

644
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:03,299
If we didn't win, then Cali
wasn't going to win either.

645
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,927
Don Oscar,
this is for my brother, Hugo.

646
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,139
Oh shit.

647
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:43,256
<i>Pepe went back to Colombia for
his brother's funeral and stayed.</i>

648
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:48,469
<i>Even though Don Oscar was dead,
I still owed him a lot of money.</i>

649
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,180
<i>In this business people die...</i>

650
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:53,808
<i>...but debts are inherited.</i>

651
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:03,693
<i>With Don Oscar dead, El Cabo
stepped in to run the Cartel.</i>

652
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:05,611
...you owe me?

653
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,614
How can you say that?
Calm down Cabo.

654
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,160
You're putting the cart
before the horse.

655
00:58:13,411 --> 00:58:16,289
Are you selling it by the gram?

656
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:19,125
I'd prefer if we don't talk
about this over the phone.

657
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:22,086
Why do you defend this asshole?

658
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,925
Listen, motherfucker!

659
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:31,596
<i>While you're over there
scratching your balls...</i>

660
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,057
...we're at war down here
waiting for your contribution.

661
00:58:35,558 --> 00:58:36,934
Why do you say that Cabo?

662
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:40,605
Pepe and we decided
that the money you owed the late...

663
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:44,984
<i>...Don Oscar is going towards killing all
those faggots and avenging his death.</i>

664
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:50,031
So get me that money
and get it to me fast.

665
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,743
You'll have to wait, because
we don't have money right now.

666
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:55,077
Wait?

667
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,121
Listen to this asshole.

668
00:58:57,205 --> 00:58:59,040
Wait how long?

669
00:58:59,123 --> 00:59:02,418
<i>Don't forget
the fifteen hundred tamales...</i>

670
00:59:02,502 --> 00:59:06,631
...you're using to make
money for yourself are mine.

671
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:10,551
I lent those to Pepe temporarily.

672
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:12,762
When are you gonna give them back?

673
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:15,431
Or should I take my money
from your paycheck?

674
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:17,517
What's your problem?

675
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:23,731
Things around here aren't that easy.
All I need is time.

676
00:59:23,815 --> 00:59:26,692
One week. No more.

677
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:29,862
What's going on?

678
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,742
<i>All I wanted at that point
was to sell the drugs...</i>

679
00:59:34,826 --> 00:59:37,495
<i>...for as much money as possible
and retire.</i>

680
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:40,123
<i>So I could finally live
in peace with Sofía.</i>

681
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:41,374
It's done.

682
00:59:41,457 --> 00:59:45,211
Multiply 1500 by $12,000 and
that's what we can sell it to my boys for.

683
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,798
Dude, if we go to New York
we can sell it for twice as much.

684
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:53,511
- Are we in New York or LA?
- The money is in New York.

685
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:58,015
Over there we can sell it for
twelve thousand more per kilo.

686
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:01,144
And five thousand
miles of risk per kilo.

687
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:03,980
The real risk was crossing
the border.

688
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:07,733
We're the ones doing all the work
and the Americans buy it here...

689
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,986
...and sell it there for twice as much.

690
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:13,489
- Are you American?
- No, but I'm not an idiot either.

691
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:17,493
- We can get more money of this.
- I've already told you, bro.

692
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:20,746
- Relax, it's just business.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

693
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:25,042
We can sell if for twice as much.
Twice as much.

694
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:36,179
- Hello?
- Hey, grandma.

695
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:39,932
- How are you?
<i>- Fine. We're on our way to New York</i>.

696
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:42,351
What are you doing there?

697
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:44,729
I have to do a bit of shopping.

698
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,106
<i>I'm calling to ask
for my cousin's address.</i>

699
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,150
<i>I want to stop in.</i>

700
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,363
Okay, this is in Queens right?

701
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:59,994
Okay, I'll tell them.

702
01:01:00,578 --> 01:01:01,913
Big kiss. I love you.

703
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:04,040
Me too. Take care.

704
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,925
Hey...

705
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:15,843
What's going on, cuz?

706
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:17,011
Welcome!

707
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:18,221
What's up?

708
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:20,515
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

709
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:24,811
- Damian.
- Hi, bro.

710
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:28,022
A friend from Mexico.
Clarita my cousin, Gustavo.

711
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:29,941
Come in.

712
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:33,027
- Hey, Amelia.
- Hi.

713
01:01:33,111 --> 01:01:34,529
- Hey, Juan.
- Hi.

714
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:37,115
- How have you been?
- Good, thanks.

715
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,450
Very nice.

716
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,413
- When is our first meeting tomorrow?
- 11:30, in Brooklyn.

717
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:46,374
Hey...

718
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,751
You pray?

719
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:51,421
You have to give thanks.

720
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,155
- Good to see you.
- You too.

721
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:21,534
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is Fresita home?

722
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:23,744
- Martín is not here.
- He's not here?

723
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:26,456
- No.
- Wait, dude. Hey, dude!

724
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:29,000
You asshole.

725
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:32,712
Excuse me.

726
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:43,723
Sofía, right?

727
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,433
Yes.

728
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:48,269
Have you spoken to Fresita?

729
01:02:52,857 --> 01:02:58,029
Because he owes me some money
and he doesn't want to pay up.

730
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:03,493
He hasn't told me where he is
or when he's coming back.

731
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:06,078
Really?

732
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:07,914
No.

733
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:09,624
Hey Cabo...

734
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,002
This is a pretty nice house, huh?

735
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:18,341
Fresita has good taste.

736
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:26,099
Cabo, Cabo,
let me take care of this.

737
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,029
Have a nice day.

738
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,914
What's going on, Pepe?

739
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:53,835
- Nothing's wrong. Relax.
- What do you mean? Tell me.

740
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:58,673
Martín owes money to Cabo
and he hasn't shown up, so they're worried.

741
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,300
Don't worry.
I'll calm them down.

742
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:05,346
And, you know, if Martín shows up,
tell him to call me.

743
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,810
Call me, all right?

744
01:04:14,105 --> 01:04:15,231
Pepe...

745
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,986
I'm really sorry
about your brother.

746
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,572
Damn...

747
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:26,325
How are you?

748
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,872
Not good.

749
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,543
Come here.

750
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,388
Since he died, its been nothing
but problems, and violence, and debt.

751
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,687
Relax...

752
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:11,746
Pepe, let me go.
What are you doing?

753
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:14,290
What are you doing?

754
01:05:17,794 --> 01:05:20,421
Don't do this, Pepe, please!

755
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:22,256
No! I beg you.

756
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,509
No, please! Please!

757
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:26,094
Help!

758
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:27,762
Pepe, I'm pregnant!

759
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,477
Get out of my house.

760
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,022
Your house?
Who do you think you are, cunt?

761
01:05:38,106 --> 01:05:42,443
You're nothing but a drug dealer's wife,
you stupid bitch!

762
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,183
Where is he?

763
01:07:56,953 --> 01:07:58,955
Hey, Martín!

764
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,057
- Ready.
- The money?

765
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:04,312
Your money is in the trunk.
Here.

766
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:08,566
Hi.

767
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,527
Colombian, right?

768
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:12,779
From where?

769
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,535
Freeze!

770
01:09:21,496 --> 01:09:23,663
Where's your gun?

771
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:26,584
I don't have one.
Calm down.

772
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:31,339
Don't look at me!

773
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:33,256
Stay calm.

774
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,859
See what happens,
you fucking cunts!

775
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:56,489
Piece-of-shit motherfuckers!

776
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:53,755
Wait, man. Hey!

777
01:10:53,838 --> 01:10:56,382
Let me go!

778
01:10:56,466 --> 01:10:58,050
What's going on?

779
01:10:58,134 --> 01:10:59,135
Martín!

780
01:12:04,492 --> 01:12:06,285
What do you want?

781
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,872
I'm looking for Sofía.

782
01:12:09,956 --> 01:12:11,958
She doesn't want to see you.

783
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:17,422
Let her tell me.
Call her, please.

784
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:21,259
- She doesn't want to see you.
- Call her!

785
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:26,222
Sorry.

786
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:41,362
Sofi, come on.

787
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:48,703
I'm sorry.

788
01:12:52,373 --> 01:12:55,001
I can imagine
how you must feel.

789
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:04,385
But this was it for me.

790
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:07,805
It's too late, Martín.

791
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:12,101
Get this through your head:

792
01:13:12,185 --> 01:13:15,563
I never want to see you again.

793
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:19,817
- Never.
- Sofi.

794
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,571
Never.

795
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,591
Hey, look who's here.

796
01:13:46,803 --> 01:13:49,514
I can't believe it.

797
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:55,353
The great cunt is back
from Disney World to visit the poor.

798
01:13:56,354 --> 01:13:58,314
What's going on, Fresita?

799
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,650
Were you lost?

800
01:14:00,733 --> 01:14:06,322
Even the pig
was asking about you.

801
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:11,869
Oh, yeah? He must not be happy
about what you did to him last night.

802
01:14:14,914 --> 01:14:18,626
Here's the money
from the 1500 kilos.

803
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:28,302
What about my interest?

804
01:14:28,386 --> 01:14:31,013
Come on, Cabo.
At least he brought it.

805
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,599
Don't worry.
Your share is ready, too.

806
01:14:35,435 --> 01:14:37,562
Bye.

807
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:40,314
Hey, Fresita.
Fresita, come back.

808
01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:43,901
Where are you going?

809
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:48,114
We love you around here.

810
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:49,991
Right, Cabo?

811
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:51,659
I wanna ask you
for a small favor.

812
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:54,495
Now that you're going to Mexico...

813
01:14:54,579 --> 01:14:59,375
...bring me back a Mexican outfit.

814
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:03,796
The hat, the buckle,
and the boots.

815
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,716
To go out and pick up chicks.

816
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,639
Listen to this one: The only things
he picks up are dead bodies.

817
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,019
I can't help you there.
I'm not going to Mexico anytime soon.

818
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:19,604
What?

819
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:24,567
- You haven't told him?
- Stop being such a loud mouth.

820
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:27,987
You haven't told me what?

821
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:36,913
Fresita, Cabo, and I were thinking,
and we want you to go to Mexico.

822
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:39,707
You will be our contact up there.
That's the order.

823
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:44,337
- What?
- We don't want you to lose more shipments.

824
01:15:45,922 --> 01:15:48,382
That I lost?

825
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:51,177
Are you stupid or something?

826
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:56,557
First of all, <i>we </i>lost them.
Or don't you remember, asshole?

827
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:59,769
Second, I'm not going to Mexico
or anywhere else.

828
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:02,522
I came to tell you that
that was the last run for me.

829
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:06,526
The last one? That's cute.

830
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:10,279
This dumb-ass just doesn't get it.

831
01:16:10,363 --> 01:16:13,366
What is it that I don't get,
motherfucker?

832
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,661
That you two decided to send me
to Mexico? That I'm an asshole?

833
01:16:16,744 --> 01:16:20,540
That I'm a clown you send
to Mexico? Fuck that.

834
01:16:20,623 --> 01:16:23,835
You're gonna tell me
what to do now?

835
01:16:27,422 --> 01:16:30,383
What's going on, man?
What's going on?

836
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:36,556
Listen, shit-bag.

837
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:40,685
I'll get up today.

838
01:16:41,686 --> 01:16:43,146
From now on...

839
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:48,484
...you're gonna do whatever
I fuckin' feel like having you do.

840
01:16:51,696 --> 01:16:57,285
From now on,
you breathe because I let you.

841
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:06,127
You know what else?
You'll never talk back to me again.

842
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:10,006
Pussy.

843
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:16,804
- What's going on?
- Go, go, go...

844
01:17:16,888 --> 01:17:20,057
How can I leave it like this?
Cabo! Listen, Cabo!

845
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,726
Leave.

846
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:24,645
- Let me talk to him.
- Get out, asshole!

847
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:44,290
<i>At that moment,
if I wanted to stay alive...</i>

848
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:47,668
<i>...I had to put my head down
and move to Mexico.</i>

849
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,010
Where are we going?

850
01:17:56,469 --> 01:17:58,346
It's a surprise.

851
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:00,890
To the restaurant.

852
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:09,273
You on a diet?

853
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:14,403
What a great surprise!

854
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:19,325
No way. Poetry in motion!
How are you my friend?

855
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:22,954
- You've lost some weight.
- This is great. What's going on?

856
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:27,500
Listen, fuckers order some double
shots of tequila. Today, we're getting drunk.

857
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,254
Whatever. Come to the balcony
with me a minute.

858
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:34,257
Listen carefully
and don't ask any questions.

859
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,344
I'm not working with Damian, nor Modesto
or with any of these Mexicans.

860
01:18:38,428 --> 01:18:43,975
Well, I am working with them,
but not actually working.

861
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:47,645
I'm working, but for some other people.
Through some...

862
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:51,941
Better yet,
I'm just gonna tell you now.

863
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:55,486
My brother, I'm a snitch.

864
01:18:58,406 --> 01:19:01,451
- What do you mean?
- Yeah man. Because...

865
01:19:02,535 --> 01:19:07,415
The DEA busted my ass six months ago.
There was nothing I could do.

866
01:19:07,498 --> 01:19:12,044
Now I see you here man
and this changes my plans...

867
01:19:12,128 --> 01:19:16,424
I won't... You're different... I can't do
to you what I'm gonna do to Damian.

868
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:20,011
I'm in deeper than a prostate exam.

869
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:22,889
You're fucking with me, right?

870
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:34,150
Are you crazy? If they find out,
they're gonna chop you up...

871
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,736
...into little pieces and me, just in case.

872
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,572
I know. I didn't have
any other choice.

873
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,658
It was this or go to jail
for the rest of my life.

874
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:46,662
But I created the problem,
so I also created the solution.

875
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:51,250
You have to turn yourself in
to the DEA.

876
01:19:53,002 --> 01:19:55,254
What? What the hell
is wrong with you?

877
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:59,300
Martín, these guys bring your
prison sentence way down.

878
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:03,846
All you have to do is give up a
shipment here, then another one there.

879
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,307
They're already on top of this shit.

880
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:09,227
Do you know how many dead are
in Colombia because of snitches?

881
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:14,107
I know. But we can't stand here
philosophizing about this shit, right?

882
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,443
I'm just telling you
the way it has to be.

883
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:21,823
Either you come with me
and join the snitches cartel for the DEA...

884
01:20:21,906 --> 01:20:24,450
...or I'm gonna have to tell them
that you're here...

885
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:27,370
...working with Damian
and all these other Mexicans.

886
01:20:27,453 --> 01:20:31,666
I don't have any other choice,
Martín. I'm sorry.

887
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:41,717
You're a real a piece of shit,
you know that?

888
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:48,891
I'm a piece of shit? Why?
Because I told you everything?

889
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:53,688
I could've stayed quiet
and gotten your ass busted, but I didn't.

890
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,314
Look.

891
01:20:56,858 --> 01:21:01,154
This is the piece of shit
that's gonna get you out of the business.

892
01:21:01,237 --> 01:21:06,159
What's going on, Colombians?

893
01:21:06,242 --> 01:21:08,578
What happened
with the fucking tequilas?

894
01:21:08,661 --> 01:21:13,207
Listen to this kid. The tequilas.
You didn't order the tequilas.

895
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,459
Let's go.

896
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,795
Let's have a tequila.
I know I need one. Come on.

897
01:21:17,879 --> 01:21:19,213
We won't give them...

898
01:21:19,297 --> 01:21:22,925
<i>Anestesia tried to convince everybody
to cooperate with the DEA,</i>

899
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:26,512
<i>to become part of his "Snitch Cartel."</i>

900
01:21:26,596 --> 01:21:28,639
<i>Even though most
closed the door in his face.</i>

901
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:31,100
- No!
- Let's at least talk about it.

902
01:21:31,184 --> 01:21:33,186
<i>Some accepted the offer.</i>

903
01:21:33,895 --> 01:21:37,315
You give them some money
and some of the routes.

904
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:41,235
I just listened to the offer that
that guy Anestesia made.

905
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:46,491
So, you thought it was a great idea
to become a snitch for the DEA?

906
01:21:47,492 --> 01:21:50,912
No, Cabo, man.
How can you even say that?

907
01:21:50,995 --> 01:21:58,711
All Anestesia said was that I had to help out
with two or three things...

908
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:03,841
...and I would never see the inside of a cell
or give them any of my money.

909
01:22:05,468 --> 01:22:09,430
All the bullshit that piece of shit fed you
and you believed him?

910
01:22:09,514 --> 01:22:13,226
That guy came to my house,
he told me this whole story,

911
01:22:13,309 --> 01:22:15,228
and he fucked with my head a little.

912
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:24,320
<i>He told me there was a long list of people
interested in working something out.</i>

913
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:29,242
<i>More than one in Mexico.
Since it's so close, it makes things easier.</i>

914
01:22:29,325 --> 01:22:31,536
Like that kid what's-his-name...

915
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:32,954
Fresita.

916
01:22:33,037 --> 01:22:34,872
Fresita?

917
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:40,545
Where?

918
01:22:41,546 --> 01:22:42,964
Okay.

919
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:45,216
No worries.
I'll be there tomorrow.

920
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:47,468
<i>So, what did Fresita tell you?</i>

921
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:50,388
I gave him the address.

922
01:22:52,598 --> 01:22:55,601
He said he'd be there
tomorrow at 3:00.

923
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,563
Tomorrow?

924
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:02,525
Now what?

925
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:05,570
You gotta do what you gotta do.

926
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:09,740
That's what she said
right before she put it in her mouth.

927
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:12,452
Guerrero, take care of my piggy.

928
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:50,573
He's coming.

929
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:06,964
Nothing?

930
01:24:39,122 --> 01:24:40,748
Hurry up!

931
01:25:08,776 --> 01:25:12,655
- This piece of shit wants a party.
- Come on, asshole!

932
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:23,374
Get out of here, man.
The cops are coming.

933
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:51,277
Hey, he's getting away.

934
01:25:56,157 --> 01:25:57,992
Guadaña!

935
01:25:58,075 --> 01:25:59,535
Hurry up!

936
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:07,854
Come on, dude!

937
01:27:09,689 --> 01:27:12,108
What happened, killer?

938
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:17,488
Now I'm pissed.
Do your thing.

939
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:49,896
Come on, assholes!

940
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:28,476
My name is Martín Gonzales.

941
01:28:31,437 --> 01:28:33,147
Just a second...

942
01:28:40,488 --> 01:28:42,615
I want to turn myself in.

943
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:18,354
Freeze! Police!

944
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:47,068
This was the only way
to get you to come.

945
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:52,073
I'm sorry.

946
01:32:53,783 --> 01:32:58,037
Who do you think you are?
Who? Tell me!

947
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:00,498
Who do you think you are
to do what you want with my life?

948
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:04,627
What did I tell you?
I told you to never look for me again!

949
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:06,671
Disappear!

950
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:15,888
I got myself into
a huge fuckin' mess.

951
01:33:17,682 --> 01:33:20,977
I turned myself into the DEA.
They're gonna put me away.

952
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:24,272
I hope you rot in that shitty cell.

953
01:33:26,232 --> 01:33:31,112
Half of Cali tried to kill me.
If they don't find me, they'll go after you.

954
01:33:32,113 --> 01:33:35,032
That's why I had
to get you out like that.

955
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:38,494
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

956
01:33:42,915 --> 01:33:45,668
These are the keys
to this apartment.

957
01:33:46,669 --> 01:33:49,797
You can stay here
as long as you want. It's yours.

958
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:54,886
Here. An account number
that's under your name.

959
01:33:54,969 --> 01:33:58,598
There's $6 million in there.
Do whatever you want with it.

960
01:34:03,478 --> 01:34:06,856
I don't want your money.
I don't want your apartment.

961
01:34:08,316 --> 01:34:10,234
I don't want anything from you.

962
01:34:19,285 --> 01:34:20,912
I'm sorry.

963
01:34:42,433 --> 01:34:45,436
<i>In Colombia,
things were getting worse and worse.</i>

964
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:49,315
<i>No one trusted anyone anymore.</i>

965
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:56,447
Ramiro!

966
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:26,018
Your second dish, sir.

967
01:35:27,812 --> 01:35:30,022
I didn't order a second dish.

968
01:35:36,446 --> 01:35:38,030
I am Modesto!

969
01:36:21,407 --> 01:36:24,076
You know I love you, right?

970
01:36:28,331 --> 01:36:30,333
I love you, too.

971
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,168
A lot.

972
01:36:33,419 --> 01:36:36,798
I really hope
you don't get angry with me.

973
01:36:49,185 --> 01:36:51,270
In one minute,
I won't be here anymore. Promise.

974
01:36:51,354 --> 01:36:52,647
Sofi...

975
01:36:55,024 --> 01:36:56,901
Please.

976
01:36:56,984 --> 01:37:02,990
I'd like to ask you to meet me again
when I get out, here in this restaurant.

977
01:37:03,074 --> 01:37:05,243
Well, whatever is left of it.

978
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:12,333
I want...

979
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:19,799
I want you to promise me that
when I get out, you're gonna be here.

980
01:37:22,343 --> 01:37:26,889
Give me this last chance.
It's all I'm asking for.

981
01:37:28,766 --> 01:37:33,771
Don't destroy the last bit of hope
I have to see you. Not now.

982
01:37:33,855 --> 01:37:36,566
Let me take it with me to jail.

983
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:47,952
Goodbye.

984
01:37:58,087 --> 01:38:00,673
3 YEARS LATER

985
01:38:03,968 --> 01:38:06,637
<i>Now I am writing to you
from here.</i>

986
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:09,849
<i>From a cell in a federal prison
in the United States.</i>

987
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:13,936
<i>Today, on my birthday...</i>

988
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:18,191
<i>...I will celebrate alone once again.</i>

989
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:51,182
<i>The extradition law sent
a lot of drug traffickers to U.S. prisons,</i>

990
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,060
<i>so destiny put me and Pepe
back in each other's lives.</i>

991
01:38:54,143 --> 01:38:57,105
What's going on,
you rat bastard?

992
01:38:57,188 --> 01:38:59,857
How many people
did you have to snitch on?

993
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:03,111
I would snitch on the other half of Cali
if I had to, you asshole!

994
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:32,557
Son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill your kid.

995
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,686
Piece of shit!
Asshole! Rat bastard!

996
01:39:36,769 --> 01:39:41,941
I'm gonna kill your kid.
Snitch faggot fuck.

997
01:39:42,942 --> 01:39:45,820
I'm gonna kill your kid,
motherfucker!

998
01:41:00,561 --> 01:41:02,647
<i>I'm not coming, Martín.</i>

999
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:04,649
<i>I'm not coming.</i>

1000
01:41:09,195 --> 01:41:11,656
AFTER SERVING
A 24-MONTH SENTENCE

1001
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:13,324
AND HAVING BEEN
ONE OF THE PIECES

1002
01:41:13,407 --> 01:41:15,284
IN THE FALL OF
THE CARTEL DEL NORTE DEL VALLE,

1003

MARTÍN GONZÁLEZ,
A.K.A. "FRESITA,"

1004
01:41:17,453 --> 01:41:19,372
IS RELEASED
WITH A SINGLE THOUGHT:

1005
01:41:19,455 --> 01:41:22,542
FIND SOFÍA AND HIS SON,

1006
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:26,170
BUT HE NEVER IMAGINED
WHAT THIS WOULD COST HIM...

1007
01:41:26,254 --> 01:41:28,256
IN MEMORY OF OUR FRIEND
AND TEACHER, PEDRO ARMENDÁRIZ JR.

1008
01:41:28,339 --> 01:41:29,757
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WITH US
