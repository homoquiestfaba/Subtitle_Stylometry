I'm Special Agent Adam Frawley.

Need to tell you we take fingerprints
to eliminate them from the list of suspects.

135
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,741
I see that you have given us
a preliminary DECLARATION.

136
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:34,077
I want to talk about your abduction.

137
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,237
Well.

138
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:38,125
I understood that you were threatened.

139
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,899
One of them stole my license
management.

140
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:44,874
You tried to escape?

141
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,159
No.

142
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:51,031
We can identify in any way?
Do you have evidence to stand as witness?

143
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,649
I tried to escape
because they were înarmaþi.

144
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:59,032

Then they let you go?

145

Yes, I have let you go.

146
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,071
You should not have
a lawyer here?

147
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:11,363
You're not charged, but anyone asks
a lawyer is guilty.

148
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,154
- I believe that you did not need.
- Okay.

149
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,993
When someone endure
such experience

150
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,686
Very often there is a lot
side effects.

151
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:25,214
You'll never happened to you're nothing.

152
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:27,939

00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:32,291
"If you talk with the FBI, come
at your house, rape you and kill you. "

154
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,844
Want to you handle that?

155
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,155
I'm on it.

156
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,955
- Why should you handle?
- Because I came here because of you.

157
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:40,956
Yes, but I'll fix it.

158
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:42,532
And how do you solve it?

159
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,189
Want to do jail
to intimidate witnesses?

160
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,889
If you get closer than 30 meters
it, receives your kid 10 years decay.

161
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,479
They already have two counts of

162
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,414
I'm gonna bones rot in jail.

163

- 98 000.

164
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,499
Minus the flower shop.

165
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,909
- Hey, Jem.
- It 's okay.

166
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,093
What happened to the deputy?

167
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,805
The next time a skeleton
with the gun in the bank,

168
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,669
I would think that the two
times before you shoot the alarm.

169
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,894
He was lucky he escaped with just that.

170
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,409
- Hey, Rusty! How you doing, buddy?
- Okay.

171
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,527

Hey Fergie.

173
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,559

- Okay.

174
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,759
I'll turn into actions, do you?

175
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,002
Trust me.

176
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:43,927
That's it.

177
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:46,054
Take it easy.

178
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,851
Where am I?
What now?

179
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,112
They stole money
now have to wash them.

180
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:56,064
The casinos, gambling,

181
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,025
and can buy drugs
like to sell them all over town.

182
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,589
Need to celebrate, do you?

183
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,953
V.P.D, D.E.A.

184
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,031
I want tips, names, witnesses, whatever.

185
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,834
We knock and other doors,
to see who we can help.

186
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,786
Questions?
No? Wonderful.

187
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:10,870
Let's go.

188
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:22,192
- Hello!
- What are you doing?

189
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:25,574
And Krista's here.

190
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:27,937
Come on, CED, and story and you and him.

191
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,873
Doug, sit down. CED wants
to tell you something about your father.

192
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:34,195
The FBI would not understand it,
would be about 40 years.

193
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:37,939
Your father is forced to endure many
and because he betrayed friends.

194
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,730
- I have to suffer to live,
- We all have to suffer to live.

195
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:45,062
Anyway, it's a great man.

196
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:49,506
- And will always remain a standby.
- A so-i.

197
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:57,090
All right.
Get an umbrella for my beer.

198
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,944
Thanks.

199
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:14,893
- Juice?
- Yes, juice.

200
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,939
- Want a little ...
- Hey, do not ... What are you doing?

201
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,064
I'm playing.

202
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,324
I heard that you fought for us.

203
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,910
Looks like me and be beaten?

204
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:38,992
I do not know, I have not seen.

205
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:43,443
You're talking nonsense.
I went to my daughter.

206
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:44,733
And Shyne was with you?

207
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,671
I just went for a walk.

208
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,378
I do not think they are white
seriousness and in Charlestown,

209
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:54,251
that you can have sex
and to doing and other things.

210
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,152
Thi-missed?

211
00:14:57,153 --> 00:15:01,320
Cocaine and oxycodone?
Not really.

212
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,919
Well, we certainly something
Thi would do well.

213
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:09,888
Or maybe not ever want me?

214
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,740
Yes, and a.

215
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:25,179
What you want?

216
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,304
- You like?
- Yes.

217
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,603
So you like, right?

218
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:39,697
Good night.

219
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,899
Inefficiency, you understand?
Distrust in yourself.

220
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,489
Anger which turns
in disbelief and despair.

221
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,299
Like the boy who stood at the bar
and the priest comes and pulls her chair.

222
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,369
The boy says, "Wait a little.
I hate to tell you this, "

223
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,539
"Thi but not waste time around here,
because I know that there is no God. "

224
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,099
The priest says, "Yeah, like you?"

225
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,719
The boy says:
"I am exploring the North Pole."

226
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,509
"And I caught a blinding storm.
I was frozen. "

227
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,069
"I do not see anything and I was frozen."

228
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,179
"And I prayed that somehow if there
God, save me right now. "

229
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,599
"But God has not been shown."

230
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,949
The priest said:

231
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,449
"How you? Only you're alive.
He has saved you. "

232
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,309
The boy says: "No. God
no never showed up there. "

233
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,459
"But instead came an Eskimo
which led me to the camp and saved me. "

234
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,309
It was Janice, my wife,
that stands right there.

235
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,252
She's my Eskimo.

236
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:08,148
Hi, Doug.

237
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,351
Excuse me.
Îþi your laundry?

238
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,529
- What?
- I wanted ...

239
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,336
I wanted to ask you if you chopped.
The machine does not have.

240
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,378
I can not help.
Sorry.

241
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,377
A home machine to finish them.

242
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:30,868
Are you okay?

243
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes.

244
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,496
Are you sure?

245
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:44,854
Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

246
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:47,207
- You sure?
- It's a little embarrassing.

247
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,982
There's nothing embarrassing.

248
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:53,394
Need Help?

249
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:56,036
I had a bad week.

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,282
I understand.

251
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:04,176
You can take a hell of mourning
manicure at the salon.

252
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:10,076
Give the girls well.
I am very înþelegãtoare.

253
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,975
But Thiele you like more to launch,
to so it's okay.

254
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,103
Hey, why not ask you to drink?

255
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:27,023
Revan and ez to me because I
disappointed with the coins.

256
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,124
We will try to "fix"
hard this week.

257
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,299
What can happen?

258
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,374
FBI. Open the door Ah!
Open the door Ah!

259
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,449
Nenorociþi cops!

260
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,945
Jesus! Henry!

261
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,352
Drugs, weapons ...

262
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:08,840
Looks like "Christmas Ghost."

263
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:15,709
The minimum penalty for this
is ten years.

264
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,925
You'll need another "friend"

265
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,169
and it is not.

266
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,794
It's a wonderful girl.

267
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,583
Really loves you.
I can say that.

268
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,267
The good news for you is that
of an alibi for the robbery of Cambridge,

269
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:35,752
And the good news for me
is that you know something.

270
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,143
Everyone attacks
someone armored cars.

271
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,432
Knew the guys followed him to the safe.

272
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,859
- Yes?
- At least I've heard of and the.

273
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,508
One of the boys destroyed
joncþiune box.

274
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:59,536
- Here's that came.
- Hello!

275
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,050
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

276
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:08,129
I had to pick you up in front of the door, right?

277
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,794
What kind of lad and that's
you leave the door open for you to a. ..

278
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,090
What is it?

279
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:19,316
You need to get something
the soul, otherwise

280
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,459
I pretend that you listen
all night,

281
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,458
while I think
something else.

282
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:26,786
Well.

283
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:31,298
A few days ago, the bank where
work I was robbed.

284
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:35,466
Four men have forced me
to open the safe.

285
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,009
I took hostages.

286
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,279
They blindfolded me and took me away.

287
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,455
Then they stopped and left me at the beach ...

288
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,850
And one of the guys told me

289
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:57,590
get up to go
feet in water.

290
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,539
It was the longest ride
of my life.

291
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,896
I thought maybe I fall
on any rock.

292
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,284
And at one point I felt the water.

293
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:13,363
Sorry.

294
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,784
Not your fault.

295
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:22,349
A guy from the FBI told me they look
like being in mourning.

296
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,014
FBI?

297
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,534
- Working with the FBI?
- Yes.

298
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,684
What does that mean?

299
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,574
I check? I supervise?

300
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,984
Cam has anything like this.

301
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,184
And have any suspects, clues, anything?

302
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,694
I do not know. I did not say.

303
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,195
He tried to say I intimiteze
All that will scotocii's Charlestown,

304
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:50,108
wore masks, and the So ...

305
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,986
Damn!

306
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:59,059
I'm sure he recognizes voices and,
and if you hear them again.

307
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,262
I do not know. There may be more difficult
than you think.

308
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,104
You what do you do?

309
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:12,241
Gravel Sanding work in Boston,
break stones.

310
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,679
Dau holes all day long,

311
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,792
riding a brontozaur,
like Fred Flintstone.

312
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:19,188
Ready to work!

313
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,231
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

314
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,859
Doing volunteer work for a club
The Charlestown boys and girls and i. ..

315
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,116
- Really?
- Yes.

316
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,470
And most children
struggling to do something,

317
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,279
and not allow you to have a decent ice rink.

318
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:32,076
I know, it's embarrassing. Nobody puts
money in that place.

319
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,019
Yes.

320
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,788
Yes, I know. Majority of children
I say "tunie.

321
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,279
That means "strange". It is a person
come from elsewhere, that's all.

322
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,979
Of course.

323
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,824
Those kids were talking nonsense.

324
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,229
Michael, what's up?
What are you doing?

325
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,764
Well. Today I'm fine.
I want a Scotch with ice.

326
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:01,346
What happened?

327
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:08,820
- Have you checked that thing?
- What?

328
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,115
Driving license.

329
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,645
Yes.

330
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,875
- And?
- Nothing.

331
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,709
So, no need
have it out of equation?

332
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,359
- What?
- You heard me, right?

333
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,249
What, are you and the assassin now?

334
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,104
Bat and I plains, young man.

335
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,589
You really need to get
the electric chair to tell you that back?

336
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,359
Not to be a dramatic and, yes?

337
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,089
Just ...

338
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,389
I want to make sure the back, that's all.

339
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,429
- We can handle it.
- Okay.

340
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,154
- Okay.
- Super.

341
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:51,415
It's obvious that they knew how to work
joncþiune the box.

342
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,534
But I like destroyed
Bipper station site at D5.

343
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:57,736
How do you know someone
of something like that?

344
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,989
To take a job at Vericom.

345
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,784
Thanks.

346
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:08,036
Let's work to verify the reports
and employee records.

347
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:11,759
- Start with those who live in the city.
- I understand.

348
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,249
- I minds FBI.
- What?

349
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,859
When one of them
David attacked him,

350
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,774
I have seen and have a neck tattoo.

351
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,889
What?

352
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,344
It was one of those
Irish warrior tattoos.

353
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,849
I'm afraid that if they say this
I will ask to testify.

354
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,784
What do you think I should do?

355
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:39,585
Tell them of the FBI.

356
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:43,172
If the guy has the file
and I'm sure it has

357
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,999
tattoo will be noted in the file.

358
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,409
We will arrest the next day.

359
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,569
For armed robbery.
A primimeascã to about 30 years.

360
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,469
Of course he's gonna do, and worry lest
Somebody seek witness

361
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,309
and the FBI probably gonna kick you
in a witness protection program.

362
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,109
Maybe we'll send you somewhere

363
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,809
Cleavland kind in Arizona.

364
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,954
You know, somewhere safe.

365
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,724
Or ...

366
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,584
you could wait.

367
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,749
You're not all countries must
on a single card.

368
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,519
You're most vulnerable in this situation.

369
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,669
The FBI are ordinary people nuiþi,

370
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,349
who want to catch the nelegiuiþi
and to-and see beyond their lives.

371
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,084
Claire, you need to wear thi
for themselves.

372
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,314
You seem to be an expert.

373
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:42,294
Even the and a.
Only because I watched TV a lot.

374
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,369
I looked over at CSI.

375
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,799
A and So are a great expert
in anything like this.

376
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,049
And CSI Miami and CSI New York.

377
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,144
I'm looking at all.

378
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:53,239
I looked at all.

379
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,898
- Are you ready for the world.
- And the "Bones" I forgot.

380
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,099
We know each other pretty well
to tell you that I can say that this machine

381
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,504
is a little high?

382
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,849
E and machine work.

383
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,999
If you have problems with your Prius,
it into the trunk.

384
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,884
How do you know I am a Preius?

385
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,524
I assumed.

386
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,299
I wanted to say that it resembles
with a car "tunie.

387
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,299
- Why? Even have a Prius?
- Yes.

388
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,649
- Really?
- I had a Preius.

389
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,009
- But it was vandalized.
- What happened?

390
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,529
I have no idea. I was forced
1.6 km to go through projectiles.

391
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,639
And then, guys that have started to ...

392
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,949
Do you?

393
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,689
- I do not know and if those guys were, but ...
- What guys?

394
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,119
They started ... They began to
scream at me when I exceed it.

395
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,159
Then they became very aggressive and i. ..

396
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,529
And what did they do?

397
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,149
When they started
throwing bottles

398
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,679
I realized that I just loved
to walk among the projectiles.

399
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,499
They threw bottles at you?

400
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,199
I'm all right.
Only that we had far to go.

401
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,749
Never mind.

402
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,849
No, but you will need to cut and you with it.

403
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,874
Thi not remember what they looked like?

404
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,400
We need your help.
I can not tell you about what it is.

405
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,724
And you never allowed me to wonder
ever about it.

406
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,114
And you know that might hurt you
some people.

407
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,924
Whose car we go?

408
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,944
I hope to be home.

409
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,822
- Who's there?
- Open!

410
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:11,574
Zounds, that hurts!
Stops you.

411
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,361
If you stay here a week,
back.

412
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,114
Let's go.
I'm done.

413
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,029
- What have you done?
- I do not know what all the talk.

414
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,269
That over there is my brother.

415
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,124
What have you done to my brother
was upset by the way?

416
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,239
- Do not you know?
- No!

417
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,779
- What about now?
- Calm down.

418
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,099
- Now you know?
- Calm down.

419
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,739
Hey, do not tell me to calm down!

420
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,699
- Enough!
- What have you done?

421
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,329
I do not know about what it is!

422
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,844
No?

423
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,069
A and proceed to College Hockey.
Hey, look at me!

424
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,069
I see the face?

425
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,599
You can call the police.

426
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,844
Keep in mind, and I saw yours.

427
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,614
We can not kill people.

428
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,114
You called me.

429
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:22,539
- Desmond Elden.
- Yes?

430
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,579
Vericom working on.
I never did kid cavity.

431
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,289
Ã boys knew, most of them
slub did not spectacular.

432
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,599
They stole armored machine
during working hours.

433
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,079
Foreman said, "Yes, it's been here yesterday."
And we showed the time sheet spreadsheet.

434
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,099
But you can not Vericom's play
because it is a public company.

435
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,349
If you're not going to work,
means that you're sick.

436
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,049
And "Dezzy" our
has a very interesting disease.

437
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,089
Bank Boston, Cummins Armored,
Brinks Arlington,

438
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,314
Cambridge Merchants.

439
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,105
Jesus Christ!

440
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,599
Your parents live in Charlestown?

441
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,424
No, Dad probably
reached the suburbs.

442
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,894
But your mother?

443
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:11,799
Thi has not and could not say.
I abandoned when I was six.

444
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,154
What happened?

445
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,752
He's gone.

446
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,694
It's okay.

447
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,353
Well ...

448
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:41,012
A sound woke me up.

449
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:45,356
At first I did not know what it is.

450
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:49,537
Sounds to be an animal and that.

451
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:55,121
I have never heard a man
to cry until then.

452
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,834
I got in lingerie

453
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,099
and I saw my dad in the kitchen.

454
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,489
The first thing I remember,
e ashtray.

455
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,014
I think we were a hundred cigarettes in it.

456
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,004
And a mountain of ash.

457
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,544
It stopped crying

458
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,729
and stood in front of the TV's that run

459
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,714
a black and white image, no sound.

460
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:25,354
I think I did not know what to do.

461
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,754
They looked at me as I stood
there-in threshold of the door and said to me:

462
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,314
"Your mother left
and never came back. "

463
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,154
Exactly and a.

464
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:49,004
Smoke and eat there
in front of the TV, at six in the morning.

465
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,194
One year before
lost our dog and i. ..

466
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,054
I wanted to do this job,

467
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,289
in case you have lost

468
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,264
and you can call us,
the guy who found us the dog.

469
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,109
Dad, and I did today, should be able
to tell you that I helped to make them show,

470
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,129
but I helped.

471
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,144
He stayed in the kitchen with a beer

472
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,829
while I went
school alone on the street

473
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,424
asking people if
I have seen my mother.

474
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,409
Her name was Doris.

475
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,399
My grandmother had a restaurant
"Tangerine Flower."

476
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,384
I imagined that she went there.

477
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,307
Then I realized
to matter.

478
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,694
Nothing changes the fact that ...
no matter

479
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,174
Wherever they have gone

480
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,014
had a good reason
to go from here.

481
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,899
I wanted to be my mother.

482
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,334
There was never returned.

483
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,414
Now you know something about my family

484
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,064
but still does not show you the apartment.

485
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:06,079
How bad could it be?

486
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,584
Desmond Elden.
System Engineer at Vericom.

487
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,700
Twenty-two years.

488
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,546
Alfred Magloan. Only in Boston
may be a guy named Alfred MacGloan.

489
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:46,916
Mr. Magloan not never met
a car that can not be stolen.

490
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,189
He's very talented.

491
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,689
It 's able to tell you steal your Cherokee
while you doing what you keys.

492
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,144
James Coughlin.

493
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,064
His father was killed in prison.
His mother died of AIDS.

494
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,794
Did the shot Brandon Lee, in a
cemetery, just before turning 19.

495
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,194
He bled to death.

496
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,974
When the judge asked why
did it, said: "I did not like his face."

497
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,362
A kid did nine years of decay
for murder.

498
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:10,879
Ã knew boys plan and execute
minuþios everything and very disciplined.

499
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,174
And Coughlin is not the best
for it.

500
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,149
I believe that the "architect" is the guy.

501
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,699
Best friend of Coughlin;
Douglas MacRay.

502
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,209
Live together.
Se-ntâlne up with his sister and Coughlin,

503
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,929
is most likely
"Cãrãu and the" florist

504
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,909
who hired him and his father McRay.

505
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,874
You'll need explanatory drawings
Sheet for the people knew.

506
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,928
Mac senior received any life imprisonment
for robbery in Nashwood,

507
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,880
they are convinced that most
You remember him.

508
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,114
He hijacked a car
values in New Hampshire

509
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,984
and one security guard saw her face.
It and So ...

510
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,220
I executed both
with their own weapons.

511
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,859
I think Mac's heritage is that
that any drive on me and armored cars

512
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,779
not allowed to leave the car,

513
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,490
even if his partner
has a gun to his head.

514
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,800
The young man did MacRay
eight months jail

515
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,448
because it was attacked with a gun
Cashier nail on the Bay Bank

516
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,116
after being kicked out
of professional hockey.

517
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,900
- Professional hockey?
- Yes. It was a big star for a while.

518
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,634
It was selecþionat the team. He went
in a camp and there, total shock.

519
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,804
He gave out of trouble, and he beat the boys ...

520
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,910
In this hockey you're paid,
bath to you, right?

521
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,869
Yes, but not with teammates.

522
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:08,239
MacRay came home and joined
family business.

523
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,069
And those things, and those habits.

524
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,293
From hockey to come to the drug.

525
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,354
We are very far from the Grand Jury.

526
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,699
And never ever gonna get approval
The monitor you 24 hours a day

527
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,309
Unless they any of idioþii
ã knew a convert to Islam.

528
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,169
A and therefore a strong case built to.

529
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,454
All right. Come to work.

530
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,600
I told all friends
about you.

531
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,900
- Really?
- Yes.

532
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,910
- I hope only good things.
- Yes.

533
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:37,550
All right.
I said I'm very jealous,

534
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,164
because they can not afford to believe
how lucky are you?

535
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:44,864
That you moved in Charlestown
that to set you up with a rock breaker.

536
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:47,724
No. They believe that ...

537
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,707
They think it's a kind of reward.

538
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,724
But why?
For that robbery? I have no idea.

539
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,514
I feel somewhat foreign to them.

540
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,678
What?
What do you look to you?

541
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,224
My brother died on a day like this.

542
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,299
When was this?

543
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,792
He was small.
He had malignant lymphoma.

544
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,277
And now, every time is one day
sunny, I think someone dies.

545
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,989
Beyond wrong, do you?

546
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,245
No. I'm sure would be happy
thinks that you're at it.

547
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,875
It's a nice day.

548
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,711
- I feel wonderful.
- That's good.

549
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,506
Then, I will miss îþi
while I'm gone.

550
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,604
Money, mutt!

551
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,363
What the hell are you doing here?

552
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,099
- Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

553
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,589
- Who were here?
- With nobody.

554
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,049
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- You mean this is yours?

555
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,889
- Yes.
- Yes, the Hawaiian pizza?

556
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,129
- Come, sit down. I just arrived.
- I said "no."

557
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,434
- We gotta go.
- Stay the hell down. Sit.

558
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,444
- Good.
- Good.

559
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,859
- Hello!
- Claire.

560
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,196
- Jem.
- Jim?

561
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:39,901
Jem. Jem, pure and simple.
I am a friend of sucker that.

562
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:42,604
- Nice acquainted.
- Sit down. Sit down. Relax, okay?

563
00:39:51,545 --> 00:39:55,289
I saw thi's Avalanche
parked after the corner.

564
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,509
- Avalanche site?
- Truck.

565
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,211
Yes, van.
Truck at work.

566
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,131
- Dougy's a great worker.
- Yes.

567
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,989
We know the long or ...

568
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,864
Since I was 6 years.
We are like brothers, right?

569
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,934
But he never mentioned you.
Do you keep a secret, do you?

570
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,079
How did you say your name?
Jim or Gem?

571
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,594
Je ... Ge ...
In fact, both are correct.

572
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,400
Teachers, after I grew older,
nuiau ordinary always say:

573
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,995
"Hey, contact him on this,
is a real "gem".

574
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,674
I think that was a kind of arrogant.

575
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:37,131
No matter.

576
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,769
You what you do, Claire?

577
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,719
I work at a bank.
Are bank manager.

578
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,249
Are your bank manager?
Sounds funny. What bank?

579
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,139
Cambridge Merchants.
Not far from here.

580
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,309
Cambridge Merchants.

581
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,689
Wait, that's just the
was robbed, do you?

582
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,974
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, I just read about it.

583
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,960
What folly!

584
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:58,904
And then, how ...
How did you meet?

585
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,232
We met at the launch.

586
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:05,948
Super!

587
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:10,064
Love among the underwear, right?
It happens more often than you think.

588
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,924
Hey, Claire, do not waste Thi
too much time here.

589
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,459
Dougy, it's really dedicated to work.

590
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,922
And i always take work home.
And has not it, Doug?

591
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,384
- All right.
- It's okay, bro.

592
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,064
- Take care of yourself, yes? Be good.
- See you at home.

593
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,682
- I'm glad I met you.
- And me.

594
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,359
It appears that you have not told
all your friends about me.

595
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,002
Who pursues you, Jem?
Me or her?

596
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:58,037
I told that I saw thi's Avalanche.

597
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,229
You have nothing to worry about that.
Everything's under control.

598
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,259
So, try to shoot us
the dirty, do you?

599
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,089
Yes, try to fool.

600
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,382
Tell me you have a plan
spare, Dougy.

601
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,509
Because the only solution
I see myself,

602
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,884
is that you're not interested only
to hit it in this fucking bitch.

603
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,944
And that clumea it happens to be
even the girl who ... Phooey!

604
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,310
The only person we can
FBI puts on the head!

605
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,108
Calm down, okay?

606
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,859
Do not think that it would have to be
isteþi a little more time?

607
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,029
- Isteþi?
- Yes.

608
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,616
Sure. Let's begin to rule
all witnesses.

609
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,484
Yes. I go to my deputy to
make a felaþie. They are sufficiently isteþ?

610
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,854
And of others guys are not gonna say anything
lest you be scared!

611
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,434
Because I want to be apþi
for the next robbery.

612
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,720
Thi-I said,
next action is not ready yet.

613
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,365
Well, once I finish it!

614
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,139
No more guards
the next action, yes?

615
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,649
One of the guys show that GI Joe.

616
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,999
His vest antiglonþ sight
bãgaþi in boots and pants.

617
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,528
That van is a waste of time.

618
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:09,868
We will find another van with a driver
seriously do not make him afraid,

619
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:11,460
and who does not believe warrior
the Special Forces.

620
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,780
Yes?

621
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,490
Hey, look at them, I know you're happy
this motherfucker in the city,

622
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,879
but I stayed nine years
in prison for you, asshole.

623
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,754
Only nine years, that's all.

624
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,415
I'm tired of waiting.

625
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,170
That will be the last robbery.
After that we take a guard.

626
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,925
If they catch us, remember to tell you
Whose idea was this, okay?

627
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,844
Friday to be ready.

628
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,504
- Who do you visit?
- Stephen MacRay.

629
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,034
At booth 12.

630
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,090
- It's right in front.
- Thanks.

631
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,240
Are you okay? Every time I come
to see you're in the red uniform.

632
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,384
Still having problems with the knew?

633
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,621
You know how it is here.
Can not tolerate any bullshit.

634
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,109
However, you're a little old
for this crap, do not you think?

635
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,894
You're damn puþoi Sudie,
They want to control everything.

636
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,550
Listen, if you wear well
in five years, you can go wherever you want.

637
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,400
You can transfer to prison
Norfolk, Dad.

638
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,500
N-one to tell you from making one problem.
I'll Stop CERTH with anyone.

639
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,050
Understand what you mean?
There can serve ice cream and a ...

640
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,727
Yes. But, sometimes you gotta
to tell you solve problems yourself, you know?

641
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,025
Well.

642
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,077
I'm thinking ... to go somewhere.

643
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,534
- To leave the city.
- Tighten the screw?

644
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,600
- I want to make a change.
- Aha. No way!

645
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,174
"You want to make a change?

646
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,004
Whether he got the police or not.

647
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,814
I heard that was robbed
an armored car.

648
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,430
Really?
I have not heard anything about it.

649
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,891
Well.

650
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:24,186
May you have five minutes.
Five minutes.

651
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,064
Let me ask you something

652
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,150
if not gonna see you again.

653
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,405
How did you ...

654
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,991
How come you never searched?

655
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,956
Who are you looking for?

656
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,434
Mother.

657
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,604
On my mother.
How could you not you doing it again?

658
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,099
How could you not ask her?
S-one are you doing or ask her.

659
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,349
Listen, when your mother left,

660
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:03,874
you cried so hard
that you woke up everyone in Parle.

661
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,349
It and So, I told that if
you will search, you'll find.

662
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,889
It was a. ..
And you had to have an occupation.

663
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,214
I never thought this one to you
follow a fucking disease.

664
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,934
What, you think that was an angel?

665
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,354
You only.

666
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,380
Well, and you get more realistic.

667
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,831
How many girls are 22 years
through these places,

668
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,050
surrounded by children
and do not want them?

669
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,300
And you know ...
They have no remorse and that.

670
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,054
Not your mother was not different.

671
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,900
That's true goluþ empty.

672
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,642
I was reconciled to the idea.
And you should do the same.

673
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,646
I searched for that
I do not what to find.

674
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,400
Listen, I may die five times
until we get out of here.

675
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,039
Bye!
See ya.

676
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,170
Here or in another life.

677
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:47,037
Yesterday I saw a picture of yourself.

678
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:51,291
- Are you sure that was me?
- Sure enough.

679
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,650
- The club for children?
- Yes.

680
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,930
Was put on a banner,
in the image of a local hero.

681
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,464
They had pretty low standards for
those who qualify for the title that.

682
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,584
It appears that you have been selecþionat.

683
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,635
Yes. I was lazy and ...

684
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,170
and could not skating
back.

685
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,570
That means to know to skate
as a professional hockey player.

686
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,620
But I knew to pull the stick, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

687
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,400
However,
I was selecþionat the team,

688
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,910
but I did what I had
like to be part of the team.

689
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,100
And they gave me a second chance,
I lost it, and on that.

690
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,915
They sent me home.

691
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,199
I'm looking at that picture and see
a boy of 20 years

692
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,389
who have the impression that they know all

693
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,824
even if, in fact,
was about to lose everything.

694
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,694
Hey, we can go to your room?

00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:28,402
- Put the gun down now!
- Gotcha, you bastards.

709
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:34,241
It would have had to stay in the van.

00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:36,743
Come on!

711
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:40,882

- Shit.

716
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:09,359
You left a mark in dubiþã, yes?

717
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,694
Special Agent Frawley.

718
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,997

and him and put in a federal prison.

You end up with a bag over his head and
and a stunning serum into the veins.

732
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,006
This thing is not child's play, Doug.

Here.
It's just a chain and town, that's all.

777
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:10,280
We could go together.
In one trip, or something like that.

I hope that was not needed
to tell you sell your car.

783
01:06:23,386 --> 01:06:26,087
No. And someone has paid a debt.

784
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,883
You know, people wake up
every morning

785
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,509

something that will change your life.

I understand if you have some reþineri, you know.

794
01:07:03,593 --> 01:07:06,127
Regarding certain things
people say about me

795
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,369

And now, you have clup
minþiþi as to the FBI.

823

You must go on, right?
We can not at this rate.

Let's explain to tell you otherwise.
I want to leave this damn town site.

843

01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,960
- You're right.
- Yes. The so you think!

855
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,300
I'm better than all
who were involved in this project.

856
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,039
You grew up here!
When the same rules as you would me.

857
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,439
Who the hell do you think?

858
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,256
Not me to and I do ...
Not me to and I do stupid.

859
01:10:55,257 --> 01:10:57,509
Well. Look, I and I a "cake"

860
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:02,597
Me, you, your sister and Shyne

861
01:11:02,598 --> 01:11:06,017
Got it?
To tell you that between the well-head in seconds!

862
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:08,886
I was sick of your bullshit!

863
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:13,641
And if you want to see me,
Come and Visit me in Florida!

864
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,344
In 2002,

865
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,681
feds brought him here Brendan.

866
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,895
I shot like an animal.

867
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,564
Who knew that a hell happen to you?

868
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:07,694
I just wanted to make things the way
good. You know what I mean?

869
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:15,411
- No need to tell you and ask you to do something.
- Yes, was not. Come on.

870
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,507
Brendon told me that Lee is to come
here-and to celebrate the 21 years.

871
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:22,835
A so I came here
and I put in the ground.

872
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,964
I did nine years of jail, dude.

873
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,284
No need to thank me and you,
but did not go.

874
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,183
Îþi are grateful for all
what have you done for me.

875
01:12:38,527 --> 01:12:41,604
Your family when I took my father
left me.

876
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,734
We are like brothers,

877
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,112
but you have to go.

878
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:58,993
That shot me. Give it up.

879
01:12:59,994 --> 01:13:01,523
But I have to shoot you back.

880
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:14,387
Do not get up.

881
01:13:15,022 --> 01:13:16,722
How are you, Fergie?

882
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:23,400
Listen, I passed on to you
to personally tell you that whatever might happen,

883
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:27,400
I think my boys to handle a
and without me, Fergie.

884
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,735
And not to be employed without you.

885
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,060
And no you do not get to and be committed
without them. Are you a team.

886
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,243
Listen, with all due respect,
I came here to here to fight.

887
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:42,248
I do not want to do is something like.
The so because, as you can handle. I ...

888
01:13:43,676 --> 01:13:45,876
Calm down. It's okay.

889
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:51,600
It's against my raþiunii,
but with a bit of respect,

890
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,084
things will work.

891
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,344
He knew money, Fergie.
It's okay.

892
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,055
I'll standby of giving up easily.

893
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,309
You think I put it on
"Gica the toolshed" to deal with that?

894
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:05,500
- A what to do what you ask.
- I do not believe it!

895
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,270
Well.

896
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,487
Let me ask you something.
Who the hell do you think?

897
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,339
The only man in Charlestown
which has the gun?

898
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,492
I simply do not
vindeþi to numãraþi money and drugs.

899
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:20,503
You're a Santa face with a broken jars,
I never knew the glory.

900
01:14:20,504 --> 01:14:23,498
I do not work for you.
Have you understood?

901
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,109
If you have any problem with that, I stand
Bunk on Hill Street at number 551.

902
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:31,319
You can come anytime.
You know where to find me.

903
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,754
I will finish what you started,

904
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,794
otherwise, your boa and îþi them
the way it and I cut and your father.

905
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,520
- Do not talk to and has about my father.
- Boy, I knew your father.

906
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:46,020
He worked many years for me.
Years.

907
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:47,644
Then, and wanted to make one business.

908
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,394
Bet on horse races?

909
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:59,670
You know how castreazã horses?
With a knife, or chemicals.

910
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,829
When your daddy I refused

911
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,154
I castrated him with chemicals.

912
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:09,724
I gave your mom's taste.
I stuffed it well.

913
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:16,354
I drugged and a great picnic. Then, it was hung
with a wire on Malnea Cass Blvd.

914
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,846
While you,
Searching for a run through the neighborhood.

915
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,068
Your father never had the courage to tell you that you,
in fact, look for a suicidal junkie Sheet,

916
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:27,145
not coming back
never home.

917
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,440
If indeed there is a heaven,
boy, your mother certainly not there.

918
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:42,286
I heard that, lately, you have a girlfriend
nice who lives near the park.

919
01:15:44,338 --> 01:15:47,790
I'd like to tell you to send Thiele
Her funeral arrangements.

920
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:50,543
But if I have no choice, they send thi.

921
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:53,588
Now I know where to find you.

922
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:58,300
Claire!
Claire?

923
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,122
- God!
- Get out of here.

924
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:13,173
Are you okay?

925
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,544
- Get away.
- Wait a little.

926
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,429
A call to 911.

927
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,819
Well. But first,
do I need to explain and to tell you, yes?

928
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,242
- Okay?
- No, your chance has gone.

929
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,244
Who are you talking about?

930
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,873
The FBI, Doug.

931
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,002
I have to listen.

932
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:36,380
Do I need to explain and to tell you.
You understand?

933
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:40,024
- They did so much, Claire.
- Fuck you!

934
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,704
Go to hell!

935
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:45,798
Calm down.

936
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:48,698
Why did you do that?

937
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,500
Claire, I'm sorry.

938
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,870
I wanted to tell you. I came here
that night to tell you.

939
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,901
What? The night
you slept with me?

940
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:58,496
That you wanted to do?

941
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:03,458
Not enough to terrorize someone
one must him and shoot?

942
01:17:03,459 --> 01:17:05,668
- Listen to me. Calm down.
- No! No!

943
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:08,371
- Claire.
- Get out out!

944
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:12,160
I do not want to see you again.

945
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,335
Never. Never!

946
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,052
All right.

947
01:18:19,053 --> 01:18:21,452
Me bag and me.

948
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:24,052
But if something's going on, Claire

949
01:18:24,053 --> 01:18:26,574
or if they suspect may pãþii something

950
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:32,371
I come back here and kill you both,
in your own shop.

951
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,684
Claire!

952
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,080
I want to talk to you.
Two minutes, okay?

953
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:57,449
Come on.

954
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:03,900
- Wait, would you get to and never hurt.
- I do not know why ... do not touch me!

955
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,475
It's okay. Sorry.

956
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:11,420
Listen to me for a moment.
I'll never lie to you anymore, right?

957
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:13,846
- Really?
- Yes, I promise.

958
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:16,230
Ask me what you want.
I'm gonna tell the truth.

959
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,267
Why?
Anyway, you up and think.

960
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:19,690
- Yes, I'll believe.
- Why?

961
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,271
Because not one you like answers to.

962
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,578
- And tiaþi working at the bank.
- Yes.

963
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:32,030
- Did you watch?
- Yes.

964
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,533
How many of robbing banks?

965
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,744
Six banks and two armored vehicles.

966
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,038
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- No.

967
01:19:41,508 --> 01:19:44,300
Think about it, yes?

968
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,490
I'll never lie to you anymore.
I never gonna hurt you anymore.

969
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:52,374
And if I lose you, I'll regret
this until the end of my life.

970
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,154
Wait me.

971
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,604
You know that's funny?

972
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:14,223
Can I see faces
Tatham vo and three in you.

973
01:20:15,605 --> 01:20:17,604
I remind you that

01:20:17,605 --> 01:20:19,433
Ptimi still may receive punches.

975

Can still score.

976
01:20:22,605 --> 01:20:26,604
We have an informant,
who likes to play the races.

977
01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:28,933
It is an avid gambler.

978
01:20:29,605 --> 01:20:31,933
I was able to choose a horse
that would save her life.

979
01:20:32,605 --> 01:20:37,933
But because this man fan
I obtained this.

980
01:20:40,605 --> 01:20:42,933
Well, the gang is here.

981
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:48,733
Everyone has a weakness,
just to know what's it.

982
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:56,933
The money is out and is packed with
15 minutes prior to load in the van.

983
01:20:57,605 --> 01:20:59,933
That's when
you will hit.

984
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,933
Monday morning, before you begin
match in New York.

985
01:21:03,105 --> 01:21:05,933
It will sell 60,000 beers
food and souvenirs.

986
01:21:06,605 --> 01:21:09,933
Sum total: 3.5 million dollars.

987
01:21:13,605 --> 01:21:15,933
Even beat the record
Cathedral in Boston.

988
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,039
Something nepreþuit.

989
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,209
How long do you

01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:39,604
informant to escape
ends after this?

991
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:42,933
I should have to choose
best horses.

992
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,324
I'll be easy, you know that, right?

993
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,524
If it was child's play,
anyone able to do it.

994
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,338
- Hello, Frawley!
- Hello.

995
01:22:11,605 --> 01:22:14,604
It seems that it was pretty much forget thi
world-n-neck.

996
01:22:14,905 --> 01:22:16,604
What can I say?

997
01:22:16,805 --> 01:22:18,605
Boys like me.

998
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:22,554
I bet yes.

999
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,204

You must be new.

1003
01:22:38,605 --> 01:22:40,433
You're okay.

1004
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:44,569
That does not mean
So I would you get to rub, however i.

1005
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:48,199
You have to kiss him bunny
if I want codiþa.

1006
01:22:49,726 --> 01:22:51,974
My mother taught me that.

1007
01:22:55,605 --> 01:22:59,433
You and Doug MacRay
have been together, right?

1008
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:02,433
- Where did you know the Dougy?
- I worked a bit together.

01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:16,433
You know how to appreciate the dimensions?

1011
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:18,433
It depends.

1012
01:23:18,605 --> 01:23:20,433
The size of what?

1013
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:23,604
How many inches do you think is

1015
01:23:25,605 --> 01:23:27,433
Plus or minus?

1016
01:23:27,605 --> 01:23:29,433

Approximately one gram.

1022
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:46,433
What is interesting,

1023
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,550
because this bill
$ 20,

1024
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,433

01:24:01,605 --> 01:24:05,800
The bartender receives a telephone
You get the package from point A,

1027
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,433

See, there is a simple standby.

1031
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:24,433
If you start to wave it around ...

1032
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:29,433
will be bad for you.

1033
01:24:33,605 --> 01:24:35,433

Not only you but also your daughter.

1037
01:24:44,605 --> 01:24:47,433

We are almost done.

1043
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:11,174
Lasts about 14 hours.

1044
01:25:13,605 --> 01:25:18,833
If things go well,
you could walk away and you.

1045
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:21,433
Yeah, sure.

1046
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,604

Take the money in this business,
Thi even buy a pear and Uta.

1051
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:38,433
You know what's funny
when you're in prison?

1052
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:43,433
Those who are closed and there
say they want to get out of there.

1053
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:47,433
I can not do jail Duggy.

1054
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,344

the court will move into the street.

01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,574
What the hell are you doing here, Kris?

1056
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,459

01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,809
You understand? For the simple 'fact

01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,165
Go, go.

E to the ground, to get him out of here.

1209
01:42:28,122 --> 01:42:30,698
You have to make the exchange.

1210
01:42:33,712 --> 01:42:35,999
They do not look for cops.

1211
01:42:36,351 --> 01:42:38,559
I'll distract their attention
coming out the front.

1212

Move that, move.

1238
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:51,804
Coughlin, put the gun down!

1239
01:46:53,302 --> 01:46:55,040
Fuck you!

1240
01:46:55,816 --> 01:46:59,124

Fergie, you remember to
Who left you without boas and e.

1250
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:39,700
I came here in great haste

1251
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:42,500
and I saw the suspect crossing
street, and hold in their hands a TEC-9.

1252
01:49:42,713 --> 01:49:46,980
I watched, I jumped out of the car,
Then, the suspect opened fire.

Why?

And if there's police?
