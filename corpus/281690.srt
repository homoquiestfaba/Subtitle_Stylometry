1
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:20,645
Simon, where's the Wakenfield code?

2
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,716
Everyone else has finished.

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,003
May I remind you...

4
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:27,122
that your culprition date
is non-negotiable?

5
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:30,946
I repeat: non-negotiable.

6
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,365
Did you see someone?

7
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,923
Yeah.

8
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,953
$ 21.52

9
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,899
Some guy, brown coat and a hat.

10
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,833
Hello?

11
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,433
<i>Do not touch it.</i>

12
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,913
Hello? Who is it?

13
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,101
<i>Public Emergency Services.</i>

14
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,371
Hello. I'd like to report a break in.

15
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,273
Puppy!

16
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,353
Go inside.

17
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,088
Simon, what's going on out there?

18
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,975
The neighbour's got a dog.

19
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,667
You made some improvement.

20
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,101
You want to see him do a trick?

21
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,814
Hum, not right now.
I've got a deadline.

22
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,860
Let me show you
something really cool.

23
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,744
That's my couch.
It's nanotech.

24
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:26,813
It's a fantastic piece of furniture,
and it cleans itself.

25
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,131
It cleans itself?

26
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:32,089
When you spill the Chianti on it
it cleans itself.

27
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:36,732
Hey, have you received
any packages lately?

28
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,193
Packages?

29
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:42,802
Yeah, I found these two packages
in my apartment.

30
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:43,668
What was in them?

31
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:46,454
- They were empty.
- Empty?

32
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,029
You know, I got an eviction notice.

33
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,794
Maybe the landlord's
playing tricks on me.

34
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,453
He's a Scheiß, and

35
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,012
he just wants to let you know
he can get into your apartment.

36
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,042
There's some kind of
chemical imbalance in him.

37
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,047
Well,

38
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:07,084
I should go. I'll talk to you later,
Derrick. I've got a deadline.

39
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,537
Yeah, I know you.
You're a professional.

40
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:22,091
Simon, why don't you get
the videophone hooked up?

41
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,396
I'd like to see your face

42
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:26,755
when you tell me why your code
still hasn't been abrogated.

43
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,620
The client is breathing on my neck
and he's no small client.

44
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,239
He's gonna crush us like rice.

45
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,151
A company has paid you well
for your work, Simon.

46
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,402
They will protect their investment.

47
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,546
Deliver the code, please.
Thank you.

48
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,225
Do you have the rent today,
Mr. Simon J.?

49
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,762
Tenants who pay get to stay.

50
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,880
Tenants who don't pay,
don't get to stay.

51
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,973
Unless you are useful.
Are you useful, Simon?

52
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,833
Or useless?

53
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,346
- What do you want?
- You're going to fix my terminal

54
00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:08,551
and I'm going to ignore
your delicate financial status.

55
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,625
I really can't today.
I've got a deadline.

56
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:17,872
I think you can get to your deadline

57
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:21,066
after you've fixed my terminal.

58
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,141
Please.

59
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,606
It's frozen again
and won't turn off.

60
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,248
Is it a virus?

61
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,775
- When did it go down?
- Earlier tonight.

62
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,366
What time?

63
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,460
According to the system,
around 11:30.

64
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,521
Is it a virus?

65
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,002
We'll see.

66
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:47,602
You know, someone's been
breaking in in my apartment.

67
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:50,288
Impossible, not with my security.

68
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:54,373
There are ways.
Camera's always crashing.

69
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:58,436
Besides, whoever it was
might live here.

70
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,170
Might even have a key.

71
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,158
Give me twenty minutes.

72
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,188
- Twenty minutes please.
- Sure, sure.

73
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,918
The terminal's fixed.

74
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,644
You're still ahead?

75
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,402
Anything to drink?

76
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,591
Hi. Do you have any locks?
Any padlocks or anything?

77
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,940
- Isle three.
- Thanks.

78
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,389
$ 32.52

79
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,483
Someone's following me again?

80
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,262
Yeah.

81
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,525
Howard?

82
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,843
Simon? I was just thinking about you.

83
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,878
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

84
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,199
Can you hold this for a second?

85
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,005
So... Listen Howard, have you been
sending me these packages?

86
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,530
Packages?

87
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,775
I've received these three packages,

88
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,836
I don't know how
they got to my apartment.

89
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:23,644
Packages?

90
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:27,186
There was nothing inside them.
And no address, no sender... Nothing.

91
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,682
Let's think about this for a second.
What do you think?

92
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,760
Maybe it's all just happening
inside your head.

93
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,437
- Perfect. Thanks, Howard.
- Don't laugh.

94
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,339
That's how they got me,
only in baskets,

95
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,693
and played their game,
but I've beat 'em.

96
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,506
That's how they get inside
your head with their tools,

97
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:52,347
They'd offer you that
target audience,

98
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:54,126
mass production, cheap labour,

99
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,626
uniform quality, easy access,
growth...

100
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,139
That's growth forever.

101
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,651
Oh hell, let's live forever.

102
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:04,148
Hallelujah, I'm a bomb.
Hallelujah, a bomb again.

103
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:08,866
Hallelujah, give me a hand out,
revive me again.

104
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,794
Howard, you're nuts.

105
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:11,863
Listen, I have to get upstairs

106
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:14,016
and put this lock on before
they try and break in again.

107
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,636
Do me a favour. If you see anything
weird or whatever, tell me. Okay?

108
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,073
The elevator works?

109
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,792
Why, was it broken?

110
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,353
I thought so.

111
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,712
No keys?

112
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,156
Can I use your phone?

113
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,399
So, what do you do?

114
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,861
Oh... I fix computers.
I work with computers.

115
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,324
<i>Hello, this is Juliet. I'm not in,
seems you gotta leave me a message.</i>

116
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,992
She is peaking out.

117
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,595
- I can call the landlord.
- Thanks.

118
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,585
Hello Simon.

119
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,916
I see you've been making friends.

120
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,676
She lost her keys.
She's locked out.

121
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:11,393
What's in it for me?

122
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,239
You can tell her I'll be right down.

123
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,377
Just a few minutes.

124
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,679
He says he'll be right down.

125
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:32,159
Oh, great.

126
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,607
I'd only sleep.

127
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:42,506
I hate to work at nights.
Gotta do laundry.

128
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,932
I feel like I never catch up.

129
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,276
Would you mind
if I made another call?

130
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,711
No.

131
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,784
<i>Hey, I'm not here.
Gonna look into your call when...</i>

132
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,877
Another machine.

133
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,997
Hey, I'm sorry I wasn't home.

134
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,288
Could you bring the package
to the hospital tomorrow,

135
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:29,414
Maybe I can pick it up tomorrow night.

136
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,116
Anyway take care.

137
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,273
You sent them.

138
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,838
You sent me those packages.

139
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,098
What packages?
I don't know what you're talking about.

140
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,759
Why are you here?

141
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,017
I was locked out and I thought
you were helping me.

142
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,028
All my data's encrypted.

143
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,652
No one can break in.
What are you doing in my apartment?

144
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,278
- I'm leaving.
- What do you want?

145
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,982
I just wanna get
some sleep. That's all.

146
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,650
The 24 hours are over.
Where is your code?

147
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,729
This is very unprofessional.
Smarten up or fuck off.

148
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:25,401
Please... and thank you.

149
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,033
Fucking virus,
Get out of my computer.

150
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,355
Red Courier now speaking.
May I help you?

151
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,745
Hey... Listen, it's an emergency.

152
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,478
I need the best home
security system on the market.

153
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,464
Also I would like the latest
virus protector and three cards of milk.

154
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,498
Alright. I'll be there in an hour.
It's free. Thanks for calling Red Courier.

155
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,215
- What's up, man!
- What did you get me?

156
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,559
I got you PRP 4000 infrared
motion and sound detector system

157
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,781
and Virus Pro Version 5.5.

158
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:58,820
Great.

159
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,548
Do you want me to install it?

160
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,528
Well, I'll install it myself,

161
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,682
but could you install
this trigger for me?

162
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,683
Yeah.

163
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,178
Did you bring the milk?

164
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,732
I might have to charge you
the emergency rate for this.

165
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah, that's fine.

166
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,974
Simon, I'm fucking with you.
Damn, I'll behave some serious!

167
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:18,300
Here.

168
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,790
Why do you need
all this security anyway?

169
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,449
I started receiving
these strange packages.

170
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,820
Four packages exactly the same.
Nothing inside them.

171
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:39,445
I was just asleep. No one has
the keys, apart from my landlord.

172
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:42,256
What about the windows
and the ventilation system?

173
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,758
Either way, you're not
gonna have a problem

174
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:57,683
now the system's off

175
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:01,858
and the code of the release is set.
Read the instructions.

176
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,152
Alright. Thanks for coming so quick.

177
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,727
You really need to get out.
I mean you look pale man.

178
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,310
and the place is like shit.

179
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,022
Look, go to a club, fuck a girl...

180
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:13,269
Let me get you some
psychedelic drugs.

181
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:14,399
You know I can get that shit.

182
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,829
Okay.

183
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,245
Look I'm only saying that
because I care about you.

184
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,426
You're one of my best customers.

185
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,899
- Thanks.
- Call me if you need anything.

186
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,201
Bye.

187
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,593
Look.. have you been putting
shit in my apartment?

188
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:13,955
Shit?

189
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:17,952
Yes, packages with
nothing inside them.

190
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,145
Did you crawl through
the vent on the wall?

191
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:31,469
So, here we are...

192
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,514
- Simon.
- Hi.

193
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,823
I was wondering if you could turn
your music down a little,

194
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,137
I'm trying to work.

195
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,364
Work? It's Friday!

196
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:59,053
It's the week-end. No work.

197
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:03,000
Come and have a drink. And let's talk
about the neighbours. Come.

198
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,518
Gesundheit. Are you sick?

199
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:16,820
Yeah, I guess.
Just an overnight thing.

200
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,072
I have the cure.

201
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,156
- Cognac. It's the best!
- Do you have any milk?

202
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,842
Milk is the worst for a cold.

203
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,329
Sit down!

204
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,512
Hey, what happened to your couch?
I thought it cleaned itself.

205
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,112
It's broken.

206
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,118
Drink this, it's good for you.

207
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,414
- So, how is your head?
- Adam.

208
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,685
He is sleeping right now,

209
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,746
but I believe
he's making some progress.

210
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,120
Yeah?

211
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,395
I always wanted to have a child,
but I have bad sperm.

212
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,039
- So what's its first word?
- Oh, he goes... aaaaaah!

213
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,986
Say, couldn't we use
your speech pattern?

214
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:11,809
At the moment he's learning
and he's using my pattern

215
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:15,534
but he keeps confusing
his voice with my voice.

216
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,496
And...

217
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:21,946
Adam needs clarity.

218
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:25,769
Adam with my voice?
It seems a little strange...

219
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:30,017
Please, do it for Adam.

220
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:35,797
A, B, C, D, E...

221
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:39,824
...F, G, H, I...

222
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:43,977
...J, K, L, M...

223
00:27:44,177 --> 00:27:48,077
...N, O, P, Q...

224
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:51,906
...R, S, T, U...

225
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:57,473
...V, W, X, Y, Z.

226
00:27:57,587 --> 00:28:02,198
Hello father. Thank you Simon.
Have you received the package?

227
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,672
I want to help you.

228
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:06,395
There are changes happening.

229
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:09,528
I am afraid... I am afraid.

230
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,198
My son!

231
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,242
Why does he make that sound?

232
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,496
I gave him access to the web
all the time. I don't censor anything.

233
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,274
- Are you infected?
- Maybe I should...

234
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:25,287
I'm gathering information.

235
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,877
I know something bad
is happening. I'm finding answers.

236
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:36,113
There are changes happening.
Some changes in the Q zero zero.

237
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,461
Adam!

238
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,753
Wait, don't touch it.

239
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,558
That's my neighbour,
the guy with the dog.

240
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:48,036
- Adam! You filthy thing!
- What are they doing?

241
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,073
- Haven't you played the neighbour's game?
- What game?

242
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,632
It's porno! Role-playing shit.

243
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,572
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was using you as a subject.

244
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:58,983
- What do you mean?
- I don't know,

245
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:02,740
maybe he's capturing
your reactions for his stories.

246
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:00,788
You!

247
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,823
You were in the club? My club?

248
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:11,426
- It's a free country.
- What are you, a sheep?

249
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,193
You've been following me.

250
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,709
Look, you've been fucking with me.

251
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,458
Why did you send me those packages?

252
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,145
Packages?
What do you know about packages?

253
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:30,880
- I don't wanna be part of your game.
- Is that what this is about?

254
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,074
You kiddin' me?
With all that's going on

255
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:35,371
you wanna talk about my game?

256
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:37,580
You're in the game!

257
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,435
You wanna lead
or you wanna follow?

258
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,390
There are changes happening, man.

259
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,152
I can show you things.

260
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,552
It's your call.

261
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,712
My dog will be hungry.

262
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,478
It's supper time for Puppy.

263
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:06,062
Hey, we're gonna have a drink,

264
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:07,793
I'll show you my game...

265
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:10,979
...then we can talk
about this package riddle.

266
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,834
Actually I think I must
go back to my apartment.

267
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,746
Don't be so fucking nervous!

268
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:23,272
Elevator doesn't work
and we gotta do with this.

269
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,620
Fix the fucking elevator!

270
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,383
Wait, check this out.

271
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,799
Are you gonna fix it?

272
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,222
How about that drink, uh?

273
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,638
Home sweet home.

274
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,710
Puppy?

275
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:07,929
Don't be the naughty boy.

276
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,513
Puppy!

277
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,633
There. See? He's fine.

278
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,680
Hear that?
Your phone is ringing.

279
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,615
Thin walls.

280
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:27,267
So...

281
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,969
What's your poison?

282
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,886
Huh.. I'd have a beer.

283
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,711
I drink Cola 500.

284
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,404
Yeah, that's fine.

285
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,884
- Haze 'em on your ass.
- Cheers.

286
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,138
Come.

287
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,882
Have a look at some of my work.

288
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,039
I just got the latest "Virus Pro".
I've been having some problems.

289
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,902
- Yeah, me too.
- It's been going around.

290
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,598
You wanna see something fresh?

291
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,197
Are you sure it's fixed?

292
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,345
Welcome to the game, my friend.

293
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:40,583
Bugs are part of the game.

294
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:45,472
they can grow as the game
grows. Have a seat.

295
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,355
You wouldn't have something
like this at the club?

296
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,498
Yeah, there's a few
of them at the club.

297
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,498
Thanks.

298
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:58,371
Okay.

299
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,838
Put your hands here.

300
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:05,798
Control it with your fingertips.
Everything's touch-sensitive.

301
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:07,603
This has a mind.

302
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:18,767
Yeah, that's Alice. Check her out.

303
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,193
Alright. You know what... I should...

304
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:37,914
You here?

305
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,436
So, what do you think of my game?

306
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,402
Isn't that the girl
who lives down in the hall?

307
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,403
Trish?

308
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,952
Yeah, the nurse.

309
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,328
She works on the cancer ward.

310
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,302
That chip is from her.

311
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,351
She needs a good fuck now, man.

312
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,640
She seems to me so full of life
after being surrounded by slow death all day.

313
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,587
I've always been so creative
doctoring her performance.

314
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,840
She doesn't like that.

315
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,455
She's Alice's friend.
Alice has many friends.

316
00:38:26,296 --> 00:38:27,909
I like Alice.

317
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:31,870
She holds my future.

318
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:34,681
I suspect her.

319
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:37,004
I don't know her motives.

320
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,400
What you do to me...

321
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,430
You're my baby...
You're my lover... you're mine.

322
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,112
I've received packages too.

323
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,712
Cola 500.

324
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,109
Cola 500.

325
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,560
I love the smell of sweat and blood.

326
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,280
You're my baby,
you're my lover. You're mine.

327
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,148
You're up early.

328
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,054
Still high, asshole?

329
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,354
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

330
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,307
You're right.

331
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,541
I've just been put on the one edge.

332
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,137
You're pretty fucked up, aren't you?

333
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,936
I'm just doing the laundry.

334
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,603
What's wrong?

335
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,481
I'm fine.

336
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,993
Are you sure?

337
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,762
It's alright.

338
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:31,591
It'll be alright.

339
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,447
He's watching us.

340
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,952
So? He's just another lonely man.

341
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,152
There's a lot of you out there.

342
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,949
You should probably
stay away from me.

343
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,576
I think I might be getting sick.

344
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:00,507
Yeah? Let's feel it.

345
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,153
I should go.

346
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,920
- That's a lot of milk.
- Well, I like it.

347
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,157
- It makes mucus.
- How much?

348
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:42,995
Lots. Enlarges the pancreas too.

349
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:45,162
- I meant the milk.
- So did I.

350
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,678
How much does it cost?

351
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,113
$ 82,57.

352
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,695
$ 82?

353
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,220
$ 82.57. I don't control
the prices, man.

354
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,405
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

355
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,375
Detective Harris and I

356
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:24,717
need to ask you a few questions.

357
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,640
No problem. What's the matter?

358
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,489
- Hello?
- Hello Simon, my name's Adam.

359
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,616
You may not talk to me.
I must talk to you.

360
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,359
I've been trying to
connect me with your brain.

361
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,075
I wanted to help you.

362
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:05,065
Stop buying. I must go now.
I will call again. I will call again.

363
00:47:16,563 --> 00:47:18,324
Hello.

364
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:21,405
Hello?

365
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,716
- Hey, what's up?
- You alright?

366
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,044
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

367
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:34,007
Just sort of freaked out man
about your neighbour, man,

368
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:36,482
I mean he used to be
this hardball tenant...

369
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,159
Do you think he was infected?

370
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,793
I don't know, I don't know.

371
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,599
Are you infected?

372
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,793
Infected with what?

373
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,553
I don't know, I don't know.

374
00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:51,656
You know...

375
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,178
You know your neighbour was on
to something? I mean his game

376
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:57,697
could be responsible for shit
done to venture corporate thugs.

377
00:47:57,897 --> 00:48:00,280
It has something to do with
those packages you received.

378
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,798
Do you still have one in here,
that I can look at?

379
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:06,910
Yeah.

380
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,353
Where?

381
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,038
I thought it was right here.

382
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,327
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

383
00:48:27,796 --> 00:48:29,928
I think you need a blood test, man.

384
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,787
Do you want me to take a sample?

385
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:37,786
- You could do that?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

386
00:48:37,986 --> 00:48:39,577
I got a kit in my bag.

387
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:41,020
Hey, take a seat.

388
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,508
- Where did you get this?
- Oh, connections.

389
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,247
Sterile. It's a one-time use.

390
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:55,423
Gimme a thumb.

391
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:04,075
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

392
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,208
I'll get this delivered to the lab.

393
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:12,015
I'll get the results back to you

394
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,584
as soon as possible.

395
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,297
Why are you drinking milk?

396
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,059
What?

397
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:22,316
Didn't you tell me
you were allergic to it?

398
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,277
Oh man, just stop drinking it for a while.

399
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:30,382
See how you react, alright?

400
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,560
Howard?

401
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,570
Who else could it be?

402
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,795
I don't know.

403
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,796
Did you see someone
in the garbage room?

404
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:04,387
I think that a dog
was in the building.

405
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:09,441
Maybe it was me.
I've been down here,

406
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:11,105
working on pipes and vents.

407
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,276
I'm really glad to see you Simon.

408
00:51:14,476 --> 00:51:16,010
Glad to see you.

409
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,597
Are you plugged in now?
Where are the plugs?

410
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,949
You know what I mean?
Plugged in plugged in plugged in?

411
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:23,519
Come on.

412
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,718
- Where?
- My place.

413
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,313
Sit down.

414
00:51:37,165 --> 00:51:38,911
You know, I made some home-made wine

415
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,248
Made out of real grapes.
You want some?

416
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,324
Sure.

417
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:48,642
- It's a nice place, Howard.
- You hungry?

418
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,718
- Yeah, I suppose I am.
- I'll make you a sandwich.

419
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:53,943
Thanks.

420
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,315
You know most people get that food thing,
almost get screwed and crazy?

421
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,180
They don't understand how the human
body works. They don't understand.

422
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,198
gastronomie.

423
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,073
Hey, Howard?

424
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,478
Can I trust you?

425
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,599
I hope so.

426
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,476
It's about the Christmas presents.

427
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,279
Yeah, those packages.

428
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,553
Do you feel sick?

429
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,227
No, actually I don't, now that
you're asking. I feel better.

430
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,905
- Here. Eat this.
- Oh, thanks.

431
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,503
That's good.

432
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,913
What were you feeling?

433
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,250
I don't know.
...I mean, everything.

434
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,913
What?

435
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,313
I feel... I feel the building,
humming and

436
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,680
...worrying...

437
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,791
...noises.

438
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,837
Most times I'm just afraid.

439
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,442
Afraid of my own apartment.

440
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,546
Afraid I might get another package.

441
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:25,622
Did you change your locks?

442
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:27,835
I can fix 'em for ya,
I'm really good with my manos.

443
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,929
- No, it's okay, I've already done it.
- You changed 'em?

444
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:36,135
- No, no, a friend of mine, Nile.
- An old friend?

445
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,032
I've known him for a while.

446
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,750
Somebody you can trust?

447
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,952
You're gonna be fine.

448
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,357
You have a conscience.
That's all you need.

449
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,318
- Thanks.
- You're welcome any time.

450
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,017
- Alright.
- Just a second.

451
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,812
Happy birthday, Simon.
It's one of my early inventions.

452
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,998
They're micro-bugs.

453
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:21,278
Yeah.

454
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,085
Yeah. Just toys, really.

455
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,833
They're nice.

456
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,636
Makes you feel like you're
in the country. I love that sound.

457
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,598
Makes me feel comfy and peaceful.

458
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,896
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

459
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,196
- Good night son.
- See you, Howard.

460
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,855
Hallelujah I'm a bomb...

461
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:50,038
Hallelujah bomb again.

462
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:56,513
Hallelujah...
Give me a hand out, revive me again.

463
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,440
Listen, Simon.
This isn't funny at all.

464
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,601
I don't think you realize
the seriousness of the situation.

465
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:17,855
We need that code.

466
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:19,624
There are people waiting.

467
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:22,672
I put someone else to work on it,
because I couldn't find you.

468
00:55:22,872 --> 00:55:24,845
I didn't know what to think.

469
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:26,697
If you don't get back at me soon

470
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:29,998
...you'll fucking find it hard
to work in this business in the future.

471
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:44,846
Hello?

472
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:47,324
It's the police!

473
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,014
We know you're in there!

474
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,681
Detective Harris and I...

475
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:56,840
...need to ask you
a few more questions.

476
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:01,164
Mr. J., open the door!

477
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,073
You okay?

478
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,514
Yeah... Yeah thanks.

479
00:57:26,622 --> 00:57:27,717
Hey.

480
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,214
Have you been calling me?

481
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,676
- Would like to come in?
- Thanks.

482
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,670
With those cops
I don't think I can sleep.

483
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,473
Would you want some milk?

484
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,553
No, thanks.

485
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,558
Simon, I'm moving.

486
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,873
What?

487
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,116
This place is really getting into me.

488
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,233
Where are you gonna go?

489
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,506
Anywhere but here.

490
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:14,166
The Hospital's out for sale,
they'll sell anything...

491
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,884
...it's pathetic.

492
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,350
Everyone's so afraid they don't
wanna get sick, so it's empty.

493
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,354
But where do they go?
No one cares.

494
00:58:23,554 --> 00:58:24,869
No one says a word, it's not normal

495
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,224
I mean maybe it's normal, but...

496
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,714
...maybe something is wrong with me.

497
00:58:29,914 --> 00:58:32,239
Have you been receiving the packages?

498
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,561
Have you been buying
and buying anything?

499
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:36,685
Consuming anything
out of the ordinary?

500
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,082
Listen to yourself.
You're paranoid about some package

501
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,627
while a man was murdered
down the hall. It's not normal.

502
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,790
Real people don't
have this conversation.

503
00:58:44,991 --> 00:58:48,148
Real people don't
think like this... It's like

504
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:50,773
everyone in this building is... is so...

505
00:58:50,973 --> 00:58:52,208
Hey Trish,

506
00:58:53,353 --> 00:58:56,892
- I saw you in the game.
- So what?

507
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,521
It's just something I did
to escape this fucking reality.

508
00:59:00,784 --> 00:59:02,915
What does that have
to do with anything?

509
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,828
I was playing the game when he died.

510
00:59:08,772 --> 00:59:11,614
I don't know anymore what
was real, or what wasn't.

511
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:14,482
But I couldn't get out.

512
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,200
I had to crawl through the vents.

513
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,670
I heard somebody coming in after me.

514
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,438
It's addictive.

515
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,358
I never should have played that game.

516
00:59:26,558 --> 00:59:28,228
But you've been tested?

517
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,033
Tested for what?

518
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,074
If you play the game
you should be examined out

519
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:33,527
...for mineralities in the blood...

520
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:35,804
...STDs, some of them...

521
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,697
If you haven't been
tested I can do it for you.

522
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:40,598
No, my friend Nile did it.

523
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:42,215
He's a doctor?

524
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,353
He's a courier.

525
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,850
You had a courier
take blood from you?

526
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,098
Are you fucking crazy?

527
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:51,449
- Oh, it's alright. He's a friend.
- A friend.

528
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,429
I have no friends here. And no family.

529
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,400
You know it's like I'd love
to have children some day...

530
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,517
...you can't raise children
in a place like this.

531
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:05,472
Everyone's tainted.

532
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,525
I'd like to go somewhere
where there's some people left.

533
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,686
Please don't say that,
it's not too late.

534
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:36,152
<i>Simon, it is Adam. I'm
worried about your condition.</i>

535
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,908
<i>I have learned many
systems of human logic,</i>

536
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:41,488
<i>I know bad and
good. Bad is Q zero.</i>

537
01:00:41,813 --> 01:00:43,802
<i>Double zero can make
the device stop.</i>

538
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:47,639
<i>You're in danger of being
erode. Stop buying.</i>

539
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,372
<i>I found the answers.
Buy is not answers.</i>

540
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:54,680
<i>Do not trust them.
I must go now.</i>

541
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:55,992
Wait, wait. Adam?

542
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,121
Hello?

543
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,029
Simon, I have something wrong.

544
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,476
Farm Cut meat!

545
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:18,973
Did you hear that?

546
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:20,661
Did you?

547
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:23,107
- What's going on?
- Please, help...

548
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,389
What? Farm Cut!

549
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:29,665
There is someone...

550
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,284
I have no control anymore.

551
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,166
Find someone of the Farm.

552
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,297
Hello?

553
01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:52,113
Hello?

554
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,772
Is anyone there?

555
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,832
Hello?

556
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,755
Anyone here?

557
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,627
Hello?

558
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,612
Shit!

559
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,092
Howard?

560
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,394
Simon J.?

561
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:51,929
Yes.

562
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,121
You're fired.

563
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:54,917
I wanted to tell you over the phone...

564
01:03:55,118 --> 01:03:58,026
just to make sure that
the words got into your brain.

565
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,116
Yes, I'm sorry.

566
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,787
Your code. Where is it?

567
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,713
It's been infected.

568
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,513
A virus?

569
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,315
I don't know. What was the code for?

570
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,675
I can't tell you that, Simon,
you know your contract.

571
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,308
Tell me. What was the code for?

572
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,808
I don't know. We're only
working on a specific part.

573
01:04:20,008 --> 01:04:21,444
We don't know the big picture.

574
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,191
We know you're in there.

575
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,868
We want to have
a few words with you.

576
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:43,645
There's something
we want to tell you.

577
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,169
It concerns your health and safety.

578
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,038
I have safety through my alarm.
Everything's fine.

579
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,543
No, no.
Everything is not fine.

580
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,388
Your life as well as most, if not all, the
tenants' in this building is in possible danger.

581
01:05:06,588 --> 01:05:08,319
We're warning everyone.

582
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,407
Now obviously I can't force
you to do anything,

583
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,015
but I would suggest
you leave the building...

584
01:05:12,215 --> 01:05:14,522
until this matter is resolved.

585
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,997
If you feel sick at all

586
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,728
check yourself into a Hospital.

587
01:05:21,268 --> 01:05:23,419
Better to be safe than sorry.

588
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,884
Good day to you, sir.

589
01:05:27,528 --> 01:05:29,079
Good day.

590
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,993
- Hello?
- Nile speaking.

591
01:05:38,357 --> 01:05:40,691
- Hey, where are my results?
- I've got 'em.

592
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:48,312
Actually... You know what, don't worry
about it at all. I think I'll go to a Hospital.

593
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:51,200
No, don't go there Simon, don't go there!
I'll be right there in a minute.

594
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,802
No, that's okay. Bye.

595
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,394
- Simon, where you goin'?
- What are you doing here?

596
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,836
Look man, I'm trying to stop you from making
a mistake. Look, I've got your results.

597
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,180
Don't freak out.
There's something in your blood.

598
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,589
And the last place
you wanna go is in there.

599
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,876
- Don't worry, Trish works in there.
- Who's that?

600
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,180
She's a friend of mine,
someone I can trust.

601
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,321
Oh, you trust her?
I've never even heard of her.

602
01:06:17,522 --> 01:06:18,623
You don't even talk to fucking girls!

603
01:06:18,824 --> 01:06:20,613
You can't trust anybody
in there right now.

604
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:22,942
I'm the only one you can
trust, but I gotta tell you:

605
01:06:23,143 --> 01:06:26,277
- What have you been working on?
- You said you didn't wanna know.

606
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,829
It's an antivirus program, right?

607
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,156
My code got infected,
I couldn't finish it.

608
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,312
That's bullshit! The only thing
that's infected is you!

609
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,538
They gave it to everybody
in your building, Simon.

610
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:39,484
You're a fucking
guinea pig, and so am I.

611
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,672
It's a big experiment
that's all gone wrong.

612
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,832
Now, if we don't do something
about it, we're both gonna die.

613
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:47,229
Okay?
Now get on the bike!

614
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,500
What are the packages for?

615
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,463
What the fuck!

616
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,909
What are the packages for?

617
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,878
The package is a delivery system.

618
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,793
What? There's nothing inside them.

619
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,794
Just because you don't see it,
doesn't mean there's nothing.

620
01:07:02,663 --> 01:07:04,520
Now, what's inside you is inside me.

621
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,796
- It's not safe anymore.
- What's inside them?

622
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,024
Nanomites. Version 1.0.

623
01:07:15,224 --> 01:07:15,989
What?

624
01:07:16,189 --> 01:07:18,918
Code-break messages that
go directly into your brain.

625
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,388
That's why you can't stop
buying Nature Fresh Milk

626
01:07:21,389 --> 01:07:23,357
and I can't stop buying
fucking Parker Jarks. man.

627
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,996
And it is not safe anymore.
Get on the bike!

628
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,469
No, you're lying. You're working for them.

629
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,233
No!

630
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,119
You're trying to scare
me, to manipulate me.

631
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,396
Simon, your code could help us.

632
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,872
Now you're wanting the code.
You won't get it. It's there.

633
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,393
Stay away from me.

634
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,981
Be quiet, Adam!

635
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,600
Be quiet!

636
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,059
I need to talk to Adam.

637
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,793
Come in.

638
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,814
Come in, Simon.
I need to talk to you.

639
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,801
I can explain. I can help you
explain. You know the nanomites?

640
01:08:28,924 --> 01:08:32,399
You know, he's been calling me
when you're not at home.

641
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,436
Adam is behaving
very strange lately.

642
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,795
Father made Adam,
he no made the nanomites.

643
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,410
You've been receiving
the packages too?

644
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:41,932
What packages, Simon?

645
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:43,990
- What's in your fridge?
- In my fridge?

646
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,033
Adam knows about the packages.
Adam knows something bad is happening.

647
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,481
Adam knows that Derrick father is infected.

648
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:52,763
- Adam knows that Derrick father lied about...
- Stop talking!

649
01:08:52,764 --> 01:08:56,486
Stop right now, you filthy thing!

650
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,995
Adam, knows that nanomites malfunction.

651
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,792
I'm sorry, my son.

652
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,533
What the hell are you doing living here
all deep in this fucking building,

653
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:09,874
playing with your stupid android head?

654
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:12,580
- I want you to leave.
- Shut the fuck up!

655
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,851
You sent me those packages.

656
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,906
- Leave, now!
- Or what?

657
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,205
Or I'll have to call the authorities...

658
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:24,323
I don't want to do that.

659
01:09:24,523 --> 01:09:26,166
Simon, I think you're sick.

660
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,444
You're the sick one.

661
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:34,510
Simon, I saw you going into
the neighbour's apartment

662
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,849
the night he was killed.

663
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,951
Well, if you're so sure
I killed my neighbour,

664
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,592
what makes you think I won't do
exactly the same thing to you?

665
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,968
Simon.

666
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:30,073
What's wrong?

667
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,737
I think I'm alright.
I think I just fainted.

668
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,713
Careful.

669
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,886
I'll be alright in a minute.

670
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,639
What did you buy?

671
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,473
Just some juice
and stuff. Look at me.

672
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,674
Stuff? What kind of stuff?

673
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,270
Oh, just juice, actually.

674
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,513
What kind of juice?

675
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,393
Orange Juice synthetically pure
calcium, enriched with vitamin E.

676
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,429
You've been receiving
packages too, haven't you?

677
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,076
Do you know what's going on?

678
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,072
Can you feel it?

679
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,593
- I'm full of bugs.
- No.

680
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:43,466
- No.
- I'm full of mistakes.

681
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,869
Life is full of mistakes.

682
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,744
Gentle.

683
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:25,467
I don't love you.

684
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,739
I don't love you either.

685
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,184
Come inside.

686
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,075
Trish?

687
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,417
Trish, are you here?

688
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,306
Simon?

689
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,833
Go away!

690
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,785
Simon, it's Nile.
Come on, man, open the door!

691
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,030
Open the door before it's too late!

692
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,830
I can't take this anymore,
It has to stop.

693
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,593
So you believe me now?

694
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,639
I'm seeing things. I'm seeing people

695
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,067
and they're not there.
I'm seeing packages.

696
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,649
I know, I know.
They're side effects, bugs.

697
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:26,757
It's a beta version,
but I found the upgrade.

698
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:30,832
The upgrade from version
1.0 to version 1.1.5.

699
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,912
Look, I've got it right here,
I just need you to touch it.

700
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,419
- Have you tried it?
- Yes, yes yes. Simon, look at me, I'm fine.

701
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:38,111
Everything's okay.

- Yes.

705
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,120
- But how do I know?
- It should already be working.

706
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,266

Not much. How are you?

716
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,233
Hey Trish!

717
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:38,827
Hey Trish!

718
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,128
It's me!

719
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,947
Nature Fresh Milk!

720
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,393
Howard?

721
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,279
Nile, you fucking bastard.
There are more bugs in this.

722
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,635
What - Nature Fresh Milk!

723
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,858
Did you hear that?
I didn't say it!

724
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,716
You sent me the first
package, didn't you?

725
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,832
Fuck!

726
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,914
<i>Leave your message after the beep.</i>

727
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:00,079
Trish, hi this is Simon.

728
01:20:00,644 --> 01:20:01,680
Listen...

729
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,757
I'd like to come, come with you.

730
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,315
You were right about everything.

731
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,953
Hello... Nature Fresh Milk!

732
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,983
Help me. Help me!

733
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,119
I love my life.

734
01:20:38,024 --> 01:20:39,606
It's too late.

735
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,362
Simon?

736
01:21:12,256 --> 01:21:13,496
I heard the crickets.

737
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,521
Howard, come in.

738
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,215
Can you help me?

739
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,817
- I'm sorry. You want something to drink?
- No.

740
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,631
Nature Fresh Milk!

741
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,716
Did you hear that?

742
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,588
- I didn't say it. Zero nanomites.
- Yeah.

743
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,006
Zero nanomites. Happily brought.

744
01:21:49,323 --> 01:21:50,728
I'm afraid.

745
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,337
Let me take your hand.

746
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,120
There are good people and there are bad people and
they're on their way and they want you, Simon.

747
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,763
The bad people could
save you, but they won't.

748
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:07,562
The good people, they wanna
save you, but they can't.

749
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,831
The bad people, Farm people,
they wanna hurt you, Simon.

750
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,955
They want to possess your intellectual
fibre. They want your money.

751
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,141
They put the mites in your brain.

752
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:23,609
And I wanna save you.

753
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:25,880
Come on, open your mouth.

754
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,136
You see, you haven't got much time.

755
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:32,997
This'll help you, come on.

756
01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:36,700
Simon, you're infected.
Just say "ah"! "Ah"!

757
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:37,800
Say "ah".

758
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,972
Almost too late.

759
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,235
Your body is rejecting the mites.

760
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,551
It's a completely bugsy product.
It never would happen in my day.

761
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:00,568
If I don't remove your hard drive,
you're gonna have to die, or Farm will catch you.

762
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:07,193
I've saved you Simon, just like I've saved
the landlord, the game man.

763
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,384
I was too late for that garbage man.

764
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,037
How you know,
I don't know everything.

765
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,627
You know, you're gonna feel
a little uncomfortable for a while...

766
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,147
...then you're gonna sleep.

767
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,353
And when you wake up,
everything's gonna be different.

768
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:32,772
Everything is gonna be good.

769
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,193
There's a time when we walk up.
There's a time we fall back.

770
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,248
It's just the beginning.

771
01:23:47,593 --> 01:23:47,593
