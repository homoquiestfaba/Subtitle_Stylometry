1
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,255
You want some coffee?

2
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,821
You're supposed
to make me some coffee.

3
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,231
Well, I hope she likes it.
The weather's pretty nice.

4
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,359
Look at the clouds.

5
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,907
Oh, she's nuts.

6
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,851
Shut up.

7
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,289
No no no!

8
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,207
Stop.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,217
No, let me go!

10
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,691
Please don't!
Don't! No! No!

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,059
Please don't.
Please. Stop.

12
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,623
Don't. Don't.

13
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,259
No! Stop.

14
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,305
No! No! No. Stop.

15
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,616
No. No.

16
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,458
Stop it. No.

17
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,055
Stop it!
Stop.

18
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,599
Stop.

19
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,303
Hey, can I get
everybody's attention?

20
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,869
Hello?

21
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,978
Welcome to 9 Juliet.

22
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,416
Do me a favor and put
your phones on the table.

23
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,180
What?

24
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,911
Wow.

25
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,514
That is quite a collection.

26
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,827
Who thinks this is silly?

27
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,488
Raise your hand.

28
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,930
Okay.

29
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,433
Remi, Holly, Justine,

30
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,096
Margot, Natalie.
Who else?

31
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,435
Madison thinks it's silly.

32
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,475
No no no, I have a question.

33
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,976
- Yeah?
- Are you gonna take these away?

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,775
- I am.
- When?

35
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,839
Hey, I'm fine.
Take 'em away.

36
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,475
You're ready, huh?

37
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,146
You know,
when I tell people what I do

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,417
and I talk about this program,

39
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,119
some people ask me

40
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,184
"Is it really that out of control?"

41
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,423
And I'm telling you guys

42
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,658
that here tonight at this table

43
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,396
we have a $2400-a-month texter.

44
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,267
We have serious online gambler,

45
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,070
a hacker,

46
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,632
a cyber-bully.

47
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,942
We have two students who,
in one year,

48
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,879
have gone from top of their class

49
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,940
to barely passing

50
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,452
because of time spent online.

51
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:21,118
And one of you caused
a five-car pile-up on the freeway

52
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,857
because she was talking on the phone
while she was driving.

53
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,236
So you guys
still think it's silly?

54
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,070
I mean, it's kinda serious, right?

55
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,603
And I'm not saying
"Don't use technology."

56
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,305
I love technology,
but we just...

57
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,406
we don't want to abuse it,

58
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,646
because there's more to relationships
than pushing buttons,

59
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,516
and that's what
this program is about.

60
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,215
It's about relationships...

61
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,457
face to face, eye to eye,

62
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,618
talking to each other,

63
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,491
listening to each other.

64
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,163
And you're gonna have fun.

65
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,427
And you know what?

66
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,265
I know you just met
each other tonight

67
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,829
but some of you,
after this program,

68
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,866
I promise will become
lifelong friends.

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,480
You going out?

70
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,116
No.

71
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,785
There you go.
It is all yours.

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,311
Hey, you left a mess here.

73
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,816
You wanna clean it up?

74
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,725
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

75
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,792
Right there.

76
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,073
There you go.

77
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,000
Hi.

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,004
Was that a camera?

79
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,483
I'm hungry. I'm going
to the vending machine.

80
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,961
Oop! Sorry.

81
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,664
That's okay.
Do what you need to do.

82
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,672
Where'd you get
the sandwich?

83
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,302
My house. I have more.
Do you want one?

84
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,868
Uh, no thanks.

85
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,374
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,645
My mom bought
a whole bunch of stuff for us.

87
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,884
Dude! Check it out.

88
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,326
Oh my God.

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,231
Sick.

90
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,268
You guys.

91
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,568
Could you keep it down?
I'm trying to work.

92
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,135
- Sure.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,146
...and made positive use
of the sector from Wall Street.

94
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,120
But blue chips fell victim
to a sell-off after a two-session rally

95
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,383
to propel the Dow Industrial
further in 2011.

96
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,652
US import prices took
their sharpest plunge

97
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,159
in over eight years in March.

98
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,827
- That was so awkward.
- Come on.

99
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,664
Guys, what's going on?

100
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,466
We thought you were
right behind us.

101
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,564
That other girl, Dawn...

102
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,474
- we're rooming with her... so uptight.
- That's all I have to say.

103
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,035
- Whoa. What?
- She's the one with the puffer.

104
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,944
No, I think she's really nice.

105
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,848
Go. Go.

106
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,915
...and bulldozers rumbled
into this refugee camp

107
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,018
earlier Wednesday, razing...

108
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,364
- Yes!
- Go.

109
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,936
- I wanna. I wanna. Wait.
- No no no no! Shh!

110
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,106
Look what you did.

111
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,809
Okay okay okay. Shh!

112
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,579
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Why?

113
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,711
- Just turn around.
- Why?

114
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,584
She doesn't want us
to see her password.

115
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,953
Oh.

116
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,924
Okay, you can look.
Okay.

117
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,960
So there's this girl
at my school... Angela,

118
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,629
and she thinks
I'm this girl named Blair.

119
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,425
And I put this shit
up on her wall,

120
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,966
and it's totally outing her
about what a skank she is

121
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,935
and how she got all messed up at this
party and was totally being a slut.

122
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,164
My friend was there and, like,
she saw the whole thing

123
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,139
and so did a bunch of people
from my friend's school.

124
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,607
So anyways,
on this profile of Blair,

125
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,542
I blab to everyone
on her page about it.

126
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,080
Yeah, she has no idea.
It's so great.

127
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,526
"R" to the "E"
to the "M" to the "I"

128
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,933
Remi is my name,
that's dancing in the line...

129
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,333
I don't wanna be here,
I don't wanna be here

130
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,171
And matter of fact,
you should check your back.

131
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,644
Check your back.
Uh, yeah.

132
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,009
May I have the camera?

133
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,644
Yes.

134
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,253
Margot.

135
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,554
Margot.

136
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,395
All right, ladies, listen up.

137
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,168
We're gonna get the stuff
loaded onto the boat.

138
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,402
Groceries are gonna
go in the galley,

139
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,707
the sleeping bags
and duffels up top

140
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,407
and the ropes
and climbing gear aft. Okay?

141
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,315
Everybody. Now.

142
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,645
Get to work.

143
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,094
If the boat gets stuck
in the water,

144
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,158
we use these poles
to push our way through.

145
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,804
Ow!

146
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,584
Which one of you has
experience with boats?

147
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,248
Me.
My dad owns a boat.

148
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,689
Fantastic. You're gonna
take us out, okay?

149
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,021
Right on.

150
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,090
How fast she go?

151
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,927
Are you asking me
how fast she goes

152
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,830
or how fast you're
allowed to drive her?

153
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,764
Oh!

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,402
Whoa!

155
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,566
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

156
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,271
- You always have to hold onto something.
- That makes sense.

157
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,677
If your engine dies,
you can use them

158
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,978
as a makeshift rudder
or to rescue a man overboard.

159
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,479
- Justine.
- Mmm?

160
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,284
Why do we need paddles
on a houseboat?

161
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,086
I have no idea.

162
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,621
What's port? Good.

163
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,220
What's starboard?
Thank you.

164
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,822
- You're gonna be awesome.
- Okay.

165
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,924
I'll take those.

166
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,372
You guys get the rest
of the gear loaded.

167
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,336
Whoa!

168
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,167
Margot, stop.

169
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,774
That was interesting.

170
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,312
Okay, how you doing, Ashley?

171
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,679
I think that if you twist
the line as you coil,

172
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,547
- it works better.
- Come up from below, over the top horn,

173
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,950
cross over,
under the bottom horn.

174
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,512
- I'm a visual learner.
- Up two and over one.

175
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,115
Okay, so it's like this.

176
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,889
- Okay. Okay.
- You just kind of twist it like that.

177
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,056
- Okay.
- Yup, thanks.

178
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,464
- Yeah.
- Take one.

179
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,530
I don't know how we're supposed
to learn to drive the boat

180
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,667
when we're not allowed
to touch anything.

181
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,768
Everything okay, Margot?

182
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,244
- I think Dawn wants to talk to you.
- Does she?

183
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,309
Okay, you guys keep working.

184
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,260
Okay, what's going on?

185
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,627
Mmm. How do you think this feels?
It was really grinding.

186
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,029
I know.
I heard it.

187
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,976
It sounds fine.
It's fine.

188
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,238
She's tough.

189
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,514
- Didn't you read the brochure?
- No!

190
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,016
Yes.

191
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,890
- What does that mean?
- Did I get it?

192
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,896
- "Hi, how are you?"
- "Hi, how are you?"

193
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,959
- What was the first one you said?
- Remi, please roll your tongue.

194
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,436
- Wait.
- No, like this.

195
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,803
I can't do it.

196
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,739
Wait wait. What?

197
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,300
No, like when it goes
up and down, like...

198
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,573
Yeah! I can't do that.

199
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,740
- What are your rates?
- How much do I charge?

200
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,512
- Yeah.
- You want an "A" or do you want a "B"?

201
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,110
- I'm dead serious. Yeah.
- Seriously?

202
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,824
There is, like, no one in this town.

203
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,259
Population: Three.

204
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,661
I wanna do that.

205
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,899
What did you say?

206
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,563
- Oh my God, so funny.
- I hope he throws up.

207
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,131
That's gross.

208
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,904
Yes, he does.

209
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,418
You guys are gonna be doing this

210
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,078
every day while we're together,

211
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,021
so I promise you it'll get easier.

212
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,422
Hey, Nancy.

213
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,090
Yes?

214
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,100
- What should I write?
- I don't know.

215
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,399
- Who are you writing to?
- Nancy, this is crazy.

216
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,533
I'm trying to write my sister
at college in California.

217
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,578
- Oh, that's great.
- But I don't know what to write.

218
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,242
Can you tell me
how to start it?

219
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,715
- No, I can't.
- I can't do it.

220
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,450
Can we write about
someone here we don't like?

221
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,663
Do you guys have
this much trouble with a keyboard?

222
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,155
I know you don't.

223
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,224
It's just different.

224
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,667
What's different about it?

225
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,898
It's really intimate.

226
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,100
- Aha.
- It's just too slow, you know?

227
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,701
It’d just be so much faster
if we could text.

228
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,769
You like your speed,
don't you?

229
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,208
Ashley?

230
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,345
Are you okay?

231
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:18,985
Hey.

232
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,794
What's going on?

233
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,267
Can you talk about it?

234
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,240
No.

235
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,816
I'm writing
to the mom of a boy

236
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,478
who got a punctured lung
from the wreck.

237
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,681
And she's really mad and she won't
return any of our calls.

238
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,918
And I feel so bad.

239
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,831
He's gonna be okay,
but I just...

240
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,162
I want her to know
how sorry I am.

241
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,328
- Here. Here.
- Thank you, Holly.

242
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,602
I'm sorry.
It just kind of hit me.

243
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,906
That's okay.

244
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,715
- It's okay.
- I've just been praying a lot.

245
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,508
Does that make you feel better?

246
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,417
Yeah.

247
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,197
You okay?

248
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,565
Yeah. Thanks.

249
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,080
- 11.
- But you rolled 10.

250
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,979
What? She rolled 11.

251
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,950
- I did not. Look.
- Wait.

252
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,077
It's got one more dot.
One, two, three. So...

253
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,952
- I think it's almost...
- Wait. Remi, have you gone?

254
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,082
- It's okay, just...
- Yeah no, I'll go again.

255
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,059
- Ashley.
- Okay. Oh, is it my turn now?

256
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,153
- Did you hear that?
- Ready?

257
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,462
Yeah, just doing the math, guys.
I don't really have any...

258
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,498
Why do you have five cards?

259
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,699
I don't know.
Someone handed me two of them.

260
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,674
'Cause she was
holding her cards.

261
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,802
She handed me two of them.

262
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,813
Bishops should go...

263
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,076
right there.

264
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,270
- Do you wanna bet?
- So how much money did you bring?

265
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,984
It's about $300.

266
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,854
Oh yeah, right!
They're all ones!

267
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,724
I bet that's, like, $15, $16.

268
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,626
Okay, so do
you guys wanna bet?

269
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,725
- That's nine.
- That's eight!

270
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,669
I'm just deciding.
Okay next. Okay.

271
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,263
How do you move the horse?

272
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,205
Okay.

273
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,141
He is called the knight.

274
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,977
What's wrong?

275
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,679
I'm not sure.

276
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,213
Um...

277
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,886
I don't wanna take
any chances.

278
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,724
- And every move after that...
- So...

279
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,787
I think it's Miss Scarlet.

280
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,662
...I’m gonna
pull her in over there

281
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,293
and we're gonna
stay there for tonight.

282
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,894
Would you get 'em
ready to moor?

283
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,463
- Please? Thank you.
- Okay.

284
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,714
Right. Right now.
Go right.

285
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,388
Go right.

286
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,268
I know it's a little rough.

287
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,236
It's just for one night.

288
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,173
All right, 9 Juliet, let's get all
the gear off the boat.

289
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,369
- This sucks.
- Let's go!

290
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,278
- I need bug spray.
- Grab this side. I'll get the other.

291
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,781
All right, guys,
keep working!

292
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,285
Are you joking?

293
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,549
Ow! I got bit by something.

294
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,286
Get that tent up.
Come on.

295
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,889
Somebody go get
the other cooler.

296
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,955
- I got bit!
- Um, you guys,

297
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,467
put it... put it more like that.

298
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,732
- Like a puzzle piece. It's this way.
- All right.

299
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,968
- Claire, can you get water?
- Grab that one.

300
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,910
- Yo, Margot?
- Guys, how are you doing this?

301
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,142
- That's not gonna fit there.
- All right.

302
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,379
- You got it?
- Yeah, we're good. Whoo!

303
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,443
I can't set up a tent!

304
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,489
We're gonna have to...
hey, can you hold this up here?

305
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,615
Somebody get that log
so we can use it as a bench.

306
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,932
Natalie, that piece is too big.

307
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,693
Where's the front?
Was it this one or this one?

308
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,927
You got it.

309
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,530
Wait. Does anybody
have allergy medicine?

310
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,803
Just keep working.
We need lots of wood.

311
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,308
Chatcolet.
It's French, I think.

312
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,612
Isn't it?

313
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,848
My dad used to take me
here every summer,

314
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,585
and he told me
that Chatcolet was the name

315
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,925
of an Indian maiden who fell in love
with a handsome trapper.

316
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,091
And when he didn't
return her love,

317
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,194
she was so broken-hearted
that she drowned herself in this river.

318
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,466
That's sad.

319
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,610
So what do you guys think?

320
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,940
How was your first day?

321
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,413
Was it kinda what you expected?

322
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,882
Yes? No?

323
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,715
It was different in that

324
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,881
it all feels very real.

325
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,982
Go on.

326
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,584
Well, coming here
was my idea.

327
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,493
Nobody made me.

328
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,589
I knew I needed
to make a change,

329
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,999
so I researched it
and found it.

330
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,037
One of my issues

331
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,005
is that I can be
kind of shy sometimes,

332
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,835
so online relationships
are really easy for me.

333
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,173
I don't know.
This just feels really real.

334
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,808
Does that make sense?

335
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,615
Mm-hmm.
Well, how do you like it so far?

336
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,348
It's okay.
I like it, I guess.

337
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,689
Well, I have a surprise.

338
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,539
- I'm confused.
- Oh my God.

339
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,801
Hypocrite.

340
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,709
I usually save this
for the last night,

341
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,214
but I know you guys could use
a little morale boost.

342
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,477
So who wants to pick?

343
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,053
Here!

344
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,849
Unh!

345
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,150
Whoo!

346
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,524
Well, that's unfortunate.

347
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,693
But we should probably keep
our noise level down

348
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,237
for those people 'cause it's late

349
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,331
and that's the considerate thing
to do, okay?

350
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,172
Get outta my closet.
Come on. Get to working.

351
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,373
Hey. Hey.

352
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,472
- Get out of there.
- Stop it!

353
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,346
Stop!

354
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,550
Stand up.

355
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,148
Get that thing away from me.

356
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,057
- Eww.
- Oh, you want it?

357
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,029
- Come closer.
- Can we not...?

358
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,689
Hey. Hey, where you going?

359
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,529
Hey, where'd you go?

360
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,568
I want to talk to you...

361
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,573
I wanna talk to you
briefly about tomorrow.

362
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,109
We're gonna get up at 5:00.

363
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,044
We're gonna eat at 5:30.

364
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,343
And then I want you
to go back to your...

365
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,906
whatever your
morning thing is,

366
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,818
air out your sleeping bags,
and then generally police the area.

367
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,719
There you go.

368
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,224
Easy, little girl.

369
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,558
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,723
- Let's go to bed.
- Gonna put on a show.

371
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,699
There you go.
There you go.

372
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,267
Get your drunk ass
away from me!

373
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,000
Keep it down over there!

374
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,079
Shut up, bitch!

375
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,755
Okay, we get the point!

376
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,801
You can turn
the light out now.

377
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,079
Can we all agree

378
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,123
that we're not gonna play
shout-out with those people?

379
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,885
- Okay.
- Yeah.

380
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,291
- Let's go.
- Yes.

381
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,672
Come on, ladies.
It's time to get up.

382
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,042
Wake up.
Come on, it's morning.

383
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,240
- Girls, come on.
- What time is it?

384
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,044
It's time to wake up, okay?

385
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,052
It's morning time. Wake up.

386
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,090
It's time to get up.
Wake up.

387
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:56,924
Girls, come on.

388
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,032
Morning, ladies.

389
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,377
Good morning.

390
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,043
How y'all doing?

391
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,760
Holy shit, dude.

392
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,979
Hi!

393
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,150
Can you take your...?

394
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,592
Oh. Sorry.

395
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,497
It's my boyfriend's music.

396
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,263
Anyway, we ran out of coffee

397
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,395
and I thought, "What the hell.

398
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,497
I'm gonna go ask them."

399
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,168
Yeah, we have coffee.

400
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,642
How do you take it?

401
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,202
Black.

402
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,407
Anyway, I just wanted
to apologize

403
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,448
for all that noise last night
and that damn light.

404
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,847
He was drunk.

405
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,512
Well, we were
pretty rowdy ourselves.

406
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,390
Everything okay over there?

407
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,618
Oh.

408
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,853
Yeah.

409
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,360
Eh, normal.

410
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,363
Everyday boat living.

411
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,796
You know, this coffee is shit.

412
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,169
Well, it is what it is.

413
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,232
I could teach you how to make
a good pot of campfire coffee.

414
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,937
You could, huh?

415
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,572
We may have to do that
another time.

416
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,048
I would like you guys
to get some firewood.

417
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,415
- Aren't we leaving?
- Soon.

418
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,078
What are y'all doing today?

419
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,257
Did you hear me?
Can we get some firewood?

420
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,467
What, is this some kind
of Girl Scout thing or something?

421
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,300
Yeah.
Yeah, something like that.

422
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,136
Mickey, let's go!

423
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,847
Well...

424
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,209
it was really nice
meeting y'all.

425
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,886
And thanks for the coffee.

426
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,287
You guys keep practicing
on that badge.

427
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,655
Thank you.

428
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,122
Y'all have fun today.

429
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,891
Hey.

430
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,987
Well, I don't know
what's going on.

431
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,625
So what I want to do

432
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,134
is take her down to Dave
and have him look at her.

433
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,398
And I will feel a lot better

434
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,440
if he fixes whatever
it is that's going on

435
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,338
before I get
you guys back onboard.

436
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,606
And that should only take me about
half a day at the max.

437
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,170
What do you want me
to do with them?

438
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,012
I want you to get them familiar
with all the rappelling gear.

439
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,646
There's some really good rocks that
we saw when we were on our way in.

440
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,020
Just have 'em swim, eat lunch,

441
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,993
just hang out, swim some more
and I'll be back.

442
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,993
Are you sure they're gonna wanna
take orders from me?

443
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,159
Well, you don't have
to give 'em orders.

444
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,793
You can just have
fun with them.

445
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,600
You can do this.

446
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,868
Okay, this is a very good
opportunity for you.

447
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,705
Especially you.

448
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,608
Okay?

449
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,549
And I know you're really sad
that your friends are gone...

450
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,712
...but carry on.

451
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,457
Ashley, you've got to set
up your stuff. Come on.

452
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,829
This is a belay device...

453
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,031
and you just click it in here...

454
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,700
and it is used
to slow your descent

455
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,072
while you rappel.

456
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,336
Natalie, how about
you put that on your belt?

457
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,903
Okay.

458
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,473
All right, now I'm gonna
show you the figure-eight knot.

459
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,918
You hold your rope,
bend it around

460
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,853
and pull it through there.

461
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,720
Okay, Natalie,

462
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,759
how about you give it a try?

463
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,755
It's the primary knot
used in rock climbing.

464
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,659
Great.

465
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,559
You in a funk?

466
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,334
I think it's just a little water
in the fuel pump.

467
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,174
It happens quite a bit.

468
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,148
Why don't you head to the front?
We'll give you a tow.

469
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,209
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

470
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,699
Hurry up, Margot!
Catch up!

471
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,568
- Look!
- What are you doing?

472
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,675
Wait, we have to start over!

473
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,905
- Don't talk to me, woman!
- You don't talk to me.

474
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,743
- Shut up! Don't talk to me!
- Ugh!

475
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,047
- Hey!
- Do we have to do that?

476
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,416
Don't!

477
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,051
When Dawn pointed
to that last boulder,

478
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,617
I think I actually yelled at her.

479
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,541
Come on, Natalie! Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on!

480
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,502
Come on, you guys.
You can do it!

481
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,440
- Dawn, what's the time?
- Come on, ladies, faster!

482
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,999
- Oh no!
- What?

483
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,411
Three, two, one!
Way to go!

484
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,073
38 seconds.

485
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,912
Six seconds off your last time.

486
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,416
Hey, it's that boat again.

487
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,385
No.

488
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,023
No, don't.
Oh my God.

489
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,958
No, don't.

490
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,611
No! No! Nancy!

491
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,443
- Oh no! No! No!
- Get out of the water!

492
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,006
No!

493
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,553
No!

494
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,850
- Get out! Go! Come on!
- Come on, get out of the water!

495
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,178
Guys, help!

496
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,384
Come on!

497
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,351
Help. Help.

498
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,414
Get out of the water!

499
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,566
- No no no! No!
- Come on!

500
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,157
Go go go!

501
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,798
- Hurry up!
- Help me!

502
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,602
Go go!

503
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,903
Oh my God!

504
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,000
They're coming!

505
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,442
- Run!
- I can't breathe.

506
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,174
Where's my inhaler?

507
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,580
Help!

508
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,176
Hey, wait. Wait for me.

509
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,156
- Go!
- Go! Run!

510
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,091
Run!

511
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,940
Where are we?

512
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,795
Shh shh shh! Quiet.

513
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,858
Shh. Quiet.
Quiet. Shh.

514
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:31,532
- Shh shh shh shh shh.
- Shh shh shh shh.

515
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,842
Go! Go!

516
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,341
Go.

517
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,706
- No, my shoe!
- Ashley!

518
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,146
Oh!

519
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,909
Go faster!

520
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,194
Ashley!

521
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:43,931
Ashley!

522
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,973
Go! Go!

523
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,740
Go!

524
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,073
Looking for this?

525
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,198
A little bump.

526
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,601
Here you go, blondie.

527
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,277
There you go.

528
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,755
There.

529
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,727
Let that stuff work for ya.

530
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,742
Feel better?

531
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,578
Good.

532
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,022
Good.

533
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,106
Why don't you, uh...

534
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,551
why don't you take off?

535
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,094
Yeah.

536
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,495
Take off!

537
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,032
Is there anyone in there?

538
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,467
Let's get on the boat
and get out of here.

539
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,564
I'm with you. Let's go.

540
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,610
- Wait.
- I'm not staying here.

541
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,407
They might still be watching.

542
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,710
Just please wait until dark.

543
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,216
Just wait until dark.

544
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,717
Please.

545
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,415
This is wrong.

546
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,693
Ashley and Holly are
still back there.

547
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,406
All right, shh.

548
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,265
Is anybody...?

549
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,543
Sorry.

550
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,106
Claire, come on.

551
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,445
Up.

552
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,917
Give me one.

553
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,935
Where are the keys?

554
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,414
Girls, there... there's no keys.
There's no keys.

555
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,319
Natalie, go...
go and do the anchor.

556
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,653
Natalie, anchor. Oh.

557
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,420
Justine, Remi,

558
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,259
go push us off with the poles.

559
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,765
Claire, hand signals.

560
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,629
Margot, Madison,

561
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,730
paddles in the aft.

562
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,975
Come on, go right!

563
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,481
Keep going right!
Okay, go straight now!

564
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,723
- Straight! Go straight!
- Wait! Wait!

565
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,787
- Dawn!
- Left! Go left!

566
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,129
Madison?

567
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,328
Go right!
Okay, go right, go right!

568
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,137
Madison!

569
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,075
Come back!

570
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,238
- Did you hear that?
- Where are you?!

571
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,409
Wait! Please!

572
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,850
Come back!

573
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,887
- It's Holly!
- Dawn!

574
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,150
I'm over here!

575
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,156
Come back!

576
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,219
- Holly!
- Madison!

577
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,023
Holly's back there!

578
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,020
Maddie.

579
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,828
- Holly.
- Please.

580
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,726
They killed Ashley.

581
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,560
- I saw it.
- Come on, we have to go.

582
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,071
Okay.

583
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,802
- Come on.
- Wait.

584
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,027
Okay.

585
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,194
Oh! They're coming!

586
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,627
Poles stop!

587
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,228
I need help!

588
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,843
Climb over!
You have to climb over!

589
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,185
- Leave it, Claire!
- I can get it!

590
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,958
Claire, leave it! Leave it!
Claire, don't!

591
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,658
Claire, please hold on!
Grab my hand!

592
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,162
Claire! No no!

593
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,673
Claire!

594
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,539
Claire! No!

595
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,230
Okay, listen.

596
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:03,635
Next...

597
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,867
next time the light goes out,

598
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,701
you guys head to the back
of the boat, slide off

599
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,111
and head towards the beach.

600
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,950
Everyone clear?

601
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,257
Now.

602
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,513
Go!

603
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,956
Are we...

604
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,824
are we... are we all here?

605
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,125
- Where's Holly?
- Here.

606
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,633
Margot, keep your light down!

607
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,265
You've gotta get up.
We have to go.

608
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,073
- No.
- Let's go, let's go.

609
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,205
- Let's go.
- I can't take anymore.

610
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,771
Let's go.

611
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,303
Oh my...

612
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:44,291
Hey.

613
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,333
Shh! Shh.

614
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,772
What happened?
What happened?

615
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,441
Shh shh shh shh shh.

616
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,143
I can't... I can't pull it.

617
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,878
I can't pull it.

618
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,410
Shh shh.

619
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,089
Shh.

620
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,124
Don't go.

621
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,818
Gotcha!

622
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,914
Shh shh.

623
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,488
Shh shh.

624
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,571
Oh!

625
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,239
No, look at me!

626
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:17,551
Look at me!

627
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,337
Come on,
they ain't going nowhere.

628
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,298
- Come on.
- Over here, over here, over here.

629
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,766
- Ow!
- Sorry.

630
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,700
- It's okay.
- Keep going.

631
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,864
Here.
Set her down here.

632
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,407
Right here.

633
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,819
Okay.

634
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,785
These damn boots.

635
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,995
I've got a blister.

636
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,142
I think she's in shock.

637
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,720
Okay. Okay. Ah!

638
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,724
Get off me!
Stop it!

639
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,191
Stop!

640
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,091
Stop it!

641
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,857
Okay. Okay.

642
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,491
Okay okay. Stop!

643
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,592
Stop stop.

644
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,566
I can't breathe in there.

645
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,542
I just needed to think.

646
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,507
I can't even look at her.

647
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,049
Yeah.

648
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,586
We should leave her
or we're not gonna make it.

649
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,660
I know it sounds bad,
but everybody's thinking it.

650
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,034
She's safe here.
We could come back, couldn't we?

651
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,235
We're not leaving her.

652
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,086
My dad tried to talk
to me the whole way here

653
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,855
and I just ignored him.

654
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,126
I wish I'd just talked to him.

655
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,834
Maddie.

656
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,006
Maddie.

657
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,446
Can you hear us?

658
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:36,013
Shh. Shh.

659
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,649
Listen.

660
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,160
Do you hear that?

661
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,598
This way.

662
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,603
Come on.

663
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,720
Over this way.

664
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,027
Holly, stop.

665
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,835
- They're coming!
- Go!

666
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,471
Go.

667
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,412
Wait wait wait!
Stop stop stop stop stop.

668
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,311
Okay, we gotta put her down.

669
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,042
Okay okay, right here.

670
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,708
- I got her foot.
- Okay.

671
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,222
Okay.
You okay, Maddie?

672
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,427
Is there a way down?

673
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,397
Remi, help me.
Remi, help me.

674
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,367
Gimme the rope.
Gimme the rope. Gimme the rope.

675
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,444
- Okay, let's do it.
- What are you talking about?

676
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,080
We have to go over this cliff
right here right now.

677
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,623
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know what's down there?

678
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,352
No, but I know what's up there!

679
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,791
We have no other choice.

680
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,254
Is the rope long enough?

681
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,901
If we can get down to the boat first,
I can get you guys all out of here!

682
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,938
Let's just go!
Let's stop waiting!

683
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,769
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Okay.

684
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,672
We're going down now, Holly!

685
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,837
- Now! Let's go!
- Okay!

686
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,150
How are we gonna
get Madison down?

687
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,888
I'll take her.

688
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,957
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'll take her.

689
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,531
Pull!

690
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,099
Go! Go! Go!

691
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,309
Hurry!

692
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,685
Stop! Don't... stop!

693
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,850
No!

694
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,848
Drive.

695
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:18,744
Holly!

696
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
No! No! Ah!

697
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,072
I can't find the keys!

698
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,193
Natalie!

699
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,427
No!

700
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:32,420
Shh. Shh!

701
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,019
Stop. Stop!

702
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,467
Shh. Shh.

703
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,696
Shh.

704
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,133
Come here.
Come here.

705
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,167
Shh! Shh!

706
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,339
- No no no.
- Shh.

707
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,611
Shh.

708
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,850
Shut up!
Shut up. Shut up.

709
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,789
Shh.

710
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,960
I'm not gonna hurt you.

711
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,330
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Please!

712
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,426
Please!

713
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:16,765
No.

714
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,337
- No!
- Shh.

715
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:23,468
You wanna do this?
You wanna do this?

716
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,012
No!

717
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,914
Don't. Pl...

718
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,356
Get down there.
Get down there.

719
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,487
Easy. Easy!

720
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,862
- Easy.
- Don't touch me!

721
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,458
- Easy. Easy.
- Please. No no no.

722
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:49,730
- No no!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

723
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:52,364
I'm not going
to hurt you.

724
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,237
Shh.

725
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,878
Please!

726
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:08,579
Go in here. Don't step
on your little friend there.

727
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,358
Shh! Shh!

728
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,295
Stop!
Stop! Relax.

729
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,491
Relax. Relax.

730
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,397
Relax.

731
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,333
I'm your friend.

732
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:23,632
Look.

733
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,536
No no no no.

734
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,574
No.

735
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,778
My boat.

736
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,092
No!

737
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,112
What's up, fatty?

738
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,136
It takes you back, huh?
