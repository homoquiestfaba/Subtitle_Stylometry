1
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:05,094
Jerry has... excuse the
expression... clam fritters!

2
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:10,832
l'm not eating them alone! Come on.

3
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,474
Lorenzo.

4
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:23,209
Here, kitty.

5
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,087
Yeah! There you go!

6
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:37,321
They got to be the worst
clam fritters l ever ate.

7
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,160
ls that so?

8
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:40,927
Even Lorenzo thinks so.

9
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:45,700
Ain't no worse than that
goose you cooked last week.

10
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:49,674
Even my stomach still gets
upset just thinking about it.

11
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,644
Well, l promised John Bartlett

12
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:58,207
l'd take his cranberry
barrels up to him, so...

13
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:03,416
you two can match coins to see
who's going to wash the dishes.

14
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,424
l won't do them.

15
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,950
Blessed if l'd do the darn things if
Teddy Roosevelt himself asked me to.

16
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,059
Where's my hat?

17
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:13,963
l can't find anything in this mess.

18
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:19,062
l suppose you fellers think l'm
going to do them all the time.

19
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,508
Well, if you think that,
you're mistook. l ain't!

20
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:26,569
Aw, this... this just don't work.

21
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:27,908
lt don't work.

22
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,414
What don't work?

23
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,006
This plan of ours.

24
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,578
l thought not going to sea,
settling down with you sailors,

25
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,249
living on the cheap was
going to be the ticket.

26
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,293
lt was going to be fine. But it ain't.

27
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,296
l mean, l don't mind
doing my share of the work.

28
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,594
You know, swabbing the deck, and...

29
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:51,228
But, l mean, that's not
the way it worked out.

30
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:55,240
l'm doing the work! l'm
just so sick of this!

31
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:58,641
l'm sick of living in a pigpen!

32
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:10,283
Well, now, l'll tell you what.

33
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,190
This craft...

34
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,329
needs a steward.

35
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,901
A steward.

36
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,437
Or a woman!

37
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,069
A woman?

38
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,702
Yeah.

39
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,872
l'm not kidding. A woman.

40
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,917
We could use a housekeeper.

41
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:41,044
Nobody's talking about a housekeeper.

42
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,713
l'm talking about a woman.

43
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,189
This house needs a woman!

44
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:46,953
lt's simple.

45
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,858
One of us has to get married.

46
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,328
- Married?
- Married.

47
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,199
And take the other two as
boarders into his house.

48
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,362
Look, when a shipwrecked
crew is starving,

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,137
one of them has to be sacrificed
for the good of the rest.

50
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,172
One of us has to get married
for the good of the other two.

51
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,186
Well, that's pretty good, Perez.

52
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,279
So...

53
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,091
you going to be the first offering?

54
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,755
lf it's my luck, yes.

55
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,767
But l had this idea

56
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:32,566
maybe we'd match for it
like we do for the dishes.

57
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,164
Well, l don't know.

58
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,868
l'll tell you what.

59
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,377
Why don't you just marry...

60
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,573
Melissy Busteed.

61
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,083
She's awful sweet on you.

62
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,586
No, you don't. She is the town gossip.

63
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:53,421
She's already buried two husbands,

64
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,825
and l ain't looking to be the third.

65
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,099
Where you going to find this wife?

66
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:05,627
Well, sir, l'm about to show you.

67
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:43,537
The <i>Nuptial Chime,</i>

68
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,102
a journal of matrimony.

69
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,384
Chock-full of advertisements

70
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:56,548
from women who wants husbands.

71
00:07:57,723 --> 00:08:03,329
Well, seems to be a strong running

72
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:07,054
for "vivacious brunettes,"

73
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:11,661
and over here, "blondes of tender

74
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:15,834
and romantic dispositions."

75
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,503
So, Mr. Perez,

76
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:22,776
which one of these types
are you suffering for?

77
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,841
Why don't you hush up?

78
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,946
You really think that l
would write anyone in there?

79
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,721
What we have to do

80
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:37,422
is make our own advertisement.

81
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:40,591
Say exactly what kind of woman we want

82
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,659
and then sit back and
wait for the answers.

83
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,431
Simple.

84
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:48,099
What do you think about this, Jerry?

85
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:52,372
Well, seems like a good idea.

86
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,343
We got to do something,

87
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,510
and that's the only sensible thing.

88
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,077
So you have to do it.

89
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,588
Yes, you do.

90
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,648
We agreed to stick together.

91
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,321
Two-to-one's a vote.
So you got to do it.

92
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:13,298
We'll match for it.

93
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,771
Come on, Zeb.

94
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,898
Ain't going to mutiny, are you?

95
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,465
All right.

96
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,843
l'll stick with the ship.

97
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,361
Heads.

98
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,137
Heads.

99
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:02,906
Tails.

100
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:06,110
Well, there it is.

101
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:11,720
Well...

102
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,187
don't feel bad...

103
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:17,752
Jerry.

104
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,558
There it is.

105
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,333
lt's Providence.

106
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:32,467
Me and Perez are bachelors.

107
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,878
We'd just be green hand.

108
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,282
You're an able seaman.

109
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,217
You already know

110
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:45,451
what it is to manage a wife.

111
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,857
Dang it to hell.

112
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,459
l know what it is

113
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,432
to be managed by a wife.

114
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
Hey! Here's Captain Zeb.

115
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,209
Well, Cap'n, how's she heading?

116
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,545
Well, l'd say pretty
much northeast by north.

117
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:16,145
Running fair, but watch
out for some wind ahead.

118
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,623
- l calculate you ain't heard the news, Zeb.
- Yeah?

119
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,752
Web Saunders has got his
original package license.

120
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,456
Come on the noon mail.

121
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,464
- ls that a fact?
- l seen it myself.

122
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,193
Web was showing it around.

123
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,895
We was wondering what kind of
fit John Bartlett would have now.

124
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,562
He's been pretty nigh distracted

125
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,970
ever since Web started
his billiard room,

126
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,566
calling it a haunt, a sin,
and a whole lot more names.

127
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,577
And when he hears that
Web's going to sell rum,

128
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,977
why, that's going to
set him off real good.

129
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,653
- Morning.
- Morning, Zeb.

130
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,066
Excuse me!

131
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,129
Whoa, Daniel.

132
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,238
l'm afraid l'm mixed in my directions.

133
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,043
A gentleman at the train depot told
me the way to the cable station.

134
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,948
But l've forgotten
whether l turn to the left

135
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,077
once l reached here or to the right.

136
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,056
How was you calculating to get there?

137
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,285
l intended to walk.

138
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,128
Did you tell those fellas at the depot
that you were going to try to walk?

139
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,136
- Certainly.
- One thing they forgot to tell you is...

140
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:40,297
the station's out on the outer beach.

141
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,534
There's about a half a
mile of pretty wet water

142
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,473
between here and there.

143
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,774
- You don't mean it.
- l do.

144
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:50,247
Unless, of course, there's
been an almighty drought

145
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,513
since l was at the house.

146
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:54,951
l tell you what.

147
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,718
l'll give you a ride down to the shore

148
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,726
and find somebody to row you over.

149
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,820
Here. Give me your flipper.

150
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:07,457
There you go.

151
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,160
Thank you.

152
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,430
Come on, Daniel.

153
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,438
My name is Hedge.

154
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,973
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hedge.

155
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,406
My name's Hazeltine.

156
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:21,004
Yeah. You're the new engineer
for the cable station.

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,878
All educated, l hear.

158
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,147
Whole town's been expecting you.

159
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,812
ls that right?

160
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,480
Who told you?

161
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:33,320
Well, l can't say for sure,

162
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,793
but Melissy Busteed got
a hold of the information,

163
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,730
and from there on, it's plain sailing.

164
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,565
You see, Chatham's not big
enough to have its own newspaper.

165
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,399
Come on, boy.

166
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,496
So...

167
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,438
the Almighty gave us Melissy, l guess,

168
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,536
as a sort of a substitute.

169
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,012
You play pool, Mr. Hazeltine?

170
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,019
Sure. Sometimes.

171
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,783
Yeah. Come on, Daniel.

172
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,653
Good boy.

173
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,587
John.

174
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,566
This is Mr. Hazeltine.

175
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,604
He's the new man at the cable station.

176
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,004
Mr. Hazeltine, this is
my friend John Bartlett.

177
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,770
- Captain John Bartlett.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

178
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,176
So l brought those barrels up for you.

179
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,873
Thanks, Zeb.

180
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:32,907
l'll probably be up sometime tomorrow.

181
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,010
l want to talk to you about that...

182
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,714
billiard room business.

183
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,121
God Almighty's got his eye on that place

184
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,023
and on them that's running it.

185
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,960
Well, then, it's in good hands,

186
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,658
and we won't have to worry, do we?

187
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:03,406
Boy, am l glad to see you.

188
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,485
First of all,

189
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,521
how do you spell "conscientious"?

190
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,684
l don't.

191
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:16,091
What would you want to spell it for?

192
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:19,393
We've writ about 400
of these advertisements,

193
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,763
and ain't one of them fit to feed a pig.

194
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,136
Perez has got such fancy notions

195
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,866
that only a circus bill
would make him feel happy.

196
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,408
l don't see why we can't have
something plain and simple

197
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,138
like, "Woman needed to wash dishes

198
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,680
and clean house for three men."

199
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,238
Why wouldn't that be all right?

200
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,284
That's really going to get you

201
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:42,344
an answer from a woman
in a hurry, isn't it?

202
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,087
"Woman to wash dishes for three men"?

203
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,961
You think that that's a
bait to get you a wife?

204
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,263
Come on! You got to do better than that.

205
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,771
You got to be... l don't
know... soft-soap them,

206
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,569
a little more high-toned, sir.

207
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:06,100
You got to make them
think that you're a catch!

208
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,975
l am a great catch,

209
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,742
like you're talking about.

210
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,749
Pass me that pen.

211
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,239
Wife wanted

212
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:40,303
by ex-seafaring man...

213
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,872
of...

214
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,550
steady habits.

215
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,921
Willing to work

216
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:57,019
and keep house

217
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,462
shipshape...

218
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,230
and aboveboard.

219
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:08,330
No sea lawyers

220
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,240
need apply.

221
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,475
Address...

222
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,915
- "Skipper."
- Good.

223
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:24,922
l liked that bit about sea lawyers.

224
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,788
lt'll keep the loose-tongued ones away.

225
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,657
Well, Jerry.

226
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:35,799
Now all you have to do is
pick yourself out a wife

227
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,929
and tell us what you want
for a wedding present.

228
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,700
A divorce.

229
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,456
Mighty sharp buggy, Web.

230
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,083
Good day to you, gentlemen.

231
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,786
Nice weather.

232
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,262
Good for picking them
cranberries, l hear.

233
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,856
Slick. Slick.

234
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:10,265
Now that he got that
rum-selling license,

235
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,304
he'll be purring just like a cat.

236
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,861
l'm all right with cats,

237
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:17,705
but there's something about a cat man.

238
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:40,153
- How do you do, Captain?
- Mrs. Small.

239
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,666
What a surprise to see you here.

240
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,533
l swear if you ain't been a stranger.

241
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:52,304
Ezekial, get up and give
Captain Hedge your chair.

242
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,538
No, no.

243
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,706
Don't go to all that
trouble, Mrs. Small.

244
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:00,445
l'll just sit over there on
the sofa with Captain Bartlett.

245
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:06,719
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Zeb.

246
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,090
l didn't expect to see you here.

247
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,561
l'm glad, though.

248
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,690
Every God-fearing man in this town

249
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,258
has need to be on his knees this day.

250
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,270
Have you heard about it?

251
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,738
Captain John is talking
about that rum-selling license

252
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,206
Web Saunders has got.

253
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,708
Ain't it awful?

254
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,770
How you doing, Melissy?

255
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,781
Yes, of course. Hello, Captain.

256
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,248
And how is Captain Perez?

257
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,376
He's just dandy.

258
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,478
He always has a kind word for you.

259
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,184
Anyway, l says to Prissy Rend

260
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:42,318
"There is going to be
a judgment on this town,

261
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:44,624
sure as you're a living woman," says l.

262
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,598
And she says, "You are right,
Melissy." And then l says...

263
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,232
We are blessed this day

264
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:56,400
to have with us the Reverend Perley

265
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,103
to lead us in the meeting.

266
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,440
Amen!

267
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,276
Brothers and sisters,

268
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:04,543
here we are, a-kneeling
at the altar's foot.

269
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,608
And what's going on outside?

270
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:10,849
Why, the devil's got his
clutches in our midst.

271
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,289
The horn of the wicked is exalted.

272
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,419
They're selling rum... rum in this town!

273
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:20,022
The people of Chatham have been
slow-footed in the Lord's vineyard.

274
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,090
l tell you, brothers and sisters,

275
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,635
God has given us a task to perform.

276
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,432
And what have we done with it?

277
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,370
We sat still

278
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,465
and let the devil have his way.

279
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,842
And now the grip of Satan
is tighter on the town

280
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,744
than it ever was before.

281
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:39,580
Do you think that that
hellhole down yonder

282
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:43,383
is going to shut up because
we talk about it at meeting?

283
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:47,687
You think Web Saunders is
going to quit selling rum

284
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,092
because we say he ought to?

285
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:53,893
Do you think God is going
to walk up to that door

286
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,264
and nail it up himself?

287
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:57,768
No, sir!

288
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,531
He don't work that way!

289
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:03,336
We've talked and talked,
and now it's time to do!

290
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,106
Ain't there anybody
here that feels a call?

291
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,549
Ain't there axes to chop
with and fire to burn?

292
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:16,281
l tell you, brothers,
we've waited long enough.

293
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:19,085
And l, old as l am,

294
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,058
am ready.

295
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,959
Lord, here l am.

296
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,018
Here l...

297
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,228
Play, sister.

298
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,236
...from temptation

299
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:41,507
And show to us a sign

300
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,640
That to every small...

301
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,680
Okay, here we go.

302
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,245
Zeb,

303
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,154
do you believe

304
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,591
that man's law

305
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,993
ought to be allowed to
interfere with God's law?

306
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,760
Well, in most cases,

307
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,767
it's been my judgment that it pays

308
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:05,065
to steer close to both of them.

309
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,867
Suppose God called you

310
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,070
to break man's law and keep his.

311
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,078
What would you do?

312
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,909
Well, l guess

313
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:18,779
the first thing would be to make sure

314
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:23,117
that it really was the
Almighty that was calling.

315
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,287
Let me help you aboard, Captain.

316
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,149
Maybe there just ain't
no interest in having

317
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:01,021
a seafaring man of steady habits.

318
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:07,158
Jerry, it's just
exactly like l told you.

319
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,723
27 letters in all.

320
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,566
Here's my favorite.

321
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,035
Well...

322
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,301
Nifty writing.

323
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:39,924
"Mr. Skipper, sir,

324
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:43,024
"l saw your advertisement in the paper

325
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:47,903
"and think perhaps you might suit me.

326
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,568
"Please answer these
questions by return mail:

327
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,974
"What is your religious belief?

328
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,475
"Do you drink liquor?

329
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:04,055
"Are you a profane man?

330
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,784
"lf you want to,

331
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:08,554
"you might send me your real name

332
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,959
and a photograph."

333
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,691
Photograph? The only one
l got is a cracked one

334
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,631
from my first marriage.

335
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,362
lt's turning yellow.

336
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:19,734
Will you please let the man finish?

337
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,069
Thank you, Perez.

338
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:25,338
"lf l think you will suit,

339
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,345
maybe we can sign articles."

340
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,443
"Yours truly, Martha B. Snow,

341
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,716
Nantucket, Massachusetts."

342
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:47,859
She sure don't mince words, do she?

343
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,629
You know what l like about it most?

344
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,693
The shipshape way she puts it.

345
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:59,608
You know what l like is that
part about signing articles,

346
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,771
like she was signing on to a voyage.

347
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,372
Seems to be exactly
what we're looking for.

348
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:07,247
Well, l don't know. What's the hurry?

349
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,911
l mean, next batch of letters

350
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,012
are liable to have
one that's much better.

351
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,785
ln the meantime, this
house keeps looking

352
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,384
like the fo'c'sle on a cattle boat.

353
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,725
You know, Jerry,

354
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:21,960
l don't really see how
you could do much better.

355
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,264
Go ahead, you know. Do what you like.

356
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:28,432
l'm only a devilish fool that's got
to take in boarders and get married.

357
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,270
That's all the hell l am.

358
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,276
Excuse me.

359
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,777
Be careful.

360
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:36,178
Right there it says,

361
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:39,479
"Are you profane?"

362
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,611
You fellas are enough
to make a preacher cuss.

363
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,588
Well, go ahead and write her,

364
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,625
but l'm giving you fair warning.

365
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:51,527
l ain't going to have
her if she don't suit.

366
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,827
l ain't going to marry a skeleton

367
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:56,265
and crawl into bed with a bag of bones.

368
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,507
We did not open it.

369
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:39,510
We felt all hands should be on deck

370
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:41,808
before we did anything that important.

371
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:49,312
Hurry up and open it
before he messes his pants.

372
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,719
Oh, please!

373
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:06,502
Thanks, Perez.

374
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,537
"Captain Jeremiah Burgess.

375
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,136
"Sir,

376
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,080
"l like your looks well enough,

377
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,382
"though it don't pay to put
too much dependence on looks,

378
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:25,218
"as nobody knows better than me.

379
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:28,954
"Besides, l judge that picture you sent

380
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:32,019
"was took quite a spell ago.

381
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:35,260
"Anyway, you look honest,

382
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,929
"and l am willing to risk money enough

383
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,734
"to carry me to Chatham and back,

384
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:44,002
"though the dear land knows

385
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,567
"l ain't got none to throw away.

386
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,739
"lf we don't agree to sign articles,

387
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,283
"l suppose likely you will be willing

388
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,512
"to stand half the fare.

389
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:59,046
"That ain't any more than
right, the way l look at it.

390
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:03,788
"l shall come to Chatham
on the noon train Thursday.

391
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:06,558
"Meet me at the depot.

392
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,724
Yours truly, Martha B. Snow."

393
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,098
And there's a postscript.

394
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,535
"l should've liked it better

395
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,835
"if you was a Methodist,

396
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,740
"but we can't have everything

397
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,143
just as we want it in this world."

398
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:27,443
She sure don't waste no time, does she?

399
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,148
She's pretty prompt, l'll
sure say that for her.

400
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:34,454
ls that all you've got to say
after getting me in this scrape?

401
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,858
Don't go on your beam-ends, Jerry.

402
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:40,125
- There ain't no harm done yet.
- Ain't no harm done?

403
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,358
l don't know nothing about her.

404
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,561
She might be 100 years
old, for all l know.

405
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:47,400
And she's coming down
here on the forenoon

406
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:52,341
to marry me by main force,

407
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:55,938
and you expect me to marry a Methodist?

408
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,073
- Now, hold on!
- l'm a pilgrim!

409
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,118
Hold on!

410
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,643
Jerry, l like the way

411
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,020
the woman's got it put together.

412
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,025
She's got sense.

413
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:11,722
You can't just sell her a cat in a bag.

414
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,658
A cat in a bag?

415
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,470
Well, l don't know
what you mean by that.

416
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,168
You had me doing all
this at a flip of a coin,

417
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,938
and then l'm going to
have to pay her fare, too?

418
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,604
lf she comes down here

419
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,945
and signs articles,
like she says in here,

420
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:36,044
we all are going to be paying
a lot more than just fares.

421
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,214
And l agree with him.

422
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,986
This woman has a lot of sense.

423
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,027
And you, sir,

424
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:45,563
will be going to the depot

425
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,190
as well as he and l.

426
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,235
The three of us will go to the depot.

427
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:53,965
Why don't you go down
there and you meet her,

428
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,200
and you bring her here?

429
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,139
- l'll wait for her here.
- No, Jerry.

430
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,236
Got to treat her decent.

431
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,611
You are going to the depot.

432
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:18,693
Here they come.

433
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,687
Godfrey domino!

434
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,925
Heave to! Heave to!

435
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,831
There's no danger.

436
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,871
What do you mean no danger?
She knows where we live!

437
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,997
We're going to scoot back to the shanty,

438
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:06,237
and we'll stay there until
she gets tired and goes home.

439
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,028
That's it.

440
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,430
Yeah. Go on. Laugh.

441
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,232
You set there tee-heeing
like a Bedlamite.

442
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:34,897
That's what l'd expect of you.

443
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,409
Oh, my body and soul.

444
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:49,952
There she comes now.

445
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:53,987
She's heading up the hill!

446
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,222
- Did you lock the dining room, Perez?
- Why should l lock it?

447
00:31:57,295 --> 00:32:00,287
She'll go in there and
sit and wait for us!

448
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:09,273
Well, now,

449
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,605
one of us has got to go up there

450
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,167
and tell her she don't suit

451
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:16,180
and pay her fare back home.

452
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:19,479
And l think Jerry ought
to be the one, since...

453
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,951
since he's the bridegroom.

454
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,149
Me?

455
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:28,988
You fellas got me in this scrape.

456
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,652
Now let's see you get me out of it.

457
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:35,428
l ain't going to move a
step unless it's out to sea.

458
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:42,062
lt's a man.

459
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,468
He's been up to the house.

460
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,471
Hey.

461
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,447
Over here!

462
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:53,507
Over here, on your lee bow!

463
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:56,645
Mr. Hazeltine, just...

464
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,848
just go on around to the back.

465
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,193
- Here.
- Captain.

466
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:18,203
Mr. Hazeltine, l'd like you to make

467
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:20,767
the acquaintance of Captain Jerry here

468
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,437
- and Captain Perez.
- Hello.

469
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:24,607
- Pleased to meet you both.
- My shipmates.

470
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,249
We're...sort of up to here.

471
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:32,154
We're waiting to get our bearings.

472
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,487
We're...

473
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,584
We're not out of our heads.

474
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,755
l'm saying that because l
know that's what it looks like.

475
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,423
Well, l'm glad to hear it.

476
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,263
What we want to know is...

477
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:49,296
have you been up to our house,
and was there anybody there?

478
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:52,673
Yes, l've been there. The housekeeper.

479
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:55,406
That is, l suppose
it was the housekeeper

480
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,846
that opened the door
and said you were out

481
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:01,579
and l should wait or come back.

482
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:04,053
l told you.

483
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:06,352
l knew it. Didn't l tell you? Yeah.

484
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:09,291
Just hush up for one minute, Jerry.

485
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:14,697
Now, this woman that you say
you thought was a housekeeper,

486
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:17,667
what was she doing?

487
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,499
She seemed very much at home.

488
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,471
That's why l thought
she was the housekeeper.

489
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,236
There you go. l mean, she's
going to stay there maybe forever.

490
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,210
l mean, she's got...

491
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,213
she's got too good a
thing going for her.

492
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:33,546
- That's... Come on.
- Too big a thing going...

493
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,313
Hush!

494
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:39,721
The thing is we're in kind
of a ridiculous scrape here,

495
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:43,056
one that we got to get out of alone.

496
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,494
l'll...

497
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:48,123
l'll tell you about it sometime,

498
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,064
but not now.

499
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:51,727
Well, l'll leave you to it, then.

500
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:54,294
Yeah.

501
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,169
Good day to you all.

502
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,448
All right. Now that's it.

503
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,711
No more stalling!

504
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,413
We got to go up there and see her.

505
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,853
And that's all! Now come on.

506
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:14,653
No! l'm telling you

507
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,786
that all this running
around, this hiding...

508
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,796
it just sickened me
on this whole subject.

509
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:23,527
And l'm just not... l'm not about
to do nothing, have nothing to do.

510
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:26,729
l ain't going up there. lf there's
any kind of talk of marriage

511
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,172
or any other female up there.

512
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,074
All right. l'll go.

513
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,736
Good.

514
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:38,180
And l'll tell her you're bashful

515
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,980
and you're dying to get married.

516
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:45,022
No! You ain't going to do that!

517
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,854
He ain't going to do that, is he?

518
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:52,056
l don't know. But, uh, maybe you
shouldn't have been so pig-headed.

519
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:04,939
You're not Captain Burgess.

520
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:10,239
No, ma'am.

521
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,647
My name is Hedge.

522
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:18,546
You're not Miss Snow?

523
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,386
Mrs. Snow.

524
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,120
l'm a widow.

525
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:26,686
l feel as if l know you, Captain Hedge.

526
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:29,426
The boy in the depot
wagon told me all about you

527
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:31,298
and Captain Ryder and Captain Burgess.

528
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,635
Well, hey, l hope he
gave us a clean bill.

529
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:39,108
Well, he didn't say nothing against
you, if that's what you mean.

530
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,168
lf he had, l don't think it
would've made much difference.

531
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:44,215
l've lived long enough to want
to find things out for myself,

532
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:46,477
not take folks' say-so.

533
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:49,816
l judge you got my letter
and was expecting me.

534
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,520
Now, if it ain't too much trouble,

535
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,259
l'd like to know where
Captain Burgess is

536
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,530
and why he wasn't at
the depot to meet me.

537
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:09,437
Well, the truth is, ma'am...

538
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,532
we was at the depot.

539
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,236
You was?

540
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,008
Thing is

541
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,106
we thought you was somebody else.

542
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:22,577
No.

543
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:28,123
We thought somebody else was you,

544
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,355
and, though, l'm sure she's a fine lady,

545
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,192
she was...

546
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,258
Well, there. lf that don't beat all.

547
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:40,463
l don't blame Captain
Burgess a mite, poor thing.

548
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:43,632
l guess l'd have run, too,
if l'd seen that woman.

549
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,506
l mean, she was sitting in
the seat next to me, and...

550
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,944
Well, she had a shut-over
bag considerable like mine,

551
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:53,040
and when she got up to get
out, she took mine by mistake.

552
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,812
Oh, dear, dear. Where
is Captain Burgess?

553
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:00,653
He's in a fish shack down the road,

554
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:03,717
and as upset as he is,

555
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:07,424
l'm not sure when he's
ever going to break cover.

556
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:13,895
Rock of ages

557
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,770
Cleft for me

558
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,776
Let me hide

559
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:21,971
Myself in thee

560
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,579
Well, Captain Hedge,
there are one or two things

561
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:28,585
that l need to say right here.

562
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,951
ln the first place, l ain't in the habit

563
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:34,321
of answering advertisements from
folks that wants to get married.

564
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:38,328
l ain't so hard up for a
man as all that comes to.

565
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,387
And the next thing, l didn't come here

566
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,831
with my mind made up to
marry Captain Burgess,

567
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,765
not by no means.

568
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:51,635
l'll tell you what. l...

569
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,835
l'll go down to the shack,

570
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,140
and l'll get Captain Burgess, and...

571
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,271
No, you shan't, either.

572
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:58,281
l'll tell you what we'll do.

573
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:00,283
lt's nearly supper already,

574
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,512
and l need to be getting to the tavern.

575
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:06,523
l suppose if it's not too much
trouble, you could walk me there.

576
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:07,922
And l'll stay there tonight,

577
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:10,119
and tomorrow, l'll come down here,

578
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:14,221
and we'll all have a commonsense talk.

579
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,497
That is the most sensible
thing l have heard today.

580
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,308
Come on! Keep that
water moving, will you?

581
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:35,380
Big fire in the village!

582
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,751
All hands on deck! Hey!

583
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:41,280
Come on, you! Keep
that water going there!

584
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,384
And don't break the bottles!

585
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,966
- Keep it going!
- Get those bottles out of there!

586
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,628
Keep that water moving, will you?

587
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,104
How'd it start, Web?

588
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,663
- How'd it start?
- Yeah.

589
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,642
l know mighty well how it started.

590
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,680
But what l'm going to find
out before this night is over

591
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,978
is who started it, and
they're going to pay!

592
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,986
You hear me? Come on, you!
Keep that water going there!

593
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:13,023
- Come on!
- Get the water on there!

594
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:53,721
"He burnt all their
houses wherein they dwell

595
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:56,858
and all their goodly
castles with fire."

596
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,799
Oh, no. That's not good.

597
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:12,048
lt's all right, John.

598
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,259
Kerosene.

599
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:34,664
l'm going to get you out of this.

600
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:39,140
Well, don't worry, shipmate.

601
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,905
l'll fix it up.

602
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,411
Make sure they'll think

603
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,540
you were running to
help put out the fire.

604
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:48,642
Yeah. They'll never know you set it.

605
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,846
Okay.

606
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,095
All right. Here.

607
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:09,066
Oh, yeah.

608
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:28,657
We have a man upstairs in our house

609
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:32,025
who may live and who may not live.

610
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,257
lf he lives,

611
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:37,233
he's going to be sick in
our house for a long time.

612
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:40,236
What do we do?

613
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:43,762
Who's going to take care of him?

614
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,900
You got to get married now.

615
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:48,946
To the fat lady?

616
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,878
Well,

617
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:56,214
she'd be shade in the summer,

618
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,914
warm in the winter.

619
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,822
We wouldn't have the money to feed her.

620
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,363
Well, you think he'll live?

621
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:17,341
l can't say.

622
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,577
He's had a stroke of paralysis,

623
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:24,411
and there seem to be other
complications as well.

624
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,980
lf he regains consciousness,
l shall think he has a chance.

625
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:32,284
Not a very good one.

626
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:35,553
l don't think he'll die tonight.

627
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,560
But if he lives, he's
going to need a good nurse,

628
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:40,062
and l don't know of one in town.

629
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:41,564
Neither do we.

630
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,531
Watch that top step now.

631
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,595
Yeah.

632
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:51,335
There you are.

633
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,844
Dr. Palmer,

634
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:59,906
l would like you to meet Mrs. Snow.

635
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:02,418
- Mrs. Snow, this is Dr. Palmer.
- Pleased to meet you.

636
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:04,317
Captain Perez,

637
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:08,188
- this is Mrs. Marthy B. Snow...
- Ma'am.

638
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,250
...of Nantucket.

639
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:13,092
Pleasure is mine. All mine.

640
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:17,931
Mrs. Snow is sort of a relative,

641
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,129
so to speak, of Captain Jerry.

642
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,071
And...

643
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,871
it turns out she has had
considerable nursing skills,

644
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:30,345
and she said she is
willing to take care of John

645
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,348
until he feels better.

646
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,850
Well, that's... that's wonderful.

647
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:36,853
That's wonderful.

648
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:00,510
Captain Bartlett's upstairs?

649
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,375
Shall l go right up?

650
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:04,414
Oh, yes, ma'am.

651
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:07,542
You have nursed before, l
believe the captain said?

652
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:10,018
Yes. Five years with my husband.

653
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,554
He had slow consumption.

654
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:13,749
And before that, with my mother

655
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:16,691
and my brother and sisters
at one time or another.

656
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:20,595
l've known considerable
sickness my whole life.

657
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:24,566
More of that than
anything else, l guess.

658
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,432
Now, if you'll go up with me

659
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,404
so as to tell me about
the medicine and so on.

660
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,963
Oh, yes, ma'am. This way.

661
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,100
Excuse me, Captain.

662
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,046
She has lost quite a bit of tonnage.

663
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,053
She's also...

664
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,112
l don't know...

665
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,750
prettied up a bit, wouldn't you say?

666
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:53,422
You, uh, haven't told
me something, have you?

667
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:56,022
Jerry, it's safe now.

668
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,432
You can come on out and show yourself.

669
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,232
Wait a minute. Didn't l tell you fellas

670
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:05,969
that there was a slight case
of misidentity at the station?

671
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:08,068
lt had something to do
with a couple of valises.

672
00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:10,045
- l told you that.
- Told us nothing.

673
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:11,411
No, l did. Told us nothing.

674
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:13,074
- Really?
- No.

675
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,618
- l must be getting old.
- She'll do.

676
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:20,313
lf all your relatives are
like that, Captain Burgess,

677
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,415
well, l'd like to know them.

678
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:23,926
Anyway, he seems a
little bit better now.

679
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,394
There should be no change for a while.

680
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:29,797
lf there is, send for me, all right?

681
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,301
l'll call in the morning.

682
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:39,035
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Good night, Captains. Good night.

683
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,543
Good night, Captain Burgess.

684
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:42,408
Thank you, Doc.

685
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:47,311
Well, Jerry,

686
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,477
don't you think it's
about time you went up

687
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:52,386
and introduced yourself
to your future wife?

688
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,651
She's busy up there.

689
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:56,885
l'm so tuckered out,

690
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:59,259
if l have a little nap,

691
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,855
l'll make a better presentation...

692
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:03,297
is what l'm thinking.

693
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,597
Naps are out.

694
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,103
You go upstairs now.

695
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:11,073
- Come on.
- lt's time. lt's time.

696
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:15,510
Oh, no. Come on, Jerry.

697
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,074
Mrs. Snow,

698
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:26,590
l think you'd better sleep in
my bedroom, long as you're here.

699
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:30,559
l'll just bunk downstairs
along with my shipmates.

700
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:31,890
All right.

701
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:35,022
Perhaps you should introduce
me to Captain Burgess.

702
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,260
l don't think we've ever
met, if we are relations.

703
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:41,532
Oh, why, of course. Excuse me, ma'am.

704
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:44,506
Jerry, this is Mrs. Snow.

705
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,167
l don't know what's gotten into me.

706
00:47:46,243 --> 00:47:49,110
- You're sure pert, ma'am.
- Thank you.

707
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:52,907
Well, he seems to be doing better,

708
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,678
so l think you all should go to bed,

709
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:56,481
and we can talk tomorrow...

710
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:58,647
l mean, today.

711
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:01,623
l forgot it's next door
to daylight already.

712
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,455
Good night.

713
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,529
Jerry's correct, ma'am.

714
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,466
You sure are pretty.

715
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:14,964
Thank you.

716
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,994
Mrs. Snow.

717
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:19,899
What's the matter?

718
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:23,270
Nothing worth gabbing about.

719
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,742
You just look awful upset.

720
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:30,609
You look awfully down.

721
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:33,707
Do you want to tell
me what the matter is?

722
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:37,115
l'm fine, really.

723
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:39,781
Well, if there's ever anything l can do,

724
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,518
do you promise that you'll tell me?

725
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,362
You're a sweet man.

726
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:58,170
Captain Perez.

727
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:00,836
lt's...

728
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:04,711
Mrs. Snow here is feeling awfully blue.

729
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:07,250
l just...

730
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:09,548
l got an idea.

731
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,020
This weekend, in order to cheer her up,

732
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:14,853
we ought to have some kind of an outing.

733
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:19,453
Go down and see Luther and the boys.

734
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,226
A picnic! We'll make it a picnic.

735
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,229
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

736
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:29,104
What's got into Jerry?

737
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:33,132
He have an epiphany or something?

738
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,735
Captain Burgess?

739
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:38,179
He didn't tidy up and fix the
table, if that's what you mean.

740
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:39,408
Captain Bartlett was...

741
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:41,781
seemed to be sleeping
or in a stupor-like,

742
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,184
and the doctor, when he
come, said that l could

743
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,245
leave him for a few
minutes and run downstairs.

744
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,223
A doctor?

745
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,192
He's been here already this morning?

746
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,524
Oh, yes. He came an hour ago.

747
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:55,292
Now, if you wouldn't mind going up
and staying with Captain Bartlett

748
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:57,163
while l finish getting breakfast,

749
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:59,168
and if you wouldn't mind
going out to the barn

750
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:02,205
and gathering a few eggs,
that would be a help.

751
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:04,968
l've been up and down the stairs
so many times in the last half hour,

752
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:08,273
l don't know l'm certain whether
l'm on my head or my heels.

753
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,280
She hugged me.

754
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,624
John, if you can hear me,

755
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,192
l done what l can,

756
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,467
but l can't for the love of Pete

757
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,270
find that darn coat.

758
00:51:39,343 --> 00:51:41,903
l just hope it's just
some kid that found it

759
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:46,416
and don't put it together with you.

760
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:53,423
Zeb, ain't this gay?

761
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,222
Eggs boiled to a T.

762
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,887
Not like the ones Jerry made.

763
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:00,759
Why, you boil them so hard,

764
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,095
if you threw them, you'd dent the barn.

765
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:06,765
- She's good.
- Yes.

766
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:09,568
How's he doing up there... John?

767
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,267
About the same.

768
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,969
Listen we got to talk a little

769
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:18,242
about the arrangements
for this marriage question.

770
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:20,909
lf Jerry here wasn't so pig-headed,

771
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:22,576
he'd marry her right away.

772
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:24,484
Because the way l see it,

773
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:27,922
there's going to be a long line of
suitors as soon as word gets out,

774
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:32,087
and l am going to be one of them.

775
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:36,830
Captain Perez, keep
your eye on the business.

776
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,198
Well, you fellas forget

777
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:40,861
l've been married twice before,

778
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:42,838
and those women were very handsome,

779
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:46,364
but the marriages
weren't always so pretty.

780
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:50,611
So l'm just taking a
little time, that's all.

781
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,273
This...

782
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,113
This Mrs. Snow ain't nobody's fool.

783
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:58,643
We put out bait that any sensible person

784
00:52:58,722 --> 00:53:02,283
would say would get
us nothing but sculpin,

785
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:06,728
and by Almighty, we
got ourselves a halibut.

786
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,822
You know what we can do?

787
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,263
We can explain

788
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:17,671
that Jerry ain't real comfortable

789
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:21,575
with getting married...
even talking about it...

790
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:23,545
while Captain Bartlett is upstairs

791
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:25,548
so sick in our house.

792
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:29,552
And if she's willing,

793
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,316
we can put it off

794
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:36,291
until he either dies or gets better,

795
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,229
and we'll pay her to stay on as a nurse.

796
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:43,391
Pay her?

797
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:47,966
You pay her or you marry her.

798
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:50,632
Mr. Hazeltine, l was wondering,

799
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:54,336
could you come over to our place
and keep an eye on Captain Bartlett

800
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:56,106
while l attend to some chores?

801
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,168
l'd be happy to.

802
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:13,586
- Hello.
- ls Captain Hedge in?

803
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:16,189
No. Captain Hedge is out just now.

804
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:17,494
Oh, dear.

805
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:23,336
- l think l will come in and wait.
- Yes, certainly.

806
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:25,671
- Please do come in.
- Thank you.

807
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:34,446
Won't you take a chair?

808
00:54:34,518 --> 00:54:36,918
Thank you.

809
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,760
Certainly a pleasant day.

810
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:47,490
Yes.

811
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:57,903
Are you Captain Zebulon Hedge?

812
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,602
Yeah.

813
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:01,610
l'm so glad.

814
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:04,647
l received your telegraph. l
hurried down on the first train.

815
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:06,774
l'm Elizabeth Preston,

816
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,909
Captain Bartlett's granddaughter.

817
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:11,147
You wrote me that he was ill,

818
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:14,657
and l felt like l needed to
be here as quickly as possible.

819
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:16,784
- Elsie.
- Elsie. Yes.

820
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:19,895
Well, don't that beat all?

821
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:22,431
- Please, sit. Sit down.
- Thank you.

822
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:24,626
l'm so glad to see you.

823
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:29,163
l'm mighty glad to see you.

824
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,969
Please tell me about Grandfather.

825
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,272
How is he? Can l see him?

826
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:37,711
Well, Miss Preston...

827
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:39,214
your grandpa is pretty sick.

828
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:43,116
He's got a stroke of palsy or something.

829
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:46,883
He doesn't have much of a sense
of what's going on around him.

830
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:50,051
He might not even recognize you.

831
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:54,697
Well, don't you worry now.

832
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:58,098
Doc says he's considerable better.

833
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:01,035
- lsn't that right, Mr. Hazeltine?
- Yes, he did.

834
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:04,039
What on earth am l thinking?

835
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:08,373
l'd like to make you known
to Mr. Hazeltine here.

836
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,107
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
- He's sort of a neighbor of ours.

837
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:14,082
Actually, over there, across the bay.

838
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:15,948
And...

839
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:19,147
Well, Mr. Hazeltine,
if you will excuse us,

840
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:23,352
l'll escort Elsie upstairs now.

841
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:25,952
- lt's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

842
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:29,656
A looker, ain't she?

843
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,703
l swear.

844
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:48,914
lf l wouldn't sooner have
these beans than turkey.

845
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:52,318
Especially better than that
burnt one you had for Christmas.

846
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:53,822
No, no. lt was Thanksgiving.

847
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,189
Well, it hung around till Christmas.

848
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,160
l want to thank you all.

849
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:02,323
You've been so good to my grandfather.

850
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,833
Well, Mrs. Snow told me all about it.

851
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:07,495
We done ship together. He's our mate.

852
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:09,869
You've just been so kind,

853
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,534
and l really appreciate it.

854
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,075
Hello, Mr. Hazeltine.

855
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,641
Hello, Captain.

856
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:28,355
l just stopped by your house

857
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:31,553
to inquire on Captain Bartlett.

858
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:34,062
Mrs. Snow seems to have
things quite in hand.

859
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,594
She seems as though trouble
doesn't trouble her at all.

860
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,629
l judge she's seen enough of it, too.

861
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:50,875
lt's queer how trouble acts in folks.

862
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:52,812
Sort of like hot weather.

863
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:57,047
lt spoils milk, but it sweetens apples.

864
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,816
She's one of the sweetened kind.

865
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,619
Afternoon, Melissy.

866
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:05,457
Well, hello, Captain. What a
spectacular afternoon we're having.

867
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,728
Melissy, we're having

868
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,927
kind of an outing day after tomorrow.

869
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,129
We'd love for you to join us.

870
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:15,671
Will Captain Perez be there?

871
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,037
Why, yes, ma'am.

872
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:21,509
Asking you to come along was his idea.

873
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:22,670
Well.

874
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,908
Well, l'll be there.
You can count on me.

875
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:18,094
Come on, baby.

876
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:19,931
Whoa!

877
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:23,131
Spied you coming, Zeb. Jump
right down and come right in.

878
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:42,453
This is where we keep the
boat and the rest of the gear.

879
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,823
The spare oar is on the wall.

880
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:47,420
The regular ones are in the boat.

881
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:50,261
Captain, where's the famous "breeches
buoy" l've always read about?

882
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,925
Right up there.

883
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:55,028
l don't believe you'd
get me into that thing.

884
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:57,403
l don't know, but l think
l'd rather be drowned

885
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,135
than to make a show of myself.

886
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,234
Only used it once since
l've been at the station.

887
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:03,609
Most of the time, the
wrecks are too far offshore,

888
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,944
and we have to get the boat out.

889
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:08,951
Chowder's warming, Father.
Should be ready soon.

890
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:12,448
lf y'all don't mind,

891
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:15,889
l think l'll break
out the picnic baskets.

892
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,396
Why don't you show Melissy
here the lookout tower?

893
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:22,897
l don't believe she's ever seen it.

894
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:24,797
Really?

895
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:26,733
l don't want to go.

896
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:28,794
l believe l'd love to see it!

897
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:32,205
Listen, go easy, Perez.

898
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:34,971
You and Melissy are
like our insurance policy

899
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:39,106
just in case Jerry gets cold feet.

900
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:43,414
- You know what l mean?
- lf Jerry gets cold feet,

901
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:47,388
l'm the one stepping into his shoes,

902
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,550
immediately.

903
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:00,227
Captain Norris, you must've seen
some plucky things in your day.

904
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:02,771
What's the bravest
thing you've ever seen?

905
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:04,739
Well, l've seen something done once

906
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:08,938
that may not strike you as being
anything out of the usual run,

907
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:13,381
but has always seemed to me
clear grit and nothing else.

908
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:17,113
So l says to Prissy Rend, says
l, "That Captain Perez Ryder,

909
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:18,848
"he sure is a case.

910
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,483
70 years old and still so wild."

911
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,720
Prissy says there's no woman
alive who can tame a man

912
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:26,227
once he hasn't been tamed already.

913
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:29,197
But l said, "No, Prissy. lf
anyone can tame him, l can tame him.

914
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:32,098
l'm going to housebreak him just
like l did my second husband.

915
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:35,569
lt happened off the coast
of Maine along in the '70s.

916
01:01:35,638 --> 01:01:39,597
l was working as a sort of
second mate on a lumber schooner.

917
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,509
We struck a rock that
wasn't down on any chart.

918
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:44,809
Punched a hole in the schooner's side.

919
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:46,746
Did you abandon ship?

920
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,284
Well, that was my thought.

921
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:52,378
But the skipper... he wasn't that kind.

922
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:55,117
He sized things up in
a hurry, l tell you.

923
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:58,058
Half the crew was praying to the virgin,

924
01:01:58,128 --> 01:02:00,926
the other half swearing a blue streak.

925
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:02,965
But the skipper... he
drove them to the pumps

926
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:06,161
and set me over them with a
revolver to keep them working.

927
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:09,103
- And she said that...
- Now, Melissy, look.

928
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,698
l hate to interrupt you
there in your story, but...

929
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:18,005
l see where you're driving,

930
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,049
and...

931
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:24,416
l just don't want to
give you no encouragement.

932
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:26,717
l mean, l like you

933
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,122
but...

934
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:31,217
not in the marrying way.

935
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:35,964
l don't mean to offend you.

936
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:38,159
lt's just that l'm...

937
01:02:38,234 --> 01:02:41,135
l'm not ready to settle down yet.

938
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:43,434
l mean, l'm...

939
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,100
still a seafaring man.

940
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:49,304
Out there, there's...

941
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:52,542
still maybe voyages to take, and l...

942
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:55,413
Captain, you make as much common sense

943
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:58,147
as a duck in a henhouse.

944
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:01,447
Don't... Please don't cry.

945
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:03,458
l didn't mean...

946
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,927
When they was done,

947
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:10,397
we had to carry the
first mate to the cabin.

948
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:12,662
But the skipper... he just sent the cook

949
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:14,999
for a pail of boiling hot coffee,

950
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:16,936
drunk the whole of it,

951
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:20,134
put dry clothes over his flannels

952
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,668
and stayed on deck and worked
that schooner into Portland Harbor.

953
01:03:23,746 --> 01:03:25,407
Who was he, Captain Norris?

954
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:27,746
lt was Captain Zeb.

955
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:29,842
That's right, ma'am.

956
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:31,819
Perez told you, l suppose.

957
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:34,948
No. Nobody told me. l just guessed it.

958
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,515
l've seen a good many folks in my time,

959
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:41,496
and l calculate that l've got so
that l can tell what kind a man is

960
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:43,054
after l've known him a little while.

961
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,769
Thank you.

962
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:55,640
He's been sleeping
peaceful the last hour.

963
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:27,102
Dear Miss Preston,

964
01:04:27,177 --> 01:04:29,645
if you don't want the sheriff to come

965
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:32,909
and haul your grandpa
into state's prison,

966
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:34,347
you better come and see me

967
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,408
at the billiard hall right away.

968
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,351
Web Saunders.

969
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:48,262
Sure l can't help you with
them dishes, Mrs. Snow?

970
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:51,960
No. Don't you fellas ever
touch another dirty dish.

971
01:04:52,035 --> 01:04:55,368
Ever since l caught you with
a dust rag as a dishcloth,

972
01:04:55,438 --> 01:04:56,905
of all the silly things.

973
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:59,134
Don't fleck out with me.

974
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:01,939
When did you have a
dust rag and a dishcloth?

975
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:03,774
l don't know what...

976
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,576
lt's a pity she won't let us help her.

977
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:11,014
There.

978
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,595
Well, hello.

979
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:29,160
You come to learn the trade?

980
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:31,969
Captain Zeb, l want to
have a talk with you.

981
01:05:33,676 --> 01:05:34,870
A business talk.

982
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:41,542
l want you to help me get a position.

983
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:43,552
A position.

984
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,884
Well, l've been thinking
a great deal lately,

985
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:49,049
and now that Grandfather
seems to be a little better

986
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:52,060
and he doesn't need as much care,

987
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:55,495
l want to do something
to earn my living.

988
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:57,931
Earn your living?

989
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,333
Why, child alive,

990
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:02,564
you don't need to do that.

991
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,335
Your grandfather is not so poor

992
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,535
that l can't give you a
little change now and then

993
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,668
that he wouldn't pay me back.

994
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:12,613
No, l don't want to use your money,

995
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:13,774
or his.

996
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:21,856
l want to get the teaching
job here at the grammar school.

997
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:23,915
Look here, Elsie.

998
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:28,487
l don't want you to think l'm
curious about your private life,

999
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:30,862
but are you sure there's
not some other reason

1000
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:34,027
why you want to take this place?

1001
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:35,968
No, Captain Zeb.

1002
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,270
lt's just as l've told you.

1003
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:43,674
l just don't know what
you must think of me

1004
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:46,806
answering an advertisement
for a husband that way.

1005
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:48,145
l just...

1006
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:51,050
l'm ashamed of myself to
think of it, l declare.

1007
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,712
And in that kind of paper, too.

1008
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:55,087
Well, l will say...

1009
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:57,183
l did wonder more than a few.

1010
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,856
Well, l am surprised that
you ain't asked me before.

1011
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,195
My husband's name was Jubal Snow.

1012
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:06,792
He was a good husband.

1013
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:08,393
No better anywheres.

1014
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:10,405
He and l had a good life together.

1015
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:12,134
Our trouble was we didn't calculate

1016
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,301
that fair weather
wouldn't last all the time.

1017
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:19,376
Well, he took down sick,

1018
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,383
and he had to quit going to sea.

1019
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:28,656
And we had a little house in Nantucket,

1020
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:30,693
and we settled on it.

1021
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,627
Finally, we come to where we
had to do something right away,

1022
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,994
and we talked the whole thing out,

1023
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:38,090
and we decided to mortgage the house.

1024
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,367
The money we got from
the mortgage, though,

1025
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:43,337
lasted until Jubal died.

1026
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:47,935
They foreclosed the mortgage
and gave me notice to move out.

1027
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,944
So l packed my things

1028
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:54,574
and watered my flowers
for the last time.

1029
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,711
You know, l had a beautiful garden.

1030
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:04,291
Fire. Fire.

1031
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,157
lt's blazing.

1032
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:08,493
lt's burning. The fire...

1033
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:11,192
John, don't talk so.

1034
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:13,963
Where's the kerosene

1035
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:15,663
and the matches?

1036
01:08:15,738 --> 01:08:18,138
Now, softly,

1037
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:19,936
softly...

1038
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,874
The shavings.

1039
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:24,970
lt's dark here in the corner.

1040
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:33,018
"And all their goodly
castles with fire."

1041
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:37,784
John, be still.

1042
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,623
Be still.

1043
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:43,488
Be still.

1044
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,363
He had just such a turn last night.

1045
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:48,893
Did he talk like he did just now?

1046
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:51,701
Just the same.

1047
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:53,639
Saying the same things?

1048
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,233
Yes.

1049
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:57,640
Then you knew.

1050
01:08:57,713 --> 01:09:00,409
That he set the billiard room afire?

1051
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:02,815
Yes.

1052
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,617
l always rather suspicioned that he did,

1053
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:13,594
and, of course, last night
just made me sure of it.

1054
01:09:13,663 --> 01:09:15,358
Did you think that l knew?

1055
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,126
Always thought that you did.

1056
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:24,900
When l found him, he had his coat on,

1057
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:28,239
and it was... it was all burnt,

1058
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,645
and he had an empty kerosene bottle

1059
01:09:32,715 --> 01:09:34,580
in his pocket.

1060
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,379
l hid them both,

1061
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:39,046
and then l turned him
around so it looked like

1062
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:40,884
he was running towards the saloon

1063
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:42,549
instead of from it.

1064
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:48,892
l feel like l'm a
firebug myself sometimes.

1065
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:52,867
Captain Zeb, do you think l blame you

1066
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,403
for trying to keep your
best friend out of trouble

1067
01:09:55,471 --> 01:09:58,929
for being, well, out of his head?

1068
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:00,270
Land of mercy.

1069
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:04,177
He ain't no more to be held
responsible than a baby.

1070
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:07,774
You did exactly what l would've
done if l'd been in your place.

1071
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:13,988
Mrs. Snow,

1072
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:19,584
you are just exactly

1073
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:21,061
the kind of woman

1074
01:10:21,731 --> 01:10:23,722
that l wish l'd had

1075
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:26,461
for a sister.

1076
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:36,442
Yes...

1077
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,503
- Did it again, did you, Margaret?
- Hi.

1078
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:40,310
Nice work.

1079
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:49,552
l was just helping Martha here

1080
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,422
take some groceries home.

1081
01:10:51,494 --> 01:10:53,826
l was telling her how wonderful it was

1082
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,421
that we've got her to take care of us.

1083
01:10:56,499 --> 01:11:00,230
Well, with John
Bartlett and all, it's...

1084
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:02,328
Were you, now?

1085
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:06,171
Captain Perez has been
such a comfort to me today.

1086
01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:10,508
lnsisting on carrying the groceries
and helping clean the house.

1087
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:14,682
Some girl will be awfully
lucky to land him one day.

1088
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,588
Well, if he ever consents to marry.

1089
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,649
A confirmed bachelor, he is.

1090
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:26,888
Now, Melissa will marry him,

1091
01:11:26,963 --> 01:11:28,555
but he won't have none of that.

1092
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:30,326
That's not true.

1093
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,560
l'd marry.

1094
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:36,503
Melissa...just isn't my type.

1095
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,802
Perez, can l have a word with you?

1096
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:44,868
Excuse me.

1097
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,015
Now what?

1098
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:55,185
Stop two-timing Jerry.

1099
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,886
Melissa's the one for you.

1100
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,485
That's our backup.

1101
01:12:00,563 --> 01:12:03,999
She's a sure thing, not Mrs. Snow.

1102
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:07,126
Why not?

1103
01:12:07,203 --> 01:12:11,162
Well, don't take this
personal or nothing, Perez,

1104
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,765
but when all you got is a hand line

1105
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:16,368
and a scrap of squid for fishing,

1106
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:19,778
you really can't be going after whales.

1107
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:31,449
Hey, Sonny, is Miss Preston gone yet?

1108
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,995
No, she ain't. She's up there.

1109
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:37,089
Mr. Saunders is there, too.

1110
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:40,158
Saunders? Web Saunders?

1111
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,734
l'm telling you right now,

1112
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:48,401
l ain't nobody's fool.

1113
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:52,504
You're making $14 a week,
and all you're paying me is 6!

1114
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,139
l want more, l tell you.

1115
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:59,047
Sure smells good.

1116
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:03,649
l hope you didn't spend all day.

1117
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:06,024
Making that?

1118
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:09,622
Oh, no. l didn't spend
even a second on it.

1119
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,826
Melissy Busteed made it.

1120
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:19,731
She brought the whole
pot over this morning.

1121
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:23,677
Really? She wanted you
to have the first taste.

1122
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:26,146
- ls that true?
- Oh, yeah.

1123
01:13:29,852 --> 01:13:31,945
For me.

1124
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,194
Miss Busteed.

1125
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:46,524
What?

1126
01:14:15,397 --> 01:14:18,594
Not only did l find that burnt coat

1127
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,932
and empty kerosene bottle on the hill,

1128
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:26,168
but l found his big, fancy, white hat.

1129
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:29,643
Found that hat, did you?

1130
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:31,236
That's l done.

1131
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:35,610
Where do you think l found it?

1132
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,151
ln the back of my shed,

1133
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:39,153
right where the fire started.

1134
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:41,416
And there was a pile
of ashes there, too.

1135
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:44,084
And there was kerosene on him.

1136
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,855
What kind of fool do you think l am

1137
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:47,896
that l wouldn't know
who started that fire?

1138
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:52,300
l knew the night she burned.

1139
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:56,464
And when Doc Palmers said
that Bartlett had took sick,

1140
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,975
l went right up the hill,
and l started hunting.

1141
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:01,907
And l found things.

1142
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:05,344
And the things l found, l kept.

1143
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:06,847
Do you, now?

1144
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:10,008
Dear, dear.

1145
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:12,679
And when that girl come here,

1146
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:16,589
and starts swelling around
and putting on the airs,

1147
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:19,423
l sees my chance.

1148
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,759
So l tell her, "You better pay up,

1149
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:26,291
or l'm going to have your old
granddad shoved into Barnstable jail."

1150
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:34,105
You lowlife, thieving rascal.

1151
01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:36,406
l'm giving you a chance
you don't deserve.

1152
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:40,539
You either pay back that money
to that girl you stole it from,

1153
01:15:40,616 --> 01:15:42,641
or l'm going to walk out that door,

1154
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:45,846
and when l'm come back, l
will have the sheriff with me.

1155
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,913
Go ahead. Bring the sheriff up here,

1156
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:51,516
and l'll march him
right down to your house,

1157
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:55,394
and l'll show him the man
that set my house on fire.

1158
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,398
That doesn't frighten me.

1159
01:15:57,466 --> 01:15:58,524
lt doesn't?

1160
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:01,359
lt doesn't. Why not?

1161
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:05,799
He's gone someplace
where you can't get him.

1162
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:09,242
He just died just
before l left the house.

1163
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:11,074
He died?

1164
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:13,239
Died.

1165
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:19,085
And your proof don't
amount to a hill of beans.

1166
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:22,919
Well...

1167
01:16:22,992 --> 01:16:25,153
Well, now...

1168
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:29,054
Captain Hedge,

1169
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:32,828
l don't think we ought
to be fighting like this.

1170
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:35,029
Neither one of us

1171
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:40,041
really wants to see any
trouble, so maybe there's a way

1172
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,907
that this thing could be worked out?

1173
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:48,643
You no-good scoundrel.

1174
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:51,379
You give her that money back,

1175
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:54,616
or l'll break you in two myself.

1176
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,942
John is gone.

1177
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,912
He's gone to a better place.

1178
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:22,178
He being gone is a great loss to us,

1179
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,311
a great loss for this town,

1180
01:17:25,387 --> 01:17:28,015
but a great blessing for heaven.

1181
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,590
We're going to miss his courage,

1182
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:34,595
his insight,

1183
01:17:35,965 --> 01:17:37,899
and the powerful example he was

1184
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:40,367
for... for all of us.

1185
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,861
Let us pray.

1186
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:08,452
So, Jer...

1187
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:12,332
now that John's in the ground,

1188
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:15,336
we got to talk about
this marriage business.

1189
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:18,703
Well, l don't see why she can't
keep on being a housekeeper

1190
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,036
like she was.

1191
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:23,203
Well, l do. Jerry,

1192
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:25,746
you've got to ask her to marry you.

1193
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,679
Now, why don't you stick
to your own concerns

1194
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,240
and give me a bit of time?

1195
01:18:29,318 --> 01:18:31,786
Jerry, you've had enough time.

1196
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,378
l think a heap of Mrs. Snow.

1197
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:36,117
She's a fine, pretty woman.

1198
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:38,523
l'd be proud to have her as my wife.

1199
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:41,688
But l just ain't the
spunk yet to ask her.

1200
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,356
The spunk?

1201
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,297
lt don't take much spunk.

1202
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:46,834
l need a month at least.

1203
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:48,870
- A month?
- Well, three weeks.

1204
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:50,666
A week.

1205
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:52,536
l give you one week.

1206
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:57,503
Get...

1207
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:02,873
There's Melissy.

1208
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:06,910
l think l'm going to go over
and say some nice words to her.

1209
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:11,585
Perez, l thought you weren't
too keen on old Melissy.

1210
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,025
l'll give you she's talkative.

1211
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:18,128
She's talkative. But after she
brought the chowder the other day,

1212
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,636
l have a whole new appreciation

1213
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:23,603
for the woman.

1214
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,405
Listen to that wind.

1215
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,845
l think we're in for a northeaster.

1216
01:19:32,915 --> 01:19:34,576
How about a game of cards?

1217
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,776
l should like to stay, Captain,

1218
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:37,648
but how will l get back to the station

1219
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,050
if this storm grows any worse?

1220
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:41,351
l think it's getting worse.

1221
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:43,288
l ought to be back at the station.

1222
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:45,792
Well, yep, but you ain't.

1223
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:50,230
So you're just going to have to
put up in this here boarding house

1224
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:52,665
until morning at least.

1225
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:54,599
First thing in the forenoon,

1226
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,036
l'll take you back
to the station myself.

1227
01:19:57,106 --> 01:20:00,303
Maybe we'll stop in and see
Luther and the boys on the way.

1228
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:22,220
Nice day for ducks.

1229
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:26,733
Luther, wake up!

1230
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:28,667
You got visitors.

1231
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:37,001
What are you doing here?

1232
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:38,740
l come out here with the news.

1233
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:41,408
l might ask you what you're doing here.

1234
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:44,816
Well, l'm taking Mr. Hazeltine

1235
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:47,014
up to the cable station,

1236
01:20:47,089 --> 01:20:49,284
and l thought l'd drop
in and see the boys.

1237
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:51,053
There's been a wreck.

1238
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:53,617
A schooner's hung up on Hog's Back.

1239
01:20:53,695 --> 01:20:57,153
Luther and his crew went out
there well over two hours ago.

1240
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:58,893
And l'm getting worried.

1241
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:02,664
l was on my way out to the point to
see if l could see any sign of them.

1242
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,069
Well, we're going with you.

1243
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:11,539
Wind's letting up a little might.

1244
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:13,513
We've had the worst of it, l guess.

1245
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,777
- There ain't so much...
- Good God!

1246
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:19,018
They need help!

1247
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:22,489
Godfrey mighty!

1248
01:21:22,558 --> 01:21:24,617
Quick now!

1249
01:21:33,735 --> 01:21:35,703
Quick now! Lively!

1250
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:48,548
There's Luther Norris.

1251
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:51,085
He's all alone.

1252
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:04,929
Yeah.

1253
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:56,746
- Looks like he's out cold!
- l got to go out there.

1254
01:22:56,818 --> 01:22:58,683
l'm going, Captain.

1255
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:01,154
l'm younger than either of you,
and l've got the best chance.

1256
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:04,249
l mean it. l'm going.

1257
01:23:04,326 --> 01:23:06,260
All right, Mr. Hazeltine.

1258
01:23:06,328 --> 01:23:08,193
But we need the medicine chest.

1259
01:23:08,263 --> 01:23:11,562
You run back there as fast as
the Lord Almighty will let you,

1260
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:15,364
- and you get it back here.
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:23:15,437 --> 01:23:17,302
Don't give me that look, chummy.

1262
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:19,237
That young fella's got a life to live.

1263
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:27,214
You do not have to do this.

1264
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:29,443
You think l'm too old.

1265
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:34,418
l think you're going to die.

1266
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:35,956
All right.

1267
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:38,857
lf l don't come back,

1268
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:40,986
you make sure Jerry marries

1269
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:43,554
that wonderful woman from Nantucket.

1270
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:47,497
Don't let me down, Perez.

1271
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:21,735
Lute, we're going to
try land. You hear me?

1272
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:24,897
What's the use?

1273
01:24:24,973 --> 01:24:27,203
They're all gone!

1274
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,243
My whole crew!

1275
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:33,243
l might as well go with them.

1276
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:35,579
Lute Norris, l never thought

1277
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,550
l'd see you playing crybaby.

1278
01:24:46,695 --> 01:24:48,720
That wily coot!

1279
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:51,925
The medicine chest was in
the wagon the whole time.

1280
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,934
Let me see that.

1281
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:59,903
Brace up. What are you, anyway?

1282
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:03,035
All right, Zeb. l'm with you.

1283
01:25:03,111 --> 01:25:05,443
But l ain't much good.

1284
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:13,514
l got you now.

1285
01:25:13,588 --> 01:25:14,953
Just hang on.

1286
01:25:43,919 --> 01:25:46,820
Nice knot you tied there, Cappie.

1287
01:25:48,256 --> 01:25:51,316
He's a damn fool Bedlamite.

1288
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,089
And to think that you
might've been drowned.

1289
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:26,056
l knew something was happening. l...

1290
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:28,891
l could just feel it somehow.

1291
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:35,730
l couldn't think of anybody
but you all the forenoon.

1292
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,864
Mrs. Snow...

1293
01:26:42,644 --> 01:26:44,373
you know,

1294
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:48,245
when l was in the worst of it,

1295
01:26:50,752 --> 01:26:52,743
all l could think about was you.

1296
01:26:54,623 --> 01:26:56,090
l mean,

1297
01:26:56,157 --> 01:26:59,456
l thought about Luther

1298
01:26:59,528 --> 01:27:02,986
and them poor souls, of course,

1299
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:05,589
but my mind was mainly on you.

1300
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:08,124
l...

1301
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:10,971
l kept thinking

1302
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,476
that l might never see you again,

1303
01:27:17,012 --> 01:27:19,480
and...

1304
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,539
that's all that kept me going.

1305
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:26,216
You know...

1306
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:28,620
Mrs. Snow,

1307
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:32,023
we've been so happy together
since you've been here.

1308
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:37,425
l was wondering if...

1309
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:44,161
maybe you could be

1310
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,867
happy with me,

1311
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:48,842
always,

1312
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:50,878
if...

1313
01:27:52,414 --> 01:27:54,712
if we was...

1314
01:27:56,785 --> 01:27:58,719
if we was married.

1315
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:02,782
Now, think about it.

1316
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:07,225
l'm not young. l'm not rich.

1317
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:11,055
What am l?

1318
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:23,144
You willing to give it a try?

1319
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:25,543
Yes.

1320
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:29,575
Yeah? Did you say yeah?

1321
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:31,812
Yes.

1322
01:28:31,886 --> 01:28:34,116
Oh, yes.

1323
01:28:57,012 --> 01:28:59,105
l plain forgot.

1324
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,513
l'm two-timing Jerry.

1325
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,428
Hey, Jerry.

1326
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,895
Hey.

1327
01:29:15,964 --> 01:29:17,898
Zeb, l had you at half dead.

1328
01:29:17,966 --> 01:29:20,901
You don't look so bad
for a half-dead man to me.

1329
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:24,530
Well, l'm half alive.

1330
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,541
Listen, Jerry...

1331
01:29:31,646 --> 01:29:34,774
l have to talk to you about Mrs. Snow.

1332
01:29:34,849 --> 01:29:38,979
You just have to stop
pestering me about this.

1333
01:29:39,054 --> 01:29:41,488
You gave me a week,
and it ain't half over.

1334
01:29:41,556 --> 01:29:45,822
l mean, l've thought of a
million things to ask her,

1335
01:29:45,894 --> 01:29:47,759
but none of them seems to suit.

1336
01:29:47,829 --> 01:29:51,788
Just stop nagging me

1337
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:53,731
and let me be

1338
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:55,702
till my time's up.

1339
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,034
l'm not nagging you, Jerry.

1340
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:02,440
l came to tell you that
you don't have to ask her.

1341
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:04,478
l've been talking to her, and...

1342
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:06,878
Zebulon Hedge, l thought
you were a friend of mine.

1343
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:09,416
l give you my word l
said l'd do it in a week,

1344
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:11,008
and at least it would seem to me

1345
01:30:11,086 --> 01:30:13,350
that you could give me
a chance to keep my word.

1346
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:16,015
But no. You and Perez...

1347
01:30:16,091 --> 01:30:18,559
all you think about is yourselves.

1348
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:21,254
You're so afraid you're going
to lose your housekeeper.

1349
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:24,162
She'll say no.

1350
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,065
What'd she say?

1351
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:31,003
Well, she said yes to what l asked her.

1352
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:35,735
So you see?

1353
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:38,506
She's known me for quite a spell.

1354
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,980
Know what kind of man l be.

1355
01:30:41,049 --> 01:30:43,483
Of course she'd say yes.

1356
01:30:43,551 --> 01:30:45,212
What'd you do?

1357
01:30:45,286 --> 01:30:47,516
You set the wedding, too, did you?

1358
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:52,089
Not yet.

1359
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:56,897
You're making kind of a mistake here.

1360
01:30:56,965 --> 01:30:59,229
l didn't ask her for you.

1361
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:05,530
l asked her for me.

1362
01:31:05,607 --> 01:31:08,667
She's going to marry me.

1363
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:14,011
Look, it's hard to
explain how it happened.

1364
01:31:14,082 --> 01:31:18,246
But in the time that
Mrs. Snow has been here,

1365
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:20,685
l've really taken a liking to her,

1366
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:24,521
and today l found out

1367
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:27,186
she feels the same way about me.

1368
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:30,823
lt just come out.

1369
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:34,062
Anyhow, we're going to be married.

1370
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:40,764
Jerry, l can't tell you how...

1371
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:43,504
how small l feel about

1372
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:46,308
the way l've treated you here.

1373
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:48,440
Zeb,

1374
01:31:49,584 --> 01:31:52,280
l don't mind,

1375
01:31:52,353 --> 01:31:57,290
but l can't say that l ain't hurt.

1376
01:31:57,358 --> 01:31:59,292
Because, well, it's just...

1377
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,988
Let me sit here for a while

1378
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:04,930
till l get used to the idea.

1379
01:32:06,201 --> 01:32:09,602
All l can do, Jerry, is say...

1380
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:11,400
l'm sorry.

1381
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:13,838
Well, you done stole my wife.

1382
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:15,739
Ain't you going to shake my hand?

1383
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:18,301
Sure.

1384
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:22,340
We're still shipmates, right?

1385
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,248
Always.

1386
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:30,757
Congratulations.

1387
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:32,315
Thanks, partner.

1388
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:02,650
Well, you got to dig deeper.

1389
01:33:02,724 --> 01:33:05,158
Come on. Hurry up. You're
moving as slow as molasses.

1390
01:33:05,226 --> 01:33:07,217
l'm just learning.

1391
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:10,093
Here's your bulb.

1392
01:33:10,164 --> 01:33:12,428
No chowder till you're done.

1393
01:33:15,069 --> 01:33:16,832
lt's not fun yet.

1394
01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:19,339
You said marriage was going to be fun.

1395
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:22,342
When's it going to be fun?

1396
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:26,710
Glad to see Elsie and
Mr. Hazeltine sparking.

1397
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:28,806
Her grandpa would be proud.

1398
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:36,620
Looks like we're going to
have a fair day tomorrow.

1399
01:33:36,691 --> 01:33:39,125
Maybe so.

1400
01:33:39,193 --> 01:33:41,058
But if it ain't,

1401
01:33:41,129 --> 01:33:43,097
l know l've got a good pilot.

1402
