1
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,082
( beeping )
Hey, what do you--

2
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,751
Hey, hey, what do you
think you're doing?!

3
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,954
¶ Thinking about the summer
that went by too fast ¶

4
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,956
( man groaning )
Hey! Ah!

5
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,591
¶ All the money invested ¶

6
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:42,959
¶ And I wasted time ¶

7
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,297
Owwww!

8
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,600
Ohh, eeee!

9
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,136
¶ Everything's gonna be okay ¶

10
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,022
¶ Everything's gonna be okay ¶

11
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,691
¶ Everything's gonna be okay ¶

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,943
¶ Don't worry about a thing ¶

13
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,395
¶ There'll be better days ¶

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,232
Oh!

15
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,203
( man ) 
Oh, come on.

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,574
I wanna go for a ride.

17
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,327
¶ Whoa Whoa ¶

18
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,080
¶ So I started a band and
got booed off stage... ¶¶

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,166
Boys, boys, his colostomy bag!

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,972
5:29.

21
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,758
We gotta shave that
time in half, amigos!

22
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,143
I could have transpo'd

23
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:34,177
every blue hair in this building

24
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,845
in two minutes.

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,430
( patient yelling ) 
You couldn't shave my ball sack in two minutes.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,766
Shut up! ( stuttering )
This is b-bullshit, Richie Rich!

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,651
How about n-next time

28
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,520
we clock you?

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,772
You're all heart.

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,574
Now cowboy up, let's roll!

31
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,159
( Rich ) 
Hey, Rich here.

32
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,661
Head of the illustrious
BALS ambulance unit.

33
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,663
Welcome to Bayside, where
we're famous for two things,

34
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,165
boredom...

35
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,117
( man ) 
We French are the best drunk drivers in the world!

36
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
( woman screaming ) 
...and tourists.

37
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,038
Did I mention drunk tourists?

38
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,039
Anyways, I digress.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,543
See, we're EMTs, Emergency
Medical Technicians.

40
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,046
That's a step or several stories below

41
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,548
your basic well-trained paramedic.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,553
And stop calling me "Jacques"
and call an ambulance! Oh!

43
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,605
Being an EMT in a small
town ain't that bad.

44
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,106
It's almost as good
as being a celebrity.

45
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,110
The only problem is we got a
little friendly competition.

46
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,065
( dispatcher )
Wake up, 82,

47
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,068
we got a fender bender
at Fourth and Park.

48
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,321
This is unit 8-2, are they insured?

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,241
Well, hell, let my
check my crystal ball.

50
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,211
No HMO, no go.

51
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,213
Don't make me come out there.

52
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,632
No-- no homos?
Is that--? What?

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,383
You said, "No homos, no go."

54
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,085
No, I said, "No HMO."

55
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,837
You don't know what I'm
talking about, do you?

56
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,388
You're an idiot. Sure.

57
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:54,891
The captain's coming,
don't embarrass me.

58
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,893
Good evening, sir.

59
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,145
Don't call me "Sir."

60
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,147
I'm off-duty and
potentially undercover.

61
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,149
This should help with tonight's mission.

62
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,151
That'll be $50, sir.

63
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,653
Shut up, Neil!

64
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,687
You must be joking.

65
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,940
Have you forgotten who
signs your little checks?

66
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,193
Don't forget whose hand feeds you.

67
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,077
We read you sir.

68
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:15,828
That's good.

69
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,331
You boys are gonna go
far under my guidance,

70
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,116
just keep the good stuff coming.

71
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,201
( chuckling )

72
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,202
( Neil ) 
Have a pleasant evening, sir.

73
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204
I already am, let's go, sweetheart.

74
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
Your wife looks very beautiful tonight!

75
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,209
Especially her boobs.

76
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
That's not his wife, doofus.

77
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
That's why we're gonna videotape it.

78
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,716
Boobs like that just
make me want to grab them

79
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,352
and just put the nipples in my nose

80
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,138
and ( sniffing ) inhale.

81
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,640
I don't wanna hear that. Okay.

82
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,644
( dispatcher )
Unit 9-6, this is county.

83
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,113
I need you to get your
butts to Fourth and Park,

84
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,531
ASAP!

85
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,032
In the old days,

86
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,534
firefighters would get EMT duty

87
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,035
as a form of punishment.

88
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,405
That's why you've been doing
this for four years, huh?

89
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,242
Some sort of sick f-fucking punishment.

90
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,293
"It's not what you are,

91
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,495
but what you do not become that hurts."

92
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,964
A Greek guy said that.

93
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:09,415
S-seriously, Rich,

94
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,418
We c-cannot live like this forever.

95
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,672
Hey, man, who says this
is living, huh, One-Foot!

96
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,173
Dammit!

97
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,008
Hey! One-Foot!

98
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,476
Yo, boss.

99
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,728
Beer me!

100
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,765
Can paramedics do this?

101
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
Wait for it...

102
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,152
Take it, take it.

103
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,687
Swallow.

104
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,607
Wanna hit-- hit
this, playa?

105
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,608
No, no, no, I'm with child.

106
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,110
Come on!

107
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,078
Rich, we got a bit of a
cluster fudge-pack back here.

108
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,364
You better watch yourself, midget!

109
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,667
Who in the hell are
you calling m-m-midget?

110
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,085
You
m-m-meathead!

111
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,588
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Ladies, please!

112
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,590
Your whole family's short!
Your momma's short!

113
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,792
Time out!

114
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,377
You're both pretty, okay?

115
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,966
Are-- are you-- are
you staring at me?

116
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,883
Uh-uh.

117
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,352
Stop staring at me, Neil.

118
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,307
Neil, I'm not fucking
around, cut it out!

119
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,891
Oh Jacques!

120
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,394
Oh my head! Oh!

121
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,395
( on loudspeaker )
Would you excuse me, Miss?

122
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,896
I wouldn't make out with him tonight.

123
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,898
I can tell you, that's a herpes scar.

124
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,284
Ambulance? Stop!

125
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,119
We're EMTs, we want you to be healthy.

126
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,621
( Jacques ) 
You're not going to run after it?

127
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,623
( both laughing )

128
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:28,661
( imitating radar ) 
Richie, pizza boy is locked and loaded.

129
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,163
Where in the hell are you guys going?!

130
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,165
Tarzan and Jane want pizza.

131
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,668
Easy
and--

132
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,553
( tires squealing ) 
Ow! Oh!

133
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,504
Aw! Aw!

134
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,006
Oh my God!

135
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,007
( Rich ) 
You okay back there?

136
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,975
No!

137
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,477
Oh my God, here we go.

138
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,979
( pizza boy )
Guys, I didn't do anything.

139
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,981
What are you doing?

140
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,483
( Rich ) 
Sweet ride.

141
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,602
It's awesome, really cool.

142
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
Ow! Ow!

143
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,356
What are you guys doing?

144
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,441
( Jamaican accent )
Yeast infection quarantine.

145
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,443
Yeast infection?
I don't--

146
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,445
Just be thankful you
haven't ingested any pizza

147
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
in the last six hours.

148
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,531
Does a large extra cheese count?

149
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,617
This could be bad.

150
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,752
He's looking pretty white to me, boss.

151
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,788
What--
what are you doing?

152
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,173
Ow, okay, ow!

153
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,959
Easy, easy, easy! Don't manhandle me!

154
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,046
Ow, you pinched my nipples!

155
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,047
( Rich ) 
Calm down, my brother.

156
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,548
You don't be needing
your nipples right now.

157
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,051
How many fingers there, man?

158
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,052
I can't see, dude.

159
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,054
You're flashing your light in my eyes.

160
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,389
Not good.

161
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,941
I am a nice guy!

162
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,810
They're doing that stupid
trunk midget gag again.

163
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,945
Neil, chimp time.

164
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,947
Not even God can save you now.

165
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,065
Go get 'em.

166
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,700
( Rich ) 
There's damage to your optical nerve.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,902
Yes, pepperoni!

168
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
Oh! Oh, oh my God!

169
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,292
No, you're not going to die,
you might be blind.

170
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,161
Please, son, leave this to
the pseudo-professionals.

171
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,246
I need you to squawk.

172
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,247
Squawk?

173
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,749
Universal EMS code, man.

174
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,801
It might just save your life tonight.

175
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,720
All right, brother, squawk!

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,004
Squawk, pizza man!

177
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,424
This is a roadside molestation!

178
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,058
Rich! Rich!

179
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,477
You just be lucky we be come by here.

180
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:08,811
Hello?

181
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,680
Rich, he's stealing the patient!

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,517
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's our 150 bucks!

183
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,185
Oh
my--!

184
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,771
Come on now!

185
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,275
Got your patient, bitches!

186
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,276
Woo-hoo!

187
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,277
( pizza boy )
Guys, come back!

188
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,279
I have a yeast infection!

189
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,332
Oh God, there's poop on my leg!

190
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,420
( tires screeching )

191
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,423
( man on loudspeaker )
We're almost to hound, someone call an ambulance!

192
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,375
Faster!

193
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,210
God dammit, those BALS are fast!

194
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,764
Oh, we're gonna bring the pain!

195
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,971
( Rich ) 
Hey, Neil and Bob, riddle me this?

196
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,940
Ooh, I love riddles.

197
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,942
What's the past tense of "shit"?

198
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,061
What is it, "shat"?

199
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,146
Go, go, go, go!

200
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,314
Merry Christmas!

201
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,483
( all laughing )

202
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,567
Throw this!

203
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,985
I got pooie on me!
Throw it!

204
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,870
Isn't a horse tranquilizer dangerous?

205
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,622
Neil, throw it!

206
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,456
Ah!

207
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,575
Oh, oh, oh!

208
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,993
Nice shot!

209
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
Ew, you're pooie.

210
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,832
( One-Foot )
What the--! What--!

211
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,051
What the hell is that?

212
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,053
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

213
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,054
Hey, new driver, new driver!

214
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,556
Don't throw me on the wheel!

215
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,559
Neil, get it off your fucking face!

216
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,927
Get if off!

217
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
Jacques, what are you doing? Voila!

218
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,683
This is how you get
things done in my country.

219
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,687
Watch out for your shoes!

220
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,190
Jacques, Jacques! What are you doing?!

221
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,325
Medical assistance! Oh!

222
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,245
What the hell is that?

223
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,863
( siren blaring )

224
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,331
Wake him up! wake him up!

225
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,333
Please, Rich, wake him up,
I'm gonna kill this guy!

226
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,702
Move, get off the road!
Rich, come on, he's coming!

227
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,040
I demand that you stop this ambulance!

228
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,259
You look healthy to me, man.

229
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:03,626
French, but healthy.

230
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,710
Bite harder!

231
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,713
Oh my God! Brakes, brakes!

232
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,969
Uh...

233
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,971
Oh, Jacques!

234
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,972
( Rich ) 
Gas, on the gas!

235
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,557
( woman ) 
Why are you in this trash dump, why?

236
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,620
( man ) 
Congratulations, carrot queens.

237
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,705
You managed to strike a new low

238
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,158
in the annals of emergency
medical care history.

239
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:40,413
Due to budget cuts and
your flaccid performance,

240
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,464
this city is cutting back

241
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:45,334
to only one-- count
it, one-- EMT unit.

242
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,335
What?

243
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,721
He said they're cutting
back to one EMT unit.

244
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,972
Oh!

245
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,591
Wait, so it's
either us or--

246
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,675
The DIC unit.

247
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,929
The EMT unit with the
most patient transports

248
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:01,100
wins a shiny Cadillac El
Dorado with white walls.

249
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,186
Seeing as the DIC unit is
based out of the hospital,

250
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,355
we'd have to, like,
double our patient load,

251
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,608
which seems like some type of work.

252
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,992
I didn't take this job to work.

253
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,162
May I suggest that you pack
up your little clown car

254
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,331
and drive your lazy ass back
to the chocolate factory!

255
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,916
Oh, Sarge, don't worry.

256
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,417
One-Foot's all good.

257
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,503
It's just his little lungs are
so close to that little brain,

258
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,421
he just fires that
oxygen right up in there,

259
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,006
messes him up a little.

260
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,008
Look, we may not be great at what we do,

261
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,960
but we are almost average.

262
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,845
Right, guys?

263
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:30,930
( T-Bone snoring )

264
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,348
Christ, Bones!

265
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,633
You're on desk duty for
falling asleep at the wheel.

266
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,304
Large-and-in-Charge, you're
in the field, son, with, uh...

267
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,390
Oh yeah, you are in the field

268
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,893
with Mr. Mary Jane Rottingcrotch here.

269
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,028
And what about me, Sarge?

270
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,647
Grow up!

271
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,648
That's right, soldiers.

272
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,817
Hard times call for hard choices.

273
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,826
( snoring )
( wolf whistling )

274
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:04,747
Meet my illegitimate
adopted daughter, Lai Mei,

275
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,800
my attempt at diplomacy when I
went back to 'Nam after the war.

276
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,339
Lai Mei, you ride with,
uh,... oh, Stumpy here.

277
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,760
Lai Mei, baby, you can ride
Stumpy anytime you want.

278
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,267
Now it's up to you!

279
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,603
( snoring )

280
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,691
( man ) 
My heart is pounding, Rich.

281
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,693
I'm feeling like a real paramedic!

282
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:39,365
Lesson one, Chunk, we
are EMTs, not paramedics.

283
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,784
Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

284
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:45,755
Paramedics get paid a salary,

285
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,373
have training,

286
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,509
and, hey, actually save lives.

287
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,094
You just worry about
saving your own, got it?

288
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,379
Got it!

289
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:58,384
Roger! My man!

290
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,886
Richie, you fucker,
you! What's up, man?!

291
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,388
What are you doing here, man?!

292
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,890
I donate sperm every Thursday. Nice.

293
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,892
Yeah, it's my beer money, bro!

294
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,894
Hey, when I'm gonna ride
in the ambulance with you?

295
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,312
I'm training a rookie this week, man,

296
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,816
but I think next week
it's someone's birthday!

297
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
I love you, bro!

298
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,319
Hey, did you check out the new girl?

299
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,321
Where? At reception.

300
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,457
She's just the way you like 'em, hot!

301
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:22,491
There you are.

302
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,577
Are you ready to donate?!

303
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,079
Wow.

304
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,884
I might need help taking off my pants.

305
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,970
( humming )

306
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,842
Holy mother of God.

307
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,928
Can I help you?

308
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,564
Megan, is it? Yes.

309
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,066
Picking up or dropping off?

310
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,068
Picking up.

311
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,439
If you have anything that
cures instant attraction?

312
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
Pepper spray works.

313
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,493
Oh, smarmy, beautiful...

314
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,995
Almost perfect.

315
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,497
Mmm, almost.

316
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,699
Rigid, hmm...

317
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,536
"Warning, erections may
last up to 72 hours."

318
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,955
Science...

319
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,258
What will they think of next?

320
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,542
Are you
always this--?

321
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,344
Handsome? Charming?

322
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,179
Sexy? Annoying?

323
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,547
Fine--
fine.

324
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,683
Could you just fill one quick 'scrip?

325
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,301
Whoa, how did that that get there?

326
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,688
Wow! My bad!

327
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,858
This is blank.

328
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,227
Are you sure it doesn't
have your number on it?

329
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,313
You know, I don't usually do this,

330
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,899
but for a special guy like you?

331
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,535
Have fun.

332
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:43,823
Special guy.

333
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,825
Special...
what the--

334
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,493
You couldn't get picked
up in a gay chatroom

335
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,962
even if you were bent over and lubed up.

336
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,414
Hitler, Himler.

337
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,799
Uh, my name's Neil.

338
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,503
Question for you, be-yotch.

339
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,339
Oh, I mean Ri-otch.

340
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,258
Did you know we're up on your crew

341
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,592
by almost 20 patients?

342
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,395
( coughing ) 
Oh!

343
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,396
( both laughing )

344
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,148
Yeah!

345
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:13,152
Uh, uh! What's the matter?

346
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,155
Wheelchairs make your butt pucker,
Bobby boy?

347
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,157
No, he just used to
drive the wheelchair van

348
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,159
for, like, ever, makes him nervous.

349
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,777
Shove it, Neil!

350
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,778
Oh, Bob.

351
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,580
Listen here, ball sack,
you're the lower class.

352
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,664
Watch your toes.

353
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,666
The slackers, the slobs, the losers.

354
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,169
DIC will always
be above BALS--

355
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,755
Especially when you're gone.

356
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,256
But, alas...

357
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,709
What is a DIC without its BALS?

358
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,094
Huh... useless.

359
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,513
You're useless!

360
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,515
Ow, my neck.

361
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,108
Warning, erections lasting over 72 hours

362
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,444
should seek immediate fornication.

363
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,115
It's really a shame you
don't have girlfriends.

364
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,157
With a little scheming
this time next month,

365
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,160
we're gonna be the only EMTs in Bayside,

366
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,547
and then those BALS
boys are gonna be S.O.L.

367
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,132
Damn right, Bob.

368
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,418
( women laughing )

369
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,720
What's everybody laughing at?

370
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,807
If we were paramedics,
no one would be laughing!

371
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,342
( dog barking )

372
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,060
Oh! Ah!

373
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,895
Oh, nice catch, Bob.

374
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,480
Ahh!

375
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,098
Ahh!

376
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,935
There's a dog ripping
off my penis flesh!

377
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,319
Help me!

378
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,071
Neil, Neil, stop screwing the dog!

379
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,324
( screaming )

380
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,243
Get the puppy off
your dick and help me!

381
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,414
Why are you laughing at me?!

382
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,915
This is a serious matter!

383
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,835
Oh, God!

384
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,170
You can bet your ass, I'm
gonna make those BALS pay,

385
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,173
slow and painful.

386
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:02,094
Yeah, I like how that sounds.

387
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:07,099
Make those BALS hurt,
painfully and slowly. Yeah.

388
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,601
I'm gonna tickle those BALS.

389
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,886
Be naughty.

390
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,388
I'm gonna knock 'em back and forth.

391
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
Yeah. I'm
gonna--

392
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,890
Ah!

393
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,392
Sir. Sir.

394
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,893
Something organic and truthful

395
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,395
about a locker room, don't you think?

396
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,397
My ego's on the line here, boys.

397
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,399
That's why I need you to play out

398
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,401
this phony patient total scam and win,

399
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,536
legally or not.

400
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,038
Even if it
means a little--

401
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,489
Sabotage?

402
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
Oh, you didn't hear me say that.

403
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
No, that was Bob who
just said that, sir.

404
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
Now, we're gonna keep
this little arrangement

405
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,914
just between us, get it?

406
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,915
Got it. Got it.

407
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,917
Good, carry on, men.

408
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,137
Aww!

409
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,927
So firefighter, huh?

410
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,930
Yeah, save the day and get
paid above minimum wage.

411
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,932
For once--
how about you?

412
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,934
I always wanted to be a police officer.

413
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,935
Really?

414
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,438
I'm a big fan of unnecessary pain.

415
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
Are you? Suffering.

416
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,826
Nipple clamps once in a while.

417
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,328
Nipple clamps?

418
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,114
I like nipples, and I like clamps!

419
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,199
Ay-yi-yi-yi, that
works, that works, oh!

420
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,703
My turn? Yeah...

421
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,624
( man ) 
Oh, oh, oh, yeah! Whoa, hello!

422
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,126
That's embarrassing.

423
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,210
I don't see anything
that warrants a call

424
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,295
to nine-double-one
in here.

425
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,796
Was I being too loud, again?

426
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,881
What's your deal, buddy?

427
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,467
I am--
meditating.

428
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,101
I said,
what's your--

429
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,436
Ah! Oh!

430
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:35,938
Oh, snap.

431
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,473
Oh my God.

432
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,641
How did you get that in that vacuum?

433
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,642
Am I in trouble? No.

434
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,861
We take care of this right here.

435
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,869
( dog grumbling )

436
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,738
Hey, how are you?

437
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,740
( barking )

438
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,492
God.

439
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,380
Ugh.

440
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,721
Ugh, great.

441
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,058
I don't see the point of this.

442
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,060
Shh, I can't hear them.

443
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,063
Shouldn't we be trying to
boost our patient totals?

444
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,567
We're way ahead.

445
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,068
This is gonna make sure
that we stay that way.

446
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,354
Know your enemy, Neil.

447
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:25,854
Got it?

448
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,494
( cat snarling )

449
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,496
Would a little affection
now and then kill you?

450
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,625
( dialing phone )

451
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,133
Living the dream, huh, Pops?

452
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,218
( woman ) 
You've reached the Lonely Loser Love Line.

453
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,803
I think I got something.

454
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,773
Where you can get it on
with anyone or anything.

455
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,277
Before you select a species,
here's this week's special.

456
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,063
Have you ever really had pork?

457
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,532
Most people don't
realize that--

458
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:13,035
Rich is a dirty animal freak?

459
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,570
... And they love a good spanking.

460
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,955
Make your selection after the tone.

461
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm gonna record this.

462
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,242
You're into that? What?

463
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,710
No,
I, uh--

464
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,961
Two, marsupials.
I said--

465
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,796
Three, invertebrates.

466
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,664
I said that we should
get some ice cream later.

467
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,249
Four, reptiles.

468
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,341
( Rich ) 
Ooh, come on, someone trip,

469
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,760
choke, drown, pass out.

470
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,262
Do you think I'm stupid?

471
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:43,649
Oh, my.

472
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,017
Rich!

473
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,818
Me? No.

474
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,322
I think your mother used
food as emotional compensation

475
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,941
for a lack of self-esteem
brought on by a father figure.

476
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,278
And she passed the fat onto you.

477
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,782
Wow, you know, I admire
how intelligible you are.

478
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,369
Thanks, Dane, that's sweet... of... you.

479
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,872
Nice, two for two.

480
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,375
And three--
( hacking )

481
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,760
Okay, if that's not
illegal, it should be.

482
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
I'm gonna go get something to drink.

483
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,180
Hey grab me a beer and my surfboard,

484
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,598
would you?

485
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,685
Mmm, pass the gravy, I
could eat of that ass.

486
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,720
( Megan ) 
Oh, that is so tasteful.

487
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
What? Ah, hey.

488
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,192
Yeah, what do you expect
from a lonely loser

489
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,061
looking for love?

490
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,646
Ah, you called?

491
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,114
Yeah, I'm a desperate man, I admit it.

492
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,702
Hey, what are the odds
of us meeting like this?

493
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,988
I'd say more odd than anything.

494
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,491
Although we are a block away

495
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,993
from the only hospital within 40 miles,

496
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,995
a hospital that I work at.

497
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,414
But, still, more odd than anything.

498
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,383
You're gonna make some lucky girl

499
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,386
a great ex-husband someday.

500
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,304
So, coffee? See you later, Rich.

501
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,221
Dinner?

502
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,806
Have fun with those binoculars!

503
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:01,009
Brunch? Pictionary? Yoga?!

504
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,815
That close, that close.

505
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,401
Wow.

506
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,358
( dispatcher ) 
Any available units,

507
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,161
hermaphrodite Jesus
is-- over. Ah!

508
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,530
Rich, come here!

509
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,867
You just created your first patient.

510
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,869
Oh, no.

511
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,872
Good job, El Grande!

512
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,512
( groaning )

513
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,180
Is she all right back there?

514
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,465
( car honking )

515
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,601
I'm sorry, but we're
gonna have to cut it off.

516
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,187
I think I ruptured my implants.

517
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,855
These aren't real?

518
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,857
And it hella-kills.

519
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,442
My compliments to the chef.

520
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,110
Do you have anything for pain?

521
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,896
We can apply pressure or numb it.

522
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,398
Numb it?

523
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,232
Num-num-num-num--

524
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,901
Ah, sorry.

525
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,987
We're not allowed to
administer any drugs.

526
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,907
However, there's
nothing written about...

527
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,294
self-medicating.

528
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,380
Oh!

529
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,881
Little smoky smoke?

530
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:25,727
Megan, what are the odds?

531
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,596
( laughing )

532
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,314
Is she drunk?

533
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,600
Well, yeah, but mostly just stoned.

534
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,353
You gotta love you EMTs.

535
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,321
Thanks, Karl.

536
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,190
Get her to the emergency room.

537
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,158
The pleasure was all mine!

538
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,860
( laughing )

539
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,782
Don't even think about it, Fatboy Slim.

540
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:53,288
Oh, ah, oh, that was
not what it looked like.

541
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,790
That's too bad for you.

542
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,842
I'm gonna put myself on the line here

543
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,343
and just let it all hang out.

544
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,845
Honest looks good on you.

545
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,767
Okay, aside from my job and social life

546
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,353
running on empty, my life sucks.

547
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,856
My cat pisses on my
sofa on a bi-daily basis,

548
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,191
my dad drowned in a
bathtub when I was 15,

549
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,276
he was a Jim Morrison fan,

550
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:15,360
so it sort of worked out for him.

551
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,778
He was a paramedic, which I'll never be

552
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,363
because of the whole test anxiety thing,

553
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,898
so I became the next-worst thing, EMT,

554
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,317
which affords me the luxury
of no real responsibility,

555
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,736
emotional purgatory
and the rare cop-a-feel.

556
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,571
Does any of this make sense to you?

557
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,157
Not really, but it's consistent.

558
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,576
Again, honest looks good on you.

559
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,379
You know what else would
look really good on me?

560
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,381
Sorry, that's force of habit.

561
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,384
Look, I know you don't
have time for life.

562
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,470
But I was thinking, maybe, just maybe,

563
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,473
we could have no life together.

564
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,476
Somewhere... sometime.

565
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:49,978
Somewhere, sometime could be nice,

566
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:52,013
and then again, maybe it couldn't.

567
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,817
You know what would
look really good on me?

568
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:56,818
You.

569
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,189
Medic!

570
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,941
You are a medic, ain't you?!

571
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,443
Yeah, sure.

572
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,827
Look, we're short today.

573
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:08,330
I need you to take this gomer
to urology for his tests.

574
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,199
The way he's been acting,

575
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,202
he's lucky I don't
request a hydrocolonoscopy.

576
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,204
That would cure the bastard.

577
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
Hydrocolonoscopy?

578
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,459
On the double, ma'am.

579
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,961
( French accent ) No, no, she's joking!

580
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:23,962
Don't worry, sir, don't worry, sir,

581
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,964
I'm a trained professional.

582
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,933
Let's get it right this time.

583
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,937
That needs to go in the last cabinet.

584
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,939
Stuff it in the back, yes.

585
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,440
Oh, take my partner please.

586
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,642
Yeah, and give this
up? I don't think so.

587
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,944
Whoa, don't look now,

588
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,279
but the sons of sodomy
are taking prisoners.

589
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,864
( honking )

590
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:43,865
( Neil on loudspeaker )
Neil, The Neil-o-nator...

591
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,116
( Bob ) 
Neil, turn off the PA!

592
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:46,952
So did Sarge give you those numbers?

593
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,704
Yeah, real shocker, we're still behind.

594
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:52,541
You know, I am never
gonna make firefighter.

595
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:53,742
Don't be so hard on yourself.

596
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,244
You were never gonna
make it before, anyway.

597
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,580
( woman groaning ) 
Shut up!

598
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,882
Aw, why look, Neil.

599
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,717
It's Mother, Jugs and the Dweeb.

600
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,169
Let me ask you a question.

601
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,054
You ever actually save anybody?

602
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:08,056
Or do you just sit
around and be retarded?

603
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:11,142
You know, actually, I
saved your mom last night

604
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,561
after she choked on my donkey stick?

605
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,095
Does that count as saving?

606
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,180
No? I'd say it.

607
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,815
Excuse me,

608
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,684
the adults are having a conversation.

609
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,903
Would you like something
to tide you over?

610
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:23,488
Perhaps a balloon animal?

611
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,407
I'll make it for ya.

612
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,945
Look, a bird!

613
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,997
You shrimpy son of a bitch, One-Inch!

614
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,948
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

615
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,367
Hey, uh, hey, Rich,

616
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,669
how's not getting laid going for you?

617
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,288
Oh, and last time I checked,

618
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,591
I believe you ball sacks are
behind us in the patient count.

619
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,175
Last time I checked,

620
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,044
you were still the
limpest dick in Bayside.

621
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,262
And isn't it better

622
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:50,882
to be behind than in front, Bobby boy?

623
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,100
Not gay if you're giving.

624
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,518
This doesn't end here!

625
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,103
Yeah, this doesn't end here!

626
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:56,438
Come on, Neil.

627
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:58,773
In case you haven't noticed,
Bob and I are the she-yat!

628
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:00,275
It's not gay if you're giving?

629
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:01,560
I heard it was.

630
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,063
( Rich ) 
Gary!

631
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,816
Are you stinking what
I'm thinking, little man?

632
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,401
I'm One-Foot ahead
of you, Mo-sucka.

633
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,907
It's stuck.

634
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,827
Why don't you stop
pulling on it like a girl?

635
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,046
Right, right, right...

636
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,882
Ahh! Ugh, oh God!

637
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,478
I did not go through

638
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,897
three semesters of
community college for this!

639
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,900
I went to Harvard for a little while.

640
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,401
What?

641
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,403
Or I thought about it.

642
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,405
How many times were you dropped

643
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,907
on your head as a baby?

644
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,408
One time.

645
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,776
I think it's the reason I'm balding.

646
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,866
I'm gonna get those BALS
if it's the last thing I do.

647
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,621
( groaning )

648
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,124
Ho-ho! Oh!

649
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,843
I've been wanting to try this thing out.

650
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,596
Hold him down good.

651
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,184
Ohhh!

652
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:19,270
Ahh!

653
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,775
Slim, you'll always be my hero!

654
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,276
( laughing )

655
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,780
( echoing ) 
My hero, hero, hero...

656
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,318
( merry chattering )

657
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,713
Help! Help!

658
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,965
Please, I can't swim!

659
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,883
¶ What am I to do ¶

660
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,886
¶ My feet are off the
ground I'm unbound ¶

661
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,972
¶ It's all because of you ¶

662
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,889
¶ And now I know... ¶

663
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,591
I can't swim!

664
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,143
¶ You've had a little doubt ¶

665
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,680
¶ From way beyond the
shadow of our feelings... ¶

666
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,897
Hurry!

667
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,015
¶ We can work it out ¶

668
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:15,443
¶ I know you're standing in a crowd ¶

669
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,697
¶ From way beyond the
corner of the ocean ¶

670
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,582
¶ We can work it out... ¶

671
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,584
( woman ) 
You'll always be my hero!

672
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:24,085
( echoing ) 
Hero, hero...

673
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:26,588
( Rich ) 
Wow, that is hot.

674
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,792
Yo,
f--

675
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,629
You white boys ain't right.

676
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,432
Sarge wants everybody outside, pronto.

677
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:40,802
I got plans.

678
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,855
You three have fun.

679
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,974
You done?

680
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,525
I gotta get to work.

681
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:52,864
All right, listen up, peckerheads.

682
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,032
Come on.

683
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,868
( shrieking )

684
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,620
It's high time you
bring a little integrity,

685
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,372
a little grit to your uniform!

686
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,959
If we don't beat the DIC
unit, we're all out of a job!

687
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,461
Where in the hell

688
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:08,963
is that freeloading
felcher Rich, anyway?

689
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,331
He's the main reason

690
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,667
your butts are in this position.

691
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,669
Make sure you thank him.

692
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,839
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

693
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,342
( sighing )

694
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,312
Is this the part where you stalk me?

695
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:27,148
I prefer hunting with no intent to kill.

696
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:30,235
Sounds utterly romantic, but I'll pass.

697
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,238
This is somewhere, sometime.

698
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,240
No, this is nowhere right now.

699
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,743
( alarm chirping )

700
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:46,868
Disco ball, Kama Sutra,
Jacuzzi-- of course.

701
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,336
I hope you brought your bikini.

702
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,256
It's for special transports.

703
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,258
Am I special?

704
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,759
( laughing )

705
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,711
Speaking as a seasoned
medical professional,

706
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,297
I would say you need to relax.

707
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,299
Blow off some steam.

708
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,385
Stress-related heart attacks
are the number-one killer

709
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,806
among laughing, smiling,

710
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,226
giggling, beautiful
medical professionals.

711
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,230
Is that so? Yeah.

712
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,732
Oh...

713
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,734
AWOL?

714
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,736
"A"-what?

715
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,740
Alcohol without liquid. 
( coughing )

716
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,244
It's a vaporized alcohol

717
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,746
mixed with just a little bit of oxygen.

718
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,748
Designed to help your victims relax?

719
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,251
Oh...

720
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,753
The whole van
thing just screams--

721
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,255
"A-Team," right?
"Scooby-Doo!"

722
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,757
Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson.

723
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,677
Oh, ho! Oh, oh, hot!

724
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,512
I think your van just went AWOL.

725
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,514
I'm gonna fix this! Ah, ah!

726
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,016
Just know that I'm here for you.

727
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,518
( siren blaring )

728
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,353
( on loudspeaker ) 
Folks, if you look to the left of the bus,

729
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,021
you'll see not only the
ugliest man in Bayside,

730
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,657
but he also doesn't
actually have a penis.

731
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,695
I would feel bad for him if
he wasn't such a ball sack!

732
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,201
( radio chatter )

733
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,005
Knievel hotbox.

734
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,791
Where is everyone?

735
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:18,626
'Cept for One-Foot, home.

736
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,012
Sarge got a b-bad case
of the crabs or something.

737
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,264
Said t-there's no way
we're gonna make it.

738
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,184
And the DIC unit ass r-raped us again.

739
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,185
Yeah, not to worry.

740
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,688
Let's just say they'll
be hearing from me.

741
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,974
No-Leg called about a dozen times.

742
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,027
Dispatch sent DIC unit
over to pick him up.

743
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,445
Oh, shit, his birthday!

744
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,314
What about patients' calls?

745
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,531
Screw the patients, man.

746
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,617
I'm the only friend he's got!

747
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:44,118
Tell One-Foot to saddle up.

748
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,658
Richie never forgets my birthday.

749
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,328
Faking a seizure

750
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,080
is the only way of
getting out at night, bro.

751
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,966
You hear me?

752
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:02,887
( clearing throat ) 
Bob, do you see anyone here having a seizure?

753
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,174
No, I think I see someone
who's been faking a seizure.

754
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,092
Hey, who is this?

755
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,394
Is this your new girlfriend?

756
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,896
Oh, hello, I'm No-Legs' girlfriend.

757
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,399
Look at me! I'm an idiot!

758
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,653
An idiot with a beard
! Oh, I have gingivitis.

759
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,905
Neil. I'm angry!

760
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,440
I'm a
rhinoc-- Neil!

761
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,909
Oh, you think this is funny?

762
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,245
Oh, who's laughing now?

763
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,080
I don't hear you
laughing anymore, No-Legs.

764
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,866
It's not funny anymore, is it?

765
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,867
Let me out of here, I can't breathe!

766
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,619
I can't breathe! Come on, Neil.

767
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,122
Hey, nice night for a
51-50 call, huh, fellas?

768
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,626
Dammit, Neil.

769
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,628
Aw, what's wrong?

770
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,630
You DICs having trouble
finding the hole?

771
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,631
( No-Legs ) 
You assholes!

772
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,517
Oh, I can't feel my legs.

773
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:53,688
You missed me, jerkoff!

774
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:54,689
I was just wondering.

775
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,557
When you two 69 each
other, who's on top?

776
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,059
Is it--
Bob.

777
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,896
No one talks to my Bobby
that way, you little Gremlin!

778
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,448
Awhh!

779
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,532
( Rich ) 
Do your thing, little man.

780
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,234
Grab the little bastard!

781
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,320
Okay, here we go.

782
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,490
I know Tae Bo, you little bitch!

783
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
Grab him!

784
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,294
Ah! Oh!

785
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,795
My penis!

786
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,130
You're gonna pay for
that, you little son of a--

787
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,084
( Neil ) 
Okay, David, time to meet Goliath!

788
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:29,390
Aaaaayyyyyy! A-ya, ya, ya, ya, ya...!

789
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,142
Oh, hell, he's got my leg.

790
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,478
Son
of a--

791
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,597
Oh God! Oh God, my foot.

792
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,316
Get off me!

793
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,318
Why are you so mean?

794
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,819
You are a useless piece of shit

795
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,438
and an embarrassment to this squad.

796
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,522
Right.

797
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,024
Watch your tiny back. Yeah!

798
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,026
Come on, Neil.

799
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:49,360
( Neil ) 
Oh, he bit my leg!

800
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,996
I can't believe a midget kicked our ass.

801
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,583
( No-Legs ) 
What took you fuckers so long? I faked a fucking seizure.

802
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,919
Somebody's special day!

803
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,420
Yeah!

804
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,923
It's my fucking birthday, assholes!

805
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,424
Hey, I want to see some tits.

806
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:04,876
Culo! Nalgas!

807
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,212
Can I bring a friend?

808
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,556
Oh, it hurts so bad.

809
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,558
Who bites? No one bites.

810
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,061
That fucker's like a
two-foot tall vampire.

811
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,229
Are you gonna cry?

812
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,983
Neil, don't cry... Neil, stop crying.

813
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,618
Neil, do--
dammit,

814
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:33,654
pull yourself together
and hit the lights.

815
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,656
( man recorded on loudspeaker )
Attention all units, attention all units,

816
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,458
how would you like to see our units?

817
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,459
What?

818
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:39,961
We're Neil and Bob,

819
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:41,462
proud sexually ambiguous
members of the DIC unit--

820
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,915
Turn it off. Turn it off! 
I can't, it's--

821
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,216
...and we love wearing women's clothing.

822
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,668
Neil is a Capricorn rising
with a moon in Uranus.

823
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,170
He enjoys spending time

824
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,889
with his imaginary
friends and smoking crack.

825
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,890
Dammit!

826
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,892
Don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

827
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:55,893
You know why?

828
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,261
'Cause at least we got their patient.

829
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,181
Oh, shit! Shit!

830
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,682
Dammit! Shit!

831
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,234
Shit! Shit!

832
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,103
Shut up! Fuck!

833
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,321
Goddammit, Neil.

834
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,906
It's my fault. This is your fault!

835
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,408
No, no, no, it's not.

836
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:11,993
Damn right this is your fucking fault!

837
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,444
No, it's not your fault,
don't blame yourself!

838
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,912
Don't touch me, I know
it's not my fault!

839
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,914
You don't listen, Bob,
it's not your fault.

840
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,583
It's not your fault.

841
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,084
Dammit, Neil, not you, too.

842
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,921
It's not your fault, Bob,
it's not your fault, Bob.

843
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,207
Stop making me cry, you fucking jerk!

844
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,710
( men hollering )

845
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,218
Boobs! Boobs!

846
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,719
Happy Birthday!

847
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,138
One of the real things!

848
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,640
Oh, come on!

849
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,809
Come on, show it, show it!

850
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,811
So what's your name, honey?

851
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,814
Louis, but everybody
calls me "One-Foot."

852
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,819
Ooh, you're taller than One-Foot.

853
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,322
Well, that's not why they
call me "One-Foot," honey.

854
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,825
That's why, that's why.

855
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,326
I see.

856
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,829
Yes, three legs, baby, three legs.

857
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,831
Lock him in the gates of heaven.

858
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,333
May your friends always be special.

859
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:15,223
Rich, Rich, Rich!

860
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:19,560
Your liquor cold, your women hot,

861
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,064
and your troubles slide
off you slicker than--

862
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,565
Twat.

863
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,568
Lai Mei?

864
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,070
What?

865
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,072
Only guys allowed on sniffer's row?

866
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:36,077
I have never been more
attracted to anyone

867
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:39,113
than at this very moment.

868
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,199
( man recorded on loudspeaker) 
...members of the DIC unit,

869
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,201

873
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,926
Oh, I'm gonna kill that Rich.

874
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:53,427
Bob is a Scorpio on the cusp

875
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,930
who once performed the
Heimlich maneuver on a hamster.

876
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,431
You see 'em? Great, they're gone.

877
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:58,432
It's not us.

878
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,601
We borrowed
this from our--

879
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,187
Shut up, look-- Just
look for 'em, look for--

880
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,690
Right.

881
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,692
Hi, we're Neil and Bob,

882
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,310
proud members of the DIC ambulance unit,

883
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,895
and there's nothing
we enjoy more than...

884
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,396
Mugs 'N' Jugs?

885
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,398
You thinking what I'm thinking?

886
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,901
Yeah, slumber party at my house tonight.

887
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,903
( laughing ) 
We'll get marshmallows.

888
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,873
Load the gurney.

889
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,046
My very special friends,

890
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,331

introduces to you--

891
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,918
Sinderella, with an "S."

892
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,919
Very creative.

893
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,422
This here is Roger, he touches himself.

894
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,675
But it's his birthday,

895
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,178
so how about you shake that moneymaker?

896
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,346
Dance for me!

897
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,347
Culo, right here, right here.

898
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,848
Come here!

899
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,350
I don't dance for 'tards.

900
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,851
Oh!

901
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,852
These are my friends!

902
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,855
Whore! Whore, whore!

903
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,941
Whore! Puta!

904
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,442
Whore?!

905
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,443
Oh, I forgot, you don't have any legs.

906
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,444
Come on, come on!

907
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,446
This is why I don't strip no more!

908
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,998
Bring the blackness out in me,

909
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:04,999
You gonna make me
take my shirt off--

910
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,001
( arguing and hollering )

911
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:13,007
I can fight, I can fight!

912
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,460
Ow! What
the--!

913
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,462
What the hell's you're problem, man?

914
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,014
Stay out!

915
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,766
Say "cheese," window-lickers.

916
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,351
Ow! Ow!

917
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,270
What the hell, man?! Ow, pepper spray!

918
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,438
Get 'em, fuckers!

919
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,106
Get in the rig, retards!

920
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,193
Hey, that's not politically correct.

921
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,696
Neither was that slap, get in.

922
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,783
( Neil ) 
I feel bad about last night.

923
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,868
What are you gonna do with
their crutches and stuff?

924
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:41,869
Won't they need 'em?

925
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:42,870
Mind your own business.

926
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,871
Right.

927
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:48,376
Well, all done, boss.

928
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,632
Neil, look again.

929
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,250
Oh, dammit! Neil...

930
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,385
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit! Neil.

931
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:58,969
Dammit, dammit! Neil, Neil.

932
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,970
Dammit, dammit...!

933
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,089
Neil! Neil! Neil! What?

934
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,175
What did I tell you
about being positive?

935
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,179
Right... awesome.

936
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,066
Awesome, awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome, awesome!

937
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:15,486
Your little foray last
night was spectacular.

938
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,823
Bravo, men, bravo!

939
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,908
Keep that up and they'll
be calling you paramedics

940
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,410
in no time.

941
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,995
Drop the ball,

942
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,915
and you'll be driving a
wheelchair van for life.

943
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:28,866
Get it?

944
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,951
Got it. Good. Got it, good.

945
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,954
Pimple.

946
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:37,258
I like how that sounds.

947
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,427
"Neil, the paramedic."

948
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,462
But I also like,

949
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:45,349
"Neil, the guy who drives
the wheelchair van for life."

950
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,801
Both sound good.

951
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,892
Ahh!

952
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:03,117
( Rich ) 
Fuck.

953
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,990
( One-Foot ) 
Dude, isn't the paramedics test

954
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,076
like six months away?

955
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,413
Yeah, but it's a least a
year's worth of reading here.

956
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,633
Whoa, whoa! The stench of despair!

957
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,218
If we don't beat the DICs, it's over.

958
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,137
No firemen's school

959
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:26,507
and no cop academy and
no paramedic groupies,

960
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:30,094
we are seriously losers.

961
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:35,983
We get to party like it's 1999!

962
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,985
Ah! Ah!

963
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,487
Ooh! Ooh!

964
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:41,105
Gentlemen, come on!

965
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,106
When life gives you lemons,

966
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,108
for God's sakes, show some courage.

967
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:46,777
Drink beer.

968
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,996
The car's running, guys--
you're coming with me.

969
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,081
Oh yeah, oh yes, oh yeah.

970
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,084
You're coming with me and
you're gonna have a great time!

971
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:58,038
¶ I like to get drunk
straight So-Cal punk ¶

972
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,875
So people think we're, like, heroes,

973
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,760
because, I mean, what we do

974
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,595
can sound all glamorous and everything.

975
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,014
Would you like to try
some cranberry spritzer?

976
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,933
Ay, papi!

977
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,469
Ever go south of the border?

978
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,555
Ma-nuh
ma-mah no-mah.

979
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,363
DIC unit, right on time.

980
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:26,534
Rich, the eagle has landed.

981
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:29,954
Uno momento.

982
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,038
( Rich on radio ) 
I think it's time

983
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:32,039
our friends Neil and Bob experience

984
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,041
a real MRT call, over.

985
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,544
We're just here to watch
what it's like to have fun

986
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:38,045
or are we going in?

987
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,548
Leave the rig, Neil? Yeah.

988
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:42,550
That's exactly what
they would want us to do.

989
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,551
Then why'd we come?

990
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:45,836
To get the drunken idiots on tape.

991
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,422
Oh, right, that is brilliant.

992
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,424
Hey, if they come out and
they do something funny,

993
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,927
we can send it into that show,

994
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,312
the North American
hilarious video tapes show.

995
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,680
Did you see the show last Thursday?

996
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,400
They had this, like, tiger

997
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,937
and he was on the stool and
he was like-- ( growling ).

998
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,438
Right?

999
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,940
And then the zoo trainer came out

1000
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,441
and he kicked the stool
out from under the tiger

1001
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,442
and the tiger
was like--

1002
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,445
( growling ) 
"Help me!"

1003
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,447
You know, like in
tiger language, right?

1004
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:18,002
And the guy that sent
in the tape got $100.

1005
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,587
Are you still talking?

1006
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:30,014
( Rich ) 
Thomas Aquinas' theory of duality doesn't make sense

1007
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,966
in a modern-day paradigm.

1008
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,851
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're mistaken.

1009
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,185
Oh my God, that's J-Lo!

1010
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,054
Donde?

1011
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,022
Hey, you got my message!

1012
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,025
Yeah, how'd you get my number?

1013
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:45,029
OBGYN Kenobi never
reveals his sources--

1014
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,447
medical records.

1015
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:48,032
I need a drink.

1016
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,453
I can find you two drinks
and a shot and a lime.

1017
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,455
Right this way.

1018
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:56,457
Where in the hell is the
pisser in this joint?

1019
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:57,958
I gotta pee, I gotta pee.

1020
00:42:58,459 --> 00:42:59,960
Oh!

1021
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,496
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! ( crowing )

1022
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,465
Huh?

1023
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,471
You'll pop a vessel in a minute.

1024
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:14,008
What is that?

1025
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:18,429
Please do that again. Ow!

1026
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,898
Don't give me orders,
I give you orders!

1027
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,401
( women moaning )

1028
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,987
Mo-sucka!

1029
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:28,489
Ah!

1030
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:31,325
Come on in, little munchkin.

1031
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,750
I represent the Lollipop Guild.

1032
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,085
Prepare to be conquered.

1033
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,087
( growling )

1034
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,873
Ooh, he's frisky.

1035
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:48,926
Rich?

1036
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,428
Hey.

1037
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:55,299
This is my confessional.

1038
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,134
And why are we in the closet?

1039
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,219
I have a problem.

1040
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,973
I met an incredible,
fantastical volunteer

1041
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,059
at the hospital, actually.

1042
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:11,198
And she is beautiful, smart, sassy.

1043
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:12,533
And that's your problem?

1044
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,569
Yes, no-- she's not
the problem, I am,

1045
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:20,541
'cause when I look at
her eyes and her smile,

1046
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,243
all I do is talk cheesy lines,

1047
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,629
crazy sayings, stupid jokes.

1048
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,715
Oh, and then words become action

1049
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:30,751
and I end up with the Jacuzzi

1050
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,338
in the back of my Charles Manson rig.

1051
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,840
Look, bottom line,

1052
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:41,228
I would really like to get to know her.

1053
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:45,065
That's really sweet.

1054
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,403
Question.

1055
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:52,322
What do your lips taste like?

1056
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,324
Oh...

1057
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,328
And why are we in the closet?

1058
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,786
Yay, tonight's my night!

1059
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,788
Yes! Kicking ass!

1060
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,289
( woman ) 
I'm in love.

1061
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,290
( woman ) 
Woo!

1062
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,294
Oh my God.

1063
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,602
( dispatcher ) 
Unit 82, got an MRT at Seventh and Main.

1064
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:23,604
Wait, wait, wait, isn't
that the Franklin house?

1065
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:26,056
We just hit the mother-flippin' lode.

1066
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,692
Oh, yes! Wait, what's an MRT?

1067
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,061
Multiple Reject Transport.

1068
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,113
Oh, yes.

1069
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:34,698
Hey, can I drive? No.

1070
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,200
Oh, come on, let me drive.

1071
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,201
No way.

1072
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,202
Come on, please? No, Neil.

1073
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,203
Please? Neil, no.

1074
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,204
Please. Neil.

1075
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,205
Please, please, please?

1076
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,206
Neil, No! Dammit, Neil!

1077
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,707
You always drive, please?

1078
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,209
Fine, all right, you want
to drive, you can drive.

1079
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,076
Go around, I'll switch.

1080
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,578
No, no, no, if you
want to drive, go ahead.

1081
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,413
Are you fucking kidding me?

1082
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,498
No, after your little
baby parade right there,

1083
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,499
you're gonna fucking drive.

1084
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,467
Go around, all right?

1085
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,502
Woo, finally!

1086
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,587
Okay, I'll go--
I'll go behind.

1087
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,089
Ow, you're stepping on my foot.

1088
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,090
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1089
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,592
You go to the left.

1090
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,593
I got it.

1091
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,594
What-- no, get down,
what are you doing up--?

1092
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,596
Neil, Neil, hurry up and get over!

1093
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,599
Ow, my foot!
What are--

1094
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,934
Hoo, damn.

1095
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,352
Oh, I hit my pinky
toe. Shut up and drive!

1096
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,854
I hurt my pinky toe.

1097
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,855
Get the fuck in the seat
and drive, all right?

1098
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,356
Okay. Stop clowning around.

1099
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,025
Have you driven before?

1100
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,026
Safety first.

1101
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,027
No, just fucking drive.

1102
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,528
We gotta go pick up patients up now!

1103
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,280
Drive!

1104
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,618
( Neil ) 
You know who I really hate?

1105
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,619
( Bob ) 
Gee, I don't know, Neil, who?

1106
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,620
One-Foot.

1107
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,955
The little one? Yeah,
he's a little bitch.

1108
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,457
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

1109
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:37,961
I wish I could just take him
and slap him and murder him.

1110
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:42,966
And not get your ass kicked
by him this time, right?

1111
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,969
Smells kind of like asparagus.

1112
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,472
That's odd.

1113
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,357
I like asparagus.

1114
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,442
Did you pee in the rig again, Neil?

1115
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,623
Aw, Looky what we got here, Neil.

1116
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,208
Hey, fuckers.

1117
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,077
Mm-hmm, what'd you
call us in here for?

1118
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,545
To change your tire, bitch?

1119
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,550
Haven't you heard that
he who messes with Mr. Bob

1120
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,836
must pay dearly.

1121
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,337
That's right.

1122
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,589
And I wonder what else you got know of,

1123
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,425
I think he's got no nipples,

1124
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,095
which would be interesting to look at.

1125
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,181
Look what we got here, No-Legs.

1126
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,935
It's your friend, peppy spray.

1127
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,988
Oh, looks like somebody's
gonna have no face.

1128
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,573
Yeah, your turn to feel the burn.

1129
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:42,826
Die, hooker!

1130
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:43,327
Ow!

1131
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,616
Um, Bob?

1132
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,118
There are wheelchairs everywhere.

1133
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,921
( growling and hooting )

1134
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,875
Take this, you freakin' rejects!

1135
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,878
Oh my God.

1136
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,350
Ahh!

1137
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,185
( yelling and growling )

1138
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:09,686
Get these fuckers!

1139
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,272
( Neil and Bob shouting )

1140
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,864
With all the jerking off
you frat boys do together,

1141
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,866
I thought you'd be tougher.

1142
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,868
Are you sure you're a chick?

1143
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,871
You win, I'll show you.

1144
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:28,822
Gah!

1145
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,824
Ooh! Oh! Oh!

1146
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,626
( sirens blaring )

1147
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:36,747
Move it, move it! It's a beer bust!

1148
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,249
( chaotic shouting )

1149
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,394
All right, gentlemen,
have your boarding passes

1150
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,230
and IDs out and ready at the door.

1151
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,066
So this is the wild
life of a paramedic?

1152
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,652
I wouldn't know, we're just EMTs.

1153
00:48:58,652 --> 00:48:59,653
Whoop, there you go.

1154
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,905
I'm sure paramedics have even more fun.

1155
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,190
Oh, drunky, no throwing up in the rig.

1156
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,192
No throwing up in the rig.

1157
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,077
I don't know that girl!

1158
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:11,915
Oh! Okay, ow, ow, ow!

1159
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,000
That ties DIC.

1160
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,502
Nice, that's a lot of cash per slab.

1161
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:17,955
Slab? These are college kids.

1162
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,923
But to us, they are future rehabbers.

1163
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:20,924
Going up! No!

1164
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,428
And our ticket to a better tomorrow.

1165
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,930
Wait, where's Shortbus?

1166
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,799
I don't know, where's anyone?

1167
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,518
Okay, start the rig, now.

1168
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:32,886
( Rich ) 
Moving out.

1169
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,887
Rich! Rich!

1170
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:34,938
Rich, we
got the--

1171
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,023
Wait, hold on!

1172
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:38,108
Rich! Rich, wait!

1173
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,059
( man ) 
They're stealing our brews!

1174
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,310
Wait!

1175
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:45,399
Run, Zane, run! Run your fat ass!

1176
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,484
Get him, get him!

1177
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,487
Get the keg, get the keg, get the keg!

1178
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,374
Yes, all right!

1179
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,993
( Bob ) 
I swear, you're all freakin' dead!

1180
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,245
( Neil ) 
Ow, get off, get off, ow!

1181
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,048
From now on, I will steal
handicapped people's spots!

1182
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,635
( Bob on video ) 
I've got you right in the viewfinder, Captain.

1183
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,587
This is gonna come in real handy.

1184
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,724
Yes.

1185
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:12,843
( Neil ) 
I've never been beaten like that.

1186
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,428
Oh, no.

1187
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,231
I think I'm missing some toes.

1188
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:21,401
Oh! Oh!

1189
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,270
Oh, Bobby!

1190
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,273
Ah, my nipples!

1191
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,276
( Bob ) 
I think I'm gonna cry.

1192
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,863
I had fun tonight, but
we do have a problem.

1193
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,247
And what would that be?

1194
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:35,749
You now know where I live.

1195
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:38,752
I wouldn't really worry about that.

1196
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:42,255
I totally followed
you home the first day.

1197
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:44,758
Yeah, oh, by the way,

1198
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,259
I've been living here for
a while and the cable bill--

1199
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,679
Shut up and kiss me.

1200
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,186
( horn honking )

1201
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,272
Come on, get a room!

1202
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:02,275
Your patients are waiting, doc.

1203
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,362
Ah, I owe you an O.B.E. next time.

1204
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,865
An O.B.E.? I'm afraid to ask.

1205
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:09,733
Oral breast exam.

1206
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,034
I do housecalls and I work weekends.

1207
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,619
( T-Bone ) 
It took less time to free the slaves.

1208
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:14,621
Hey, don't make me run, come on!

1209
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,079
Got sperm?

1210
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,330
You do now.

1211
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,332
This needs to get to the fertility lab

1212
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,716
on Beech, stat.

1213
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,168
Why the Styrofoam?

1214
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,170
We ran out of sample cups.

1215
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,889
Okay, oh--
you're very angry.

1216
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,307
You know what?

1217
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,926
I like that.

1218
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,512
Do you know if this counts
as a patient transport?

1219
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,980
Because there's probably dozens in here.

1220
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,515
No.

1221
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,484
Can I get your, uh-- Can
I get your phone number?

1222
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:45,735
No.

1223
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,604
Oh, because you're homeless, right?

1224
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,773
I understand, I understand.

1225
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,242
Have a good day, homeless lady.

1226
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:58,915
Whoa!

1227
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,001
They found some drugs
missing during my shift

1228
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:03,003
and I've been fired.

1229
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:06,089
Oh my God, sweetie, oh...

1230
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,126
It was you?

1231
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,760
Me? No.

1232
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,130
Oh God, this is a
sample, this is--

1233
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,548
This is my life here.

1234
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,550
You may not like your
job or take it seriously,

1235
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,634
but I do.

1236
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,136
Wait, how can they
even fire you anyways?

1237
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,387
You're just a volunteer, right?

1238
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,689
You know, I'd turn you in,

1239
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,191
but I wouldn't want you to lose

1240
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,810
your precious big-money EMT gig.

1241
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,313
God, I suck.

1242
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,907
God, I am a douche bag.

1243
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:50,217
( Neil mumbling ) 
I don't want your number anyway...

1244
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:52,002
I am sexy.

1245
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,637
One day a girl will realize it.

1246
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,639
What was that? Oop!

1247
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,141
Oh, shit.

1248
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,142
"Wouldn't want you to lose

1249
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,178
"your precious, big money EMT gig.

1250
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,262
La-di-da-di-dah."

1251
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:05,982
Hello?

1252
00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:11,321
Anybody there?

1253
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:18,245
( dispatcher ) 
We got a BWS at 1120 Terrace, over.

1254
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:21,665
1120 Terrace Lane,
copy that, Roger, over.

1255
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,872
Yo, Rich? Hey, Rich?

1256
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,874
Hey, let's take this
one ourselves, huh?

1257
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,958
You and me.

1258
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Karl.

1259
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,465
I am not going anywhere
with your Susie-Q flabby ass.

1260
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,051
Listen up, little man!

1261
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,519
You're gonna go with me out on this call

1262
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,020
because I have wanted to be a paramedic

1263
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,022
ever since I was six years old

1264
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,024
and pulled out of that
sewage treatment plant.

1265
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,392
Do you copy me?

1266
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,894
Okay, yeah, I copy.

1267
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,231
I was just kidding, Karl.

1268
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,483
Try Rich again first.

1269
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,485
Okay.

1270
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,070
Move out! Doctors.

1271
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,376
We're already up half a dozen calls.

1272
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,961
Or six.

1273
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,080
Anyway, this'll really slow 'em down.

1274
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,915
You actually did something good?

1275
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,834
You know it.

1276
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,921
( Karl on radio ) 
Hey, Rich, we got a call, Rich.

1277
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,390
Yeah, so?

1278
00:54:20,974 --> 00:54:23,009
Can't you handle it
yourself there, buddy boy?

1279
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,394
By myself?

1280
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,513
( whispering ) 
I sound like Rich.

1281
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,265
Isn't that what I just said?

1282
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,267
Get humping there, Super-size.

1283
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,685
Roger that.

1284
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,572
That's it, let's go!

1285
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,527
I knew it, I fuckin' knew it.

1286
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,279
What?

1287
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:44,447
We could have used that, you jackass!

1288
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,832
All right, look.

1289
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,834
Let's just drop this cum pack off.

1290
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,842
Hey, where the hell is that
pint-sized crack sniffer?

1291
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,461
One-Foot? Yeah.

1292
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,549
Oh, your partner just left on a call.

1293
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:08,054
By himself? Yeah, not so good.

1294
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,056
What's One-Foot usually say?

1295
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,225
"Mo-suckas?"

1296
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,311
Yeah, he does say that, doesn't he?

1297
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,318
Are you smelling that?

1298
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,821
Oh, I think this is spoiled,

1299
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,323
or a black guy used it or something.

1300
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,824
Let me see that.

1301
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,914
It's a chocolate shake, you kumquat!

1302
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,832
What'd you do?

1303
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,417
Ooh, chocolate? Chocolate?

1304
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,418
I mean-- no!
Neil, no!

1305
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,302
Neil, stop it!

1306
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,221
Neil! I'm eating!

1307
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,807
Neil, Goddammit,
you're gonna get hyper!

1308
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,058
Ahh!

1309
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,143
Ah, Neil!

1310
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,812
That's it, we're going
back to the hospital.

1311
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,321
Hey, nurse, I said I don't want any more

1312
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,740
of your stank-assed freedom
fried cafeteria food!

1313
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,244
I just want a chocolate shake.

1314
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:05,245
Here, take it.

1315
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:07,247
That's all, it's too much to ask?

1316
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:09,699
Oh, yeah, merci.

1317
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,588
I said, "chocolate freaking shake!"

1318
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,041
This tastes like splooge!

1319
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,293
Hmm, tasted a lot of splooge, have you?

1320
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:23,096
No. No, no?

1321
00:56:23,096 --> 00:56:25,098
Lying ass Frenchman,
stupid mother fucker.

1322
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:26,099
I can't fucking believe this shit.

1323
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:28,518
Motherfucker tell me what to do...

1324
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,271
Bone says this is a GPS.

1325
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,274
It's not a GPS, you idiot, a BWS.

1326
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:37,143
Oh, well, then, so
what the heck is a BWS?

1327
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,111
( woman ) Hello?

1328
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,112
Since when were you not a rookie?

1329
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:41,114
Hello? I'm in here!

1330
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:43,116
Beached Whale Syndrome.

1331
00:56:43,116 --> 00:56:44,284
Oh.

1332
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:45,785
I'm right here, I can
hear you! Now you know.

1333
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:48,238
I fell, I'm in a lot of pain here.

1334
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,409
I have just undergone a very
complicated medical procedure.

1335
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,377
What seems to be the
problem here, ma'am?

1336
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,129
I need something for the pain.

1337
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:58,965
Look, we're EMTs, so we
can't administer drugs.

1338
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:00,667
Oh my God.

1339
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,752
Let's just put her on the backboard.

1340
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,753
Okay.
I just--

1341
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:08,258
What-- what are you
doing?! I'm hurting here.

1342
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:08,758
Here we go, backboard's down.

1343
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:09,759
Roll her back.

1344
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,261
Oh, oh, oh!

1345
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,095
Feel free to just roll me over!

1346
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,847
It's okay, ma'am, we're professionals.

1347
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,348
We do this kind of thing all the time.

1348
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,900
One, two, three! I
don't have it yet, Karl.

1349
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,234
Wait! Oh!

1350
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:21,821
( groaning )

1351
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:25,492
Oh my God! Peanut butter?

1352
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:28,611
What?

1353
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,113
Pookie, Pookie, go to your room!

1354
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,831
Go!

1355
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,620
Somebody help me!

1356
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,622
You find that cup. You
find that cup right now!

1357
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,257
I will, I will.

1358
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,343
You ruined everything,
you ruined every single...

1359
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:44,928
I know..

1360
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,714
Hmm?

1361
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,299
Hey, nurse!

1362
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,801
My husband is captain of
Bayside's medical personnel

1363
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,803
and he's going to hear

1364
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,805
how you refused to give
me pain medication!

1365
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,308
You know what, ma'am, I told you before,

1366
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,810
we don't stop pain, we merely induce it.

1367
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,897
Did you say your husband was
captain of EMS for Bayside?

1368
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,815
( woman ) 
Yes, I did, and you can bet--

1369
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,700
No, bad dog, no!

1370
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,819
( woman ) 
Get this tiny pervert off me!

1371
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,455
Smells like peanut
butter down here-- Karl!

1372
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,458
You are eating future
humans you little bastard!

1373
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,461
Give me the cup, you asshole!

1374
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,963
Give it to me now!

1375
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:24,467
I hate French baby-eating assholes!

1376
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:28,137
Ah!

1377
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,008
( screaming and hollering )

1378
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,643
Mo-sucka!

1379
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,268
All right, beat like there's
no tomorrow, little buddy.

1380
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,520
We gotta get this cup
filled and delivered

1381
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,022
by the end of our shift or
we're totally goat-holed!

1382
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,157
That's an ugly dress.

1383
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,159
Who's your Bobby? Who's your Bobby?

1384
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,662
Yeah. Who's your Bobby?

1385
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,663
Oh!

1386
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,664
No, not you, you idiot!

1387
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,165
Oh!

1388
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,667
Oh!

1389
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:01,170
( both grunting )

1390
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,794
I need the cup, Neil!
Neil, hand me the cup!

1391
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,430
Oh yeah, Bob's doing
it! Bob's doing it!

1392
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,181
Bob is doing it!

1393
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,103
Oh, I'm so good.

1394
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:19,105
What are you doing? I'm working!

1395
00:59:19,439 --> 00:59:21,391
( groaning )

1396
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,645
Okay, I'm just gonna shoot it in there.

1397
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,480
( groaning )

1398
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,952
It didn't work.

1399
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:40,376
This isun mistico del mar, si, si.

1400
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,377
Muynice.

1401
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:42,879
Goddamn.

1402
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:43,880
Muynice, capitan.

1403
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,164
Mark?

1404
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,749
Didn't you get the news?

1405
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,418
Yeah, actually I did.

1406
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,471
Why do you think I'm here?
To congratulate the winner.

1407
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:55,508
I never thought I'd say this,
but you're better than us.

1408
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,843
If I had my way,

1409
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:01,731
I'd round up every sick,
elderly, mental whack job

1410
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,901
welfare-checking loser,

1411
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,736
load them all into your ambulances

1412
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,822
and drive you all off the nearest cliff.

1413
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:11,324
That's enough, Juan.

1414
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,775
Get off my ass!

1415
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,945
You don't want the happy
ending today, mister?

1416
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,747
No, I'm fine, thank you.

1417
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:18,831
Maybe tomorrow.

1418
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,834
Look, Sarge, you're gonna
have to realize that--

1419
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:23,836
You like my new recorder?

1420
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:27,707
What you recorded was just a joke.

1421
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,177
Some people call me an old softy.

1422
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:32,178
You know why?

1423
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,047
Because from the bottom of my heart,

1424
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,050
I believe that it's important

1425
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,303
for you and your unit
to have another chance.

1426
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,773
Have them at the EMS
lot tomorrow morning.

1427
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,609
Pussy.

1428
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:50,863
Son of a bitch!

1429
01:00:50,863 --> 01:00:52,365
Esta bien, capitan, esta bien.

1430
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:54,367
Why'd you let him in here?!

1431
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:56,452
Guys, I've done all I can for you.

1432
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,954
Now it's up to you.

1433
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,540
Like it or not, tomorrow at 0800

1434
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,041
is a paramedic field test.

1435
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,376
What? D-Day.

1436
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:06,129
If you guys don't pass,
the whole unit's done for.

1437
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,047
Don't you have to, like, go to school

1438
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:09,549
to pass the paramedic test?

1439
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:12,335
It's a test to qualify for
paramedic school, Meatloaf.

1440
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,638
22 hours, soldiers.

1441
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,639
( Karl ) What?

1442
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,007
I suggest you use it wisely.

1443
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,343
22 hours.

1444
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,347
No more bullshit.

1445
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:29,852
If any of you fail, I'll
kick a new hole in your ass.

1446
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,904
So I'll be drinking alone.

1447
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,084
Ah, you work here? Ah, Christ.

1448
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:47,036
A few beers to wash the drugs down?

1449
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,622
I may have taken a few
sample packs of Rigid,

1450
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,623
but that was it,

1451
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,341
and they were sample packs, I promise.

1452
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,676
Wasn't our five minutes in the closet

1453
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,595
worth anything to you?

1454
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:57,680
12.99.

1455
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,218
I was thinking about
going to nursing school

1456
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,054
or paramedic school.

1457
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,940
I was hoping maybe
you'd be around for that.

1458
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,526
Why don't you just
nurse those beers down?

1459
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,946
We're done here.

1460
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:16,949
Awesome.

1461
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,960
Can I get a pack of regulars too?

1462
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:43,392
I want to propose burnt toast to Sarge.

1463
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,678
Screw the test, let's drink the rest!

1464
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,930
Ow!

1465
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:52,401
Rich here seems to mess
up test time every time.

1466
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:55,021
I think he does it on purpose.

1467
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,074
Could be worse, could be sober.

1468
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:00,993
We need a new leader.

1469
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:03,529
All right, I nominate myself.

1470
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,115
You know what? You are a disgrace!

1471
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,001
And that is coming
from a fellow disgrace!

1472
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:10,002
( T-Bone ) 
Man, I'm outta here.

1473
01:03:10,503 --> 01:03:12,622
And my bone's outta here,
my dong's outta here...

1474
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,623
Wait.

1475
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,124
... my joint roller, my steam roller.

1476
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,626
Wait!

1477
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,426
One-Foot, what do you do

1478
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,128
when life gives you an enema?

1479
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,714
We heard this speech
before, getting kind of old.

1480
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,800
No, no, no, no, no, hear
me out, black sunshine.

1481
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,269
This is "A.T.M"

1482
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,270
"A.T.M?"

1483
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,272
Yeah, "Ass to Mouth."

1484
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,558
Actually, I was thinking
of Aldus Manus Torpus--

1485
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,944
Aldus
Torpus Man--

1486
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:35,862
Whatever, it's Latin!

1487
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:38,731
And it means, "Family Never Dies"!

1488
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,484
And what we got here,

1489
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,953
this place, each other...

1490
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:46,956
God, this is A.T.M!

1491
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm Ass to Mouth?

1492
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,209
Yes, Karl!

1493
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:51,794
Let's face it, for Christ's sakes,

1494
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,746
we are sloppy seconds,

1495
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:54,831
we are day-old donuts,

1496
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,835
we are the skid marks

1497
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,721
in life's crotchless panties.

1498
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:02,805
And when someone comes up to you,

1499
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,007
and says, "You're a reject,

1500
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,727
"you're a freaking loser,

1501
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,314
you are an unacceptable human being,"

1502
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,515
you say, "No!"

1503
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,516
He's right!

1504
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,735
We are EMTs!

1505
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:17,987
Fuck, yeah!

1506
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,572
We here today are the one, the only,

1507
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:21,574
we are, my
friends--

1508
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:23,659
Ass to Mouth! Ass to Mouth!

1509
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,661
Mouth! Close enough!

1510
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,747
Let's fuck these assholes

1511
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:29,582
and make 'em sleep in the wet spot!

1512
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,701
All right, that was a
little bit over the top.

1513
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,703
But I like your spirit!

1514
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,371
Yes!

1515
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,790
A.T.M!

1516
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,260
( all chanting ) 
A.T.M! A.T.M!

1517
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,262
A.T.M!

1518
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,131
I can't hear you, Lai Mei!

1519
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,799
A.T.M! A.T.M!

1520
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,685
A.T.M! A.T.M!

1521
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,138
A.T.M! A.T.M!

1522
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,224
Woo! Yeah! Woo!

1523
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,443
Let's go b-beat some DIC!

1524
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,862
( record scratching )

1525
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:00,947
I think he meant Neil and Bob.

1526
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:03,399
No, I didn't!

1527
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,487
Oh, ah, ow!

1528
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,489
Goddammit, Neil. Sorry.

1529
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,991
All right, okay.

1530
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:15,995
Neil! What?

1531
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,496
What is your problem?

1532
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,998
Okay, open the gas door!

1533
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,500
Not the gas tank, the gas door!

1534
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,669
Open the gas door!

1535
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,671
Very-- very good,
okay, all right!

1536
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,675
You'll awaken the entire
fucking neighborhood!

1537
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,177
All right!

1538
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,178
Okay, here you are! Here!

1539
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,679
Ow! Ow!

1540
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,681
Neil!

1541
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,683
Ow, ow!

1542
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,685
Goddammit!

1543
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,187
You are like a puppy on crack!

1544
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,189
What is your problem?! Calm down!

1545
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,607
Switch! Wait, wait, wait.

1546
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,243
If we use the DZ gas,

1547
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:50,329
won't it cause them to
have, like, hallucinations?

1548
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,331
And maybe internal bleeding?

1549
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:53,833
Yeah, exactly. It could be dangerous!

1550
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,252
Exactly! Switch the fucking tanks!

1551
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,259
You still up, man?

1552
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,845
What's this?

1553
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:09,181
( Bob on video ) 
If you wanna be a ninja, now is the time to be a ninja.

1554
01:06:09,682 --> 01:06:11,183
Hello, ha!

1555
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,302
Where the hell did you get this?

1556
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,804
The DIC unit.

1557
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,306
( Neil ) 
I don't mind stealing drugs for Captain Limison,

1558
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,308
but I feel bad that that
pretty girl got fired.

1559
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,811
Will you shut up?
Is that thing on? No.

1560
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,063
Oh!

1561
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,564
Then shut up and help me, butthead!

1562
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,984
Hey, my friend B.O. needs
some "herpe" medicine.

1563
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,485
Do you have any in there?

1564
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,988
No! What is wrong with you?

1565
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,874
That, my friends, is our golden ticket

1566
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:36,375
to the chocolate factory,

1567
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,327
and I'm not talking about
the fudge-packing district.

1568
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,471
Turbo-Heat powder.

1569
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:48,971
No-Hair.

1570
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:49,972
Cheers.

1571
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,976
No that big, Bob.

1572
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,478
Wow, Bob has a little
baby pee-pee, doesn't he?

1573
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:56,479
Little baby pee-pee.

1574
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,980
Oh, it's a cute, little baby pee-pee.

1575
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,981
Little
baby--

1576
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,484
Dude, you just touched
his baby pee-pee. No.

1577
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,985
Let's get out of here.

1578
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,487
Wait.

1579
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:08,274
I am not satisfied with
this pedestrian thoroughfare.

1580
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,192
We gotta take it up a notch.

1581
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,694
Rich, that baby pee-pee is gonna burn.

1582
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,195
Yes, it will.

1583
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,698
Well, then, what else would
you possibly have in mind,

1584
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,249
oh great one?

1585
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,588
I hope you don't think you're special.

1586
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:24,590
You have 30 seconds.

1587
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:25,841
They'll be here.

1588
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,793
Just so you know, I got an "A+" in CPR.

1589
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,608
( Karl ) 
I think we might be in shock!

1590
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:44,110
( all ) 
I think we might be in shock!

1591
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,611
Neil and Bob are sucking cock!

1592
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:48,697
Neil and Bob are sucking cock!

1593
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,282
( woman ) 
Listen up, ladies.

1594
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:54,653
Welcome to the field
portion of the EMS test.

1595
01:07:54,653 --> 01:08:00,876
Statistically, most of you
will fail miserably today.

1596
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,629
The few who do pass

1597
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:08,717
will have to survive a living hell,

1598
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,087
so stay alert

1599
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,924
as you're administering
to the victims of a WMD.

1600
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,010
Bayside, you're up first.

1601
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:21,764
A.T.M!

1602
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,899
Show 'em what the losers can do!

1603
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,986
Sir, are you dead yet?

1604
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:30,406
Learn CPR!

1605
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,158
I don't think this is oxygen.

1606
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:34,160
Neil, I don't want any of it.

1607
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,162
No, look, look, I think it's nitrogen.

1608
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,618
Come on, guys, God dammit!

1609
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:49,458
Oh, man, I am an African princess!

1610
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,677
Here are my boobies!

1611
01:08:55,681 --> 01:09:00,886
( distorted laughing ) 
Oh my God!

1612
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:05,524
Oh my God!

1613
01:09:05,524 --> 01:09:09,395
You're bleeding, wow!

1614
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,290
I'm naked for my love.

1615
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:23,709
Neil, put your clothes on!

1616
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,162
Why?!

1617
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:29,965
Why?!

1618
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,970
I can't believe we failed.

1619
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,972
You Dirty Sanchez'd an old lady.

1620
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:40,392
I can't believe the Nazi-twins passed!

1621
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:43,012
They passed by default
because we let them win.

1622
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,147
I can't believe they only gave us

1623
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,683
24 hours to get out of here.

1624
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,602
And you guys thought I
was the fucking retard!

1625
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,487
Look at you losers!

1626
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,571
Please, don't get up.

1627
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:54,523
Hey, those EMT assholes
from the hospital

1628
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,859
are getting their acceptance
certificates today.

1629
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,244
Oh, and how the hell do
you know that, Roger?

1630
01:09:58,244 --> 01:10:00,613
They happened to mention it to me

1631
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,032
when they stopped by to give
me a little going away present.

1632
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,283
Damn!

1633
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,619
Lai Mei, what are
your thoughts on pain?

1634
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,871
Constant!

1635
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,040
( No-Legs laughing ) 
I like that!

1636
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,041
You look good, Mami!

1637
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,542
Damn, she's good. Caliente!

1638
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,627
Mamasita, come here!

1639
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,545
She look good.

1640
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger!

1641
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,882
Roger, Roger, Roger.

1642
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:20,966
I get a little too happy, you know?

1643
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,551
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

1644
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,553
Good, good.

1645
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,054
She caliente.

1646
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,055
Yes, caliente.

1647
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,556
Caliente, hot! Caliente.

1648
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,276
( Rich ) 
Anybody feel like crashing a party?

1649
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:32,611
Megan, hey, it's Rich.

1650
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:35,114
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't hang up, don't hang up,

1651
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:36,115
don't hang up.

1652
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:40,986
Wait, look, I need you
to meet me somewhere.

1653
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,239
Are we taking the back road there?

1654
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,492
I might be able to
get you your job back?

1655
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,794
What about my j-job? 
Shut up.

1656
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:51,080
No, no, no, don't shut up, not you!

1657
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,915
That's mine!

1658
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,417
I don't even know
what you're gonna wear.

1659
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,004
Hey, Bob!

1660
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,506
( Bob ) 
What?

1661
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,008
I can't believe we won today.

1662
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,010
That's because Captain Limison fixed it

1663
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,012
so that we couldn't lose.

1664
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,015
I know, I love surprises,
I love 'em, I love 'em!

1665
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,016
Yeah, great, Neil.

1666
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,017
Hey, you know, this new shampoo

1667
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:12,901
is really tingly.

1668
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,903
Yeah, my underwear's been really tingly.

1669
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,605
Are those my new underwear?

1670
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,491
No, these are my new underwear.

1671
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:22,077
Okay, those are the underwear
my mom gave me as a gift.

1672
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,196
She loves
me, she--

1673
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,614
Neil. Yeah?

1674
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:28,000
You've got five seconds
to take off my underwear!

1675
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,453
Five, four, three, two, one!

1676
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,456
Neil. Neil.

1677
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,292
What was that for?

1678
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,294
You're gonna get a
visit from Mr. Shampoo!

1679
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,795
No, no!

1680
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,299
That's right, Neil, you
heard me-- Mr. Shampoo.

1681
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,267
Not Mr. Shampoo.

1682
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,269
Oh, I can't see! Somebody help me!

1683
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:48,771
Don't touch me!

1684
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:52,775
This is not allowed
in the hosp--

1685
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,276
Oh, oh, oh!

1686
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,278
Oh! Oh...

1687
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,197
Hey, homeless lady.

1688
01:11:58,197 --> 01:11:58,697
You!

1689
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:01,200
Take off my fucking underwear!

1690
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,701
I'll meet you at the soup kitchen!

1691
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:03,786
Ahhh!

1692
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,660
Okay, huddle up, here's the game plan.

1693
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,078
Bones, you're gonna be serving up

1694
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,580
a little cut of brake line supreme

1695
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,715
with a side of there
goes the brake fluid.

1696
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:17,716
Got it, boss.

1697
01:12:17,716 --> 01:12:20,219
One-Foot, you're gonna
be dishing out the dirt.

1698
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:22,171
Pile it high and deep, my friend.

1699
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,672
Well, that's my specialty, Mo-sucka.

1700
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,090
Karl, you're the point man.

1701
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,426
Got it! What's a point man?

1702
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,928
When you see a bad guy, point.

1703
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:32,431
Um, where's Lai Mei?

1704
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,265
She's putting her face on.

1705
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:34,767
Of course, she is.

1706
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:35,851
Do you mind if I--

1707
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,820
Yes, you can go peek
at her in the bathroom.

1708
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,574
Oh, duty calls, carry on, gentlemen.

1709
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,364
( man ) 
Hey!

1710
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,950
Uh, hi, wow, you are gorgeous.

1711
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,087
Call me crazy, but I thought
when you hung up on me,

1712
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:56,588
that meant you weren't gonna come.

1713
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:58,090
I wasn't.

1714
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,509
But a wise friend of mine once told me

1715
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,345
that everybody deserves a second chance.

1716
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,931
He did? Nice.

1717
01:13:05,931 --> 01:13:07,182
Good, good job, I like this guy.

1718
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:09,385
He's a good friend, you
should keep him around.

1719
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,687
Anyways, I'm gonna get
your job back today.

1720
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,522
Don't ask me how,

1721
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:16,442
just sit back, relax, have some candy,

1722
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,111
turn off your pagers
and the cell phones.

1723
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:23,031
Deal? Deal.

1724
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,783
You're touching me.

1725
01:13:28,787 --> 01:13:30,739
I'm so proud of you, Marky.

1726
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,325
You deserve everything you've
got coming to you today.

1727
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,461
This day belongs to both of us, Bunny.

1728
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:38,464
Behind every great man...

1729
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:41,967
... is a great woman. Is a great woman.

1730
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:44,970
Now, you just remember to smile

1731
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,972
and I'm gonna go freshen up.

1732
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,184
Good afternoon, sirs,
that's a fine motor vehicle.

1733
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:02,688
Just park it, peasant.

1734
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,690
Oh, my balls, what'd
the do to my balls?

1735
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,024
My balls feel like they're melting!

1736
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,609
( parking attendant ) 
Fudge-packers.

1737
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,328
Hi, how you doing?

1738
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:10,829
What did you say?

1739
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,332
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you guys were partners.

1740
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:16,335
That's a warning.

1741
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:22,424
Ahhh! My balls are on fire!

1742
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:23,926
I gotta go.

1743
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,427
( Bob ) 
Come on, Neil, let's go!

1744
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,846
Out of my way! Oh, God, Neil!

1745
01:14:27,846 --> 01:14:29,348
Out of my way!

1746
01:14:29,348 --> 01:14:32,968
Oh, Satan, stop licking my balls!

1747
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,470
Oh!

1748
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,472
I'm gonna rub my fiery
balls on your face, Neil!

1749
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,474
Oh, I need a restroom!

1750
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,475
Hi, ma'am, how are you today?

1751
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:40,976
Great.

1752
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:41,977
Listen, I'm wondering if you knew

1753
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:42,978
where the nearest restroom facility is.

1754
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:43,979
There's one right here.

1755
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:44,980
Well, thank you very much.

1756
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,482
Hey, wait a minute. Uh-huh?

1757
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,483
Can't you see that there's a line?

1758
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,484
Oh, you're right.

1759
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,485
But I'm sure you're an old lady

1760
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:50,986
and you're wearing old lady diapers,

1761
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:51,987
so I'm sure you'll be okay.

1762
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,990
( woman shouting )

1763
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,993
Go buy a diaper, you witch!

1764
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,496
Oh, God, Neil! Neil!

1765
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,464
I need you to do something to my balls!

1766
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,549
Oh!

1767
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:06,051
( Neil and Bob screaming )

1768
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:08,971
My balls are gonna explode!

1769
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:10,472
Ah!

1770
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,257
I feel like fire ants have
crawled into my penis hole

1771
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,759
and started a tribal ritual dance!

1772
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,143
This is worse than herpes!

1773
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,762
No, it's not. What?

1774
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,680
It's not, trust me.

1775
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,148
Ah!

1776
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,234
Oh my God, my foreskin's gone!

1777
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:24,736
Ahh!

1778
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:27,022
You better start using some
new conditioner there, buddy.

1779
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,657
Look at it. What?

1780
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,659
Holy shit!

1781
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,661
No one fucks with Bobby's hair!

1782
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,498
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

1783
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,000
Fire Chief.

1784
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,420
Well, good afternoon everyone.

1785
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,423
My name is Captain Mark Limison,

1786
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:47,543
head of Bayside's
Emergency Medical Services,

1787
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,962
at your service.

1788
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,798
I just want to thank
each and every one of you

1789
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,349
for being here today

1790
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:58,387
to help me kick off our
safe community campaign.

1791
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,222
Woo! Woo!

1792
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,057
Oh!

1793
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,444
Quite frankly, lackluster
performance has forced us

1794
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:09,197
to make some major improvements
about the future of healthcare.

1795
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,818
In the meantime, I have a
little presentation for you.

1796
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:17,873
Without further ado,
I give you your future.

1797
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,242
( Limison groaning )

1798
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:25,547
Oh my God! Son of a bitch!

1799
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,166
Honey bunny, that's not me.

1800
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,635
It looks like me, but it's not me.

1801
01:16:29,635 --> 01:16:33,505
This is a digital hoax!

1802
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,841
Dammit, Neil!

1803
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:39,144
( Neil ) 
I don't mind stealing drugs for Mr. Limison,

1804
01:16:39,144 --> 01:16:39,761
but I feel bad that
pretty girl who got fired.

1805
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,730
Is that thing on?

1806
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,982
Well, then, shut up
and help me, butthead!

1807
01:16:43,982 --> 01:16:46,401
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1808
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:50,439
I am as shocked and deeply
disturbed as you are,

1809
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,575
but it does appear our dear old Captain

1810
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,994
has been playing hide the Jimmy Beam

1811
01:16:55,994 --> 01:17:01,333
with a local Ru-Pollyanna,
while his safe community EMTs

1812
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:04,870
have been peddling
prescription meds on the street.

1813
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,038
I can explain!

1814
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,673
( Bob shouting )

1815
01:17:07,673 --> 01:17:10,759
( gasping from crowd )

1816
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,795
Okay, that's a little over the top.

1817
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,381
It's payback time, Rich!

1818
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,100
I've had enough of your little jokes,

1819
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,770
so now it's time for Bobby
to cut off your balls.

1820
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:25,390
( gibberish )

1821
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,893
For those of you that
don't know ancient Aramaic,

1822
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,645
let me translate.

1823
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,731
"I'm gonna murder you,
your family, a random goat

1824
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,950
and then I'm gonna rape your cat."

1825
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:36,368
Neil!

1826
01:17:36,368 --> 01:17:37,703
What, no cat?
But you-- Shut up!

1827
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:40,706
I think it's time we bust
a needle in Mr. Cool's ass.

1828
01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:42,157
Neil, get him!

1829
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,909
Ahh! Neil, what are you doing?

1830
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,994
( groaning )

1831
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,799
It's your turn to feel the pain, Rich!

1832
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,501
Oh! Ahh!

1833
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,302
Oh!

1834
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:58,056
Everybody freeze! DEA!

1835
01:17:58,056 --> 01:18:00,425
He can walk! It's a miracle!

1836
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,927
Shut it, fanny pack!

1837
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,895
I'm sick of this undercover garbage!

1838
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:07,432
I feel like I'm surrounded by
a secret society of idiots!

1839
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,351
If it were up to me,

1840
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,736
every one of you would
be going to jail!

1841
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,521
Please don't shoot, I'm innocent!

1842
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,156
Stand down!

1843
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,273
And another
thing--

1844
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,409
( Mrs. Limison ) 
His ass is mine!

1845
01:18:17,409 --> 01:18:18,493
Okay, everybody, listen up!

1846
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:19,995
Free Viagra for everybody.

1847
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:21,997
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!

1848
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,416
Warning, may cause anal
leakage and premature death.

1849
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,702
( Bob ) 
Get back here, Neil!

1850
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,538
Oh, my--

1851
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,008
( man ) 
Oh, shit, my evidence! You fucking animals!

1852
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,261
Hey!

1853
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:38,263
Oh, I got the Jacuzzi fixed in the rig.

1854
01:18:38,263 --> 01:18:39,264
Wanna see?

1855
01:18:39,264 --> 01:18:41,183
If you play your cards right.

1856
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,136
( Rich ) 
By now, you're probably wondering

1857
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,637
what became of all of us.

1858
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,139
Good morning, my brothers and sisters.

1859
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,474
T-Bone became the
new head of the NAACP.

1860
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,978
Yeah, not that NAACP.

1861
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,781
The National Association of
American Cannabis Providers.

1862
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:57,866
I think he founded it.

1863
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,402
And it seems to be doing wonders
for his speech impediment,

1864
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,236
don't you think?

1865
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,821
Can I get an "Amen"?

1866
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,706
Yes!

1867
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:07,125
Can I get $5 to get home?

1868
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:08,210
Huh? Huh?

1869
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,499
Under the new Little
Person's Equality Act,

1870
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:17,002
One-Foot made the fire department.

1871
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:19,004
Yeah, I know, good for him.

1872
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,007
And don't ask me how,
but Lai Mei graduated

1873
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,508
top of her class at the police academy.

1874
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:26,978
Probably involved some
sort of physical abuse.

1875
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:29,481
I hope they never have kids.

1876
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,851
Wow, if I didn't see
it with my own eyes,

1877
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,853
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

1878
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,354
You okay back there, baby?

1879
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,355
Opposites attract.

1880
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,441
Yeah, I'm on fire.

1881
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,027
Great, we have skydiving after lunch!

1882
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,529
Aw, I thought we were
going bungee jumping!

1883
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,531
And, apparently, love is blind.

1884
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,034
Wow, does he have to wear the Speedo?

1885
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,119
Oh my God, I think I
just threw up in my mouth.

1886
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,205
After Sarge won his
lawsuit against the city,

1887
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,674
he reconnected with Lai Mei's mama-san,

1888
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:57,175
Phat Ho.

1889
01:19:57,175 --> 01:19:59,678
I just love saying that.

1890
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:00,679
Anyhow, they started

1891
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:02,931
a very successful
dry-cleaning business.

1892
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,216
I get all my shirts done there.

1893
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,768
Oh, that's sweet.

1894
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,103
And that's kinky.

1895
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,689
And my BFFs Neil and Bob?

1896
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:12,691
Well, they're enjoying some quality time

1897
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:15,110
at Bayside's very own country club.

1898
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,112
Do you think
we're have--

1899
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,613
having macaroni and
cheese tonight, homie?

1900
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:23,118
I understand they're
making a lot of new friends.

1901
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,621
I miss Bob sometimes.

1902
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,123
( snapping ) 
Okay.

1903
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,826
I think I'm gonna send
'em some lube next month.

1904
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,329
DIC above BALS, always.

1905
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,832
Okay, give it a rest, Bob, that
stuff only happens in movies.

1906
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,334
Very big movies.

1907
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,719
Ooh, was that the lunch bell?

1908
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,671
Seems that the captain still
hasn't given up on love.

1909
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,174
Some of these guys in
here are homosexuals!

1910
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,226
That ass is mine.

1911
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:49,678
You know that, right?

1912
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,599
And, me, I finally passed
the paramedic entrance test.

1913
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:56,601
I have the next two days off duty.

1914
01:20:56,601 --> 01:21:00,105
The rest is none of your damn business.

1915
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,860
Uh...

1916
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,361
Well, somebody's on duty.

1917
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:12,033
You are a sick, sick lady.

1918
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,535
Baby, there's no cure for horny.

1919
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,037
Tell me about it.

1920
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,045
All right, all right,
you've seen enough.

1921
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:27,048
'Til next time, amigos.

1922
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,050
What's One-Foot say?

1923
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,052
Over and out, mo-suckas!

1924
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:45,984
( man ) 
Mark it.

1925
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,485
( man ) 
Roll "B," common marker.

1926
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:48,486
Action!

1927
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,956
( groaning )

1928
01:21:50,956 --> 01:21:52,540
When you cross the
street and you see me,

1929
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,042
you're crossing a ninja.

1930
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:57,045
That's a warning.

1931
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,048
My balls feel like they're
in the hands of Satan!

1932
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:03,251
Let go, Satan!

1933
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,338
Wow! Do that again, I like it!

1934
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:10,342
( laughing )

1935
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,344
Turn it off!
I got it, I--

1936
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,345
Turn off the wiper!

1937
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,846
I'm gonna get
you, you son of a--

1938
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,848
( groaning )

1939
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,353
Okay, okay.

1940
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:25,657
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

1941
01:22:25,657 --> 01:22:29,244
( Neil ) 
Hi, Mrs. Limison, great to see you.

1942
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,746
May I say you look lovely tonight?

1943
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,248
Thanks again for having me over.

1944
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:36,751
Hard and fast.

1945
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,754
( groaning and laughing )

1946
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:44,259
Clear!

1947
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,767
( No-Legs ) 
Come here, mamasita! Come here!

1948
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,769
Oh, you look good!
Come here, culo negro!

1949
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:57,272
I like black boys! Come here, culo!

1950
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,274
( shouting )

1951
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,945
( growling )

1952
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,234
