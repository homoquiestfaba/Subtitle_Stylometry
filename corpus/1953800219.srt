[Seagull calling]

3
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,899
Things haven't been going
so well for me lately

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,567
and if I come out of the closet,

5
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,702
things aren't going
to be getting any better.

6
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,733
Don't you sometimes wish

7
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,770
you could just live
inside your head?

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,788
I've always imagined
my life as a movie.

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,415
The problem
with my imagined movie

10
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:03,020
is I think it might be boring,
so I'd add helicopters.

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,725
Helicopters makes every movie great.

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,926
And naked girls. Ladies.

13
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,026
'Cause if my story is R-rated,

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,300
might as well
go for a full "R."

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,869
Nobody's going
to believe a guy like me

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,275
would have naked girls
and helicopters.

17
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,576
Fellas from LA or New York,
where they take chances,

18
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,983
yeah, maybe,
but I'm just a guy from Chicago.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,448
Did I mention I was
a great football player?

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,482
People here, they don't stray
from the blueprint.

21
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,357
- [Crying]
- You're born.

22
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,523
You go to school.

23
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,793
You get a job.

24
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,027
You meet a girl.

25
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,591
You marry the girl.

26
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,466
You have a baby.

27
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,665
You move to the suburb...

28
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,832
and die.

29
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:54,044
My story, my story's an Irish
Catholic story.

30
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,520
A gay Chicago
Irish Catholic story.

[Quiet chatter]

32
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,875
That's my eldest brother,
Father Jack.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,042
The nice thing about having
a brother as a priest

34
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,018
is that no matter
how big a jackass I am,

35
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,714
I'm a lock to get into heaven.

36
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,785
You gonna save some
for the guests?

37
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,419
That's my second
oldest brother, Connor.

38
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,692
If we were the Corleones,
he'd be Fredo.

39
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,599
Hey, can I help you out?

40
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,967
No. Go help Luke be
the life of the party

41
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,132
while I stay back here,
unload this.

42
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,299
That's Maggie.

43
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,538
She's youngest and only girl
among four boys.

44
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,570
When we were kids,
Maggie and I went on expeditions

45
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,878
in search of her lost penis.

46
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,315
We never found it.

[Kids yelling]

48
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,356
- Hey, hey.
- What?

49
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,856
Got a little joke for ya.

50
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,560
Your jokes always
gets us in trouble.

51
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,035
- Mm-hm.
- This one's a clean one.

52
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,833
What kind of bees make milk?

53
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,533
I don't know.

54
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,006
Boobies.

55
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,373
[Laughter]

56
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,207
Go tell your Uncle Jim.

58
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,711
BO Y: Boobies.

59
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,913
That's my older brother, Luke.

60
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,482
Luke's that rare oddity
in an Irish family.

61
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,892
He can go out in the sun
with something lower

62
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,954
than SPF 45 and not burn.

63
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,228
If gay marriage were
legal in Chicago...

64
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,428
about as likely as the Cubs
winning the series...

65
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,232
Luke would be my best man.

66
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,501
Find some cards.
We'll go play some poker.

67
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,374
People have been dying
for thousands of years,

68
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,539
and I'm sorry for your loss

69
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,277
is the best they
can come up with.

70
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,979
I've been told being gay
is easy nowadays.

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,317
Not in my family,

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,913
where the Pope
and the President,

73
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,049
they're included
in bedtime prayers.

74
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,083
Now that both
of my parents have passed

75
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,789
all I've got left
are my siblings.

76
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,190
It's gonna be weird
not having him

77
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,097
chomping on that cigar

78
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,068
and encouraging Luke
to tell silly stories.

79
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,229
Silly?

80
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,532
You know, everybody was
so sad in the living room

81
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,039
and I couldn't
help thinking that...

82
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,406
that's where Dad laid
on the floor with that AB roller.

83
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,035
Aunt Rose, turn the camera off.

84
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,807
Oh, no!

85
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,441
- Here we go!
- Here we go, Dad.

86
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,812
[Fart] Hello!

87
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,842
[Laughter]

88
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,953
Hello!

89
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,929
[Laughter]

90
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,295
We still going
on the fishing trip?

91
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,596
Hell, yeah, we're still going
on the fishing trip, Connor.

92
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,363
Dad would want us to.

93
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,768
It's not like it's the seventh
game of the World Series.

94
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,272
Well, a fishing trip's a nice way
to honor Father.

95
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,764
My brother, the Father,
can you get away from your flock?

96
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,573
Ah, Father Dreary...

97
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,275
Father Jack here, can you cover
for me this weekend?

98
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,442
Those altar boys
are wearing me out...

99
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:03,649
especially that Hugo,
he's got the tightest little ass.

100
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,291
Oh, come on, guys.

101
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,123
He made an altar-boy joke
and he's a funny man.

102
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,288
I make one and I'm an asshole.

103
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,626
That's about right.

104
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,462
Nothing like an altar-boy joke
to get a laugh, jackass.

105
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,728
Fuck you. Fuck you.

106
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,429
You know, I've got
the third graders' confession

107
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,960
Friday morning.
Let's go right after that.

108
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,700
Right, and leave the black suit
at home this time

109
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,970
and thank you for letting me
borrow the tie.

110
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,567
You should consider buying one.

111
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,475
Now, why I do that
when I have you?

112
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,208
Jack, I noticed the new suit.

113
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,909
Armani, on sale.

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,078
- Uh-huh.
- Very nice.

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,180
- To the old man!
- BOTH: The old man.

116
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,690
May the road rise to meet you.

117
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,090
May the wind be always
at your back.

118
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,561
May the sun shine
warmly on your face.

119
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,394
May the rains fall
softly on your field.

120
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,400
And until we meet again...

121
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,198
ALL: May God hold you in the palm
of his hand.

122
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,839
Hello!

123
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,042
[Laughter]

124
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,826
Bobby, I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

125
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,420
I know.

126
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,727
We have to do something.

127
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,460
My dad just passed away.

128
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,401
The excuse used to be
that your dad was sick.

129
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,028
I know.

130
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,165
We agreed to do it after
your father passed away.

131
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,743
Just give me a couple weeks.

132
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,244
Fine.

133
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,881
Carly is a lesbian, which makes
us each other's beard.

134
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,978
Our five-year
fake relationship

135
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,353
is like most people's
real relationships,

136
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,858
based on lies and no sex.

137
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,417
I love you.

138
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,556
I love you.

139
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,929
No, I mean I really love you.

140
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,100
I'll see ya. Thanks.

What can you be doing
at this hour? Come to bed.

156
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,817
I'm working, honey.

157
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,288
You know, I've got
to check the markets.

158
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,484
You're on that thing all night.

159

What, are you afraid
to sleep with me?

160

Honey, it gives me the edge
in the pit every day

161

and it pays the bills.
Come on!

- A beautiful day, huh?

172
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,447
You know, what shocks me
is how you've been able to fool

173
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,005
your family into thinking
you're straight

174
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,483
for as long as you have.

175
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,349
This is my boyfriend, Andy.

176

If he would keep public displays
of affection private,

177
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,386
our relationship would be great.

178
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,385
Unfortunately, like a bad little kitty,
he likes to get out.

179
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,262
- I think you're mad.
- I'm not mad.

180
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,631
Sounds like you're mad.

181
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,795
Hi.

182
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,861
Mmm, hey.

183
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,998
I am so sorry, you know I wanted
to go to your dad's funeral.

184
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,440
Oh, I know.

185
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,568
So, how are you two big
gay fag homos doing?

186
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,603
I think, uh, one gay slur
should cover it.

187
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,013
Uh, and we're sill incognito.

188
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,679
Oh. I don't know about you, Andy,
but I think it's time.

189
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,188
I think all parties have been
heard from now.

190
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,282
Bobby, I love you
like the sister I never had really,

191
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,453
but if you do not come out to
the boys up north this weekend.

192
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,963
I'm going to come up there
and out you myself.

193
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,556
Out, damn spot, out.

194
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,295
Yeah, if you can tell me how
to do it naturally.

195
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,633
We're going to be sitting there
watching the Cubs game.

196
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,901
Sosa hits one out of the park,
and as we're cheering,

197
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,407
I'm supposed to go, "Oh,
you guys hold on a second, um,

198
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,878
I love to suck cock."

199
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,436
Actually, love's a little strong.

200
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,081
Fuck off.

201
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,414
Why don't I come up there with you
and we can demonstrate it.

202
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,851
- Hello!
- Mm-hm.

203
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,285
Did you order soup?

204
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,913
Uh, no.

205
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,355
Uh, French toast.

206
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,949
- French toast?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,963
So, how'd you tell your family?

208
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,193
Actually, I didn't have to.

209
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,826
I did musical theatre
in high school.

210
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,530
Ah.

211
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,129
All that butter on it.

212
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,108
Hi.

213
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,374
You guys got money on this race?

214
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,611
I do, and a lot.

215
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,140
Who are you rooting for?

216
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,784
20 bucks.

217
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,789
I'm rooting for number two,
My Face.

218
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,257
- My Face?
- Yeah, but I tell you what.

219
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,283
If My Face wins, I will
buy drinks for you

220
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,559
and your girlfriends
all night long. All right?

221
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,895
It's gonna be a good one, too.

222
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,593
All right?

223
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,623
- Mm-hm.
- Check this out.

224
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,135
Let's go.
Come on, number two.

225
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,694
Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

226
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,000
- Come on.
- Come on.

227
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,131
Come on. Come on.

228
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,539
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

229
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,803
- Come on.
- Come on.

230
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,105
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah!

231
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,012
- Come on.
- Come on.

232
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,981
- Come on.
- Come on!

233
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,449
- Come on!
- Here we go. Come on!

234
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,418
Come along now. Here we go!
It's gonna be close.

235
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,648
Come on, My Face! Come on, My Face!

236
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,814
- Yes!
- Come on, My Face!

237
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,255
- Yes!
- Come on, My Face!

238
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,020
Come on, My Face!
Come on, My Face!

239
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,424
Whoo!

240
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,560
Uh... eww.

241
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,194
- What?
- What?

242
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,498
What? What?

243
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,061
Oh!

244
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,834
Well, fellas, you did it again.

245
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,864
Sir, thank you.

246
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,737
You know, I'm not really
a religious person,

247
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,474
but I got to think
that something like

248
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,880
somebody's sexuality's
got to be like kind of

249
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,646
an insignificant detail
up there in heaven.

250
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,016
I mean, if it's
even half the place

251
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,384
you people crack it up to be.

252
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,355
Yeah, no, it's a great place...

253
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,585
you know, for those people
that don't, uh...

254
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,561
sin against nature,
the Church, and God.

255
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,757
Mmm. Mmm.

256
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,631
I don't know. I...
I don't watch The 700 Club,

257
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,659
but... well, actually...
no, that's a lie,

258
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,931
I watch it for the hair.

259
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,370
Yeah, great hair.

260
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,204
But, I mean, didn't Jesus
hang out with, like, whores

261
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,142
and lepers and all
other types of scum?

262
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,042
I heard that rumor.

263
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,910
Well, I would think that...

264
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,280
at the very least being gay
falls into the category

265
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,252
of, you know, all
of other types of scum.

266
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,086
Kiss me, scum.

267
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,821
Everyone always wants to know,

268
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,094
when did I first
realize I was gay.

269
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,034
For me I knew I liked
the sweet contrast of soft lips

270
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,063
and bearded cheeks the first time
I kissed my Aunt Rose.

271
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,875
[Falsetto] Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

272
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,105
Go ahead.

273
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,444
Father, um, sometimes I...

274
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,746
I spy on my grandmother
taking a shower.

275
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,615
And my penis...

276
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,248
it shoots out straight
like a number two pencil.

277
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,882
And then I rub my penis,

278
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,688
rub it like I'm
trying to erase it,

279
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,025
rub, rub, rub, rub,
three men in a tub.

280
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,427
Rub, rub, rub.

281
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,761
A little privacy please.

282
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,925
I'm gonna kick
your fucking little ass.

283
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,457
I don't think priests
should be saying

284
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,094
fucking little ass these days.

285
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,729
Get out of here.

286
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,770
[Falsetto] Um, hi, Father, um,
I've got a question, Father.

287
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,305
When you touch me,
do I have to confess that

288
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,818
or is that something
you've got covered for me?

289
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,115
This has got to get old
for you guys.

290
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,645
No, it does not,
but I have a question.

291
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,555
What is the sense of having
a brother who's a priest

292
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,150
if he doesn't give us
any dirt once in a while?

293
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,592
Yeah!

294
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,463
Mrs. Dornhan can't say
no to the cable guy.

295
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,864
Oh, I knew it!

296
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,868
She's a dirty, dirty lady.

297
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,199
[Laughter]

298
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:03,427
[Laughter, indistinct chatter,
duck quacking]

299
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,534
Uh, I believe that's me.

300
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,203
[Laughter]

301
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,106
Where's your God now?

302
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,241
I got to cover your ass
every time.

303
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,339
Horse shit!

304
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,509
Consider it a donation
to the church.

305
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,782
Hey, I got a question
for the church.

306
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,686
Has Lisa
in the confessional...

307
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:35,285
ever confessed to,
uh, faking an orgasm with you?

308
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,592
When I get nervous,
my voice, it gets real high.

309
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,397
I'm afraid when I actually say,
"I'm gay," only dogs will hear me.

310
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,198
- No.
- Ha ha.

311
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,536
Thank God!

312
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,236
She has confessed to orgasming
to the thought of other men.

313
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,868
Motherfucker, that's mean shit.

314
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,674
I don't know what you're
laughing about.

315
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,271
Well, Carrie's very happy.

316
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,078
Yeah, if balls slappin'
against her taint feels good.

317
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,051
[Laughter]

318
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,485
The Irish inch
gets the job done.

319
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,853
I absolve you all of your sins.

320
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,415
Good night.
I'm going to bed.

321
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,984
[High voice]
Good night, Father Jack.

322
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,894
God, he sucks at cards.

323
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,127
Good God, he's never been good,
but this was terrible.

324
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,759
The Lord could help him.

325
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,398
I saw it once at the swim club,
it looked huge.

326
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,930
I was like seven years old,

327
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,205
and I was much more interested
in all that pubic hair.

328
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,237
Oh. Well, you know what I mean.

329
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,078
Well, you guys, you guys
are sitting here talking

330
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,880
about whether Dad passed on
the small weenie gene and that's OK.

331
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,716
I mention his pubic hair,
and I'm the asshole.

332
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,915
God damn it, every time.

333
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,186
I think it's time for me
to go to bed, pussy.

334
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,658
Besides, I don't
want to sit around

335
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,921
talking about Dad's weenie.

336
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,930
So, let's talk about you.

337
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,090
Thank you.

338
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,759
You gonna marry Carly
any time soon?

339
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,269
I'm thinking, no.

340
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,600
Oh, I love it.

341
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,936
Every time Lisa wonders
why I'm not as sweet as Bobby,

342
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,634
I just remind her how
your commitment phobia

343
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,233
keeps Carly hanging
on a string.

344
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,269
I'll give you a string
to hang on.

345
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,280
[Mumbling]

346
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,613
Hey, did she give you
the ultimatum yet?

347
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,414
I think I got that
the other night.

348
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,579
Good for her.

349
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,110
Whose side are you on?

350
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,486
She's a good girl, Bobby.

351
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,048
Oh, they're all whores
except Mom.

352
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,890
And Maggs.

353
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,327
Uh, um, hey!

354
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,297
Hey, I'm not saying
that Maggie's a whore.

355
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,062
I think she's more of
a victim of our times.

356
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,967
If she had been born
when mom was born,

357
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,130
she would've gotten married
instead of going to college,

358
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,608
which is key because, 'cause
college is just another word

359
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,078
for girl whore
making factory.

360
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,603
Ha ha.

Fellas, I'm gay.

362
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,511
Ah, it's got to be lower.

363
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,313
[Low voice]
Guys, I'm gay.

364
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,014
Oh, God, what am I gonna
do with my girls?

365
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,684
Looking' for an answer
here, boys.

366
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,316
Hey, I don't have daughters.

367
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,418
Why don't you check your weed
for the answer?

368
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,089
Actually, my weed guy
was all out,

369
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,429
but he gave me these mushrooms.

370
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,264
Never tried 'em but he said
they are good.

371
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,997
Care to partake?

372
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,006
I'm gonna skip.
Going to bed.

373
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,371
Connor?

374
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,002
Oh, man, I'm... I'm out.

375
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,103
All right, if you
guys come out here

376
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,445
and my pants are still
around my ankles,

377
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,007
just give me the courtesy of
throwing a blanket over me.

378
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,712
- Good night.
- Good night.

379
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,549
Oh, they taste like crap.

Get the fuck out of here,

383
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,536
- What is that?
- Fuck off!

384
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,198
What the fuck!
Get the fuck out of my house!

385
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,366
Fuck you, you fuckin' animal!

386
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,534
You think you can
fuckin' come here

387
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,702
and piss all over
my dad's house?

388
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,802
Luke! Luke! Luke!

389
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,107
Fuck me!
If my dad were here,

390
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,272
he'd fucking kick your ass!

391
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,872
- Come on down from there, Luke.
- Fuck off!

392

Fucking shit!

393
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,877
It's fucked up.
What are you doing, Jack?

394
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,216
We're going to get
down off the bed.

395
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,413
- Let's go.
- Ow, fuck.

396
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,682
Come on.
Down off the bed.

397
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,383
OK! Fuck off!

398
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,824
It's OK. He's gone.
You did a great job.

399
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,885
We're got to set up a 24-hour
watch, make sure that fucker

400
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,396
doesn't come back,
try to pee on this house.

401
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,727
- I'll get the next watch.
- Kick ass.

Come on, let's go to bed.

403
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,392
If you can't catch him, Jackie,

404
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,493
maybe you can keep
him out of heaven, OK?

405
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,060
- Maybe I can...
- 'Cause I don't want him.

406
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,071
Ha ha ha.

407
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,572
- Fuck off!
- Shh!

408
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,235
I don't want him, you know,
buggin' Mom and Dad.

409
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,743
This is bad enough
pissing on the house.

410
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,040
- Bad. It's bad.
- Kick ass.

Come on.
Let's go to bed.

I know, I know.
I love you, too.

413
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,407
Come on, let's go to bed.

414
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,575
If it was your dad,
you'd be pissed.

415
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,914
- Let's go to bed.
- I'm sorry, man.

416
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,078
- Would you guys shut up?
- Don't be sorry, man.

417
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,245
I love you. You're OK.

418
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,447
Good job there, Luke.

00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,581
Good night, you guys.
I love you.

420
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,091

Here, um, you take care of that.

00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,091

do with this?

I can't find shit in here.

425
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,260
I didn't do it, though.

426
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,429
You never do it.

427
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,995
Hey, someone's been messing
with my line.

428
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,131
It wasn't me.

429
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,141

Did you tell them?

433
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,277
Hey, hey, Maggs.

435
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,810
You didn't tell them.

436

Oh, you are such a pussy.

437
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,185

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

444
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,460
You didn't tell her
about last night.

445
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,331
Uh, she sounded
a little preoccupied.

446
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,200
It's probably that douchebag
boyfriend of hers

447
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,295
bitching about something.

448
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,305
Ah, he's all right.

449
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,465
I don't like him either.

450
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,906
Ooh, an opinion.

451
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,876
An opinion from the politician finally.

452
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,377

Oh, no, no, no, it's OK,
start without me.

That's great!

458
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,344
I think we did start
without you.

459
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,480
I think so.

460
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,955
We thought you needed some sleep
there, big boy.

461
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,321
I got a good night's sleep.
I'm OK.

a good night sleep.

even smoke anymore.

I don't think mushrooms
are the answer, my friend.

You don't have any answers, man.

for breakfast?

the Palsners' new boat?

I think our fishing's
screwed over there

'cause of the sand bar
counter tide.

Why are you so interested?

I'll talk to you later. OK?

525
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,213
How are things with Gary?

526
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,976
I think I'm gonna break up
with him.

527
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,210
Good for you!

528
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,650
Yeah, well, somebody's
got to be tough.

529
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,710
You OK?

530
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,813
Yes. Stay focused
on yourself, all right?

531
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,381
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

532
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,392
[Beep]

533
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,519
[Beep]

534
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,376
(music) The silence
I've been feelin' (music)

535
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,713
(music) Is runnin' through my mind (music)

536
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,716
(music) There lies a new horizon (music)

537
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,193
(music) Can you help me
find the way... (music)

538
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,753
- Jack! Jack!
- Wait up! Wait up!

539
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,264
Jack, wait up, Jack!

540
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,061
Whoa!

541
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,591
Jack! Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

542
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,864
Another perfect
job there, buddy.

543
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:06,871
Thank you.

544
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,872
My, uh...

545
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,033
Perfectly done, son.

546
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,043
Have you ever been
on a boat before?

547
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,477
I have spent many hours
on a boat.

548
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,413
Uh, yeah.

549
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,883
Hey, you notice the lights
on over at the Avery's?

550
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,220
Well, Mr. And Mrs. Avery
are in Europe until October,

551
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,249
which means it's Holly.

552
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,729
As in make me jolly by
sucking on my lolly Holly.

553
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,731
I remember.

554
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,232
You guys coming in?

555
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,132
I think we're going to hang out
here a little bit.

556
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,692
I hope you didn't
notice the lights on

557
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,432
over at the Avery house.

558
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,731
Oh, that guy's a jackass.

559
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,735
I think he's trying
to watch a ball game.

560
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,236
I got a ball game for her.

561
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,999
[Laughter]

562
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,837
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

563
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,274
OK. OK.

564
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,107
To the bedroom.

565
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,613
How do you know?

566
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,308
Lucky guess.

567
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,777
How many hours
have you logged here?

568
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,687
A man needs a place to think.
Ha ha ha ha!

569
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,993
Shh!

570
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,496
No, come on.

571
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh, yeah!

572
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,301
You're angry at him, aren't you?

573
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,469
Come on, let me see.

574
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,841
Take it out on yourself.

575
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,505
- I can't see.
- Yeah, you sure can't.

576
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,037
Oh, my God!

577
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,777
That little bra's
constricting your freedom,

578
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,479
isn't it, sweet pea?
You can take that right off.

579
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,645
Come to Papa.

580
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,048
[Chuckles]

581
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,490
Not bad, huh?

582
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,856
Hey, she looks pretty good.

583
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,951
Yeah, she might
have gained a pound.

584
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,657
I won't ask how you know that.

585
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,632
Ha ha ha. That's right.
You like the cream warm.

586
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,294
Don't you, sweetheart?

587
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,432
I know this is pathetic,

588
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,602
spying on a girl like this,

589
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,736
but you gotta understand,

590
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,077
I was a voyeur long
before I knew I was gay.

591
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,209
It's really the only thing
me and my brothers are good at.

592
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,949
She's completely shaven.

593
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,019
I think she's a swimmer.

594
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,052
Hey, where's she going?

595
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,394
- She's leaving.
- Fuck!

596
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,024
Maybe she's getting a vibrator.

597
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,535
Has she done that before?

598
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,299
This is where fantasy
and reality often collide.

599
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,569
OK, she's back.

600
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,069
Ooh, I think she saw me.

601
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,716
Oh, sweet Jesus!

602
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,311
Yeah, get ready
to lay down on the bed

603
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,618
and tickle yourself,
you naughty girl.

604
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,715
- I can't see.
- That's right. You can't.

605
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,055
Holy fuck!

606
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,526
All right, you've been
there enough, just let me...

607
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,892
- Just give me...
- Let me fucking look!

608
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,157
Did you just fucking push me?

609
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,164
- Yes.
- Motherfucker.

610
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,426
'Cause you're not moving.

611
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,457
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, fucking spy.

612
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,559
I'll fuck you up.

613
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,069
Yeah, I want to see!

614
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,731
Shh! Fucker!

615
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,206
I swear to God, I'll snap
your goddamn neck.

616
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,336
OK. Move the fuck over,
you son of a bitch.

617
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,016
[Bang]

618
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,813
- [Screaming]
- MAN: What the hell was that?

619
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,755
You OK?

620
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,155
WOMAN: Ohh.

621
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,819
Hi.

622
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,120
Mom and Dad have
gotta be looking down

623
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,630
beaming with pride
right about now.

624
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,723
Well, we wouldn't
have gotten caught

625
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,757
if you hadn't panicked
like a Nancy.

626
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,462
I'm the Sally here?

627
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,131
Hey, I went through that window
like I needed to see it.

628
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,705
All I saw was you on the ground
holding your knee crying.

629
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,768
All an act.

630
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,938
Holly is a fix-a-broken-wing
kind of girl.

631
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,777
She knew we were there.

632
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:14,444
She came back after calling
the cops just to keep us there.

633
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,818
That icy cold
exhibitionist whore!

634
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,516
She totally wanted me.

635
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,580
She doesn't even know you.

636
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,955
Oh, she knew me.

637
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,186
My name was danger.

638
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,661
And you, my friend
were the forbidden fruit,

639
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,496
double D, every woman's dream.

640
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,761
Are you kidding?

641
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,632
Luke thought she fell.

642
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,966
He was being selfless.

643
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:36,132
Father Jack, she was about to
fornicate with her boyfriend.

644
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,971
I was stopping her
from having premarital sex.

645
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,341
I was doing the Lord's work.

646
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,812
Hey, big of you to wear
the priest outfit.

647
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,212
It never hurts.

648
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,716
They're going
to drop the charges

649
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,047
if you guys apologize tonight.

650
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,609
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

651
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,553
Holly's so upset
she can't go to sleep.

652
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,816
She can't go to sleep

653
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,323
because she wants my cock
to tickle her ovaries.

654
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,203
Hey.

655
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,707
On behalf of my brothers.

656
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,848
You guys should be
ashamed of yourselves.

657
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,547
Holly tells me you have
two young daughters.

658
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,091
You're an embarrassment.

659
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,387
I am.

660
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,159
And you're a priest.

661
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,736
I'll be...

662
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,863
praying for them.

663
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,148
We're sorry.

664
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,420
Boo!

665
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,056
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

666
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,327
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on. Come on.

667
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,891
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey.

668
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,733
We... We should knock on the door
and do that again

669
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,897
and try it for real.

670
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,270
OK, OK.

671
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,767
So, that was good times.

672
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,972
Always good times
with my brothers.

673
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,175
Love good times.

674
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:02,277
Telling them I'm gay would
have been not good times,

675
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,447
which would be selfish of me.

676
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,548
It's not like
heterosexuals come out

677
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,617
and scream their
straightness to the world.

678
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,652
Don't judge me.

679
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,130
You can't even hold
my hand in public.

680
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,464
I'm Irish.

681
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,096
So am I.

682
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,039
I'm not talking
about some disgusting

683
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,803
amusement park make-out session.

684
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,471
I'm talking about
just that random kiss that...

685
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,344
Andy has a right
to be pissed at me,

686
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,542
but luckily he's a lawyer.

687
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,041
So, he sees things
logically, not emotionally.

688
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,612
We're committed and we're collaborative
and everything.

689
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,124
Maybe you find that boring,
I don't know.

690
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,490
But it's...

691
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,653
Ah, shit!

692
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,492
It's never happened
like this before.

693
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,988
All right, hugs and kisses
always gets him to stay.

694
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,028
L... I have to...

695
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,162
Come on.

696
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,001
I'm sorry.

697
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,973
Now, I'm gonna say
something stupid, really funny,

698
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,203
and you're gonna laugh and
we're gonna stay together, OK?

699
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,006
That's what we're gonna do here.

700
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,376
Now you're gonna make me cry.

701
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,778
Don't do that.

702
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,708
I love you, Bobby.

703
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,414
I'm concerned,
but I think I did it.

704
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,014
I think he's staying.

705
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,888
I'm money.

706
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,055
Good-bye.

707
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,069
I'm tired of being
in the closet.

708
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,542
I've become so detached
from my feelings

709
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,738
I'm not sure I can feel anymore.

710
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,438
For example, Andy
and I just broke up

711
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,882
and all I can think about is,

712
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,748
I've never been dumped before.

713
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,722
Technically, did
he really dump me?

714
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,820
It's not like he stopped loving
me or got bored of me.

715
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,730
It was my actions
that forced him to leave,

716
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,224
so in a sense,
I really dumped him.

717
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,067
Which means I win.

718
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,436
See what I mean?

719
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,412
If I really love Andy,

720
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,279
then why am I so relieved
that we broke up?

721
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,312
What do you think?

722
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,618
I, uh, I'm not usually
supposed to talk.

723
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,953
- But...
- We're all repressed.

724
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,425
Go ahead and speak.

725
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,724
The whole gay thing's
a little weird,

726
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,459
but... look, I really
can't talk, man.

727
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,296
Give me this.

728
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,734
Go ahead and speak.

729
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,765
All right.

730
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,369
You're fucked!

731
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,811
You got a guy...

732
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,943
person that loves you
completely and trusts you.

733
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,315
You're a tough guy to love

734
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,843
and instead of loving him
with all your heart,

735
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,946
all you're concerned about

736
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,786
is how your family's
gonna deal with it.

737
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,658
Look here, man,
fuck your cracker-ass family!

738
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,496
It ain't intended
for love to be hidden, man.

739
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,591
Have you looked in Andy's eyes?

740
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,531
Yeah, he's got real pretty eyes.

741
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,095
Yeah, you know,
they're all right.

742
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,128
They're cool.

743
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,435
He's got a really great body.

744
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,136
If you say so, man!

745
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,770
You know what I really love?

746
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,803
I love when we're alone.

747
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,907
We can sit in a room
together for hours

748
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,214
and we never have
to say a word

749
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,651
and don't feel uncomfortable,

750
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,053
like I need to fill
the air with words.

751
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,182
I'm so tired of being alone.

752
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,378
Someone tell you
that looks good?

753
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,251
Someone tell you
that dressing like a shlub

754
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,085
will convince people
you're not gay?

755
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,750
Why don't you say
that a little louder?

756
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,418
Oh, please.

757
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,428
Where's your suck-hole boyfriend?

758
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,123
We broke up.

759
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,127
What was it this time?

760
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,634
He wants to get married.

761
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,135
Maggs, you're almost 30.

762
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,967
And?

763
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,405
You've been datin' the guy off
and on for four years.

764
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,998
So, I should marry him out
of sympathy?

765
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,441
Is there a better reason?

766
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,910
You gonna stretch?

767
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,776
I think I'm gonna
pull something new.

768
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,542
Let's go.

769
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,151
So, uh, was he,
like, all dramatic?

770
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,919
Get on his knee.
Pull out the, uh, ring?

771
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,550
He's far too much
of a pussy for that.

772
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,790
Ha! He's so much better
off without you.

773
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,763
How could I possibly focus
on getting married

774
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,198
when I'm so preoccupied
with outing you?

775
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,633
About that.

776
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah, about that.

777
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,902
I think we should do it tomorrow
night at Mom and Dad's.

778
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,634
You know, we've got to split up
their stuff.

779
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,073
I don't know.

780
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,373
With Andy and I breaking up,
I just don't have the motivation.

781
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,473
Andy thought that would
be the motivation.

782
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,915
What?

783
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,215
Wasn't that a fabulous ass?

784
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,515
Oh, please.

785
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,920
Maggs, I'm different.
I've changed.

786
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,117
I don't even know if I'm gay.

787
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,092
Ha ha ha. Stop it.

788
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,788
You are so gay.
Don't worry about it.

789
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,072
I took a week off from work
due to my dad's death.

790
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,472
Perfect time to start a new job.

791
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,106
This is the perfect time
to start a new job.

792
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,443
These are my cameras.

793
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,472
I've been collecting them
for about 30 years.

794
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,608
- Beautiful!
- Yeah.

795
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,141
Love cameras.

796
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,312
I'm excited to have you here.

797
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,618
Ah, thank you.
I appreciate it.

798
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,784
So, I was talking
to your brother, Luke,

799
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,284
and, uh, he said
you weren't happy.

800
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,127
Bobby, I know we're
not as big here

801
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,497
as what you're used to over
at Fish, Vine and Rudolph,

802
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,230
but we're offering
you a partnership.

803
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,829
Thank you.

804
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,032
Uh, if you can just
give me a week.

805
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,064
I'll, uh, I'll have
an answer for you.

806
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,009
Fine. Take a week.
No problem.

807
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,477
I don't want to blow
smoke up your ass,

808
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,912
but you're about the most
talented young architect

809
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,972
I've ever met.

810
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,176
Thank you.

811
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:12,285
Speaking of blowing
smoke up somebody's ass.

812
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:16,453
Things still a little bit funny
over at Fish, Vine and Rudolph?

813
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,756
The nature of the business.

814
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,127
The nature of the business.

815
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,359
I'm only telling you this
because you're Luke's brother.

816
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,664
My two partners,
Charlie and Sam,

817
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,637
they're a little bit, uh, funny.

818
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:31,130
Look, don't get me wrong.
They're talented.

819
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,167
They're great,
but there's three partners here

820
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,473
and two of them
I feel have formed

821
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,845
some sort of gay alliance
against me.

822
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,407
I need somebody on my team.

823
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,511
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

824
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,513
I get along with those guys
great, professionally. Huh.

825
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,755
But I can't go out
for a beer with them.

826
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,285
OK?

827
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,991
You I can go out
for a beer with.

828
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,396
You're a beer guy.

829
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,866
You like beer don't ya, Bobby?

830
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,925
I'm Luke's brother.

831
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,196
You're Luke's brother.

832
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,033
You love beer.

833
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,664
Beer is in your blood.

834
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,040
You're probably drunk right now,
you crazy fuck.

835
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,537
All right, everything you need
to know, it's in here.

836
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,243
All right?
Take two weeks if you want to.

837
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,885
We want you here.

838
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,285
Thank you.

839
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,920
We'll see.

840
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,152
So, I got a plan how
we're gonna out you.

841
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,427
I knew I should've gone
with Judy's pizza.

842
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,432
I'm telling you if they
had had this technology

843
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,435
when Jesus was alive, there
would be no doubting Thomases.

844
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,437
I don't think this
is good for my diet.

845
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,836
And we're doing it tomorrow.

846
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,397
And I'm staying over tonight
so you don't chicken out.

847
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,671
I don't have any room
for you in my apartment.

848
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,873
Then I will share your bed.

849
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,710
That's a little weird.

850
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,444
So it is.

851
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,722
What do you think of this?

852
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,285
- I don't know.
- It's hip, it's cool, it's in.

853
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,296
- Really?
- He's a priest.

854
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,422
- He doesn't know.
- Ha ha ha.

855
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,795
Nice to have everybody here.

856
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,265
Another round?

857
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,927
Yeah.

858
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,300
You are never too
drunk to be pilfering

859
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,804
your dead parents' house
for goods.

860
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,237
Another round?

861
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,503
Any time I've had to make
a big decision in my life

862
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,009
I've blown it.

863
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:17,605
Melissa Shepherd's seventh-grade
pool party? I wore a USA Speedo.

864
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:22,483
For senior year prom I lathered
myself in fake tan bronzer.

865
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,819
The only parts of my body that
didn't turn freakishly orange

866
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,346
were the parts I missed.

867
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,859
So when Maggie
told me she had an idea

868
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,886
on how to tell the boys
I'm gay, I listened.

869
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,831
Her idea... pictures.

870
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,344
I'm not sure I've ever done
anything more stupid.

871
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,649
What are you trying to say?

872
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,850
That I'm gay.

873
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,187
Dude, you should have saved this
for April 1st.

874
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,955
If you are gay, this is
completely inappropriate.

and Mark about

of John's gospel

910

the large multitude

at the time decided to leave.

10 weeks early,

he was the father,

asking me a question like that.

Sadly I think you are
the only one.

1053
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,478
Now, of course, if this
were the Middle Ages,

and you and I were royals...

1055
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:18,010
Listen, I had to messenger
those slides over to Luke

'cause he still thinks
this whole thing is a joke.

1057

He's already seen 'em.

1058
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,652
I didn't want to take those
pictures and now all of a sudden

1059
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,889
I've got this random messenger
delivering naked pictures of me

1060
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,193
going to his office
for show and tell.

1061
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,098
Yeah, but you look really good
in that second one.

1062
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,030

Keeping a secret

What kind of prick are you?

1070
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,063

for you to confide in me?

what other lies you've got going on.

going to stand here

and listen
to a lecture from you.

1192
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,247

my stupid idea.

1193
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,720
That was a bad idea.

1194
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,188
It wasn't that bad of an idea.

all right?

this family together.

to tell you guys that.

00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,397
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi.

1210

- Mr. Burke.

- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

OK, kids, no surprises here.

1213
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,441
Your dad split up the estate
equally amongst the five of you.

1214
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,638
The house.

1215
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,976
The cottage.

1216
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,412
Life insurance.

1217
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,609
His personal assets.

1218
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,084
I've got something
printed for each of you,

1219
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,248
and he wrote something
himself for each of you.

1220
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,517
He wrote something?

1221
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,854
You're talking
about our dad, right?

1222
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,325
Yeah, I thought it was kind
of weird, too.

1223
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,793
Your dad never wrote me a note

1224
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,261
in the 25 years
I was his lawyer.

1225
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,161
Maybe his male nurse rubbed off
on him or something.

1226
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,935
Well, uh, if you
have any questions,

1227
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,632
feel free to call me. Otherwise,
it's pretty straightforward.

1228
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,438
- Take care.
- Yeah.

1229
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,609
Hey, I'll catch up
in a second, Bobby.

1230
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,278
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1231
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,308
So?

1232
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,678
So?

1233
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,323
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1234
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:13,954
Thanks again, Mr. Burke.

1235
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,465
You're welcome. Take care.

1236
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,126
Maggie?

1237
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,363
Yeah.

1238
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,633
There you go.

1239
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,470
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1240
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,469
What, did you pick
a public place

1241
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,166
'cause you thought
I'd beat you up?

1242
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,107
There's nobody here.

1243
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,238
Why'd you tell him?

1244
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,114
Bobby, everybody's got secrets.

1245
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,447
What's yours?

1246
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,151
That I can't keep them.

1247
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,449
Ahh.

1248
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,189
I'm sorry, all right?

1249
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,386
- You should be.
- I know.

1250
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,088
I know I shouldn't
have told him.

1251
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:29,428
It's just I can't keep
all this stuff bottled up.

1252
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,794
I guess we just ran out
of things to say.

1253
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,927
A lull in the conversation,

1254
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,632
and you fill it with,
"Hey, Dad, Bobby's gay."

1255
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,765
You know what, don't give me
any shit, all right?

1256
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,104
Screw you.

1257
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,609
I took a leave
of absence from my job,

1258
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,474
which, by the way,
I'm the youngest partner

1259
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,774
in that law firm's history,

1260
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,940
so that I could take care of him
everyday for two months.

1261
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,609
Who else did you tell?

1262
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,743
Nobody. Just Dad.

1263
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,918
I have a feeling he took it
to the grave.

1264
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,122
That's bad.

1265
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,957
Are you really mad at me?

1266
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,622
I should be.

1267
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,324
Don't get queeny.

1268
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,296
So, what did he say?

1269
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,297
Oh, now you want
to know what he said.

1270
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,367
Don't pull that bullshit.
Come on.

1271
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,002
Promise you won't be
mad at me anymore?

1272
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,137
No.

1273
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,772
Promise you'll still
tell me your secrets?

1274
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,248
You already said you
can't keep your secrets.

1275
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,513
So? I just have
to tell one person.

1276
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,543
I'll tell Aunt Rose, she's dying.

1277
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:27,055
[Chuckles]

1278
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,949
He was shocked.

1279
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,061
And when he realized that
I wasn't telling him a joke,

1280
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,963
he said, "Well, I would've
thought the three guys

1281
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,728
"would've been gay
before the kid.

1282
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,065
The kid's always been so tough."

1283
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,669
What else?

1284
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,039
He asked me what
I thought he should do.

1285
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,175
And?

1286
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,340
And then he laughed.

1287
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,680
About what?

1288
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,686
He told me the story about
how Mom had brought home

1289
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,188
a porno one time.

1290
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,690
God, I'd like to see that.

1291
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,021
Yeah.

1292
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,856
I guess Mom brought
home this porno

1293
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,886
and Dad was kind of nervous
about watching it,

1294
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,889
so Mom says, "When that
bedroom door is open,

1295
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,426
"I need you to be a shining
example of Catholicism,

1296
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,066
but when that door is shut,
I need you to be the devil."

1297
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,109
And then he said,

1298
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,741
"What people do behind closed doors
is their business."

1299
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,220
That's all he said?

1300
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,593
That's all.

1301
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:10,918
I don't think
we should've picked

1302
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,484
the Wiener Circle for this.

1303
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:16,760
No shit, but if I'm coming to
the north side, I'm coming here.

1304
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,960
I keep looking for a guy
in a masquerade outfit.

1305
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,595
I keep looking for a big cock.

1306
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,264
I don't think I can do this.

1307
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,035
You're the one that talked me
into this.

1308
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,200
Connor? Luke?

1309
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,904
Oh, hey. Andy. Yes.

1310
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:29,934
- Luke Riley.
- Connor.

1311
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:30,946
Good to meet you.

1312
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,447
- Riley.
- Got it.

1313
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,506
I'll get the dogs.

1314
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,449
All right.

1315
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,782
And then I'll get the cocks.

1316
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:37,979
Oh, great, thanks a lot.

1317
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,282
That's all I'm going
to be thinking about.

1318
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,584
Weird he noticed us from behind.

1319
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,989
Cheese? Cheese?

1320
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,426
So, how you doing?

1321
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,955
I'm good.

1322
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,797
How you doing?

1323
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,325
Good.

1324
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,161
Doing fine.

1325
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,635
So, how long you been gay?

1326
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,836
Well, that didn't
take long, did it?

1327
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,838
You like the Cubs?

1328
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,649
- No.
- I live for the Cubs.

1329
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,314
My grandmother loved the Cubs.
Never got to see 'em win a series.

1330
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,983
My father was
an Andy Frain last time

1331
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,458
they were in the series,
you know.

1332
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,518
Back in '45.

1333
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,828
So, what is it that
you do, Andy?

1334
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,834
I'm a lawyer.

1335
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,859
Oh, we should set
him up with Maggie.

1336
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,174
See, we don't leave Connor alone
with people very often.

1337
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,506
Too uncomfortable.

1338
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,672
So, have we seen you
in commercials?

1339
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,874
- No.
- But you're an actor?

1340
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,441
No, I'm a lawyer.

1341
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,782
A litigator.

1342
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,617
I went up against Maggie
during her first trial

1343
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,520
and that's how
I got to know Bobby.

1344
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,388
So, this is all Maggie's fault.

1345
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:54,761
And... Bobby was gay then?

1346
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:58,893
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1347
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:04,263
You guys... you guys don't know
any gay men, do you?

1348
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,534
I've seen Will & Grace
a few times.

1349
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,204
I mean, Carrie has it on.

1350
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,440
Did you know that funny gay guy,
he was from Chicago?

1351
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,209
Hmm.

1352
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,877
And you guys had no idea
that Bobby was gay?

1353
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:22,251
And what did you hope to
accomplish with this meeting?

1354
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,888
Look, I don't want to make you guys
feel uncomfortable but...

1355
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,263
Too late.

1356
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,200
But...

1357
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,932
I'm in love with your brother.

1358
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,576
Oh, man, I never thought
I would hear that one.

1359
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,271
Look, I don't want to seem rude,

1360
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,973
but it seems like you
guys don't understand

1361
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,574
how wonderful Bobby is.

1362
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:50,051
Wonderful sounds so...

1363
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,212
Gay.

1364
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,619
Yeah.

1365
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,425
Look, Bobby's the same guy
he's always been.

1366
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,585
He loves his sports.

1367
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,753
He loves the Cubs.

1368
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,762
He loves the Broncos.

1369
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:01,922
BOTH: Bears.

1370
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,625
Look, yes.

1371
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,896
The Bears and, uh...

1372
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,927
So, Bobby's the straightest
gay guy in Chicago?

1373
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,802
It's like being
the smartest retard.

1374
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,943
Well, Bobby doesn't get his wit
from the wind, huh?

1375
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,444
Or his big dick?

1376
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,379
Ha ha.

1377
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,314
Uncomfortable.

1378
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,611
You just made a retard joke
and that's OK?

1379
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,621
I make the big dick joke
and I'm an asshole?

1380
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,122
Do you see any retards here?

1381
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:31,490
Hey, guys, you shouldn't make
an asshole joke around me.

1382
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,620
I'm kidding.

1383
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,652
[Laughter]

1384
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,060
He got you there.

1385
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,000
Yeah, I'm gonna check
on those dogs.

1386
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,025
- OK.
- Yeah.

1387
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,075
So, Bobby has no idea
that we're meeting, huh?

1388
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,204
Well, I'm happy to answer
any questions you've got,

1389
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,115
but I really think
you should be talking to Bobby.

1390
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,676
And don't hate me,

1391
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,713
but the other night you left
a message on Bobby's machine

1392
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,055
and I erased it...

1393
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,926
before Bobby had a chance
to hear it.

1394
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,363
Thank you.

1395
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,361
OK, here we go.

1396
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,332
Now...

1397
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,435
how much of this do you
think I can get all the way

1398
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,003
down my throat
without gagging?

1399
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,912
I'm kidding.

1400
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,186
Luke and Connor
are quite strange.

1401
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,821
What? Did you just read that?

1402
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,990
No, I met with them yesterday.

1403
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,868
At their request.

1404
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:48,733
At the Weiner Circle.

1405
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,897
- How subtle of them.
- Hmm.

1406
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,772
You know, I think in their
own little way, though,

1407
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,074
that they're OK with you now.

1408
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,881
Oh, and I've been
working on our vows.

1409
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,082
Bobby?

1410
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,717
Hey, Bobby.

1411
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,920
- Hey, how are ya?
- Charlie. How are you?

1412
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,394
Good to see ya.

1413
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,794
When I didn't hear from ya,
I thought you got a better offer.

1414
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,058
- Yeah.
- No, not at all.

1415
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,395
- So...
- Please sit down.

1416
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,298
All right, great.

1417
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,735
Uh, I just wanted
to check in with you guys

1418
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,295
and make sure the offer's still good.

1419
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,636
- You bet.
- Absolutely.

1420
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,800
Great. Before I say yes,

1421
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,036
I just need to tell you something.

1422
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,066
OK.

1423
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,408
I'm gay.

1424
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,710
Bobby, you don't need to share
that with us.

1425
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,409
Your personal life is your own.

1426
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,747
Appreciate that.

1427
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,582
I just wanted to tell you,
so it wouldn't be a problem.

1428
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,588
Not a problem!

1429
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,114
Please! We welcome that here.

1430
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,251
All right, great.

1431
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,658
I can't tell you how excited I am.

1432
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,753
I'll give my old job two weeks

1433
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,992
and then if I can start here
on the 1st, that'd be great.

1434
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,000
- Sounds great.
- The 1st it is!

1435
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,592
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

1436
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,103
- All right, partner.
- Thank you, Charlie.

1437
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,297
- I appreciate it.
- Congratulations.

1438
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:57,430
Hey, hey.

1439
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,271
I'd still love to have beers with ya.

1440
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,435
You bet!

1441
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,603
Beers!

1442
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,839
You bet.

1443
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,073
Thanks, guys,
I'm gonna get back there

1444
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:06,741
and act like I'm, uh,
you know, still working

1445
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,147
and, uh, I'll see ya in two.

1446
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,084
- See ya soon.
- All right, partner.

1447
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,349
All right, congratulations.
Good job.

1448
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,482
Believe me, you guys had more
to do with it than me.

1449
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,118
You and your little community.

1450
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,787
[Laughter]

1451
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,490
All right, boys, these two
are on the house.

1452
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,930
Hey, thank you.

1453
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,126
You're welcome.

1454
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,533
Your dad is really going
to be missed around here.

1455
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,935
Thank you.
What's your name?

1456
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,700
- I'm Jerry.
- Jerry, Luke, Connor.

1457
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:31,797
You're new.

1458
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,742
I am, but my brother Larry
used to work here.

1459
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,176
Long Dong Larry.

1460
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,203
Hey, how is Long Dong doing?

1461
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,578
He's good. He's fine.

1462
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,877
You should have a drink with us.

1463
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,578
- I probably shouldn't.
- Quick, quick, quick one.

1464
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,521
- There you go.
- You and you and me.

1465
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,649
- To Dad.
- To Dad.

1466
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,023
To your dad.

1467
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,288
Hmm, and hot chicks.

1468
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,492
Oh, yes.

1469
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,764
Oh, wait, wait, to obligatory
marriage sex on Saturday night.

1470
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,202
It's all we got.

1471
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,343
All right, where's Long Dong?

1472
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,777
Long Dong was raising
fighting roosters in Puerto Rico

1473
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,804
for a while and
then he developed

1474
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,681
a bizarre lung disease,
so we're not quite sure

1475
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:16,616
what's going on with him.

1476
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,846
- You said cock fighting?
- Yeah.

1477
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,184
- That sucks.
- In Puerto Rico?

1478
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,347
Yeah.

1479
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,686
He thought it was the
other kind of cock fighting,

1480
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,214
but he still stayed
in Puerto Rico.

1481
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,357
Did you inherit your brother's
long dong?

1482
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,457
Oh, you did!

1483
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,195
Here's to inheriting
the long dong!

1484
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,532
I'll drink to that.

1485
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,299
Ireland is a cold country,
we got the Irish curse.

1486
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,532
To the angry inch!

1487
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,540
All right!

1488
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,166
Please.

1489
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,699
Hmm.

1490
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:45,373
Here's to having a gay brother
who would love your long dong!

1491
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,382
Hee hee.

1492
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,214
It's late. I got to go.

1493
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,879
Another brother.

1494
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,583
I got to clean up.

1495
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:55,885
We got two.

1496
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,587
One's a priest. And one's gay.

1497
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,091
Three hours of toasting
and you got to go gay?

1498
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,067
I thought we were all drunk enough.

1499
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:09,901
Look, look, I'm not...
I'm not good with words.

1500
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:13,602
You got a lot of love, buddy.
You make up for it in love.

1501
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,076
Dad mention anything to you
in his letter?

1502
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,081
What?

1503
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:21,673
Maggie's got a big mouth.

1504
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,082
What?
What did she tell him?

1505
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,746
She said I was addicted
to internet porn.

1506
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:26,982
It's not funny.

1507
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,580
- It's funny.
- It's not...

1508
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,923
Well, Dad... it's OK with Dad.

1509
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,758
She told him I was a pothead.

1510
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,097
Oh, what a bitch.

1511
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,963
Is nothing sacred?

1512
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,704
He wrote the most
beautiful thing, though.

1513
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,970
Yeah, me, too.

1514
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,974
So unlike Dad.

1515
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,911
You know, two hours
of surfing porn a night

1516
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,507
doesn't constitute
an addiction.

1517
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,111
You keep telling yourself
that, buddy.

1518
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,450
You're really going
to go cold turkey?

1519
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,820
Hmm, yep.

1520
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,654
You want a computer?

1521
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,489
You want a half-pound bag?

1522
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,627
Dad mention anything
to you about Bobby?

1523
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,136
I was just thinking that, uh...

1524
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,297
you know, if Dad's OK with it,
who the hell are we?

1525
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,966
Yeah.

1526
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:24,002
Man, I never knew Dad was
so, uh... sensitive.

1527
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,074
- A strange man.
- Strange man.

1528
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,015
Good man.

1529
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,253
- To you, my brother.
- To you, brother.

1530
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,952
Hey, here's to Dad.

1531
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,166
To Dad.

1532
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,372
Go long! Go long!

1533
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,435
I'm open! I'm open!

1534
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,809
Thank you.

1535
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,711
Give it back. Come on.

1536
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,176
Here he is!
Here he is!

1537
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,514
There's the man!

1538
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,576
Playground closed?

1539
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,020
Yes, you're late for the alternative
altar-boy competition.

1540
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,182
There's a lot of horny kids
in there.

1541
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,190
What's going on?

1542
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,192
I came to return the tie
I borrowed.

1543
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,420
Thank you.

1544
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,656
I forgot it.

1545
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,427
And I just wanted
to, uh, let you know

1546
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,197
that I had the pictures checked out,
and they're real.

1547
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,534
Of course they are.

1548
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,062
I just want to confirm that.

1549
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,377
Luke and I met Bobby's, uh,
what do you call him?

1550
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:30,378
- Boyfriend.
- Yes.

1551
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,538
- Lover.
- Yes.

1552
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,879
- Fudge packer.
- Partner.

1553
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,043
Luke and I, we liked him.

1554
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,382
I'm sure he's a nice guy.

1555
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,546
He is.

1556
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,580
Jack, come on we're not
going to be singing Kumbaya

1557
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,387
with his friends or anything,
but you know...

1558
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,951
You know, if you guys
are expecting me

1559
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:50,123
to jump on the bandwagon with this,
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1560
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:53,066
Oh, come on.
Half the priesthood's gay.

1561
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,069
So?

1562
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,400
Oh, it's OK for them?

1563
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:58,065
You guys have some idea
that being a priest means

1564
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,234
I'm a catechism robot.

1565
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,640
That I can just
extinguish my feelings

1566
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,702
for some strict
interpretation of the rules.

1567
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,112
- Yes.
- Well, here's a funny rule for ya.

1568
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,548
Homosexuality is not wrong
in the eyes of the church.

1569
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,246

01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,637
You forgot to, uh, bless yourself
with the holy water.

1744
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,872
Hey, kid, the holy water
cleanses you

1745
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,078
with the grace
of the Holy Spirit.

1746
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:34,979
So, there you have it.

1747
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,314
My gay Chicago story.

1748
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,944
Now, if my life were a movie,

1749
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:41,148
I'd probably cue
some cool music.

1750
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,178
[Music playing]

1751
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,157
And show some people loving me.

1752
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,352
Like my co-workers.

1753
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,485
That's something to celebrate!

1754
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,894
Good for you! [Mouths]

1755
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,124
And my family.

1756
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,498
[Music drowning out dialogue]

1757
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:54,661
And of course Andy.

1758
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,297
Everyone here knows
you're gay anyway, Bobby!

1759
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,364
Everybody knows.
It's in your little walk.

1760
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,874
They see it.

1761
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:06,404
Andy's therapist would tell me
that my life isn't a movie...

1762
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,348
that everybody doesn't love me.

1763
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,851
I don't save the day,
I don't get the guy,

1764
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:15,015
and I most definitely don't
ride off into the sunset.

1765
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,354
Andy's therapist...

1766
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,724
he can go fuck himself.

1767
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,408
OK, see ya next week.

1768
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,981
OK, I got to tell you a secret.

1769
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,549
Don't tell anyone.

1770
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,254
When I was in high school,

1771
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,091
I learned how
to forge Dad's handwriting.

1772
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,654
You know, so I could
write myself notes

1773
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,223
to get out of class.

1774
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,236
You know those letters
the boys got in the will?

1775
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,068
Yeah, Dad didn't write those.

1776
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:07,938
I did.

1777
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,874
All right, bye.

1778
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,295
(music) Yeah (music)

1779
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,246
(music) Well, the wrecks,
toss and mix (music)

1780
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,877
(music) This old wheel keeps spinning round (music)

1781
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,285
(music) Get your kicks, take my licks (music)

1782
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,915
(music) This whole deal is lost and found (music)

1783
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,289
(music) No surprise, tell me lies (music)

1784
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,920
(music) I've been down this hole before (music)

1785
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:43,294
(music) Criticize, apologize (music)

1786
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:46,494
(music) Try to quit but I need more (music)

1787
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,729
(music) And I'm two steps
closer to midnight (music)

1788
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,330
(music) And I'm not turning blue (music)

1789
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,966
(music) I'm two steps
closer to midnight (music)

1790
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,476
(music) A stranger in my shoes (music)

1791
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:59,002
(music) You know I do it all right (music)

1792
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,413
(music) If I knew just what to do (music)

1793
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,145
(music) Well, I'm two steps
closer to midnight (music)

1794
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:07,780
(music) I wish I was,
I wish was with you (music)

1795
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,757
(music) Flip the bird, thin the herd (music)

1796
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,462
(music) I don't need it anymore (music)

1797
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,766
(music) Speak the word,
feel absurd (music)

1798
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:26,000
(music) It's all coming true (music)

1799
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,942
Oh, hey, you think
I forgot about you guys?

1800
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:33,311
So, yeah, I'm gay.

1801
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,442
And the problem with making
the movie of my gay life

1802
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:38,281
is there won't be any action.

1803
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:39,752
No stunts.

1804
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:41,778
Like a gay Fie Hard.

1805
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:44,815
Now that'd be good,
but you try raising money

1806
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:46,292
for Raider's of the Lost Ark

1807
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,919
meets Billy's First Hollywood Kiss.

1808
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:51,295
So settle for two guys
talking about their feelings

1809
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,993
in a gay artsy way.

1810
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:54,865
No stunts.

1811
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:58,967
Ninjas!

1812
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,832
[Grunting]

1813
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:24,758
The actor playing Bobby
couldn't do this stunt.

1814
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,994
That's why I'm here
to finish his dialogue.

1815
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:30,664
The penis is a very wonderful
and tasty appendage.

1816
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:33,230
- I can't say this shit!
- [Horn blaring]

1817
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:34,536
Ohh!

1818
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:42,381
Hoo!

1819
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,381
{{{the end}}}
