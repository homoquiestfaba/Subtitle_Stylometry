4
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:49,776
[Abigail] You ready?

5
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:54,346
[Eugene] Oh Barb, give
it a fucking rest, please.

6
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,716
[Barbara] I swear to God
if I didn't have these kids,

7
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,652
I would jump out of
this car right now.

8
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,821
[Eugene] Go ahead, don't
let me stop you, woman.

9
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,691
[Barbara] Stop
the fucking car.

10
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,224
Just once, just once.

11
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:08,326
How does it do it, Nathan?

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,762
What do you mean?

13
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,766
How does the moon
stay in the same place

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,567
while we're moving?

15
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,236
It's so big, sis.

16
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,641
It's just that big.

17
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:22,541
[Eugene] Oh, there it was.

18
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:24,744
- I'm in, I lost.
- He's doing it again.

19
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:27,714
[Eugene] God, you're such
a selfish you know what.

20
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:29,414
Starts with a C.

21
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,818
[wind howling]

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,890
[Abigail] You guys,
that's not where that goes.

23
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:41,761
[Peter] And up and
over and side to side.

24
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,663
Can I get some more
helping hands, please?

25
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,898
[Peter] Abby, this is a
very important achievement.

26
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:46,999
- Of course.
- What are we gonna do?

27
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,835
You know what else is doable?

28
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,402
We're gonna feed the chicken.

29
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:51,470
- Feed the chicken.
- Okay,

30
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:52,705
final hugs for dad.

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,876
Hugs, hugs.

32
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,577
Great.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,312
All right, outside to play.

34
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,279
I don't want to.

35
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:02,014
Excuse me?

36
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,281
There's nothing to do.

37
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,050
Are you kidding me?

38
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,785
When I was your age,

39
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,054
I didn't have any of those
jungle gym, fancy things.

40
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,722
I mean-

41
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,456
- You want us to have the
same crappy childhood you had?

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,358
Really? [laughing].

43
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:14,927
- Don't encourage it.
- Abigail, it's fine.

44
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:15,862
Relax.

45
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:18,430
"Abigail, it's fine, relax."

46
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,867
All right guys outside,
I will call you later.

47
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,535
You know,

48
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,370
can you grab that bookcase
at the top of the stairs

49
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,605
that you've been
meaning to grab?

50
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,708
Because Davis really
wants it at your house

51
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,609
and it's heavy and
taking up space,

52
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,712
and also uniforms,
softball uniforms.

53
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:33,846
[phone ringing]
If you got a pair,

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,480
then I wouldn't have to be
washing them all the time.

55
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:36,314
[Peter] I will do
the bookcase next time.

56
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:37,582
Oh, can't talk to Mom.

57
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,785
Ab, I will do the
bookcase next time.

58
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:39,919
I'm kind of in a rush.

59
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,320
You just did 25 minutes
of handshakes with the boys,

60
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:43,689
you can't take,

61
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:44,489
- [Peter] Abigail.
[phone ringing]

62
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:45,423
Okay, fine.

63
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,560
Oh, look at that,
it's your mom.

64
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:49,962
Nope.

65
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:51,764
I take it you still
haven't spoken to her

66
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,800
about not calling me as
if we aren't divorced.

67
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,634
I forgot.

68
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,600
I'll get to it.

69
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,501
- Please do.
- Mm hm.

70
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:59,437
[phone ringing]

71
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,973
God, relentless.

72
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:02,607
Hey, bye, good luck with that.

73
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:03,676
Mom.

74
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:04,744
[Barbara] I have to
tell you about the pillow.

75
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:05,978
No, no, Ma.

76
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,113
I can't talk about
pillows right now.

77
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,480
I just got the boys back and
we're getting settled in.

78
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,016
Okay, okay, okay.

79
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,954
But we should talk because,
interesting, Dad fell again.

80
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:15,922
Again?

81
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,023
Is he okay?

82
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,490
Yes, he's okay.

83
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:21,393
Why do you sound so
annoyed, Abigail?

84
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,129
Oh, also interesting,

85
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,565
he almost drowned during
his pool therapy session,

86
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,000
so that might've made
him out of sorts.

87
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,468
Mom, what do you
mean almost drowned?

88
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,336
Yeah.

89
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:34,140
- Yeah?
- What?

90
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,374
I said almost.

91
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,711
He's on the floor
and can't get up.

92
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:39,946
Interesting.

93
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,580
- What?
- Well, he's comfortable.

94
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,883
Do you think I would leave
him there if he wasn't?

95
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,985
Ma, how long has he
been on the floor for?

96
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,553
A few hours, maybe more.

97
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,422
What do you think,
I'm a monster?

98
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:51,423
Ma.

99
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,827
Boys, get inside the house.

100
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,095
- Hi, JD.
- Hi, JD.

101
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,898
[Barbara] Hey, boys,
I've got ice cream.

102
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,067
Mom, they don't
need ice cream.

103
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,468
Abigail, I raised
two children.

104
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,872
Do you think I don't know
how to feed children?

105
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:08,074
It'd just be nice if
you asked me

106
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,942
before you pumped
my kids with sugar.

107
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,911
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

108
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,179
What's going on here?

109
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,780
Well, I was trying to
sit down and I missed it.

110
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,015
I see that.

111
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:16,949
Let me help you.

112
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,617
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

113
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,552
[Barbara] Careful, Abigail,
you'll get another hernia.

114
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:21,787
I'm fine, Mom.

115
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,688
I'm okay.

116
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:24,623
Here, you could-

117
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,925
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

118
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,959
Okay.

119
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,027
- Yup.
- Yeah.

120
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:30,830
How's that?

121
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,098
Feel balanced?

122
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:33,065
Will you sit on
the couch with me?

123
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,033
- Of course.
- Thanks.

124
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,038
Sometimes I,

125
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,407
I can't,

126
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:45,111
I can't get my balance.

127
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,716
I don't know what's going on.

128
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,019
That's what we're
trying to figure out

129
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,186
with the doctors, okay?

130
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:57,622
Get everything moving
the way you want it to.

131
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:58,490
Okay.

132
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:01,827
How was pool therapy?

133
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,929
Oh, well I...

134
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,101
Abby, I couldn't feel my feet.

135
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,104
Never happened to me before.

136
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,011
[sighing] I felt like
I was falling backwards

137
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:22,048
and then I tried to right myself

138
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:27,019
and I just kind of
tumbled in the pool.

139
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:28,821
Okay.

140
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,791
Ma really shouldn't
be leaving you.

141
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,159
Oh no, no, no.

142
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,528
Don't, don't, don't
be hard on her.

143
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,764
She's doing a
terrific job, Abby.

144
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:42,635
Abby, she is the best
wife anyone could have.

145
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,170
Okay.

146
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,077
Have you told your
brother about me?

147
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,046
Euge, he doesn't give a shit.

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,114
Ma.

149
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,583
- You can tell me.
- I know.

150
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,920
I just, I haven't
really said much to him

151
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,722
in the last couple of years.

152
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,824
He's a son of a bitch.

153
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:06,225
Ma.

154
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,860
I'll be right back, hold on.

155
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:11,630
You are not helping.

156
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,266
Well, when you've had your
son cut you out of their life

157
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,070
for 20 years, then you can
tell me how to do this.

158
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,105
- Hey, Hey.
- Yeah,

159
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,172
- what, honey?
- No, no,

160
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:21,207
I want Abby.

161
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,642
Ah.

162
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:24,977
Okay then.

163
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,712
Knock yourself out.

164
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,546
[solemn music]

165
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,082
- This isn't me.
- I know.

166
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,120
[Eugene sighing]

167
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,587
I love you.

168
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,621
Thank you.

169
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,025
[Eugene sighing]

170
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,292
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

171
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:43,996
[Barbara] Eugene, I'm home.

172
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,768
Yoohoo, where are you?

173
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,002
Be right there, Barb.

174
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,052
[door slamming]

175
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,153
- [Abigail] Who do I love?
- Us.

176
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,220
Who tastes like sugar?

177
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,155
We are.

178
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:10,089
All right.

179
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,258
[speaking in foreign language]

180
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,295
[all speaking foreign language]

181
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,104
Perfect.

182
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:25,971
Good night.

183
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,139
I love you.

184
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,606
- Love you.
- Good night.

185
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,009
Good night, Mama.

186
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,977
Good night, Grape.

187
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:32,878
Say good night to Matthew.

188
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,313
Good night Matthew.

189
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,181
All right.

190
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:39,285
- Night.
- Night, mama.

191
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,120
See you in the morning.

192
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,759
Sweet dreams.

193
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:54,066
[trimmer whirring]

194
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,310
Boys, breakfast.

195
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:08,814
- Ew.
- Here you go.

196
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,216
What's that smell?

197
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,884
Is something burning, Mom?

198
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,152
Oh, shit.

199
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:14,220
It's the sausage.

200
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,254
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

201
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,322
God dammit.

202
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:19,959
Language, Mama.

203
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:22,928
I mean, you don't need that.

204
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,263
You don't need that.

205
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,231
You have beautiful
pancakes and strawberries

206
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,900
with lots of anti-oxidants,
great for you.

207
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,834
- Eat.
- Mama,

208
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,369
what's that beep, beep, beeping?

209
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:31,804
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

210
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:32,972
Banana bread.

211
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,173
- Banana bread.
- Remember last week

212
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,241
when you burnt it?

213
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,276
Burned it, not burnt it.

214
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,445
Daddy never burns breakfast.

215
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,347
[sighing] Well, can
Dada make banana bread

216
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,349
that's beautiful like this?

217
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,216
[Both] Yes.

218
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,787
[knocking on door]

219
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:49,855
- Hi.
- Morning.

220
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:50,723
Come on in.

221
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,093
Banana bread?

222
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,261
Fresh out of the oven.

223
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,829
- Oh no, I'm good.
- Hey, that's for us.

224
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:57,696
Shut it.

225
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,999
No, I'm good, thank you.

226
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,001
I need the garage clicker.

227
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:04,036
Oh yeah, of course.

228
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,404
Of course, where is it?

229
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,040
One of those things
that, you know,

230
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,375
you should really put in
a safe place every time,

231
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,911
'cause that is
where you find it.

232
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:12,778
But um,

233
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:14,813
- ow.
- Careful.

234
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,414
That's sharp.

235
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,815
I'm fine, really.

236
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:18,918
Right here.

237
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:19,885
Here you go.

238
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,253
Thanks.

239
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,388
- Great.
- I'll be working

240
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,989
on the fountain if you need me.

241
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,825
Of course.

242
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,228
[door clicking]

243
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,729
[Davis clearing throat]

244
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,933
What?

245
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,334
[Peter] Hey, Daddy's here.

246
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,202
Oh.

247
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,104
You're early.

248
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:40,439
[Both] Dada.

249
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:42,308
- [Peter] Traffic was light.
- Mmm.

250
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:43,809
Did you boys do your homework?

251
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,010
- Course it was.
- Did you practice

252
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:45,477
- your violin, Dave?
- No, and no.

253
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,946
And I tried.

254
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,280
I really tried, so
that's on you now.

255
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,181
It's all good, buddy.

256
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,283
Grab your hoodies,
boys, it's zoo day.

257
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,453
They really ate none
of their breakfast.

258
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,888
What's up with your mom?

259
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,356
She's been texting me a ton.

260
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,958
It's been kind of weird.

261
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,392
Didn't they make
her start some meds?

262
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,094
Yeah, well she feels
that she doesn't need them.

263
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:03,529
It's everybody
else that's crazy.

264
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,331
Well, you told her
to stop calling me.

265
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,333
- Thank you.
- Uh huh.

266
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,301
But now she needs
to stop texting me.

267
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,936
We've been divorced for a year.

268
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,271
All right, yeah.

269
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,138
I get it.

270
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:16,041
Hey, boychiks, kisses for Mama.

271
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,142
I'm gonna miss you.

272
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,944
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye.

273
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,546
Have so much fun at the zoo.

274
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,014
- See ya.
- Snacks for them?

275
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:23,182
Yes.

276
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,116
Okay.

277
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,351
- Bye, mama.
- Of course you have snacks.

278
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,285
[phone ringing]

279
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,386
Jesus Christ.

280
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:31,924
Ma, what?

281
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,225
[Barbara] Call the
caregiver agency.

282
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,194
I gotta fire another one.

283
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,363
No, no, no, no,
no, Mom, not Shawn.

284
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,430
What's going on?

285
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:41,166
Oh, wait till
you hear this one.

286
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,836
[clock ticking]

287
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:52,511
Shawn, you were brought into
this house to protect him,

288
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,847
not to bring him poison.

289
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,348
Mrs. Frey, it's not poison.

290
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:57,349
- Medicinal marijuana.
- Oh please.

291
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,450
Has been proven to help-

292
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,353
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

293
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:04,123
I went through the '60s.

294
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,458
Barely.

295
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:09,495
I was taking mescaline before
you were even in diapers.

296
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,230
So give me a break.

297
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,264
He asked me for it.

298
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:16,335
It is a drug and I
don't want it in my house.

299
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:20,005
Mrs. Frey, I care
about your family.

300
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,939
Very deeply.

301
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:25,978
Spare me the pain.

302
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,579
Just get out, Shawn.

303
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:31,150
In fact, get out and
take your bears with you.

304
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:32,351
Whoa, whoa, Mom, stop.

305
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,853
- I want you out.
- Shawn, what's happening?

306
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,889
Mom, stop with the bears.

307
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:37,856
I can't do this.

308
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,158
- We can talk.
- I'm sorry.

309
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,292
Remember the last time?

310
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,994
Hey, stop it.

311
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,028
I'll call you.

312
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,499
This turnover is killing me.

313
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,434
What did he do?

314
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,003
Well,

315
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,238
he was giving your
father marijuana

316
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,940
in the form of
cute little bears.

317
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:55,941
Oh my God, mom.

318
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,976
He was one of the good ones.

319
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,346
Call the service,
get another one.

320
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,517
I'm very happy we have
this appointment today

321
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:10,422
because he's getting worse.

322
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,257
Ma, this is how this works.

323
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,425
It gets worse.

324
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,895
And this morning
he fell again,

325
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,933
and I could barely pick him up.

326
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:27,206
He was like a dead weight.

327
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,541
Shawn?

328
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,512
I need Shawn.

329
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,280
Hey, honey.

330
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:37,449
Hi, Dad.

331
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,619
Hi.

332
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:41,620
Hi.

333
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:46,525
I need to pee.

334
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,162
- Okay.
- Okay.

335
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,464
Abby.

336
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,199
Your dad needs your help.

337
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,401
But I'm in a hurry.

338
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,970
[Barbara] I'll be in the car.

339
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,641
[Eugene] Whoopsy
daisy, too late.

340
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,412
- Huh.
[discordant music]

341
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:07,346
Cut it out.

342
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,580
Dad said not to make noise.

343
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:09,649
Shut up.

344
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm serious, Nathan.

345
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,054
Cut it out.

346
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,289
Cut it out.

347
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,490
- He's gonna be mad.
- "He's gonna be mad."

348
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:22,094
Hey!

349
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:23,462
Abby, what did I tell ya?

350
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,563
[hand slapping]

351
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,999
[blood dripping]

352
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,568
[water dripping]

353
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:34,641
So, I can't seem
to get my balance.

354
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:36,108
Everything seems to be-

355
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,976
- Follow my finger, please.
- Everything

356
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,312
is failing on me.

357
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,416
I feel a little weak.

358
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,417
[Doctor] Just with the eyes.

359
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,286
- Huh?
- How's work?

360
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,520
It's fine.

361
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,590
When are they going to tell
you about that cover story?

362
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,294
I just don't think they
think I'm quite ready yet.

363
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,995
Well, that's ridiculous.

364
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,432
I mean, you didn't get an MFA
to be writing staff pieces

365
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,300
this long.

366
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,002
Veronica's
daughter-in-law has an MSA

367
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:07,272
and she says you absolutely
should have a cover now.

368
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,408
Great, well I am not
Veronica's daughter-in-law.

369
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,578
You have to say what
you want, Abigail.

370
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:15,247
It's not quite like that, Ma.

371
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,484
This point, there's really
nothing else to do, I'm afraid.

372
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:25,257
Nothing else to do?

373
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,660
Abigail, help me out here.

374
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:29,595
I don't think Dr.
Ashkenazi understands.

375
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,163
It's Ashkenazi, Mom.

376
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:32,699
[Both] It's fine.

377
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,767
We need another set of tests.

378
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,336
We need, we need a specialist.
[door knocking]

379
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,570
- He is a specialist.
- I am a specialist.

380
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:39,739
Dr. Ashkenazi.

381
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,206
Your next patient's ready.

382
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,675
Excuse me?

383
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,644
- Ma.
- She serious?

384
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,245
I'll be right there.

385
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:47,379
Doctor, I've been
trying to tell my parents

386
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,816
that it's not safe for them
to be living on their own

387
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,083
without full-time care.

388
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,251
[Barbara] We don't need it.

389
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,686
You call me every
time he falls.

390
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,721
Not true.

391
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:57,623
I called 911 twice this week.

392
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:58,725
Mrs. Frey,

393
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,727
you need to consider hiring
a full-time caregiver.

394
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,528
You're going to end
up hurting yourself.

395
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,296
We need a fourth opinion.

396
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,099
The thing about life is that
there are no second chances

397
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,401
to be the you that
you're meant to be.

398
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,603
What's holding you back?

399
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:14,641
Now is the time for you to
break through those limits.

400
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:17,109
Whoa.

401
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,579
[glasses clattering]
Shit.

402
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:21,613
You're good.

403
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:23,850
You're good.

404
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,685
[Man] You have to be
willing to take a risk

405
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,386
and take that step.

406
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,389
'Cause no one else is
going to do it for you.

407
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,157
You have to work.

408
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,559
Now is the time.

409
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:34,493
[bright music]

410
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,797
It's all about you
taking that next step.

411
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:43,135
Visualize yourself and
who you wanna become.

412
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,270
You have to take control.

413
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:49,174
[phone ringing]

414
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,477
[Hannah] You've reached the
voicemail of Hannah White,

415
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,446
Editor-in-Chief of Modern Jew.

416
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,148
Leave a message, I'll
return your call.

417
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,216
- [machine beeping]
- Hey, boss lady.

418
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,819
Hannah Banana.

419
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:03,555
I'm sorry, but you
know, just little busy.

420
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,391
This is Abigail
Frey, by the way.

421
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,328
So listen, so many
things to say,

422
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,529
my dad's dying.

423
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,497
I mean, everybody is dying,

424
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:16,703
but some quicker than others.

425
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:19,772
And my mom is not,

426
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:21,908
I mean,

427
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:24,142
[Abigail exhaling]
[Abigail laughing]

428
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:27,446
can I petition for a
new mom [laughing]?

429
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:30,515
There's some fun
stuff to talk about.

430
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,452
There's this guy, a man,

431
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:38,891
gardening my garden
and he is delightful.

432
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,361
So we can talk about that.

433
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,730
About haircuts.

434
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,230
I need one.

435
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,264
Bangs,

436
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,266
no bangs?

437
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,134
I mean...

438
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,406
[Abigail sighing]

439
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,677
So, give me a call

440
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,778
whenever.

441
00:16:58,811 --> 00:16:59,779
I'm here.

442
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:02,514
[upbeat music]

443
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,252
[Man] Dance clubs just
giving it their all today.

444
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:09,722
Whoa, look at those kicks.

445
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,758
[Woman] These girls
worked so hard all year

446
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,393
just to get a chance to walk.

447
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:21,266
Ma.

448
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,935
Ma.

449
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,604
Ma?

450
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:28,507
[glasses clinking]

451
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,809
What?

452
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,344
- What, I'm fine.
- We're almost ready.

453
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:34,479
[Barbara] I needed
to take a little nap.

454
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,716
Where's your father?

455
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:38,851
He's not up yet.

456
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:40,953
Eugene, what are you doing?

457
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,726
Your brother said he
would call with Karen.

458
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,862
I told him, you know,
come have a meal with us,

459
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:54,767
but she's sure has her
claws in him, doesn't she?

460
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:55,968
Mom, can we just go one day

461
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:58,437
without you tearing into Karen?

462
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,405
Excuse me.

463
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,240
Look, who's a saint.

464
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:06,244
[Eugene humming]

465
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,553
What do you think?

466
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:15,922
Why are you
wearing those shoes?

467
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:16,956
I'm in a good mood.

468
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:18,457
Can't I be in a good mood?

469
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,792
It's a new year.

470
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,661
- Oh man.
- What?

471
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,030
All right, here's why
I'm in a good mood.

472
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:26,598
It's New Year's, it's vacation,

473
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,769
I don't have to work tomorrow,
and I just got stoned.

474
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,269
Happy New Year, Barbara.

475
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,006
What?

476
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,440
- What?
- No.

477
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,709
What?

478
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,310
I've been denying
this for 20 years.

479
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,611
I am so sick and tired.

480
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,681
I ain't going to
deny it anymore.

481
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,982
I smoke weed.

482
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:43,950
Come on, let's eat.

483
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:44,984
Abby, sit down.

484
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,719
[Barbara] Abigail, do
not touch that chair.

485
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:48,988
[Eugene] Abby,
sit down, let's eat.

486
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,288
- Right.
- Ooh.

487
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:51,456
Ooh.

488
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,793
Ooh, look what
you've made for me.

489
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:54,961
It's my favorite.

490
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:56,662
It's pasta primavera.

491
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:57,596
Oh, oh.

492
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,631
- Thank you.
- I know that.

493
00:18:58,664 --> 00:18:59,598
What?

494
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:01,399
[bowl shattering]

495
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,902
- Aw, shit.
- Now you can

496
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,638
make your own dinner for the
rest of your fucking life.

497
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,305
[Eugene] Oh, Barbie,
give it a fucking break.

498
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,877
You drink, you drink, you
drink, I smoke a joint.

499
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,944
What?

500
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:17,650
[foot smashing]
[Abigail groaning]

501
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,953
Peter, this stupid
fucking bookcase.

502
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:24,991
[light guitar music]

503
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,438
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

504
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,608
- How are you?
- Okay.

505
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,978
What are you doing out here?

506
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:46,813
Where's Darrin?

507
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:47,947
Darrin?

508
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,017
Meeting, I think,
us at the doctor.

509
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:51,984
Okay.

510
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,054
Your mother said
that I should stay here

511
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,923
'cause I was too
much in the way.

512
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,691
I hate being such a burden.

513
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,358
Abigail, you're here already.

514
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:02,394
- Here I am.
- Do you know

515
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:05,998
I have just made the most
incredible flatbread?

516
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:09,902
I used those dry chickpeas
from the Armenian market.

517
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:12,939
The one the seamstress at the
dry cleaner told us about,

518
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:16,508
the dry cleaner who's having
an affair with her hairdresser,

519
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,678
but who still reads your column.

520
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:19,979
That is so kind.

521
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,883
All right, let's get
Dad to this appointment.

522
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,117
We're gonna do
it in the walker.

523
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:26,484
[Abigail] Why?

524
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,920
Well, he's got to try it.

525
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,889
- I can try it.
- Yeah.

526
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,523
Let me take this.

527
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:32,892
Dad, I think you should
use the wheelchair.

528
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,994
- He can try the walker.
- I could try it.

529
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,730
Ma, he's very weak.

530
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,165
Honey, it's okay.

531
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,666
I'm okay.

532
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,868
I know what I'm doing.

533
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:44,070
Okay, let's try the walker.

534
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,905
- Okay.
- All right.

535
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:48,774
Not too fast.

536
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:50,076
Yeah, that's it.

537
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,577
Uh oh.

538
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:53,946
- Uh oh.
- How you feel?

539
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,914
Not too good.

540
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:55,815
Come on, we'll go back down.

541
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:57,415
Okay.

542
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,151
- There.
- Okay, Abigail.

543
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,858
- [walker clattering]
- Whoa, hey.

544
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,660
I will take care of this.

545
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:11,097
This stupid thing.

546
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,131
All right.

547
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,671
Want me to do this?

548
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:19,639
No, I can do it.

549
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,109
Yeah, but I don't
have my feet ready.

550
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:24,442
Oh.

551
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:26,544
Oh, shoot.
[Abigail laughing]

552
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,445
Sorry.

553
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,114
Sorry.

554
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:30,615
Oh God.

555
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,488
I don't like you to bend.

556
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,589
I know, I'm sorry.

557
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,126
Okay, great.

558
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,426
Don't let her bend.

559
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:43,528
Okay, Dad.

560
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,497
You sure you don't want-

561
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,666
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

562
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,570
You know, Darrin's girlfriend
is 20 and she's pregnant.

563
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:56,008
How are we going to
stop this endless cycle?

564
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:58,443
- Watch out.
- Whoopsy daisy.

565
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:01,714
I'm fine, Abigail.

566
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:02,982
I'm fine.

567
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,016
Everybody's fine.

568
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:26,072
Did you get a chance to
look at that dating app?

569
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:27,073
'Cause it's time.

570
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,008
Peter's already seeing people.

571
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,743
How on earth do
you know that, Ma?

572
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:32,645
Well, you told me
I couldn't call him

573
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:33,846
and I couldn't text him,

574
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,882
but you didn't say I couldn't
follow him on Facebook.

575
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,284
[scoffing] Can we
just pay attention

576
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,885
to what the doctor is saying?

577
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,553
Sorry.

578
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:42,755
Okay. Mr. Frey,

579
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:44,156
let's see how you
can walk on your own.

580
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,825
Walking is hard for me.

581
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,094
Dad, it's okay,
we're all here for you.

582
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:49,862
Let me get you started Mr. F.

583
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,665
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

584
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:55,634
He's like the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.

585
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:56,969
Ma.

586
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,038
Okay, Mr. Frey,
let's try that again.

587
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,538
You're all right.

588
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:01,573
I got you, Mr. F.

589
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:02,241
Now.

590
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,185
How are you, Mrs. Frey?

591
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:15,855
How should I be, Dr. Pastel?

592
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,289
It's Dr. Patel, Mom.

593
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:18,324
It's fine.

594
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,160
Abigail. I would like
you to tell Dr. Patel

595
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,294
about your father.

596
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:25,031
She has training in medicine.

597
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,866
I took a couple of
courses in college,

598
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,001
just basic stuff.

599
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,236
Now she's writing.

600
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,238
She's writing a column
for the Modern Jew.

601
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:33,806
It's very popular,

602
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,275
but because she doesn't
ask for what she wants,

603
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:38,911
she hasn't been given
a cover story yet.

604
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:40,212
- [Abigail] Ma.
- Right.

605
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,050
He's not been eating.

606
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,852
He wets the bed most nights.

607
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,220
He's really not very lucid.

608
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:52,291
And he is getting
worse day by day.

609
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:58,164
His chiropractor thinks
maybe meditation would help.

610
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,232
Mm-hmm.

611
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,935
Mrs. Frey,

612
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,804
I'm going to be blunt.

613
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,806
I know you're continuing to
make appointments weekly,

614
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,175
but your husband is not
going to get better.

615
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:15,714
So, do you mean we
brought him to a doctor,

616
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,084
to a hospital, where
they can't fix him?

617
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:19,285
Mom.

618
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:21,320
He's gonna continue to decline
at a more rapid rate now.

619
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:23,756
And we need to
talk about hospice.

620
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:24,690
Hospice.

621
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:25,658
What is that?

622
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,693
Hospice means we
don't think he can live

623
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,662
longer than six months.

624
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:32,198
He's gotta eat more.

625
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,166
Maybe if you gave him an enema,

626
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,069
it would make room
for more food.

627
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,004
[Dr. Patel] No, Mrs. Frey.

628
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,307
You have to stop trying
to force him to eat.

629
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,276
If he doesn't
eat, he's gonna die.

630
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,178
Yes, Ma, he's going to die.

631
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:55,620
Oh my God [crying].

632
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:02,328
We just figured out his Lipitor.

633
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:04,330
Ma, what?

634
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:08,934
We finally figured
out the dosage

635
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:11,137
and now he's going to die.

636
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,005
[Abigail] Ma, now is not
the time to be thinking

637
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,807
about his Lipitor, okay?

638
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,845
[somber music]
[distant chattering]

639
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,953
Nathan used to work
in that building.

640
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:30,990
Remember?

641
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,361
We visited him once,

642
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:40,232
and I think we took a very
nice walk in the garden there.

643
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,140
- Remember?
- Yeah.

644
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:53,312
I remember.

645
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:57,183
[soft jazz music]
[Eugene coughing]

646
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:34,119
[Davis] Get back here.

647
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,721
[Finn] Cut it out.

648
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,790
Do you wanna tap out?

649
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:40,059
[Finn] No, I do
not wanna tap out.

650
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:41,794
Guys, take this
in another room.

651
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,264
[Davis] If you really love
him, then you'll save him.

652
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,799
[Finn] She does love me.

653
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:48,400
And she will save me.

654
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:51,003
Guys, other room, please.

655
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,441
- Get back here, you troll.
- Don't call me a troll,

656
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:57,977
- you troll.
- I'm not done with you.

657
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:01,480
Hey, Abbs.

658
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:03,215
Sorry I haven't
answered your calls.

659
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:04,083
Here's the thing.

660
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:05,951
I don't know if I
want Mom and Dad

661
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,786
at my birthday party next week.

662
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:13,392
No matter what I do,
I can't get space from them.

663
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,394
- Get what?
- What, space?

664
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,795
[Eugene] What does that mean?

665
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,330
You know what it means.

666
00:27:18,364 --> 00:27:20,032
Remember when we sent the thing.

667
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:21,367
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

668
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,302
Such disrespect
when he did that.

669
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:25,137
If I would have told my father-

670
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,539
- Oh, Eugene, stop
with the father.

671
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:30,476
It's not always
about your father.

672
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,145
Okay, hey, do you want
me to finish or not?

673
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,380
Yeah, go.

674
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,015
[Abigail] Okay.

675
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:37,049
Karen's parents

676
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:39,985
so generously offered
to throw me this party.

677
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,054
Oh, I know what's comin'.

678
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:43,255
- You do?
- Oh yeah.

679
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:44,590
Just listen, go ahead.

680
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:48,460
I think you all coming
to my party without mom

681
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,229
apologizing to Karen

682
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,031
- for what happened.
- What?

683
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:52,965
Is not gonna work.

684
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:53,565
There it is, I knew it.

685
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,134
Are you kidding?

686
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,368
- That's it.
- Ma,

687
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:57,336
what happened with Karen?

688
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,537
Oh please.

689
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,307
Her grandmother turned 100.

690
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,942
I didn't go to the celebration

691
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:08,447
because I can't be all things
to all people, Abigail.

692
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,481
You're absolutely right.

693
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:10,883
Thank you.

694
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,352
Okay, Ma, can you
just apologize to Karen?

695
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:14,420
Apologize?

696
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:16,488
Wh, why?

697
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:17,489
We're not apologizing.

698
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:19,024
It was a busy week.

699
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:20,125
Sue me.

700
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,927
Over my dead fuckin' body.

701
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,863
Over my dead fuckin' body
is anyone in this family

702
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:28,033
fucking apologizing to
go to that fucking party?

703
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,469
[bright music]

704
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,607
I think we should say hello.

705
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:37,409
- Now?
- Yeah.

706
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:38,577
I talked to them.

707
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,611
- I told them.
- And?

708
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:40,879
They had to be polite.

709
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:41,547
Okay.

710
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,621
- Hello, family.
- Happy birthday.

711
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,957
- Okay, thank you.
- Hi, Karen.

712
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,126
Mom, Dad.

713
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,994
Nathan, happy birthday.

714
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:57,963
Thanks.

715
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:07,005
Dad?

716
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:21,620
Have you put on
a little weight?

717
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,530
[Finn] You're still a troll.

718
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,099
I swear if you ask
me one more time,

719
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,468
I am going to throw
you into a wall.

720
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:37,436
Just cut it out.

721
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:38,537
You're so annoying.

722
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,176
[Davis] Can you bring
us a snack please, Mom?

723
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,544
Yes, I'll be right there.

724
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:46,445
I'll be right there.

725
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:48,046
Okay.

726
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,085
God, I-
[phone ringing]

727
00:29:58,223 --> 00:29:59,057
Hello?

728
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,961
[Nathan] Hey, what's up?

729
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:06,666
I just, uh,

730
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,637
I wanted to talk
to you about Dad.

731
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,005
He has a degenerative condition

732
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,973
and we've had to
put him on hospice.

733
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,711
Oh, okay.

734
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:21,681
Yeah.

735
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,551
I don't really know
what else to say.

736
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:27,687
Well,

737
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:32,357
I'm glad you told me.

738
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,029
If you wanted to
start thinking about,

739
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:38,163
you know um,

740
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:39,666
if you,

741
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:42,468
I don't know.

742
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,570
It might be the last.

743
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:46,639
Yeah, no, I get it.

744
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:47,473
I get it.

745
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:49,508
I am sorry.

746
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,043
I know you're probably at work

747
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:54,046
and so you probably need
time to think about this.

748
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,248
No, no, it's fine.

749
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,685
I mean, I kind of have a
good amount of distance

750
00:30:58,718 --> 00:30:59,551
from all of this.

751
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,588
It's been so long, so

752
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,061
I'll be down there
in a couple of weeks.

753
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:09,796
- What?
- Yeah.

754
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:11,230
I'm the distinguished lecturer

755
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:12,799
at the College of
Art and Design,

756
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:15,467
the horticulture
of the Meiji era.

757
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,670
Being a specialist
matters, I guess.

758
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:19,271
Yeah, I'm sure.

759
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:27,579
So, I mean, I don't want
to commit to anything, but-

760
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:30,249
- [Abigail] But there's a
chance you might come see him?

761
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:31,450
Well, I don't know, Abigail.

762
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,484
I'm just saying
I'll be down there.

763
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,418
It's a long drive.

764
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,387
So it depends on timing and-

765
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,691
- Yeah, okay.
- Bunch of stuff I have to do.

766
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,158
Should I come?

767
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,260
[Nathan] What?

768
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:43,595
You know, to your lecture?

769
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,764
Should I come?

770
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:47,165
What?

771
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,233
[Abigal] No, nevermind.

772
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:50,737
No, yeah.

773
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,537
Come.

774
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:53,740
That's cool.

775
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:55,407
Yeah?

776
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,777
[Nathan] Yeah, I'll
send you the information.

777
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,610
Okay.

778
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:01,714
[Nathan] Okay, bye.

779
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:03,415
Bye.

780
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,788
[Finn] Mom?

781
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:11,658
Yes, I'm coming.

782
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:14,593
Yeah, we have
had conversation.

783
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:17,764
This is what, my job is
an hour away from here.

784
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:20,465
It makes no sense for me
to live at home anymore.

785
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:21,701
Come on.

786
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,201
[Eugene] Oh, don't
come on with me, kid.

787
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,437
I worked my ass off so you
can live here rent-free.

788
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,271
- Dad.
- What?

789
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:27,205
Calm down.

790
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,140
Don't tell me to calm down.

791
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:29,341
I'm fuckin' calm, Abby.

792
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:30,542
- This is calm.
- You want things to be

793
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:31,610
like they were when
you were my age.

794
00:32:31,644 --> 00:32:33,646
And it's just not
like that anymore.

795
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,614
Well, when I was your age,
if I would've told my father

796
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:38,651
I want to live on my own, but
he should keep paying my rent,

797
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:39,752
he would have smacked me so hard

798
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:41,520
I'd have lost all
the teeth in my head

799
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:42,755
and I woulda deserved it, kid.

800
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,856
Karen and I are
getting serious.

801
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,490
- Karen!
- Karen, who?

802
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:46,258
Who is?

803
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,392
- My girlfriend.
- Is she behind

804
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:48,728
the whole moving thing?

805
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,630
- What?
- You think that we don't

806
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:52,564
get what's going on, Nate?

807
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:53,398
We do.

808
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,533
We know you want to live

809
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:58,270
in some bachelor pleasure den.

810
00:32:58,303 --> 00:32:59,438
Oh, Ma, stop.

811
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:00,606
Shut up, Abby.

812
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,642
[Nate] You think I want to
move out so I can have sex

813
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,309
- with Karen?
- Yeah.

814
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:06,646
Well, news flash,
we already have.

815
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,447
- What?
- Oh Jesus.

816
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,281
- Oh God.
[hands slamming]

817
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:10,783
Everyone has sex.

818
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,752
You're the only people who
refuse to acknowledge that

819
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:15,253
because you're so out
of touch with reality.

820
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,856
It's like you're living
in the Dark Ages.

821
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,490
[Eugene] Do not
yell at your mother.

822
00:33:18,523 --> 00:33:20,860
I'm so Sick of your
authoritarian bullshit, Dad!

823
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:21,928
I'm warning you.

824
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,295
Nathan, your father is

825
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:24,363
- busting his ass-
- Stop, stop,

826
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,564
stop defending him.

827
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:27,599
You gave up your life
to be his servant.

828
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:28,500
And I am tired of
shutting up about the fact

829
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,670
that you love him
more than you love us.

830
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:31,603
Stop, stop, Dad, please.

831
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:32,805
- Where are you goin'?
[Abigail crashing]

832
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,741
Where are you goin'?

833
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,375
Get out of here!

834
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:37,810
Talking to your
mother like that.

835
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:38,678
Get out.

836
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:41,480
Get out of here,
get out of here.

837
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,650
- You're not so smart, Nathan.
- Get outta here.

838
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:44,751
- Fuckin' dicks, man.
- You don't know anything.

839
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:46,184
- You're flinchin', huh?
- Get out of,

840
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:47,252
get the hell out.

841
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:48,688
Where you goin'?

842
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:50,188
- I just-
- No,

843
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:51,858
you're not goin' anywhere,
we're gonna have dinner.

844
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,827
[tense music]

845
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:55,662
Okay.

846
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,263
So, what should we talk about?

847
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:58,898
Abby?

848
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:01,734
Have a nice day today?

849
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:03,703
[knife chopping]

850
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:04,871
Ah.

851
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:07,840
[knocking on door]

852
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,782
Hello.

853
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:16,916
Hi.

854
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,750
You're early.

855
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:18,951
Hello, Miss Abigail.

856
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,254
You could call me
Abby at this point.

857
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:22,889
Abby.

858
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,391
- Short for Abigail.
- Yeah, no, I got it.

859
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:27,860
Of course you do.

860
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:30,730
I mean, I'm pretty sure
I said it'd be around noon.

861
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:32,799
And look at that.

862
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,434
It is noon.

863
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,936
- It is.
- Thought it was not,

864
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,638
but it is.

865
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,272
Can I take this out for you?

866
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:42,642
Trade you my empty water
bottle for the trash?

867
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:46,813
Sure, but I can fill
this with water for you.

868
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:48,848
That is the thing
that could happen.

869
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:49,982
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

870
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,383
- Yup.
- Yup.

871
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,484
[Abigail laughing]

872
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:54,486
Well, I will be right back.

873
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,353
Okay.

874
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:57,489
All right.

875
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:10,870
Here you go.

876
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,404
- Thank you.
- No problem.

877
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,876
So, cupcakes.

878
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:17,677
Uh huh.

879
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,414
Yup, that is what I am doing.

880
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,584
[phone ringing]

881
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:29,021
Uh, Mom, I can't
really talk right now

882
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:30,823
- because I have people over.
- Oh my God,

883
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,793
did you know if you sleep
with your mouth open

884
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:37,063
and don't swallow enough,
you get sores in your mouth?

885
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:38,030
Mom.

886
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:39,031
[Barbara] Your father
has so many sores.

887
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:39,832
Mom, Mom.

888
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,534
- Mom.
- Because his swallow reflex

889
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:43,770
is so messed up.

890
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,403
Ma I can't talk right now.

891
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,571
I have somebody over here.

892
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,874
- Okay?
- Oh.

893
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:49,842
Since, when do you
have people there?

894
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:51,077
- Ma, I was just.
- Hey.

895
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,746
[Barbara] Hello
there, muscles.

896
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,680
Hello yourself.

897
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:55,915
I'm Jay, the landscaper.

898
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:56,816
You really don't
have to do this.

899
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:58,084
Oh, I don't mind.

900
00:35:58,117 --> 00:35:59,919
I see where Abigail
gets her good looks.

901
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,020
- Oh wow.
- Jay,

902
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,656
flattery will get

00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:11,310
do you want to
tell me how he is?

1082
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:13,512
Like for you?

1083
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:19,151
So much has happened
since you left.

1084
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:23,889
Dad was hospitalized
a few years ago,

1085
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:27,393
mental breakdown,

1086
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:29,495
diagnosis bipolar.

1087
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,097
And Mom,

1088
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:35,301
I mean, she's never
been formally diagnosed,

1089
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:38,437
but you know it's very
borderline personality disorder.

1090
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,539
Okay, so now these
things have names.

1091
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:45,878
He's like bad, Nathan.

1092
00:44:48,113 --> 00:44:51,917
I mean, he can't
stand up on his own.

1093
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,352
He's refusing to eat.

1094
00:44:55,387 --> 00:44:58,590
This really is it.

1095
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:01,393
So if there's any part of
you that wants to see him,

1096
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:06,899
now would be the time.

1097
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,408
I don't think
I can go see him.

1098
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,545
Yeah.

1099
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:20,512
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1100
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:21,880
No.

1101
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:22,915
Thanks for coming.

1102
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:24,583
Yeah.

1103
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:32,091
It's because of her.

1104
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:36,328
- What?
- I don't want to see her.

1105
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,165
I don't, I really
don't want to see her.

1106
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,033
Okay.

1107
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,602
Can I ask you why?

1108
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:50,175
Yeah.

1109
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:54,113
His wreckage was

1110
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:57,149
tangible.

1111
00:45:59,952 --> 00:46:03,455
Hers was so insidious
and disturbing.

1112
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,526
I just can't go there.

1113
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,328
[door clicking]

1114
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,195
Okay.

1115
00:46:12,531 --> 00:46:13,999
What if she wasn't there?

1116
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:17,970
What?

1117
00:46:18,003 --> 00:46:19,706
What if she wasn't there?

1118
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,206
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1119
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,643
That's a good start for you.

1120
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,478
So your life is just always

1121
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:29,548
kind of like this
emotion, this intensity?

1122
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,151
You havin' to fix everything?

1123
00:46:32,184 --> 00:46:33,018
Yeah.

1124
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:35,487
Yeah, it's all I know.

1125
00:46:37,156 --> 00:46:40,492
But this, I mean, how am I
supposed to tell my mother

1126
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:42,227
that she can't be
there when her son,

1127
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:43,663
who she hasn't
seen for 20 years,

1128
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:46,398
visits her husband who is dying.

1129
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:48,668
I just,

1130
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,104
I don't know how to
tackle that one yet.

1131
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,574
But I've got to fix it.

1132
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,076
I said I'd fix it.

1133
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:03,716
Well, I kind of
fix for a living.

1134
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,417
And I can tell you this,

1135
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:09,555
things will keep breaking.

1136
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:14,727
So what are you gonna do?

1137
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:22,635
[phone ringing]

1138
00:47:22,669 --> 00:47:23,736
I'm so sorry.

1139
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,772
- It's okay.
- I really wanna do this.

1140
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,206
It's okay.

1141
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:28,407
Just in case something.

1142
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,042
Oh, say hi for me.

1143
00:47:30,075 --> 00:47:31,109
- Who's that?
- Nobody.

1144
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,544
It's me, the landscaper.

1145
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:34,146
[Barbara] Oh, Jed.

1146
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:35,380
[Both] Jay.

1147
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,783
[Barbara] What are
you crazy kids up to?

1148
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,651
I'm not,

1149
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:39,752
Ma, let me call you tomorrow.

1150
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:41,453
- Okay?
- Okay.

1151
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,791
And Jeff, make sure to come
to Eugene's birthday party

1152
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:46,258
next week.

1153
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,794
It's likely the last
one he'll ever have.

1154
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,629
- Mom.
- I would love to,

1155
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:52,231
but my parents are going
to be in town from Oakland.

1156
00:47:52,264 --> 00:47:53,365
So he has plans.

1157
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:54,500
- Plans.
- Great.

1158
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:55,467
Bring them too.

1159
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,069
- The more, the merrier.
- Oh, God in heaven.

1160
00:47:57,102 --> 00:47:58,604
No, Ma.

1161
00:47:58,638 --> 00:48:01,106
It's a party, Abigail.

1162
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:04,142
Don't you want to celebrate
your father's last birthday

1163
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:07,412
and let him see you
finally got a date?

1164
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:11,316
Okay, Ma, I'm
calling you tomorrow.

1165
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,117
- Bye, love you.
- Goodbye.

1166
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,785
Bye.

1167
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:17,189
[both laughing]

1168
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:19,659
What are you doing?

1169
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:22,662
Securing the weirdest
second date ever.

1170
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:23,763
- Truly.
- Truly.

1171
00:48:24,797 --> 00:48:26,265
Like being around you.

1172
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:29,568
[romantic piano music]

1173
00:48:30,502 --> 00:48:32,337
This isn't too much?

1174
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:35,407
It's so messy.

1175
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,510
That's not how I see it.

1176
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:58,597
My mom gets weird at parties.

1177
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:01,466
Her behavior is not
a reflection on me.

1178
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,670
Today is about my dad.

1179
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:07,640
I can do for an hour, what I
couldn't do for a lifetime.

1180
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:09,241
I am not her.

1181
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:10,342
She is not me.

1182
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:15,113
[Abigail exhaling]
[laughing]

1183
00:49:15,147 --> 00:49:16,415
Okay, party people.

1184
00:49:16,883 --> 00:49:18,417
Let's do this.

1185
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,654
[Abigail exhaling heavily]

1186
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:23,188
Where is the...

1187
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:25,190
birthday boy?

1188
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:26,291
Hi.

1189
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,660
Hello.

1190
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:28,861
- How are you?
- Good.

1191
00:49:30,162 --> 00:49:32,699
Darrin, Dad, this is Jay.

1192
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,199
Hello, Mr. Frey.

1193
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:36,368

1196
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:44,343
This is Billy and Marge,

1197
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:46,244
sorry, Marge and Billy.

1198
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:48,547
These are Jay's parents and
they're celebrating with us

1199
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,716
because they are in town.

1200
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:50,750
- How are you, Mr. Frey?
- Happy birthday.

1201
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,284
Where's the dad?

1202
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,187
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi.

1203
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,254
Hello.

1204
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:58,658
Hello, welcome.

1205
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:59,892
Can I get you a drink?

1206
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:01,894
We have mimosas.

1207
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:03,462
Come on, Jed.

1208
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:04,764
Jay, Mom.

1209
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:05,765
[Jay chuckling]
I'm sorry.

1210
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:06,733
It's okay.

1211
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,234
Okay.

1212
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,405
- The father didn't come?
- Dad.

1213
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:16,174
So how is your day?

1214
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:16,809
Oh.

1215
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:18,276
It's been up and down.

1216
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,879
We took a nice walk in
the park, right Mr. F?

1217
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:20,947
Okay.

1218
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,414
Just okay?

1219
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:23,382
Come on, we saw a
three legged dog.

1220
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:24,616
We checked out the ladies.

1221
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:25,918
We saw the little kid
who fell on his face

1222
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:27,386
when he tripped
on that sprinkler.

1223
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:28,955
[laughing] We
laughed a little bit.

1224
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:30,690
[Eugene laughing]

1225
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:31,658
What?

1226
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:33,558
- It was funny.
- Oh my God.

Laughing at little
kids falling down.

1228
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,729

- Hi, Mom.

1229
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:37,797
Hello.

1230
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:40,198
Oh, are you having a good day?

1231
00:50:40,232 --> 00:50:40,967
Missed you.

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

1233
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,803
Hiding in the back room?

1234
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,772
Your mom was having
a moment or three.

1235
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:46,806
Uh-huh, yeah.

1236
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,908
Along with her
mimosa or three.

1237
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:50,843
I'm sorry.

1238
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,412
You're supposed to talk
to her about drinking

1239
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:54,814
- in front of the boys.
- I know.

1240
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,381
I just.

1241
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:57,282
It needs to happen.

1242
00:50:57,315 --> 00:50:58,851
I will do it.

1243
00:50:58,885 --> 00:50:59,686

00:51:49,669 --> 00:51:51,269
- I don't want it.
- Yes, you do.

1261
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:53,405
- You love this cake.
- No, I don't want it.

1262
00:51:53,438 --> 00:51:55,407
- You do.
- I don't.

1263
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,575
I don't want it.

1264
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:57,677
- Yes you do, Eugene.
- No, I don't.

1265
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,510
Yes, you do.

1266
00:51:58,543 --> 00:51:59,444
Come on, Eugene.

1267
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:00,278
God dammit.

1268
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:01,681
I don't, please.

1269
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:02,514
- Ma.
- Mommy,

1270
00:52:02,547 --> 00:52:03,950
maybe he's not hungry.

1271
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:05,718
No, that is not an option.

1272
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:06,953
It's his birthday.

1273
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:08,988
He has to eat his cake.

1274
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:09,922
Okay, you know what, Mrs. F?

1275
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:10,857
Maybe you should back off.

1276
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,791
Let's just take a walk.

1277
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:13,760
It's his favorite cake.

1278
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:14,761
He loves it.

1279
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:18,430
We're all going to enjoy
it together, God dammit.

1280
00:52:18,463 --> 00:52:19,364
You know what, Mrs. F?

1281
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:20,565
I'm just asking you to stop.

1282
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,703
Darrin, I don't recall
asking your opinion.

1283
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:25,638
Just know your place.

1284
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:27,740
- Okay, know your place.
- Oh, hell no.

1285
00:52:27,774 --> 00:52:28,941
Darrin, I'll handle this.

1286
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:30,408
- Abigail?
- Yes?

1287
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:31,744
I think we're just
gonna grab a ride,

1288
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:32,678
but I'll call you.

1289
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,880
All right, I'll call you.

1290
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:35,848
That's just, okay.

1291
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:37,449
- Thank you.
- Honey, hush.

1292
00:52:37,482 --> 00:52:38,885
Let's just get out of here.

1293
00:52:38,918 --> 00:52:41,319
We can talk about this later.

1294
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:43,923
Why are you sending them away?

1295
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:44,991
Because, Ma.

1296
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:46,391
You know what, Dad?

1297
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,326
Let's get you down
to take a nap.

1298
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,461
You've had a big day.

1299
00:52:49,494 --> 00:52:50,763
Let's get you down okay.

1300
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:51,731
You just broke up the party.

1301
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:54,000
Hey Darrin, can I
borrow you for a second?

1302
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:54,901
[Darrin] Yeah, of course.

1303
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:55,735
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1304
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:57,402
[Abigail] Thanks,
I got the chair.

1305
00:52:57,435 --> 00:52:58,805
- I got ya, Mr. F.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1306
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:02,407
No one naps until they
eat their cake, Darrin.

1307
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,943
We're gonna go.

1308
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,011
Come on, Dad.

1309
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:17,990
If it were my last
birthday on Earth,

1310
00:53:19,692 --> 00:53:20,893
I would eat this cake.

1311
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:30,703
[Abigail humming]

1312
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:38,878
[Eugene groaning]

1313
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:39,946
Daddy.

1314
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:45,852
[Eugene grunting]

1315
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:10,076
[Abigail singing in
foreign language]

1316
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:35,067
[clock ticking]

1317
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,069
Sit down, sit down.

1318
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:38,204
I need to talk to you.

1319
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:41,207
[Abigail] Dad, I really don't-

1320
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,710
- You know your mom and
I had a big fight, right?

1321
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,846
She doesn't like me smoking pot.

1322
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:48,948
You know, it's not like
I'm hurting anybody.

1323
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:52,118
It's not like something I don't
have complete control over.

1324
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,154
I'm thinking of moving
back to the city.

1325
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:56,856
What?

1326
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:59,959
No, but I came out here
because your mom wanted to,

1327
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:03,129
I wanted to stay there because
that's where the energy is.

1328
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,765
I'm an artist, Abby.

1329
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:08,801
I'm a writer, I want to write
the great American novel.

1330
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:11,103
- Dad.
- But there's no energy here.

1331
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:12,537
[Abigail] Dad, just-

1332
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,640
- My psychiatrist says
that if he were me,

1333
00:55:14,674 --> 00:55:16,541
he would blow his
fuckin' brains out

1334
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,144
if he had a wife
who was this frigid

1335
00:55:18,177 --> 00:55:20,146
and a son who
wouldn't talk to him.

1336
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:23,683
There's no love
for me here, Abby.

1337
00:55:23,716 --> 00:55:26,085
[soft music]

1338
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,088
How could you say that to me?

1339
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:30,056
I'm here.

1340
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:31,190
I love you.

1341
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,661
Have you spoken
to your brother?

1342
00:55:39,832 --> 00:55:40,666
No.

1343
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,606
[sighing] My Abby,
my Abby, my Abby.

1344
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:51,509
You know me better than anybody.

1345
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:52,945
You always have.

1346
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,914
You know me better
than your mother.

1347
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,183
That's for sure.

1348
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,051
Thank you.

1349
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:01,087
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1350
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:08,227
[Abigail singing in
foreign language]

1351
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:17,770
Hey.

1352
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:19,205
Hey.

1353
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:21,040
He's asleep.

1354
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:21,874
He's asleep?

1355
00:56:21,907 --> 00:56:23,109
He is, yeah.

1356
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:26,178
Okay.

1357
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:29,015
I didn't know my cake

1358
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:32,284
would become such a big
part of the evening.

1359
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:36,789
The cake was delicious, Ma.

1360
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:37,790
I know it was.

1361
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:42,228
I spoke to Nathan.

1362
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:46,564
You called him?

1363
00:56:48,734 --> 00:56:49,567
I did.

1364
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:53,039
He wants to see Dad.

1365
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:57,843
Wow.

1366
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:05,851
Wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow.

1367
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:06,719
Yeah.

1368
00:57:09,255 --> 00:57:11,724
When, wh, when
does he want to come?

1369
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:17,630
He can come tomorrow.

1370
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:18,631
Oh God.

1371
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:21,967
Oh, well, huh, soon.

1372
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:26,305
But, uh,

1373
00:57:29,675 --> 00:57:30,309
here's the thing.

1374
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:34,280
He is not ready to see you yet.

1375
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:45,324
Huh.

1376
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:46,192
Hah.

1377
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:54,300
And, and why would that be?

1378
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:58,270
[Abigail] I don't know.

1379
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:03,909
'Cause he just wants to
keep things really simple.

1380
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:04,777
Yeah, sure.

1381
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:09,215
[Abigail] I know
this is hard for you.

1382
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:13,185
Hah [chuckling].

1383
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:14,053
Yeah.

1384
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,323
[Abigail] This is something
that you would do for Dad.

1385
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:18,157
Yeah.

1386
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:23,262
Are you good?

1387
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:25,698
Oh, good, I'm feeling good.

1388
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:26,832
Fine, fine.

1389
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,302
And you're

1390
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:35,107
gonna let him see-

1391
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:36,175
- Oh yeah.

1392
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:39,979
I wouldn't stand in his way.

1393
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:42,915
Sure.

1394
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:01,200
[Barbara crying]

1395
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,368
[somber music]

1396
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:03,702
[Hannah] Hey
Abby, Hannah White.

1397
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:06,038
Listen, I got your message.

1398
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:08,741
You don't really sound like
you're stable right now.

1399
00:59:08,774 --> 00:59:10,709
[Jay] Hey Abby, it's Jay.

1400
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:14,180
So, I know you're in
a really rough place.

1401
00:59:14,213 --> 00:59:15,381
[Hannah] Time off.

1402
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:17,216
I think you should take that
sabbatical we talked about.

1403
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:20,319
[Jay] After the
whole party cake thing,

1404
00:59:20,352 --> 00:59:21,787
you just gotta-

1405
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,922
- [Hannah] Let me know
when you're ready to talk

1406
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:24,456
from a more centered
perspective.

1407
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:25,891
[Jay] Hit pause for a minute.

1408
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:27,092
The garden's at a
good stopping place,

1409
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:29,728
so let's touch base
in a bit, okay?

1410
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:31,263
- Take care of yourself.
- Take care.

1411
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:33,232
[Nathan] Abbs, I gotta go.

1412
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:34,133
Get out of there!

1413
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,970
You have to get
yourself out of there!

1414
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:38,904
- Nathan.
- Do what you need to,

1415
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,139
do what you need to.

1416
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:42,775
- I have to go.
- Nathan.

1417
00:59:42,808 --> 00:59:43,442
You ready?

1418
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:46,045
Mm-hm.

1419
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:02,461
All right, Mr. F?

1420
01:00:02,494 --> 01:00:03,362
It's the moment you've
been waiting for.

1421
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:04,897
Thanks for the shower.

1422
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,098
I got you.

1423
01:00:06,131 --> 01:00:07,499
Your little man's all grown
up and he comin' to see you.

1424
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:08,367
Nathan.

1425
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,336
Yeah, we got you
looking pretty fly

1426
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:12,071
if I do say so myself.

1427
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:13,339
Give me some.

1428
01:00:13,372 --> 01:00:14,340
There you go [chuckling].

1429
01:00:14,373 --> 01:00:15,441
That was good enough.

1430
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:18,377
Don't you look handsome?

1431
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,278
You're welcome.

1432
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,379
[Abigail laughing]

1433
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:21,914
- Hi.
- Hey, Dad.

1434
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:24,917
How are you feeling?

1435
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,285
Nervous.

1436
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,319

Everything good about
me is because of you.

1473

You encouraged me to love art

and to make a living
surrounded by art.

I see in it, Ma.

what is that thing called?

- The kishkas.
- Colitis.

Yeah, colitis is what,

exactly, he looks like
someone with colitis.

business, Abigail.

me into your business.
