1
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,100
REMEMBER HOW YOU
USED TO LOVE THAT, DAD?

2
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,800
HOW WE'D ALL BUILD A SNOWMAN
AFTER THE FIRST BIG STORM,

3
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,800
AND I WOULD GIVE IT
THE CARROT NOSE,

4
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,700
THE RAISIN EYES...

5
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,800
AND HARRY WOULD GIVE HIM
THE CARDBOARD VIOLIN.

6
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,400
THEN TOMMY, OF COURSE,
WOULD MAKE UP THESE...

7
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,267
RIDICULOUS HORROR STORIES

8
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,667
ABOUT HOW THE SNOWMAN WAS GONNA
KIDNAP ALL THE CHILDREN...

9
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,167
...AND TURN THEM INTO ICICLES

10
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
THAT WOULD MELT AWAY
INTO THE EARTH.

11
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,533
HARRY?

12
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,633
HARRY, DO US A FAVOR. JOIN US.

13
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,500
COME ON, HARRY.
SIT DOWN.

14
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,667
YOUR GLASS.

15
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:16,567
NOW, I'M KEEPING MY FAMILY
BY MY SIDE AT ALL TIMES.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,133
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE...

17
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,533
MY LOVELY CHILDREN.

18
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,433
FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.

19
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:40,033
NOW, SPEAKING OF SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT SO FUNNY,

20
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:44,067
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF
TOMMY IS GOING TO MAKE
A HOUSE CALL TODAY?

21
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,033
LILLIAN,
WHY DON'T YOU CALL TOMMY?

22
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,067
SURE.

23
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,667
DOES HE HAVE A NAME?

24
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,500
WE ALREADY HAVE SOMEBODY
TO SHOVEL THE DRIVEWAY, THANKS.

25
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,467
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

26
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,567
TOMMY SHELLNER, I GREW UP
ABOUT A 1/2 MILE FROM
HERE ON TENNYSON DRIVE.

27
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,267
SHELLNER?
WAIT A SECOND.

28
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,267
IS YOUR DAD DR. SHELLNER?

29
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,467
YEAH.

30
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,067
WE HEARD HE WASN'T WELL.

31
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,400
THAT'S KINDA WHY I'M HERE.

32
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,667
SEE...

33
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,000
WE HAD A FAMILY DOG
THAT DIED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.

34
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,067
DAD HAD HIM CREMATED,
AND BURIED

35
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
IN AN URN SOMEWHERE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

36
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,200
HE FORGOT WHERE.

37
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,767
BUT NOW HE WANTS
TO FIND THE ASHES

38
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,400
SO HE CAN BE BURIED
WITH IT WHEN HE DIES.

39
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,300
AND I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE

40
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,600
YOU'D GIVE ME A FEW HOURS
TO LOOK IN YOUR FRONT YARD.

41
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,433
DAD WAS...

42
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,767
HE WAS NUTS ABOUT THAT DOG.

43
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,533
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT:

44
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,300
YOU GIVE ME AN HOUR TO DIG,

45
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,233
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THOSE
ICICLES ON THE ROOF.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,100
PLUS ALL THE ONES UP ON YOUR...

47
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,067
UP ON YOUR TREES.

48
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,800
I'M SORRY,
THIS JUST ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

49
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,767
ICICLES ARE DANGEROUS.

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,500
THINK ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

51
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,533
THE FIRST WINTER LIVING WITH US,

52
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:58,767
TOMMY PLUCKED ICICLES
OFF THE HOUSE AND THE TREES.

53
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,567
HE SAID HE WAS PROTECTING
HIS NEW FAMILY.

54
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,733
THIS FROM A 5-YEAR-OLD.

55
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,767
TELL ME, HARRY...

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,300
IS YOUR BROTHER STILL
LOOKING FOR HIS DOG?

57
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,533
HE'S BEEN TAKING
THE SHOVEL OUT EVERY MORNING.

58
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,067
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE DOES WITH IT.

59
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,233
I FOUND THIS HANGING
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW.

60
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,333
YOU GOTTA DEAL
WITH THIS SHIT, MA.

61
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,733
STILL HIGH TREASON
TO REFUSE YOUR BRISKET, MA?

62
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,200
IT'S LIKE COMMUNING
WITH THE COW, MA.

63
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,333
WHY DON'T YOU TRY COMMUNING

64
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,167
WITH SOME OF MY
STRING BEANS, WISE-ASS?

65
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,433
SO, TOMMY...

66
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,667
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T COMING BACK
UNTIL YOU FIND THE FAMILY DOG.

67
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,167
YOU'RE BACK, SO...

68
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,633
DID YOU FIND THE FAMILY DOG?

69
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,300
LEONARD...

70
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,600
WILL YOU GO CHECK ON YOU
FATHER AND SEE IF HE'S OK?

71
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,367
PLEASE?

72
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,500
OH, 25 YEARS, MA...

73
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,467
DAD CAN'T FIX
THE FAULTY WIRING?

74
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,467
WELL, HE SAYS THAT IT GIVES
THE HOUSE CHARACTER,

75
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,067
ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT THIS...

76
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,533
HOME HAS QUITE ENOUGH
CHARACTER AS IT IS.

77
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,200
THAT'S A BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE.

78
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,567
I KNOW THIS IS A BAD TIME...

79
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,467
YOUR SON, TOMMY,
STOPPED BY MY DAUGHTER'S
HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON...

80
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
NO, IT'S ALRIGHT.

81
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,733
I WANTED TO MAKE SOME
MUFFINS FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

82
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,300
I'M ELIZABETH ROBINS.

83
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,267
MANY YEARS AGO, YOUR HUSBAND...

84
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,533
TRIED TO HELP MY SON,

85
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,733
JOSEPH.

86
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,400
THIS IS MY SON.

87
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,000
YOUR HUSBAND,

88
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:44,333
HE WAS THE ONLY DOCTOR WHO NEVER
GAVE UP ON MY SON AFTER THE WAR.

89
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
MAY GOD BE WITH YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY.

90
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,100
MRS. ROBINS?

91
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,400
I HOPE THAT YOUR SON IS OK.

92
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,600
I HOPE SO, TOO.

93
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,500
HE LEFT US A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

94
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,233
PLEASE, WISH DR. SHELLNER
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

95
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,567
SOMETHING'S UP.

96
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,667
YOU'RE HELPING WITH THE CHORES.

97
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,667
MAYBE I JUST WANT TO...

98
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY MOTHER.

99
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,367
OHHH...

100
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,467
I THINK I'M GONNA QUIT
THE PHILARMONIC.

101
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,500
BUT YOU'RE...

102
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,667
BUT YOU'RE ONE OF
THEIR BEST VIOLINISTS!

103
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,367
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT...

104
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,367
PERFORMANCE ANXIETY
I GOT RID OF YEARS AGO?

105
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,200
I THINK IT'S BACK.

106
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,333
BUT IT WILL PASS, HARRY.

107
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,667
PLEASE, DON'T TELL
YOUR FATHER A WORD ABOUT THIS.

108
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,567
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE LOVES

109
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
WATCHING YOU PERFORM
IN THE ORCHESTRA.

110
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,467
YEAH.

111
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,200
YOU KNOW WHAT?

112
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,533
YOU'RE RIGHT.

113
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,600
I HATE DOING CHORES.

114
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,133
I'M NOT READING YOUR OBITUARY...

115
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,533

HAS WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

117

READ HIS OBITUARY.

FIND SOMETHING BETTER
TO DO WITH YOUR TIME?

119

WHY DON'T YOU WATCH
THE CHAPLIN DVD?

120
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,600
I WANNA KNOW HOW I'M GOING
TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE PUBLIC.

121
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,533

-NOBITUARY, DAD.

123
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,267

THIS "NOBITUARY" MEANS,

YOU TELL DAD YOU QUIT THERAPY?

175
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,433
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!

176
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,333
IT IS,

177
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,133
WHEN YOUR PSYCHIATRIST
IS IN MY PRACTICE,

178
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,667
AND I'M STILL YOUR BROTHER.

179
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,667
THERAPY IS FOR ROUGH PATCHES
AND I'VE SMOOTHED MINE OUT.

180
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,733
THEN WHY ARE YOU STILL TROLLING
AROUND LIKE A VAGRANT

181
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,033
LOOKING FOR YOUR DEAD DOG?

182
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,300
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THIS URN, TOMMY?

183
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,567
IF YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE IT
IS, DAD, I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

184
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
IT'S RIGHT IN HERE.

185
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,500
TOMMY!

186
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,400
EXCUSE ME, CAN YOU PLEASE
REMIND YOUR BROTHER

187
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,533
WHO THIS EVENING IS FOR?

188
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,400
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
POP WOULD DRAW A PICTURE?

189
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,033
HE'D SAY,

190
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,333
"JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURE,
WHATEVER YOU WANT...

191
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,100
"IMAGINE IT
AND IT WILL BE YOURS."

192
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,567
YEAH, IT'S WORKED FOR ME
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE...

193
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,033
BUT NOT NOW.

194
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,567
I HAVE TO HAVE THAT URN,

195
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,533
BUT HE'S NEVER GONNA
TELL ME WHERE IT IS.

196
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,400
OH GOD, HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS, TOMMY.

197
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,200
LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE.

198
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,433
-I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DOG.
-NO SHIT IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE DOG.

199
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,600
IT'S ABOUT YOUR OBSESSIONS.

200
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,733
IT'S WHY YOU STARTED WRITING.

201
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,700
YOUR STORIES COST ME AND
HARRY YEARS OF SLEEP.

202
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,133
YOU KNOW THAT?

203
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,700
YOU STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES,
JULIE?

204
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,300
I THINK I'VE GOTTEN OVER
YOUR GHOST STORIES BY NOW.

205
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,367
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT MY STORIES.

206
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,633
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE USED TO...

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,667
CRAWL INTO EACH OTHER'S BEDS
AFTER HAVING NIGHTMARES?

208
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,100
YEAH, OF COURSE.

209
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,433
SO WHAT IF I WAS TO TELL YOU
THAT THEY WERE REAL?

210
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN
KAZAN WAS REAL.

211
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,400
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE BRINGING THIS UP...

212
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,500
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT KAZAN.

213
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,300
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

214
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,133
SEE, SE WAS 8 YEARS
OLD WHEN HE HAD HIS
TONSILS TAKEN OUT.

215
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,267
THEN HE CHANGED.

216
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:38,867
BEFORE THE SURGERY,

217
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,100
I TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE
ALL THE ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD.

218
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,567
AND WHEN HE WOKE UP,

219
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,633
HE ASKED THE NURSES
FOR VANILLA AND THEN...

220
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,267
AND THEY SAID
HE COULDN'T HAVE ANY.

221
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,700
HE CRIED ALL NIGHT LONG.

222
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,533
SEE, THAT'S WHEN
I LOST HIS TRUST.

223
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,533
DAD, ICE CREAM
HAS NEVER CAUSED PTSD,

224
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,033
UNLESS I MISSED THAT CLASS.

225
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:01,667
CHECK.

226
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,533
WELL, LEONARD'S RIGHT.

227
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,567
IT WOULDN'T SAY MUCH
FOR MY CHARACTER

228
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,300
IF ALL MY VAGRANT-LIKE
TROLLING WAS CAUSED BY
ICE CREAM, WOULD IT?

229
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,100
WHAT IS IT, TOMMY?

230
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,767
TOMMY?

231
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,067
WHAT?

232
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,400
-DAD...
-MMMM?

233
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,167
PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW.

234
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700
THE ONLY THING
I HAVE TO GIVE YOU,

235
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,167
IF YOU'RE REALLY
LOOKING FOR YOUR DOG,

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,367
IS RIGHT THERE.

237
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,433

TOMMY, YOU NEED HELP.

345
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,133
COURSE YOU D SAY THAT.

346
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,100
'CAUSE HE KEPT YOU
IN THE DARK LIKE THE REST OF US.

347
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,567
DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
HOW MUCH THIS MAN LOVES YOU?

348
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,233
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE LOVES HIS
PATIENTS? JOSEPH MENGELE.

349
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,667
OH MY GOD!

350
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,367
WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY
PRESIDENTS CALLED DAD A
TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT?

351
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,467
I GUARANTEE YOU IT WASN'T
FOR SHOCKING MICE AND
HYPNOTIZING APES!

352
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,267
MENGELE, TOMMY!

353
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,567
NATHANIEL, PLEASE,
TAKE SOMETHING.

354
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,567
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

355
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,500
YOUR FATHER IS DYING.

356
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:37,200
AND ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT IS
HIS EMOTIONALLY-DISTRAUGHT SON

357
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,600
WHO COMPARES HIM TO A NAZI.

358
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,300
WE RE WORLDS PAST
EMOTIONALLY-DISTRAUGHT, MOM.

359
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,100
LEONARD, PLEASE.

360
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,767
TOMMY.

361
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,500
BACK IN '74,

362
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,667
I HAD A PATIENT WHO
SERVED IN VIETNAM.

363
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,733
TRAUMATIZED BEYOND ANYTHING
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY PRACTICE.

364
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,567
RETURNS FROM HIS TOUR OF DUTY

365
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,767
CONVINCED THAT
HE'S A SILENT ASSASSIN

366
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,500
WORKING FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

367
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,667
A VICTIM OF
MIND-CONTROL EXPERIMENTATION...

368
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,233
PROJECT BLUEBIRD.

369
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:18,700
SAYS AFTER THE WAR,
HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY CIA OPERATIVES...

370
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,333
LOCKED AWAY,

371
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,033
TORTURED FOR 6 MONTHS

372
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,700
TILL THEY BROKE HIM
INTO DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.

373
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:29,633
BUT HIS MILITARY RECORD SHOWED
HE WAS ACTUALLY IN MY LAI.

374
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:32,567
SEE,

375
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,067
BENEATH THE IMAGINARY STORY
WAS THE REAL STORY.

376
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,733
WHEN THE INCIDENT AT MY LAI
WAS BROUGHT UP,

377
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,433
HE HAD NO MEMORY OF IT AT ALL.

378
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,333
HE FOUGHT TO HOLD ON TO
THE FICTIONAL CONSPIRACY

379
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,100
THAT HAUNTED HIM.

380
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:50,133
THIS IS CALLED
DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA, TOMMY.

381
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:53,633
SO POWERFUL IS THE MIND,

382
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,667
SO IMAGINATIVE THE PSYCHE...

383
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,600
YOURS IS NO DIFFERENT.

384
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,667
THE THINGS YOU HAD
SEEN AS A CHILD

385
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,300
WERE UNLEASHED TO YOU
IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

386
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,267
NOW,

387
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,367
WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN HERE,

388
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,467
IS A COMPELLING

389
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,167
PIECE OF FICTION.

390
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,367
THAT'S ALL IT IS,
IT'S JUST FICTION.

391
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:22,600
OH, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU, TOMMY.

392
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,400
WE CREMATED THE DOG,

393
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,733
BUT WE NEVER BURIED
HIM IN AN URN.

394
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,300
WE JUST SPREAD HIS
ASHES OUT IN THE BACKYARD.

395
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,267
THAT'S IT.

396
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,033
I MAY BE THE WRITER, DAD,

397
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,433
BUT THAT'S NOT FICTION!

398
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,500
I'LL FIND IT MYSELF.

399
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,133
OK, THANK YOU.

400
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,067
BARNABIS CAN TAKE HIM TONIGHT.
I RESERVED A BED.

401
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,733
HOSPITALIZATION IS
NOT AN OPTION.

402
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,667
I CAN GET THROUGH TO HIM.

403
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,800
WHY DON'T YOU FEED HIM
SOME VANILLA ICE CREAM?

404
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,633
TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY,
MAYBE THAT'LL WORK.

405
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,733
OR I COULD RUN OUT,
GET AN URN.

406
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,533
NO, MA, MA!

407
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,367
IT'S OK.

408
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,333
CLEANING IS HOW
I RETAIN MY SANITY.

409
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:01,533
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE YOUR FATHER
ONE OF YOUR MASSAGES?

410
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:10,433
JULIE, IF YOU EVER GIVE UP
PHOTOGRAPHY, YOU COULD DO
THIS FOR A LIVING.

411
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,433
THANKS.

412
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,100
THANKS A LOT, DAD.

413
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,267
YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME
YOU'RE THINKING OF
MOVING BACK HOME.

414
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,367
DON'T DO IT FOR HIS SAKE, JULIE.

415
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,067
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TOMMY.
MOM S GONNA NEED HELP.

416
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,333
SOME OF THE BEST ADVICE
I EVER GOT WAS

417
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,800
NOT FROM A PSYCHIATRIST.

418
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,300
IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,
SET THEM FREE.

419
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,433
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE I'M A STING FAN.

420
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,367
NO, I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU AND BECAUSE

421
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,300
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A LIFE
OUTSIDE OF YOUR BROTHER.

422
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,533
THIS IS MY PROBLEM TO FIX.

423
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,667
I'M HIS PROTECTOR.

424
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:52,567
IF A MAN FAILS HIS FAMILY,
HE FAILS LIFE.

425
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,233
I WAS NEVER THE CAUSE
OF YOUR SUFFERING, TOMMY.

426
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:14,733
NEVER.

427
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,600
BUT I DID IT.

428
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:20,767
WHAT?

429
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,300
I DON'T HAVE THE URN.

430
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,333
BUT I HAVE THE CODES.

431
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:24,933
ONE,

432
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,767
TWENTY-SEVEN,

433
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:32,567
AND FOURTEEN, FIFTEEN,

434
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,200
SIXTEEN.

435
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,800
THOSE ARE OUR BIRTHDAYS.

436
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,667
YEAH.

437
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,233
IT'S EASY TO KNOW
WHEN TO SEND YOU
AND YOUR SIBLINGS OUT

438
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:51,133
ON A CLASSIFIED MISSION.

439
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,667
-YOU'RE LYING.
-YEAH, OF COURSE, I'M LYING.

440
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,300
AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW?

441
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,133
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SAID
TONIGHT WAS HORSESHIT.

442
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,267
NO MATTER HOW DEEP YOU DIG,

443
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,200
THE ONLY THING YOU'LL
FIND IS MORE SHIT,

444
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,333
AND MORE LIES!

445
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:08,133
LET ME JUST NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
AND CUT TO THE TRUTH...

446
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,000
-TELL ME!
-I'M GOING TO DIE!

447
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:13,600
YEAH, YOUR PROTECTOR.

448
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:16,067
THE MAN WHO SAVED YOUR LIFE...

449
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,233
...MANY TIMES.

450
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:37,233
YOU'RE REGRESSING TO THE STATE
BEFORE I ADOPTED YOU.

451
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:39,733
YOU HAD LOST YOUR PARENTS.

452
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,433
YOU WERE TERRIFIED.

453
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,633
YOU WERE HELPLESS.

454
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:47,300
I KNOW, I'VE BEEN THERE TOO.
I'VE BEEN TO THAT PLACE.

455
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,700
I KNOW THE FEELING WELL.

456
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,633
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
IN THE CLOSET

457
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,100
WITH THE ELECTRODES
AND THE DRILLS, TOMMY.

458
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:57,100
I'M JUST THE GUY THAT HELD YOU,
AND WOULDN'T LET YOU GO

459
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:58,567
UNTIL YOU COULD STAND
ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET.

460
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,367
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

461
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,733
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

462
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,367
NEITHER DO I.

463
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:21,433
SO LET'S JUST ENJOY THE TIME
THAT I'M STILL HERE...

464
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,633
TOGETHER.

465
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,767
AND JUST LAUGH AT DEATH.

466
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,367
THANK GOD FOR CHAPLIN!

467
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,333
TOMMY!

468
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:48,667
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
"THE GOLD RUSH".

469
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,767
AND YOU ALMOST HAD ME...

470
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,033
WITH YOUR "I'M NOT THE MONSTER
IN THE CLOSET" SPEECH.

471
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,167
TOMMY!

472
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,800
IT'S LIKE THIS
WHOLE FUCKING HOUSE

473
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,000
IS PART OF SOME EXPERIMENT.

474
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:07,100
YOU GUYS THINK IT'S AN ACCIDENT
THAT DAD'S DRAWINGS

475
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:10,233
FILL EVERY INCH OF
WALL SPACE IN THIS HOUSE?

476
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,067
YOU SEE A SKETCH OF A BIRD,
RIGHT?

477
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,500
THAT'S NOT A WING,
THAT'S A FUCKING CODE.

478
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,700
THEY'RE ALL FUCKING CODES!

479
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,367
LOOK AT THIS!
LOOK AT THIS!

480
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,300
YOU SEE A PICTURE
OF A LITTLE BOY
WITH HIS PARENTS, RIGHT?

481
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,200
YOU LOOK CLOSER,

482
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:30,233
YOU SEE THE GUIDING
HAND OF A MAD MAN!

483
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,700
THIS ISN'T OUR HOME.

484
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,433
IT'S A CRYPTIC,
PSYCHIATRIC AGENDA!

485
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,733
AND YOU!

486
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,267
OH, YOU ARE A MONSTER.

487
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,733
THIS IS A VALIUM.

488
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,167
TAKE IT, TOMMY.
IT'S NOT A REQUEST.

489
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,733
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FORGIVE
YOURSELF FOR TONIGHT.

490
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,533
HEY SIS, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
YOU ME AND HARRY,

491
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,367
WE MAKE ONE
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

492
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
CUT IT OUT, TOMMY!

493
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:13,233
I WILL GET THE CARROT NOSE
AND THE BLUEBERRY EYES.

494
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:14,233
HEY, YOU LOOK COOL.

495
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,700
THERE WE GO,
NOW HE LOOKS GOOD.

496
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,467
HE'S MISSING SOMETHING,

497
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,333
MISSING SOMETHING.
HERE WE GO.

498
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,567
SEE, THIS WAY, OLD FROSTY
HERE...

499
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,300
WILL LET EVERYBODY
KNOW THAT VISITS,

500
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,667
WHAT A NORMAL
FUCKING FAMILY WE GOT.

501
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,600
NOW, GIVE HIM A NAME.

502
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,167
WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?

503
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,033
WORST THING IN THE WORLD
I CAN DO

504
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,500
WOULD BE TO MOVE
BACK HOME FOR YOU.

505
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:40,467
DAD WAS RIGHT!

506
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,500
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

507
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,167
I CAN'T CURE YOU, TOMMY.

508
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,467
I WON'T.

509
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,133
LET THE RUMPUS BEGIN.

510
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,733
HARRY,

511
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:30,233
THE LAST TIME YOU
HAD THOSE TREMORS,
YOU WERE IN THERAPY.

512
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,000
HARRY?

513
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,500
WHAT IS IT?

514
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,367
MY SLEEP...

515
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,133
I...

516
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,667
I DON'T ANYMORE.

517
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,067
FIRE.

518
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:00,367
I SEE CHILDREN ON FIRE.

519
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,433
I JUST STAND THERE,

520
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,267
WATCH THEM BURN.

521
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,000
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

522
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:16,467
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE
SOMETHING BAD.

523
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:19,500
I FEEL...

524
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,767
I WAKE UP AND I FEEL LIKE A...

525
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,567
I FEEL LIKE A MURDERER.

526
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,633
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

527
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,533
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN THIS WAY, HARRY?

528
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,133
I DON'T KNOW.

529
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,700
BE HONEST, HARRY.

530
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,400
IT STARTED
WHEN TOMMY MOVED IN.

531
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:47,433
HARRY, HOW CAN I HELP YOU
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?
TELL ME.

532
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:48,667
I DON'T KNOW, I...

533
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
I JUST...

534
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,633
I JUST NEED TO BELIEVE
THAT NOTHING WENT
WRONG IN THIS HOUSE.

535
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,767
WHY?

536
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,033
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?

537
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,067
I DON'T KNOW.

538
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:12,533
DO YOU THINK...?

539
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:16,333
DO YOU THINK I HAD PEOPLE

540
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,000
PERFORM MIND-CONTROL
EXPERIMENTS ON YOU?

541
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
I DON'T KNOW.

542
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,767
I JUST...

543
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,200
I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MYSELF,
THAT S ALL.

544
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,233
THE POWER LINES MUST HAVE
FROZEN.

545
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:09,567
THEN TRY EXPLAINING WHY THE REST
OF THE BLOCK HAS ELECTRICITY.

546
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,167
I HAD TO BLOCK THE TRANSMISSION.

547
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,633
TOMMY?

548
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:14,333
TOMMY?

549
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:19,600
THERE'S THOUSANDS
OF MICROSCOPIC SLEEVES
IN MY SKULL,

550
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:23,067
THIS IS HOW THE
ELECTRODES ACCESS MY BRAIN.

551
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,767
THESE WIRES DAD WON'T FIX,
THEY'RE NOT FAULTY.

552
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,667
THEY'RE SET UP WITH
TRANSMITTERS...

553
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,133
NO!

554
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,633
PLEASE!
IF YOU HAVE ANY CELL PHONES,

555
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:38,167
TURN THEM OFF FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT!

556
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,467
IF HE WASN'T YOUR
SON, YOU'D ALREADY
HAVE HIM COMMITTED.

557
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,633
I WON'T ABANDON TOMMY,

558
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,333
OR ANY OF MY CHILDREN.

559
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,700
YOU'RE NOT ABANDONING
YOUR CHILDREN,

560
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:53,300
YOU'RE ABANDONING YOUR REASON.

561
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,333
HARRY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

562
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,333
LOOKING FOR THE ASHES
OF THE BURNED CHILDREN?

563
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,633
LOOK, EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT
TO INVESTIGATE THEIR PAST.

564
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,133
DAD SAID MY PARENTS WERE KILLED
BY REBELS, WHAT ELSE?

565
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,800
HARRY, WE NEVER HELD
ANYTHING BACK FROM YOU.

566
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,167
DID I DO SOMETHING VICIOUS?

567
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,533
NO, HARRY, NO!

568
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,133
DID I KILL ANYBODY?

569
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,800
DID I SET FIRE TO A HOME
FILLED WITH KIDS?

570
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,400
NO, THAT S PREPOSTEROUS!

571
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,100
MAYBE...

572
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:19,733
YOU'RE SHIELDING ME, TOO.

573
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,533
MAYBE YOU'RE SHIELDING
ALL OF US.

574
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,400
DON'T DO THIS TO DAD, HARRY.

575
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,400
FUCK YOU, LEONARD.

576
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THESE?

577
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,733
I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

578
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:00,433
BEFORE WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE,
IT CAME WITH A BOMB SHELTER.

579
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,233
YOUR MOTHER KEPT THE
ORIGINAL PHOTOS
UNTIL WE MADE OUR BID.

580
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,500
-I'VE BEEN IN THAT ROOM.
-THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

581
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:06,633
WE SEALED IT UP,

582
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,367
GREW THE GARDEN OVER IT
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE MOVED IN.

583
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,067
THEN HOW WOULD I KNOW
THAT SPACE IF I'VE
NEVER SEEN THESE PICTURES?

584
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,700
MAYBE YOU HEARD YOUR FATHER
TALK ABOUT IT.

585
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:16,267
NO, I'VE SEEN THAT SPACE
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE!

586
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,567
I KNOW THAT ROOM!

587
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,200
I KNOW THAT ROOM TOO.

588
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,500
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DO,

589
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:29,333
BUT I'VE DEFINITELY SEEN
THAT ROOM BEFORE.

590
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:30,467
THIS IS FREAKING ME OUT.

591
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,600
-I DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS.
-DAD...

592
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:34,567
I REMEMBER THIS, IT WAS...

593
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,333
DANK...

594
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,600
REALLY STUFFY,
NOT A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE,

595
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:43,633
REALLY TIGHT LITTLE SPACE.

596
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:47,600
THE FLOOR WAS MADE OF CONCRETE,
AND IT SMELT A LOT LIKE

597
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,400
- RUBBING ALCOHOL.
- RUBBING ALCOHOL.

598
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:54,433
WHO S BULLSHITTING WHO, DOCTOR?

599
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:57,300
SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?

600
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,533
THIS FAMILY HAS BOUGHT
THE FARM AND THE FERTILIZER.

601
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,500
WHERE IS IT?

602
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:04,367
TOMMY, THAT PLACE WAS
SEALED DECADES AGO!

603
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,333
WHICH WAY WAS IT?

604
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,633
THE GARDEN?

605
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,767
YOU CAN'T TELL MOM AND DAD
ABOUT THIS, YOU HEAR?

606
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,633
THIS IS OUR LITTLE SECRET.

607
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:28,067
NOBODY ELSE CAN KNOW.

608
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,267
YOU'RE BLINDED
BY YOUR DEVOTION TO TOMMY.

609
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,367
LOOK WHAT IT'S COST TO HARRY.

610
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,400
I KNOW THAT I TOOK
THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

611
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:59,400
AND IT SCARES
THE SHIT OUT OF ME BECAUSE

612
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:03,067
I CAN JUST FEEL THAT
SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPPEN

613
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,567
TO TOMMY AND HARRY BECAUSE OF
THE PERSON IN THE FOREGROUND.

614
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,733
IT'S JUST YOUR HEAD
PLAYING TRICKS, JULIE.

615
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,233
OF COURSE
YOU'RE GONNA SAY THAT...

616
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,500
BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS YOU.

617
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:16,233
JESUS CHRIST!

618
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:20,267
SO, NOW I'M PART OF
DAD S IMAGINARY FOOT SOLDIERS?

619
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
IF DAD WANTED TO RECRUIT,

620
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,667
HE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
HAVE TO LOOK ANY FURTHER
THAN HIS OWN ELDEST SON.

621
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,033
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU,
JULIE?

622
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:30,600
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

623
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:32,500
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

624
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,700
YOU GOT TOMMY'S VIRUS,
ALL OF YOU.

625
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,233
HE'S POISONED YOU AGAINST ME.

626
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:40,000
I WOULDN'T GIVE HIM
THAT MUCH CREDIT.

627
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:02,667
THIRTY-FIVE NESTS
WE COUNTED THAT YEAR.

628
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,667
NOW HE'S TURNED THE ROBIN INTO
SOME HORRIBLE SYMBOL OF...

629
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,300
CHILD ABUSE.

630
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,267
REMEMBER THAT WEEKEND
YOU WENT TO THE CONFERENCE,

631
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,567
AND I VISITED MY MOTHER,

632
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,100
IN '85.

633
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,767
THAT'S WHEN HE BEGAN TO CHANGE.

634
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,300
HE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.

635
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:30,000
THERE'S SOME...

636
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:36,200
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED ME.

637
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:40,133
LEONARD WAS TAKING CARE
OF THE KIDS.

638
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,733
I ASKED HIM IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE AWAY

639
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,267
AND HE SAID NOTHING.

640
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,133
LEONARD ALWAYS FELT
THREATENED BY THE OTHERS.

641
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,367
I THINK HE FELT WE GAVE THEM

642
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,767
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
AND HE RESENTED THAT.

643
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,767
LOOK AT HIM NOW.

644
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,967
HOW HE'S THRIVED.

645
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,433
WHAT I THINK MOM IS TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT MAYBE I RAPED,

646
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,733
MOLESTED AND TORTURED
TOMMY AND THE OTHERS.

647
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:03,733
NO...

648
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,600
IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE THE WOMEN OF THIS FAMILY

649
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:07,567
WOULD LIKE TO POINT TO ME
AS THE CULPRIT.

650
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,133
-TALK TO JULIE LATELY?
-OH, LEONARD.

651
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,200
DON'T LIE.

652
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,533
-ALWAYS HATED ME.
-THAT'S ABSURD!

653
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:14,733
YOU AND DAD, BOTH...

654
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,400
YOU TREAT THEM A LITTLE BETTER.

655
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:18,367
I ACCEPTED THAT.

656
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:21,400
I GOT THE GENES,
BUT I DIDN'T GET THE ATTENTION.

657
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:22,500
AND I UNDERSTOOD WHY.

658
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,567
BUT I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
I DIDN'T TAKE THAT PERSONALLY.

659
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,300
I NEVER ACTED ON IT...

660
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,567
NOT LIKE HOW YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

661
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,767
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THE HELL I'M THINKING.

662
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,367
SORRY, DAD.

663
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:41,133
I LOVE YOU BOTH,

664
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:44,133
BUT I REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE

665
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,667
YOUR BIOLOGICAL SON

666
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,700
MATTERED A LOT LESS
IN THIS HOUSE.

667
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,600
JANUARY 14TH...

668
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:56,300
1981.

669
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,767
THAT'S WHEN
YOU BROUGHT TOMMY HERE.

670
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,733
WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?

671
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,500
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME,

672
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,233
HE'LL TURN THE CHILDREN
INTO ICICLES.

673
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:13,667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HARRY?

674
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,333
I SAW THE RED ROBIN, TOMMY.

675
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,400
RED ROBIN?

676
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,467
I KNOW...

677
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,333
I KNOW WHO STARTED THE FIRES

678
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,500
THAT KILLED THE CHILDREN.

679
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:32,467
I KNOW WHO MADE THE
PATHWAYS IN YOUR SKULL.

680
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,767
THE ROBIN'S IN THE
KITCHEN, TOMMY.

681
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,033
I SAW IT.

682
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,200
YOU WANT THE ROBIN?

683
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,133
IT'LL LEAD YOU TO THE URN.

684
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,033
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S IN THE KITCHEN?

685
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:47,167
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE, HARRY!

686
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,133
I SAW THE ROBIN, TOMMY.

687
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,567
IT ALL MADE SENSE.

688
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:00,367
HARRY!

689
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
TOMMY!

690
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,300
TOMMY, WHAT HAPPENED?

691
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:24,533
HARRY!

692
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:26,233
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM, TOMMY?

693
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,633
HE'S GOING TO BE OK.

694
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,300
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

695
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,767
HE'S GONNA BE OK.

696
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,467
HE TRIED TO SHOOT HIMSELF.

697
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,367
HE ONLY GRAZED HIS EAR,
BUT HE'S GONNA BE OK.

698
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,300
BUT WHY?

699
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:39,200
YOU'VE NO RIGHT
TO ASK THAT QUESTION.

700
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,567
YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A NAME...

701
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,267
HE'LL TURN ALL THE
CHILDREN INTO ICICLES...

702
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,500
WHAT? HARRY!

703
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,333
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM
A NAME, HE'LL TURN THE
CHILDREN INTO ICICLES.

704
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,533
WHAT? YOU'RE WHAT?

705
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,067
ICICLES WILL MELT AWAY
INTO THE EARTH.

706
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,700
LEONARD, CALL AN AMBULANCE!

707
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,167
MOM, NO AMBULANCE.

708
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,767
TOMMY?

709
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,067
MOTHER...

710
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,267
TOMMY!

711
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,800
HARRY SAID THE RED ROBIN
WAS IN THE KITCHEN.

712
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,733
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
THE RED ROBIN?

713
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:28,267
HE SAID IT'S WHAT
DID THIS TO US.

714
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,267
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,

715
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,500
OR I BELIEVE ANYTHING
YOU'VE SAID.

716
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:24,033
NEVER SEEN THESE KEYS BEFORE.
WHAT ARE THEY FOR?

717
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:25,667
TORTURE CHAMBER?
BOMB SHELTER?

718
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,600
I DON'T KNOW.

719
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,467
HARRY SAID THE RED ROBIN'S
IN THE KITCHEN.

720
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,733
THAT MUST BE
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT!

721
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,267
LEONARD, STOP!

722
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,267
STOP IT!
LEONARD, STOP IT!

723
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,000
STOP THAT! STOP IT!

724
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,733
TOMMY! TOMMY!

725
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:41,600
TOMMY!

726
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,467
LEONARD, STAND UP!

727
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

728
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,233
HE'S MINE NOW.

729
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:55,133
CAN YOU SIT DOWN?

730
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,000
LEONARD, WHERE YOU TAKING HIM?

731
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,067
LEONARD!

732
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,600
HEY, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

733
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,100
WHERE'S TOMMY?

734
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,333
LEONARD, WHERE IS TOMMY?

735
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,300
FUCK YOU!

736
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:38,400
LEONARD!

737
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:42,567
LEONARD!

738
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:47,700
LEONARD!

739
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,200
LEONARD!

740
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,633
HERE, SWEETHEART.

741
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,600
TAKE IT.

742
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:05,467
OK.

743
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,500
CALL IN THE CHILDREN.

744
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,400
TOMMY'S FINE.

745
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,633
BARNABIS IS ON ITS WAY.

746
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,300
YOU'D BETTER HAVE YOURSELF
A STIFF DRINK.

747
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,200
I DON'T DRINK.

748
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,233
NEITHER DID YOUR MOTHER.

749
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:34,400
IN 1957, I WAS APPOINTED
DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH

750
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:37,733
AT THE JOINT-US
MILITARY PSYCHIATRIC

751
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,733
TESTING AND EVALUATION CENTER

752
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,733
AT QUANTICO, VIRGINIA.

753
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:46,433
I WAS SELECTED TO BE

754
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:49,533
ON THE FRONT LINE OF
OUR WAR AGAINST COMMUNISM.

755
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,433
THE OFFICE OF
SPECIAL SERVICES AND THE CIA

756
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,500
LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN,

757
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,300
MK-ULTRA,

758
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:04,700
TO ROOT OUT THE ENEMY...

759
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:07,733
NOT BY THE USE OF
BULLETS OR BOMBS BUT...

760
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:11,600
BY THE USE OF THE BRAIN
AS A WEAPON OF CHOICE.

761
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,500
SURE, I WAS A LEAD
PSYCHIATRIST IN MY FIELD.

762
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:24,533
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON
THAT THEY PUT ME IN CHARGE.

763
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:32,767
YOU SEE,
I WAS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD...

764
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,667
WHEN MY FAMILY WAS
VISITED BY THE FRIENDS
OF STALIN'S REGIME,

765
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,433
AND I HAD MY FIRST
REAL TASTE OF...

766
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,533
COMMUNISM.

767
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,600
A FEW YEARS INTO THE CAMPAIGN,

768
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:10,233
WHEN WE WERE TOLD THAT
WE'D BE EXPERIMENTING ON...

769
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:12,167
RUSSIAN SPIES,

770
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,733
NORTH VIETNAMESE
PRISONERS OF WAR,

771
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:16,633
SUSPECTED CHINESE SUBVERSIVES,

772
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,567
I THOUGHT...

773
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,567
"THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO GET EVEN WITH THOSE...

774
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,733
"FUCKING COMMUNISTS!"

775
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:27,700
I THOUGHT OF THAT
8-YEAR-OLD BOY...

776
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,133
AND WHAT HE SAW...

777
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:39,033
AND I THOUGHT...

778
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:45,667
HOW I COULD

779
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,433
MAKE HIM FORGET

780
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,467
ABOUT THAT AWFUL DAY FOREVER.

781
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:04,567
YEARS LATER
INTO THE EXPERIMENTS,

782
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,067
I REALIZED THAT THE PATIENTS

783
01:03:09,267 --> 01:03:13,167
WERE NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD,
ENEMIES OF AMERICA.

784
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:15,500
THEY WERE AMERICANS.

785
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,700
MOSTLY SOLDIERS.

786
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:20,667
MEN WHO WERE
SO TRAUMATIZED BY WAR,

787
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,033
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THEY WERE.

788
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:27,300
"EXPENDABLES,"
OUR GOVERNMENT CALLED THEM.

789
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,100
MEN WHO COULD BE
EASILY PROGRAMMED.

790
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:34,567
BUT...

791
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:39,100
THE EXPERIMENTS WENT ON,
REGARDLESS.

792
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,533
BUT I RESIGNED WHEN
LEONARD WAS BORN.

793
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:51,067
ANYONE TOUCHING MY CHILDREN,
THE THOUGHT OF THAT WAS...

794
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,300
PLEASE, BELIEVE ME,

795
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,567
WHEN I TELL YOU THAT
NOBODY IN THIS FAMILY

796
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,733
HAS EVER BEEN EXPERIMENTED ON.

797
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:30,300
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

798
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,667
YOU...

799
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,300
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE...

800
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,533
SCIENTISTS IN TOMMY'S STORY?

801
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:39,267
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

802
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,667
HE'S NOT WELL.

803
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,233
THIS IS THE MORPHINE.

804
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:45,333
HOW I WISH THAT WAS SO.

805
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:46,533
NATHANIEL!

806
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:49,767
YOU KNOW IT'S A LIE!
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF THOSE THINGS!

807
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,167
LOOK AT THE GREAT THINGS
THAT YOU'VE DONE.

808
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,033
THIS IS NATHANIEL SHELLNER,
THIS IS MY FATHER,

809
01:04:55,067 --> 01:04:57,433
NOT SOME MAD SCIENTIST.

810
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:58,433
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.

811
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:03,467
AND YOU'RE SICK.

812
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,067
AND YOU'RE DESPERATE
FOR TOMMY'S ATTENTION.

813
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:13,000
SO MUCH SO THAT
YOU'D INCRIMINATE YOURSELF,

814
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,400
THAT YOU WOULD RUIN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE'S WORK.

815
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,133
YOU LIED.

816
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,300
-LEONARD!
-LEONARD!

817
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,767
STOP IT, HE CAN'T BREATH!

818
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,000
STOP!

819
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:35,400
LEONARD! HE CAN'T BREATHE!
GET OFF!

820
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:38,033
PLEASE, LET GO!

821
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:40,300
MOM!

822
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,167
TOMMY!

823
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,633
TOMMY!

824
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:16,267
THERE WAS A TIME

825
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,333
BEFORE WE ADOPTED

826
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:23,633
WHEN YOU WOULD TAKE
THESE LONG BUSINESS TRIPS.

827
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:26,200
AND...

828
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:29,267
I NEVER ASKED WHY OR WHERE.

829
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,400
I NEVER MEANT
TO KEEP YOU IN THE DARK.

830
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:38,500
WE WEREN'T ALLOWED
TO TELL ANYONE,
NOT EVEN OUR SPOUSES.

831
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:40,367
BUT IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME,

832
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,533
I WOULD'VE SAID CHOOSE ME
OR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.

833
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,333
AND THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE
WHERE WE ARE THIS EVENING.

834
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,767
I NEVER LAID A FINGER
ON THOSE CHILDREN.

835
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,600
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T,

836
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:52,100
AND MAYBE YOU DID.

837
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,233
YOU CERTAINLY TOUCHED
OTHER PEOPLE S CHILDREN.

838
01:06:56,267 --> 01:07:00,300
LILLIAN, SOLDIERS WHO WERE
FAR PAST THE BREAKING POINT,

839
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,800
BEFORE THE AGENCY
GOT HOLD OF THEM.

840
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:05,233
AND WHAT ABOUT OUR KIDS?

841
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:08,467
WHEN WE FOUND THEM,
WEREN'T THEY PAST THE
BREAKING POINT?

842
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,300
I QUIT WORKING
FOR THE GOVERNMENT

843
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,500
BEFORE WE ADOPTED THEM.

844
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:16,067
YEAH, BUT THEY KEEP YOU
ON A SHORT LEASH.

845
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,767
AND YOU ARE STILL IN TOUCH
WITH YOU CRONIES.

846
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,500
NATHAN...

847
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,167
DID YOU EXPERIMENT

848
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,233
ON OUR CHILDREN?

849
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,267
NEVER.

850
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,100
NEVER!

851
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:44,167
VIETNAM VETS,

852
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,300
POLITICAL PRISONERS,

853
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,333
RANDOM CIVILIANS.

854
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,067
HOW MANY?

855
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:54,400
MAYBE 500 OR 1,000.

856
01:07:54,433 --> 01:07:56,267
THE RECORDS WERE SHREDDED,
YOU KNOW.

857
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:24,200
GIVE HIM WHAT HE CAME FOR.

858
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,133
GIVE HIM A FUCKING URN.

859
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,333
TRUTH COMES OUT.

860
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:48,167
THERE IS ENOUGH MORPHINE
IN THIS SYRINGE TO KILL
FIVE PEOPLE.

861
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:56,100
YOU THINK I WANT
TO INJECT YOU WITH THIS?

862
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,133
GET ARRESTED
FOR MURDERING MY FATHER?

863
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,000
BE LOCKED UP,

864
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:00,467
TRUTH NEVER COMES OUT,
THAT'S JUST...

865
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,200
-TOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-YOU STAY BACK!

866
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:17,233
SEE, NOW YOU CONFESSED
YOUR SINS TO THE FAMILY...

867
01:09:17,267 --> 01:09:18,500
AND NOW I WANT
THE FUCKING URN.

868
01:09:23,533 --> 01:09:25,100
WHERE IS IT, DAD?

869
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,233
TOMMY.

870
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,633
I TOLD YOU THE ROBIN
WAS IN THE KITCHEN.

871
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:36,767
YOU HAVE A CONCUSSION, HARRY.

872
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,033
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME...

873
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:41,733
CHRIST!

874
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:44,267
HE'LL KIDNAP ALL THE CHILDREN...

875
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,233
I KNOW THE FUCKING STORY, OK?

876
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,133
AND TURN THEM INTO ICICLES...

877
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,533
I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT
THE ICICLES RIGHT NOW, OK?

878
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:54,467
HE...

879
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,700
WILL KIDNAP THE CHILDREN
AND TURN THEM INTO ICICLES.

880
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,633
IT WAS NEVER A STORY, TOMMY.

881
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:11,200
IT WAS NEVER A STORY.

882
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:20,633
BACK IN '74, I HAD A PATIENT
WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM.

883
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,533
RETURNS FROM HIS TOUR OF DUTY

884
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,767
CONVINCED THAT HE'S
A SILENT ASSASSIN

885
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,533
WORKING FOR
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

886
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:30,300
VICTIM OF
MIND-CONTROL EXPERIMENTATION...

887
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:31,633
PROJECT BLUEBIRD.

888
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,767
WE CREMATED THE DOG,

889
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,667
BUT WE NEVER BURIED
HIM IN AN URN.

890
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,433
IT'S LIKE THIS WHOLE
FUCKING HOUSE...

891
01:10:42,467 --> 01:10:43,933
IS PART OF SOME EXPERIMENT.

892
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,433
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT
GROWING UP AROUND CIVIL
WAR COULD DO TO A CHILD.

893
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:49,367
I'VE SEEN THAT SPACE
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE,

894
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,267
I KNOW THAT ROOM!

895
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,000
SO POWERFUL IS THE MIND.

896
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,500
SO IMAGINATIVE THE PSYCHE.

897
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:56,100
THE TRUTH COMES IN 3 STAGES.

898
01:10:56,133 --> 01:10:57,300
FIRST IT IS RIDICULED,

899
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,567
THEN VIOLENTLY OPPOSED,
THEN IT BECOMES SELF-EVIDENT.

900
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,500
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
IN THE CLOSET...

901
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:03,700
WITH THE ELECTRODES
AND THE DRILLS, TOMMY.

902
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:07,200
DAD, PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW.

903
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:10,333
WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN HERE IS A
COMPELLING PIECE OF FICTION.

904
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,300
THAT'S ALL IT IS,
JUST FICTION.

905
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,600
I'M ELIZABETH ROBINS.

906
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:18,633
MANY YEARS AGO, YOUR HUSBAND...

907
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,600
TRIED TO HELP MY SON,

908
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:22,667
JOSEPH.

909
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:25,600
THIS IS MY SON.

910
01:11:32,067 --> 01:11:34,433
ONE OF OUR FIRST EXPERIMENTS,

911
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,400
HE WAS DEPLOYED,

912
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:38,733
NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN.

913
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:25,133
OH MY GOD...

914
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:33,400
OH MY GOD!

915
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,433
YOU CAN'T TELL MOM AND DAD
ABOUT THIS, OK?

916
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,600
THIS IS OUR LITTLE SECRET,
NOBODY ELSE CAN KNOW.

917
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:42,600
IF THEY FOUND OUT
THAT I WENT AWAY,
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME.

918
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:46,133
YOU GUYS CAN HANDLE THINGS
WHILE I'M AWAY, JUST...

919
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:48,433
DON'T LET ANY STRANGERS
IN THE HOUSE.

920
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:50,400
LEONARD!

921
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:17,767
YOU'RE DEAD!

922
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:34,633
I'VE WORKED WITH YOUR FATHER.

923
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:37,200
I KNOW HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS, SO

924
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:40,067
I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE
HIS CHILDREN WITH SOME PRESENTS.

925
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,733
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

926
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:57,733
HE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

927
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,733
WELL I HEARD IF YOU
DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME,

928
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:06,233
HE'LL KIDNAP ALL THE CHILDREN

929
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:08,200
AND TURN THEM INTO ICICLES.

930
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,233
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

931
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:29,067
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

932
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,400
THE SHADOW DOCTOR TOLD US

933
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,367
IF WE GAVE HIM A NAME,

934
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,533
HE'D TURN US ALL INTO ICICLES.

935
01:14:43,367 --> 01:14:47,233
THAT WAY, WE'D NEVER
REMEMBER WHO HE WAS.

936
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,400
DOCTOR SHELLNER.

937
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:56,567
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD

938
01:14:57,733 --> 01:15:00,100
WHY I BECAME
SO SCARED OF ICICLES

939
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:02,267
SUDDENLY IN MY ADULT LIFE.

940
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,633
I KNOW YOU KIDS MUST BE SCARED.

941
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:18,700
BUT YOU MUST LOOK AT ME
AS YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL,

942
01:15:19,567 --> 01:15:21,667
HERE TO PROTECT YOU.

943
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,033
THE WORLD...

944
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,133
IS A DANGEROUS PLACE.

945
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,633
SO WE HAVE TO HIDE.

946
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,200
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LEARN TO TRUST ME.

947
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:36,233
GET OFF HIM!

948
01:15:36,267 --> 01:15:38,467
TRUST WHAT I'M DOING
IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

949
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,667
STOP IT, PLEASE!

950
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,433
TRUST I'M GONNA CARE FOR YOU
AS IF YOU WERE MY VERY OWN.

951
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:45,967
TRUST.

952
01:15:59,067 --> 01:16:01,733
72 HOURS AND YOU
ALREADY HAVE THAT GAZE.

953
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,500
THIS IS GREAT PROGRESS,
MY LITTLE ONES.

954
01:16:12,433 --> 01:16:13,300
ARE YOU VIETNAMESE?

955
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,100
YOU KNOW,
I WAS NEVER IN MY LAI.

956
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:19,033
BUT YOUR DAD PUT
A CHIP IN MY HEAD

957
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:21,500
SO I COULDN'T REMEMBER
THE EXPERIMENTS.

958
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,333
HE CONVINCED ME
I BURNED CHILDREN ALIVE.

959
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:26,733
FIRES...

960
01:16:28,433 --> 01:16:31,333
THAT'S ALL I EVER DREAMED ABOUT.

961
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,733
I COULDN'T SLEEP
THE LAST 5 YEARS.

962
01:16:38,133 --> 01:16:39,767
YOU HAVE THE GAZE.

963
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,233
YOU KNOW I'M NOT HERE
TO HURT YOU, HONEY.

964
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:48,267
RIGHT?

965
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:51,000
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
IN THE CLOSET.

966
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,333
THIS IS YOUR DAD'S
PARTING GIFT TO ME...

967
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:02,367
AN URN.

968
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,067
HE KEPT ME AWAKE FOR A WEEK,

969
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:08,600
FORCED ME TO STARE AT IT,

970
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:11,767
HYPNOTIZED ME TO BELIEVE...

971
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:15,400
I KILLED MY OWN MOTHER...

972
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:16,767
AND CREMATED HER.

973
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:34,500
YOUR FATHER HAD A STRANGE
FASCINATION WITH BIRDS.

974
01:17:34,533 --> 01:17:37,667
HOW HE KNEW ONE WAS
SPLIT FROM THE SELF AND
READY TO BE AN ALTER.

975
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:41,533
TO TAKE A BABY BIRD'S LIFE

976
01:17:41,567 --> 01:17:43,733
MEANT ONE WAS
SUCCESSFULLY ALTERED.

977
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:49,200
BEAUTIFUL CREATURES,

978
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:51,200
HARBINGERS OF SPRING.

979
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:55,800
BUT SEASONS COME

980
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,267
AND GO.

981
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:16,367
NOW, YOUR TURN.

982
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,233
YOU MUST KILL WITHOUT
CONSCIENCE OR REGRET.

983
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,267
DON'T WORRY.

984
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,567
I'M YOUR PROTECTOR.

985
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:56,267
AS I THOUGHT...

986
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,767
YOU AREN'T PRIMED
FOR PROGRAMMING YET.

987
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,567
I WAS JUST LIKE YOU.

988
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,300
SEE, YOUR DAD...

989
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,633
GAVE ME A TRANSORBITAL LOBOTOMY,

990
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,300
HAMMERED A PICK LIKE THIS
RIGHT THROUGH MY EYE SOCKET,

991
01:19:15,633 --> 01:19:17,133
FREED ME...

992
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:29,467
GET BACK HERE!

993
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,700
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME,

994
01:19:44,733 --> 01:19:47,633
HE'LL TURN ALL THE
CHILDREN INTO ICICLES!

995
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:03,667
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME...

996
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,600
HE'LL TURN ALL THE
CHILDREN INTO ICICLES.

997
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,600
YOU, SONOFABITCH!

998
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,000
TOMMY! TOMMY!

999
01:20:55,133 --> 01:20:57,700
YOUR CHILDREN ARE READY
TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY, DOCTOR.

1000
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,400
OH MY GOD!

1001
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:07,567
MY CHILDREN...

1002
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:14,267
OH MY GOD!
WHAT HAS HE DONE TO YOU?

1003
01:23:11,267 --> 01:23:12,500
SIT DOWN.

1004
01:23:47,433 --> 01:23:50,267
I THOUGHT I COULD UNDO WHAT

1005
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,567
JOSEPH HAD DONE.

1006
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:59,500
THAT I COULD MAKE IT
AS IF IT NEVER HAPPENED.

1007
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:06,467
I ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN PROGRAMMING HARRY TO

1008
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,167
FORGET WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS BIOLOGICAL FAMILY.

1009
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:13,367
SO I KNEW THAT

1010
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,067
THE SCIENCE WORKED.

1011
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:23,333
I THOUGHT EXPERIMENTATION COULD
BE USED TO GOOD ENDS, AND...

1012
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,167
IT WAS MY PROBLEM TO FIX.

1013
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:31,667
YOUR MOTHER AND
LEONARD NEVER KNEW.

1014
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:36,100
I WAS RESPONSIBLE.

1015
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:20,033
DAD WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

1016
01:26:01,433 --> 01:26:03,067
IT'S OK.

1017
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,067
IT'S OK.

1018
01:26:19,233 --> 01:26:20,633
A MONSTER...

1019
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,000
A MONSTER WHO LOVES HIS CHILDREN

1020
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,600
MORE THAN LIFE

1021
01:26:29,433 --> 01:26:31,200
IS STILL A MONSTER.
