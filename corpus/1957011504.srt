00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:32,482
IN THE HEART OF THE MIRACLE

2
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:37,113
BYSTRICA
a town in Slovakia 1944

3
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:01,021
Stop shaking my
distributor or break up!

4
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,860
That's enough enough!

5
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:08,944
Hello sir.

6
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,951
I am looking for someone.

7
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,100
It's too late.

8
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,227
I beg your pardon?

9
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,387
He called you.

10
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,269
Hey, I can have my key please.

11
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,420
Listen, you know the rule

12
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,859
pay your rent if
you want your key, understand?

13
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,265
No, no one called me.

14
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,270
Of course he did, he called the church,
he called Saint Cecilia

15
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,465
for a priest to come and give him the ...

16
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,859
the last sacraments.

17
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,105
Extreme anointing?

18
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,150
I'm sure I paid my rent!

19
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,459
No,  you didn't pay it, then break my balls more!

20
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,908
Yeah, that's it. Except that no one showed up, all right?

21
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,150
He is dead ?

22
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,505
Yeah, you come fine for
old Joe Pinella, right?

23
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,944
Oh no.

24
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,590
I'm looking for Frank Shore.

25
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,068
He is still alive.

26
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,059
Where is he ?

27
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,380
If he's not in his room, try
the soup kitchen opposite, on the 10th.

28
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,544
Who wants to give me his share
pie today?

29
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,589
Say, you give me your slice of pie?
Come on be nice, give me your pie.

30
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,228
- Yo man, you give me your piece of pie?
- No, but you're not? Let go of me !

31
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,749
I want a piece of pie
who will give me his share of the pie.

32
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,579
Sorry.

33
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,948
- How are you today, Frank?
- Alright, thank you Beverly.

34
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:15,018
1,2,3,4,5 and 6.

35
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:21,348
Oh the pretty slice of pie. Tell me
the deal, eh, come on, I'll owe you that.

36
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,308
Here, my old Higgins.

37
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:24,219
Don't you have 1 or 2 steaks too?

38
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:30,738
What are you doing ?

39
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,296
I thank the Lord.

40
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,657
I will pray for you.

41
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,507
Thanks, that's nice.

42
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,418
I will pray for you.

43
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:40,457
I will pray for you.

44
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:45,747
Oh yes. I will pray for you.

45
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,736
Frank?

46
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:49,782
John.

47
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,467
Frank, this would be extreme.

48
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,340
Yes, but at least it's filling.

49
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,947
I wasn't talking about the food.

50
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:57,902
Sit down.

51
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,095
So ... are you writing a new book?

52
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,334
No. Absolutely not.

53
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:11,900
I made my students read "The God Within",
it's a good book, Frank. They loved it.

54
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,541
It is true ?

55
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,185
What do you do with your days then?

56
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,495
I live.

57
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,066
The 40 days and nights in the desert thing, I can understand,

58
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,215
but it's been 8 months.

59
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:26,778
How did you find me?

60
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,341
Frank, don't tell me that
you feel in your place here!

61
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,944
I don't know that, John.

62
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,374
You left without telling anyone.

63
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,375
I...

64
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:42,459
The truth is, Cahill wants to see you.

65
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,464
He needs you

66
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,224
He has need of you.

67
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:52,102
So unless you've decided
to no longer be one of us ...

68
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,537
I tried not to take too much
decisions lately.

69
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,901
You have taken a vow of obedience.
Cahill wants to see you.

70
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,578
You'll see, it's that simple. It's time to go.

71
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,697
You mustn't have opened a newspaper since
a long time otherwise you would know about it.

72
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,542
Was there another one?

73
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:35,823
A marble statue of the Virgin who stands
found in the courtyard of the Saint Stanislas school.

74
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,223
You know this neighborhood well,
you grew up there.

75
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:40,702
- Yes, I went to Sainte Bonnie.
- Perfect. You will have no trouble finding yourself.

76
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:44,662
Always populated by Poles,
Hispanics, a few Micks from the old days.

77
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,334
People who work hard despite everything.

78
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:47,775
What did she do ?

79
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,900
The marble statue, I mean.

80
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,735
That's a very good question, they're doing a lot right now, right?

81
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,342
They wave ... They levitate ...

82
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:59,893
Near Skokie there is a little Jesus in
plastic that drinks milk for real,

83
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:03,656
or a guy who cuts open an avocado
and sees the face of the Virgin.

84
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,981
- This is a sign that the Millennium is approaching.
- Without a doubt.

85
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:07,539
What is this one doing, Excellency?

86
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,421
It this one's an old fashioned girl.

87
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,934
She's just crying.

88
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:12,741
- Tears of blood.
- How did you guess ?

89
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:13,810
Do you want a drink?

90
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:15,016
Explain it to him, John.

91
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:17,021
She would already have several healings to her credit.

92
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:22,175
The documentation looks pretty solid,
especially the case of Maria Witkowski.

93
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,457
About 7 years ago she
was 9 years old at the time.

94
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,700
He was diagnosed
end-stage lupus.

95
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,531
Everything is written in there, there is also a video.

96
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,860
The statue bled on her and she healed.

97
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,010
Except it's not the statue
that people pray to.

98
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,289
But a lay woman.

99
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,260
The late Mrs. Helen O'Regan.

100
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,540
A nice widow.

101
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,500
She lived in the convent, prepared the meals

102
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,775
She opened a soup kitchen
in the neighborhood.

103
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,733
She even worked in
the orphanage created by the sisters.

104
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,494
She was loved by all,
until the day she died.

105
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,850
It is from this moment that
the statue began to cry.

106
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,699
It's her blood that the statue cries, or
at least that's what people believe

107
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,530
And of course, they are calling for canonization.

108
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,532
"Saint Mrs. Helen O'Regan",
this is what they want her to become.

109
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,214
And someone told them that there is
only had 3 American saints?

110
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,339
I said these people work hard
not that they were geniuses.

111
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,539
Did you call a chemist?

112
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,059
He could tell you if it's blood.

113
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,492
No, frankly we've stayed away.

114
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,375
But they have already collected more than 10,000
signatures on a petetion, tour buses.

115
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,130
Even the mayor signed.

116
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:20,138
You see, there is already a cult that
growing up around her.

117
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:22,129
As for Father Falcone at Lake Monroe.

118
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,289
And you were brilliant on Falcone.

119
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:31,492
I destroyed the faith of an entire community.

120
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,618
If for you, that's what being brilliant ...

121
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,658
It is, otherwise I wouldn't have pulled you out of that stinking shithouse

122
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,853
where John found you.
You did what hadda be done.

123
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:42,377
Is there anything else
I need to know about this statue?

124
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:44,848
Only that she is very particular.

125
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,697
She only cries when it rains
and only in November,

126
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,528
that's the month
Helen O'Regan is dead.

127
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:52,577
A teleconference, Monsignor.
MP Darcy is already online.

128
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:54,533
Margaret, don't you
not enough to be right?

129
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,012
Listen to me carefully.

130
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:59,527
I don't know what demons you're fighting against
but you are still my postulator.

131
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:03,452
You took a vow of obedience, I need that
you take care of that quickly, you got that?

132
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:04,886
What's the urgency?

133
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:08,208
You did not listen to me ?
We are October 28th.

134
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,651
Congressman?

135
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:10,726
Yes !

136
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:13,735
Yes that's right.

137
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:16,854
Yes, it is a question of money.

138
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,291
No no no.

139
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,488
What about your game?

140
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:11,527
When was the first time?

141
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,685
The bleeding from the statue?
7 years ago.

142
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,766
I celebrated a mass in memory of Helen
when that little girl came in

143
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,732
one of Helen's favorites who
had suffered from lupus for years.

144
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,849
In the name of the father, the son
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

145
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,286
Sit down, please.

146
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,973
- Good morning all.
- Hello father.

147
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:32,646
We could have done better on the weather, eh?

148
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,248
Helen would have been so happy to ...

149
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:38,812
... What am I talking about?
Helen is happy.

150
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,131
Helen is happy.

151
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,731
She is watching us from up there.

152
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,362
And see how many of you have got
braved the rain to celebrate her memory

153
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:50,932
She gave so much love.
I'm sure she is

154
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:56,245
in paradise with Jesus, and Mary
by his side, right now.

155
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:59,563
Go join your class, little one.

156
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,643
My child ?

157
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,610
Before this incident,
the doctors said she her lupus would be fatal.

158
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,165
They were adamant.

159
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,451
And after that ?

160
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,442
The blood of the statue completely healed her.

161
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:33,531
It's written in the file
that I sent to the diocese.

162
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,970
Oh that sounds interesting setup.

163
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,328
Yeah, yeah, it's new,
there is a money box here.

164
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,886
No need to light the candles,
just touch this and...

165
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,648
Helen loved this room.

166
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,364
She could see the children
play during recess.

167
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,329
And then also see the statue, which was very dear to her.

168
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,089
She lived in the convent?
She was a lay woman.

169
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,445
She loved taking care of the kids.
Mostly problem children.

170
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,000
So many nights she had
to work until very late and ...

171
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,804
how she liked to attend mass
in the morning, it was more convenient for her.

172
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,320
It's his daughter, Roxanne.

173
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,719
Her daughter ? I'll have to talk to her.

174
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,168
She's not a practicing Catholic,
nor a supporter of our cause.

175
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,728
This is your cause father, not ours.

176
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,320
Or at least not yet.

177
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:34,197
Father Panak. I'm here to decide if
the cause must be recommended to Rome.

178
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,168
And that doesn't happen very often.

179
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,157
Very often ?

180
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:40,445
Have you ever recommended
a case to Rome? Father Shore?

181
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,642
He was a soul chosen by God.

182
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,368
I'll have to talk to his friends,
her enemies and ...

183
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,359
- She had no enemies.
- Read her newspaper or letters that she ...

184
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,882
It may be difficult,
she was almost illiterate.

185
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,605
She could only read the Bible.

186
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,802
She must have started working very young.
And did not have a proper education.

187
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,442
You know she was the child of poor immigrants?

188
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,360
- Yes, they came from Ireland.
- From Austria.

189
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:10,283
Her maiden name was Gabor.
Did you just open the file?

190
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,318
I will set up my office in this room.

191
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:15,755
Father Shore.

192
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,685
We have been praying for years for this investigation for years.

193
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,922
I will do everything in my power.

194
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,594
Prayers for Father Falcone

195
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:45,279
You were a friend of Father Falcone,
Brother Gregory?

196
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,360
Yes that's right.

197
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,603
We talked every night.

198
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:50,802
He was a great spiritual guide.

199
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:54,276
Not only for me, but also
for all these people, excuse me.

200
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,604
Is that where he drowned?

201
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,515
We found his boat near
from the boathouse over there.

202
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:05,601
You who art in heaven. Please
to answer our chaste prayers and from us ...

203
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,955
Help me please.

204
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:21,160
Help me please.

205
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:23,762
Sir, can you help me?

206
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,077
Thank you.

207
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:29,276
Take that away from him.

208
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:31,874
Come on. Help us.

209
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:37,472
Thank you so much.

210
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:50,159
I beg you heal
my son please.

211
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:52,036
Thanks for coming, doctor.

212
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:55,757
Oh no, it's my pleasure. You know it's a case
I never tire of talking about.

213
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:57,198
Kate Malloy.

214
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:01,998
Yeah, uh we opened it up and uh, we threw it
a quick glance and we sewed it up

215
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,842
Do you see the tumor was lodged in a way
such that removing it was hopeless.

216
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:07,672
So, She was sent home.

217
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,242
And she began to pray to Father Falcone.

218
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,800
She had confessed
to him for years.

219
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,602
When you saw her again,
where was the tumor?

220
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:16,562
She was gone. There was not even
scar due to the previous operation

221
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:17,551
nothing at all, not a trace.

222
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,161
Now I refuse to call it a miracle,

223
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,521
it is not a word that I use because
what do you see, I am a Jew.

224
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,881
I don't believe in Catholic miracles.

225
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:26,280
I hope you do
don't blame me, father.

226
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:28,950
It makes him even more believable,
You can not find ?

227
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:32,281
I mean the doctor don't believe in our
miracles and yet he seems to think ...

228
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,397
These are not yet
our miracles, Brother Gregory.

229
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,561
Listen, I know how it goes.

230
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,801
I know it takes more than a miracle
and proofs of heroic virtue

231
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,280
to make a Saint, but ...

232
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,316
We don't make Saints.
God makes them.

233
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,151
So he made one of Father Falcone.

234
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,112
Thank you.

235
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,435
Hello. Were you at the lake?

236
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,909
- Hello. Were you at the lake?
- Yes, my father.

237
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,517
You couldn't walk
nor stand up.

238
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,471
I feel much better
today, my father.

239
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,076
Father Shore?

240
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,597
What happened to you ?

241
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,195
What happened ?

242
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,198
What happened to your son?
What happened to him ?

243
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,315
He could neither walk
nor stand up.

244
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,955
[on paper in woman's hand] In memory of Father Falcone.

245
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,476
Prayers to Father Falcon

246
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,075
What are you looking for ?
Evidence against him?

247
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:57,464
Don't worry, there's nothing here that I can find.

248
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,755
I can't find the notes of his sermons.
Nor the papers on which he took them.

249
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,395
I should never have agreed to speak to you.

250
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:05,272
I have to find out the truth
It's my job.

251
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:22,867
Oh Lord.

252
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,274
"In the darkness is power ...

253
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:33,744
The power of Azazel, Barakiel, Sariel.

254
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:38,066
Darkness calls, I answer them.
I give myself to them. "

255
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:39,913
Look at this.

256
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,665
I never knew about any of this.

257
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:44,913
I did not realize before his death ...

258
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:45,982
Not realized what?

259
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,870
Well, towards the end
he was depressed and he was scared but ...

260
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:58,581
"Darkness calls, I answer them."

261
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,272
I want to see the police report on his death.

262
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,632
You already have it, it's in the file.

263
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,702
These are just forms they filled out.

264
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:10,624
The report will say that they considered
the possibility of suicide

265
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,749
but that they then ruled it out.

266
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,072
Yes, under pressure from the parishioners.

267
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,869
Many policemen are parishioners.

268
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,632
Falcone committed suicide and you want
that I make a saint?

269
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,943
I believed that only God made Saints?

270
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:39,109
Do you know what you are called?

271
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,582
My friends in the Archdiocese told me.

272
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,109
They call you the miracle killer.

273
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:45,621
You knew...

274
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,420
you knew something was wrong
but you closed your eyes.

275
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,621
- You let it all happen.
- I did not want...

276
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,189
It's a goddam circus, nothing more!

277
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,510
I just wanted ...

278
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,626
I know all about "I wanted to...".

279
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,310
But, and the miracles, the healings!

280
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,266
Belief is powerful,
ask the doctors.

281
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,390
You were at the lake. You have seen.
You felt it too.

282
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,858
But it was not the work of God,
was it ?

283
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,584
Or maybe that
God played with us?

284
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:18,628
You sound like him, you know.

285
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,343
You sound like Falcone.

286
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:22,749
You do not understand.

287
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,228
This one was meant to be real.

288
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:26,669
You do not understand.
This one was meant to be real.

289
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,069
They call you the miracle killer.

290
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:29,343
This one was meant to be real.

291
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:39,105
Frank.

292
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:40,868
Happy to see you again.

293
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:41,548
Hi Frank!

294
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:42,060
Thank you.

295
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,906
Oh Brother Thomas, it's good to see you.

296
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:52,096
It's been a long time, how are you?

297
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:54,501
Ah you know, we make it go.

298
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:56,623
Thank you.

299
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,905
I don't know if I'll stay
I haven't made up my mind yet.

300
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:14,577
You'll pray for me.

301
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,220
Thanks, I'll need it.

302
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:04,945
- Father...
- Yes, Frank Shore.

303
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,825
- Roxanne O'Regan.
- Of course, hello.

304
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,417
Hello...
Listen, I ...

305
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:09,654
Do you want to sit down?

306
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:14,345
No, no, thank you. I got your message yesterday,
I didn't even want to call back.

307
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,097
You preferred to come in person.

308
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:19,941
Yes that's it. Yes.

309
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:22,812
Because I want you to understand
one thing, this ... this ... this

310
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,382
idea you have of my mother being a saint.

311
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:29,975
It's uh pathetic. You understand ?

312
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:31,736
And your colleague, the Father uh ...

313
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:33,457
- Father Panak?
- Panak, that's it.

314
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,054
He's pathetic too.
Really pathetic.

315
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,253
You like that word.

316
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:39,056
He used to bring me donut holes.

317
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:41,140
You see. What would you call that?

318
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:43,023
I don't know Father Panak.

319
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:45,503
Neither your mother, or at least not yet.

320
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:47,573
Oh ok...
Are you going to get to know her now?

321
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:48,937
Yes, this is my job.

322
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:51,372
Some job.

323
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,211
Donuts holes, eh?

324
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:55,534
Yeah, I swear.

325
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,174
Can I ask you
questions about your mother?

326
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,015
You didn't just hear me?
No !

327
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,655
Give me a second and
take a look at it.

328
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:05,461
All these people prayed to your mother, okay?

329
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:07,454
There are a lot of nonsense,
but look.

330
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:11,337
Martin Wade, his white blood cell count
was less than 1000, which is serious,

331
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,980
- his condition was very worrying.
- Oh !

332
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:14,336
He prayed to your mother.

333
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:17,693
His wife rubbed his chest with
earth from your mother's grave.

334
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,417
It's silly, it's superstition
or whatever you want,

335
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,737
but his blood cell count
whites went back to near 3000.

336
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:25,142
Doctors found
no explanation for that.

337
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:27,462
Do I have to listen to more of this?

338
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:28,782
because if there is a law
which forces me to listen to you ...

339
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:29,982
- No, you don't have to.
- Oh !

340
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:33,178
I'm not a cop.
My father was, I am a priest.

341
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,734
This is where I'm supposed to say
that you don't look like a priest?

342
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,490
It's Brother Thomas, he's been deaf since
his earliest childhood.

343
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,616
- Sorry for him.
- No, Roxanne.

344
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,539
He's never known anything else.

345
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,930
Do you have 2 minutes?
I would like to show you something.

346
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,848
Okay? It won't take long.

347
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,415
Father Panak filmed this a few days
before your mother died.

348
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,610
Jacadi said ...

349
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,815
Hold.

350
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,049
Pull your ears.

351
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,860
Jacadi said stick out your tongue ...

352
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,610
Look.

353
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,619
- Jacadi said shake your head.
- An ordinary woman.

354
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,979
Jacadi said jump in the air!

355
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,459
Jacadi said clap your hands.

356
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,653
And hit yourself on the head.

357
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,454
How about singing?

358
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,370
Is that what a saint looks like?

359
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,814
Can't you see her goddamn halo?

360
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,017
I am surrounded by people who revere
the ground she walked on.

361
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:55,698
I'm not asking you to be part of it.

362
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,336
What are you asking me then?

363
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,853
Miracles are nothing if
she was not a good woman.

364
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,652
I couldn't tell you
if he was a good woman.

365
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:08,334
She moved to the convent
when I was ... 16 years old.

366
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,492
She cared more about the church and
of the priest than of me.

367
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:14,091
So, what's your opinion !
Does that make her a good person?

368
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:17,490
Did she care more for the priest?

369
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:19,616
Oh, boy.

370
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:22,934
Oh you so we can really say
that you have a twisted mind.

371
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:23,737
What?

372
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:27,332
Oh nothing, you're just suggesting that my mom and
Panak were having an affair, right?

373
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,691
This was the case ?

374
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,450
What is wrong with you?

375
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:35,132
If you're can't make her a saint,
you make her a slut, is that it?

376
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:44,731
Jeanne Françoise de Chantal,
an 18th century Frenchwoman

377
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:48,207
She wanted to enter the convent
but she had a 10 year old son.

378
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,930
When she tried to go, he screamed, cried ...

379
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:54,685
he lay down in front of the convent to
prevent her from passing and she stepped over him.

380
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:57,770
100 years later, the church made her a saint.

381
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,005
The Church did?

382
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,969
What would you have done?

383
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:05,003
I do not know.

384
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,290
You don't know?

385
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:07,286
No.

386
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,854
Besides, I would like to know,
what is a saint?

387
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:19,691
A saint is a person who is
with God in Heaven.

388
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:26,175
If you ever pray to this person,
and your prayers are answered,

389
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,927
that means that this person
has a special connection with God.

390
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:33,532
That she managed to persuade
God to answer your prayers.

391
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,125
What are you trying to tell me?

392
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:39,812
That you believe this woman
is in heaven and she ...

393
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:44,564
that she gently tap on the shoulder of God and that she whispers

394
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:47,811
"You should hear the prayers of these people"?

395
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:51,369
Do you really believe in all of this?

396
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,129
Huh?

397
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,805
You ask tough questions.

398
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:06,925
You look like her.

399
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,364
I take after my father.

400
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:29,364
Pan! Pan!

401
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,804
Kid, do you know where the Witkowskis live?

402
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,371
- Over there.
- Thank you.

403
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:41,089
Mrs. Witkowski?
I am Father Shore.

404
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:57,848
Father Panak said you would come.
He could have told me when.

405
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,201
I tried to call you but the phone ...

406
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:02,080
It was cut off.

407
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,964
I wanted to talk to Maria,
is she here?

408
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,361
Bless this house!

409
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,801
Bless it, father.

410
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,205
Please.

411
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,403
- I don't see her any more.
- She doesn't live here?

412
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,248
I don't know where she lives.

413
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:29,046
She hasn't been coming since her boyfriend and her realized I was broke.

414
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,324
Is this her ?

415
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:35,168
She is 16 now.
A 16 year old whore.

416
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:36,762
What do you mean ?

417
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,443
I know the scum she hangs out with.

418
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:42,009
All these pimps and junkies
near the Réo restaurant.

419
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,888
- Are you really sure she ...
- I can smell it, Father.

420
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:52,605
If you want my opinion,
God wasted a miracle.

421
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,284
Do you know Maria Witkowski?

422
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,078
Can you help me, am I looking for someone?

423
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,279
I said "Can you help me"?

424
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:51,719
- It's not cool what you're doing, man.
- Her name is Maria Witkowski.

425
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,520
Not know.

426
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,641
Who the fuck are you? Are you a cop?

427
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,035
Who are you then?

428
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,326
I'm looking for a girl who
is called Maria Witkowski.

429
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:05,237
There's no one called that here.

430
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:07,084
No matter what name I give you

431
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,804
you will always answer me the same thing, right?

432
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,238
You might be right ...

433
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:12,924
Thanks anyway.

434
00:32:19,365 --> 00:32:21,037
Where are you running like that?

435
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:25,793
I see...

436
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:40,318
You know, we really get lots of Marias.

437
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:45,637
If you're not an asshole cop
can I know who you are then?

438
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,801
In reality, I am a priest.

439
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,844
What's the matter ?
She missed mass, the bitch?

440
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:54,436
She was very ill.

441
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,957
And could still be.

442
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:01,280
My name is Franck Shore,
I am in Saint Stanislas.

443
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:06,351
This church ... is the one where
my old woman is going to pray for me.

444
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:08,763
It's good, everyone should have
someone who prays for him.

445
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:12,278
My Father ... Are all these miracles true?

446
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,035
Fuck, yes, they're real.

447
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:18,159
I believe in all this bullshit.

448
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:19,796
Shut up, Wayne.

449
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:22,592
Are they true, Father?

450
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:23,911
You heard Wayne.

451
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,111
See you later.

452
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,312
Yeah, whenever you want.

453
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,318
- My father.
- I get it.

454
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,118
Go buy yourself some food, okay?

455
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,597
What did you just do with that dollar?

456
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:45,361
I thanked the Lord.

457
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:49,041
- Did Higgings show you this?
- Hey man, you know Higgings?

458
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:49,951
Did you mean "knew"?

459
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,918
Higgings died not long ago.

460
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:55,680
You knew Higgings.

461
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,071
He was so cool.

462
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,879
If you ever see Maria ...

463
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:00,237
Okay ?

464
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:03,596
Father Shore, Saint Stanislas.

465
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,833
What are you doing ?

466
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:21,434
Excuse me for disturbing you.

467
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:23,674
Frank ...

468
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:24,429
Bishop.

469
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:27,033
Take that smile off your face.

470
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,273
The body is the temple of the spirit.

471
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,437
I would like to know how you found me.

472
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:33,870
A tip from Sister Margaret.

473
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:38,709
Want a reason not to go to Heaven?
That nasty little busybody will be there too.

474
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:40,317
What do you need, Frank?

475
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:42,308
Keep you informed about Helen O'Regan.

476
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:46,705
Why, does she ... give back sight
to the crippled and make the blind walk?

477
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,195
Aren't you laughing? It means that
do you think there is some truth in all this?

478
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,988
I do not know what to think.

479
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:56,865
So think about people, I don't want to
that they begin to worship a statue.

480
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,548
But I am thinking of people, Monsignor.

481
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:00,635
What do you need ?

482
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:02,156
More time and more resources.

483
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:05,076
I need someone full time
to help me with this investigation.

484
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,749
Leone should do the trick,
I'll fix it with the university.

485
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,516
No, no, not Leone.

486
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:13,236
- I thought you were friends?
- I have another candidate.

487
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:14,066
There you are, Bishop.

488
00:36:14,276 --> 00:36:17,635
Perfect. Submit a budget to Sister Margaret,
I will sign it.

489
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:18,545
Great, thank you.

490
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,751
You not finished yet, Monsignor?

491
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:23,915
- Hi Jack, not yet.
- I'll wait for you by the pool.

492
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:24,984
See you soon.

493
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:28,153
Excuse me, it's Jack De Sica.

494
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,235
One of the most powerful men in Chicago.

495
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,227
- From DiSica Contracting?
- Yes, the biggest in town.

496
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:39,945
He is organizing a charity gala on Thursday evening.
Bigshots, $ 5,000 per person.

497
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:40,990
Do you want me to come?

498
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,994
You express yourself well,
you are not a sissy,

499
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,464
you are not like the Mother Superior,
who wants to teach the Bible to the little pagans.

500
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:48,234
Monsignor, I ...

501
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:51,226
This kind of secular support has
never hurt a career, Frank.

502
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:55,144
You thought I didn't think anymore
to your career, to your rise?

503
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:58,789
Cardinal Humas still speaks of how you handled yourself in the Falcone case.

504
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,593
Have you had time to go through the file?

505
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:14,713
I read every word of it.

506
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:17,671
So ? It interests you ?

507
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:19,267
It's impressive.

508
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:21,583
And poetic too, the rain,
it gives a nice touch.

509
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:26,745
Apparently, Brother Superior consented
to grant you sabbatical leave.

510
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,507
He didn't have much of a choice,
he received a call from the cardinal himself.

511
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,632
So the only question is ...

512
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:33,748
The only question is:
Why are you doing this?

513
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,143
Come back here after all this time?

514
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:37,791
I need your help.

515
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:41,944
My help?
Why me ?

516
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:45,462
Thank you.

517
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,431
I inquired about you and,
I found out that you studied

518
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,740
canon law at Seaton Hall before you took  your your vows.

519
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:00,583
What I want to know is why me?

520
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,784
I owe you a debt.

521
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,581
If I helped you for Falcone,
it was unwittingly and you know it.

522
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:08,184
Yes, I know.

523
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,427
But I took something away from you.

524
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:16,385
This is a chance to get it back, maybe.

525
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,786
You are aware that we have
no birth certificate.

526
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,659
Only his passport mentions
his date of birth in 1933.

527
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,704
An incomplete file is often frowned upon.

528
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,147
I will inquire with
of the Austrian Consulate.

529
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,870
They are more numerous than usual.
Wonder what's going on.

530
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,218
Maybe something's about to happen.

531
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:07,424
Maria?

532
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:20,377
Hi.

533
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:23,782
Are you Father Shore?

534
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:28,822
Who told you that I was looking for you?
Wayne?

535
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,064
No. It's Miller.

536
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:34,667
Oh, Miller, yeah.

537
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:40,904
I'm investigating the life of a
woman you knew.

538
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,180
Helen O'Regan.

539
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:50,457
- She saved my life.
- Really ?

540
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,897
And she also knew things, Father.

541
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,863
For example, she knew
when my mother beat me.

542
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,659
Did your mother beat you?

543
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:03,375
no big deal.

544
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:08,614
Therefore...

545
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,815
one day I was sick, and ...

546
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:16,302
my mother forgot to come get me.

547
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:20,823
Helen walked me home.

548
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:28,863
This is where she saw the marks
on my face, you know.

549
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:30,533
Lupus?

550
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:31,661
Yes.

551
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,015
She touched me.

552
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:42,181
What?

553
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:44,217
- I have to go.
- Find Wayne?

554
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:48,937
When Helen died ...

555
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:52,740
that morning, do you remember?

556
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:57,623
I don't know anymore uh ...

557
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:00,092
It was raining.

558
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:03,261
I prayed.

559
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:04,817
Did you pray for Helen?

560
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:08,700
When a person dies, we pray
for his soul, is that what you did?

561
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,418
- I do not remember.
- You prayed to her?

562
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:18,862
Maria?

563
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:26,534
Can you tell me about the statue?

564
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:28,343
Listen, I have to go.

565
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:31,221
- It's nothing, it's nothing!
- What do you want, I must

566
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:34,420
- Stay here, I can help you, okay?
- I don't need any help.

567
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:37,103
Yes, we all need it, you know.
Maria, wait.

568
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:39,262
- What?
- Calm down, okay?

569
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:42,622
- Whore !
- Now that's enough, stop!

570
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,500
Enough, stop!
Tell me where I can find you.

571
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:48,375
- Whore !
- Now that's enough, stop!

572
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,696
- Fuck it! Leave me alone !
- Stop that !

573
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:54,018
Shut up ! That's enough !

574
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:55,617
Stop!

575
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:01,817
Stop!

576
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,411
One last question.

577
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,967
Okay ?

578
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,049
You did not pray to God, but to Helen.

579
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,818
Helen loved me.

580
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,498
God loves you.

581
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:11,932
I've never seen him, God.

582
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:19,456
You prayed for her to heal you
and she did.

583
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,607
No...

584
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,655
I prayed to die.

585
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:52,456
Credo.

586
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,449
Credo. quia ...

587
00:43:55,577 --> 00:43:56,566
Frank.

588
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,054
Creed quia ...

589
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,097
I believe, I believe because it's ...

590
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:06,657
I believe which is impossible.

591
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:10,809
I believe because it is impossible.
Tertullian.

592
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:17,930
Frank? Are you OK ?

593
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:22,125
Where does faith go, do I ask?

594
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,485
Jack.

595
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:27,212
Frank ... you fool.

596
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:31,730
You come completely drunk in
my confessional, frankly ...

597
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:34,327
I am sorry.

598
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:36,895
In that flop house where I found you, you ...

599
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:39,775
No no no. In that stinking shithouse,
that's how Cahill said.

600
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:41,055
At least you weren't drinking there.

601
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,967
There at least I had
not to pretend to be a priest.

602
00:44:47,215 --> 00:44:48,409
How? 'Or' What ?

603
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:50,970
How does faith escape us, John?

604
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:56,852
Is it like someone
who decides not to be a lawyer anymore?

605
00:44:57,574 --> 00:44:59,494
Or who is no longer in love with his wife?

606
00:44:59,494 --> 00:45:01,166
How would I know?

607
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,571
All I know is that ...

608
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:08,727
you and me, we might look damn
cons if we die and there is nothing after.

609
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:11,123
Don't you want to stop for 5 minutes, Frank?

610
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:15,572
We already discussed it, that's the kind of bullshit
that we tackle in the 1st year of the seminar.

611
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:19,249
When is she leaving
do we want to regain our freedom?

612
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,849
Because I will give up everything. Absolutely
all !

613
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:26,450
Absolutely everything !

614
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:29,764
I will give up, I will give up everything!

615
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:32,762
I don't want it to have been
for nothing, that's all.

616
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,812
I want this to be true.

617
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:35,689
The miracle ?

618
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:39,362
And everything else is, let it be true, John!

619
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:44,533
What can I do for you,
Frank, how can I help you?

620
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,126
I don't believe you can
do anything for me.

621
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:54,086
May the Lord Jesus Christ absolve you.

622
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:59,529
And I, by his authority,
I absolve you from all your sins.

623
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:04,929
In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

624
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:07,760
Thank you.

625
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:09,452
Wayne Strozzi.

626
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:10,931
Wayne Strozzi.

627
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:14,810
Three years in juvie.
Two arrests for drug possession.

628
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:16,364
Does he do pimping?

629
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,567
To tell the truth, that wouldn't surprise me.

630
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,365
Listen ... we got this Maria Witkowski's description.

631
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:25,926
We will pick her up from time to time
to make sure she's okay.

632
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:27,211
Every now and then?

633
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:29,411
We can't do more, Frank.
Even for you.

634
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,526
Thanks, I'll owe you that.

635
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:31,971
- I did not do anything !
- They all say that ...

636
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:33,931
I did not go through red,
It switched to orange.

637
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:34,811
It was red!

638
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:36,770
Get your dirty paws off me!
I am a model citizen!

639
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,410
Roxanne!

640
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,370
Yes, who runs red lights!

641
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,166
Roxanne!

642
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,044
I thought you weren't a cop?

643
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,603
My father worked here.

644
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:45,970
Ah really ?

645
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,724
- Is she making your life difficult, Herman?
- Altercation with a motorist.

646
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,561
- She fought with Parotsky.
- They say I ran a red light.

647
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,720
Parotsky? You chose to
do you fight with the biggest cop on the force?

648
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,004
Is she a friend of yours?

649
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,280
Herman, we're like this.

650
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,169
- Thanks Herman.
- Nothing Miss.

651
00:47:11,169 --> 00:47:11,885
Thank you.

652
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:15,769
What brings you here?

653
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:19,364
I have to go somewhere.
How would you like to come with me?

654
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,960
They put down all their stuff.

655
00:47:40,808 --> 00:47:43,402
Without even wondering who is going to clean it up.

656
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,846
There are a lot of people who love your mother.

657
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:49,447
Seriously?

658
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,361
A thorn !

659
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:12,723
We used to do this when the
planes were passing over the house.

660
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,081
- You and your mother?
- Yes.

661
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:21,078
She often told me a story ...

662
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:23,442
about her childhood in Europe.

663
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:28,166
The town where she lived was being bombed

664
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,605
But she prayed ...

665
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:36,275
The bombs have been dropped
but never touched the ground.

666
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,405
At least, that's what she was telling me.

667
00:48:40,405 --> 00:48:41,085
Really ?

668
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,521
It probably means that his family
was spared, but since ...

669
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:46,676
we are terrified of planes.

670
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:54,755
I thought you didn't want
not talk about your mother?

671
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,955
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

672
00:48:58,245 --> 00:49:00,645
I never wonder why
I do what I do.

673
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,681
- I see.
- What?

674
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:05,995
Nothing, I just like the sound of that.
Never question yourself.

675
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:07,802
You should try.

676
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,878
I have done this before and it rarely succeeds.

677
00:49:12,644 --> 00:49:14,316
I guess I could try again.

678
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:18,156
And why not give this a try?

679
00:49:19,604 --> 00:49:21,204
You always carry
vodka in the cemetery?

680
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:23,115
It's kind of a tradition that I have!

681
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:27,280
I like having a drink with my mother
on the anniversary of her death.

682
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:31,442
- Are you joining me?
- Okay.

683
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:38,951
To Helen.

684
00:49:40,683 --> 00:49:41,911
To Helen.

685
00:49:57,682 --> 00:49:59,274
Why are you a priest?

686
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:01,594
Why do you want to know?

687
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,752
Because I can tell you like this.

688
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:15,954
- Forget it, it's not my business.
- No, it's okay, it's nothing.

689
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:21,681
Have you ever had girlfriends?
Or you have overcome your urge to ...

690
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:23,521
I am not a virgin if it is
what you want to know.

691
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,911
- Yes, basically.
- At Monsignor Dolan high school, I ...

692
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,281
- Dolan?
- Yes.

693
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:34,115
- I went to Mont Sainte Marie.
- We often went to dances there.

694
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,717
You had to change buses 3 times.

695
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,793
Did you dance or watch?

696
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:40,001
I danced from time to time.

697
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:41,400
- Really ?
- Yes.

698
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:44,319
- You are serious ?
- Yes, I was dancing.

699
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,880
I was not yet a priest
in high school, let me tell you

700
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,040
- Are priests allowed to dance?
- Yes of course.

701
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,429
Simply, it's not every day
that an opportunity presents itself.

702
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,188
Show me.

703
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,074
If you want.

704
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,916
Groovy.

705
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,880
You know it's going back up
in the early 1950s.

706
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,469
You are doing well.
What is it called?

707
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,799
It is not very complicated.

708
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,755
- It's graceful, I think.
- And light yes.

709
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:12,192
- You know what ?
- No ?

710
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,959
I'm sure you had to
be very lively, right?

711
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,711
My favorite dance was "the elevator".

712
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:18,992
What is "the elevator"?

713
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,387
No steps.

714
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,316
I like "the elevator" too!

715
00:51:43,398 --> 00:51:44,831
Let's go somewhere else.

716
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:51,438
Can I help you ?

717
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:53,474
No it's OK. It will act as a counterweight.

718
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:01,831
I just always...

719
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:06,151
imagined that there was
something else out there.

720
00:52:07,677 --> 00:52:09,668
I have never been anywhere.

721
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:14,707
That's why I
became a travel agent.

722
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:16,356
Where would you like to go?

723
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:18,269
I would like to go everywhere.

724
00:52:21,157 --> 00:52:24,387
Anywhere in fact.
Somewhere.

725
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:29,906
You always want to know
why did I become a priest?

726
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,269
God didn't call you?

727
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,836
I suppose so, in his own way.

728
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:40,715
I was 17.

729
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:45,954
And my father was a policeman.

730
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:47,354
That you know.

731
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,952
He had to raise me alone,

732
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,025
my mother died when I was 5 years old.

733
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:57,234
He took a bullet in the neck
during his service.

734
00:52:58,235 --> 00:52:59,987
I went to the hospital.

735
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:02,274
He was dying.

736
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:05,468
I prayed and I swore ...

737
00:53:05,595 --> 00:53:09,270
that if God let him live,
I would agree to become a priest.

738
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:14,829
And 10 minutes later,
the doctors said ...

739
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:18,312
"It's incredible, we've never seen anything like this before"!

740
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,345
My father had made it out.

741
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,034
So you kept the promise
that you had made.

742
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,626
Yes, right, I did.

743
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:29,864
I entered the seminary, I took
my vows, I put the collar on.

744
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:31,831
Three months later, my father died.

745
00:53:34,474 --> 00:53:37,226
It seems that God, him,
did not hold his end.

746
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:40,186
I do not know. I was so
angry with him.

747
00:53:40,313 --> 00:53:42,508
Well no, not angry, but rather ...

748
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:46,027
totally lost, confused.

749
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:50,031
This is where I realized
that God does not bargain.

750
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:51,945
God is God.

751
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:54,868
He was just trying
to put me to the test.

752
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:58,865
And my mother ?

753
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:02,030
Where does she fit into all of this?

754
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:04,268
I want god to show me
his face again.

755
00:54:04,352 --> 00:54:06,547
What if he didn't have a face?

756
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:14,550
All your life you've been more
worried about a dead woman than a living one?

757
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:23,223
Maybe you are afraid.

758
00:54:23,512 --> 00:54:24,991
I'm afraid, indeed ...

759
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,943
I'm really scared of ...

760
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:36,342
falling in love with you.

761
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,708
I'm afraid of that too.

762
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,627
Should I go?

763
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,620
Please don't go!

764
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:30,425
Let me watch you.

765
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:32,098
I want to look at you.

766
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:36,897
Oh how beautiful you are.

767
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,463
Is everything alright ?

768
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:52,786
Huh, are you okay?

769
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:53,741
Oh yes.

770
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:55,977
It couldn't get any better.

771
00:56:56,425 --> 00:56:58,302
Hold me tight.

772
00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:18,745
It is raining.
I have to go to the church.

773
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:19,779
What?

774
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,657
I've got to go.

775
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:24,012
Oh no !

776
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:27,132
I have to.

777
00:57:28,424 --> 00:57:30,892
You will come back ?
Huh?

778
00:57:31,024 --> 00:57:32,616
Yes. Yes.

779
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:34,936
I will be back.

780
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,253
Okay ?

781
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,893
- You promise me ?
- Yes, I promise.

782
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:46,376
I promise you.

783
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:48,702
I will be back.

784
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:02,143
Helen is with us! She is here
with us as always!

785
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:03,735
Helen is with us! She is here
with us as always!

786
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:06,132
Father, can you tell us
explain what's going on?

787
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:07,383
Father Shore!

788
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,342
The statue is said to be crying blood,
is this the truth?

789
00:58:09,342 --> 00:58:11,902
No journalists!
Come, my Father. Let's go!

790
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:13,942
- Are you Reverend Paul Panak?
- Yes, it's me, it's my parish.

791
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:15,382
No photos and no television!

792
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:16,982
I don't take orders 
from you, this is my parish!

793
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:18,142
Father, I don't have time to discuss.

794
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:19,782
Listen, I told them
to come, I invited them.

795
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:23,536
It's encouraging worship, I can close down
the Ordinary Process here and now!

796
00:58:23,622 --> 00:58:26,782
When the statue weeps tonight
try to silence me!

797
00:58:26,782 --> 00:58:27,782
Frank, over here!

798
00:58:27,782 --> 00:58:29,374
My Father, tell us
when it started.

799
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:30,742
It was 7 years ago ...

800
00:58:30,742 --> 00:58:31,662
What's up ?

801
00:58:31,662 --> 00:58:33,891
Nothing yet, where were you,
have I looked for you everywhere?

802
00:58:34,221 --> 00:58:37,901
I present to you Father Burke, he works
in the Chemistry department in Loyola.

803
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:38,731
Nice to meet you !

804
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,653
You have already been confronted
to a case like this?

805
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:43,333
Yes, half a dozen times.

806
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:46,572
It's called "The Pig Fat Patrol".
It's a common trick.

807
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:48,741
The statue is smeared with pork grease
, which mixes with the rain ...

808
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:51,941
and then it looks like blood, yeah, I know.

809
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:52,930
Helen!

810
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:55,338
His blood !

811
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,618
Helen is with us.

812
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,938
Helen is here!

813
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,099
Helen is with us!

814
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,460
Bring a ladder!

815
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,654
She comes !

816
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,419
No no no.

817
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,212
No no no, not yet.

818
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,415
Frank ... that's Burke's job.

819
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:40,326
Good evening.

820
01:00:47,616 --> 01:00:50,449
But who do I see, Frank!
You came.

821
01:00:50,536 --> 01:00:52,936
- Glad to see you.
- What a circus in Saint Stanislas last night!

822
01:00:52,936 --> 01:00:56,326
The press was more reserved this time.
I recognize your style there, well done!

823
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,372
Precisely, we should be talking about last night.

824
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:06,129
Your Eminence, may I introduce you,
Father Frank Shore?

825
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:08,415
- Your Eminence.
- Glad to meet you, father

826
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,695
Please let me introduce you to
Archbishop Werner,

827
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:13,892
who is part of the congregation
for the cause of the Saints in Rome.

828
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:17,015
The Archbishop is in America
to give some lectures.

829
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:17,572
I see.

830
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:20,815
You may have heard of
the cause of Helen O'Regan?

831
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:23,773
- Yes.
- Father Shore is our Postulator.

832
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:26,255
So we have to consider
to have another American Saint?

833
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,245
I really appreciate your country.

834
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:31,003
You now have several
world class orchestras.

835
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:35,573
I even heard that there was one or
two decent restaurants in San Francisco.

836
01:01:36,094 --> 01:01:37,322
That's wonderful.

837
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:41,652
But I doubt this is fertile enough soil for sainthood to grow.

838
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:44,654
Helen was not born American,
as you surely should know.

839
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:49,054
Yes, I was told she was a
street urchin, originally from Austria, right?

840
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:49,854
That's right.

841
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:52,128
It is understandable that
the congregation would be slow

842
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:54,124
to recognize the existence of new saints.

843
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:57,330
Think again, I support several
causes like that of this Belgian priest

844
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:02,093
Father Kurtswall for example, a man
of great wit and learning.

845
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,013
And of great heroic virtue,
without a doubt.

846
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:09,167
The Nazis martyred him for having
preached against the persecution of the Jews.

847
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:10,484
But...

848
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:15,011
I'm sure your little housewife
was just as courageous.

849
01:02:15,173 --> 01:02:18,881
We haven't decided yet
to urge her cause, Monsignor.

850
01:02:18,972 --> 01:02:21,652
Perfect. I advise you to consider very carefully

851
01:02:21,652 --> 01:02:24,371
before spending the congregation's time.

852
01:02:24,612 --> 01:02:26,443
Thanks, I have to go.

853
01:02:26,532 --> 01:02:27,567
A brilliant man.

854
01:02:28,932 --> 01:02:30,809
Excuse me your Eminence.

855
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,362
I have something to say to both of you.

856
01:02:33,692 --> 01:02:35,808
The statue shed tears last night.

857
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:37,770
According to Loyola's lab,

858
01:02:37,852 --> 01:02:41,003
it was group A blood,
the same as Helen's.

859
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:43,371
You are wrong, young man.

860
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:43,971
I beg your pardon ?

861
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:45,927
Wrong to let me know this way.

862
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:48,406
I rely on Bishop Cahill
in these matters.

863
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,368
- Sorry, your Eminence.
- What did I tell you?

864
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:52,641
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

865
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:55,331
- Sorry, I wanted ...
- What did I tell you?

866
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:58,209
Sorry, I'm sorry but Father Shore,
there is an urgent call for you.

867
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,163
Excuse me.

868
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:37,126
How can you tell who it is?

869
01:03:40,169 --> 01:03:41,568
Any idea who could have done this?

870
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:43,965
We're looking for a junkie named Miller.

871
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:45,477
Neighbors saw him rabbit.

872
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:47,201
Miller, yes.

873
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:50,601
They were stoned, and there are
syringes all over the place.

874
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:54,729
She was hurt too, Father.

875
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:56,684
- Where is she?
- She's in Southside General.

876
01:03:56,928 --> 01:03:58,520
- Frank.
- What?

877
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:01,761
She'll die there.

878
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,076
Take Father Shore to Southside.

879
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,076
My God.

880
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,556
- Can I ask you something ?
- Of course.

881
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:45,365
When you needed a second on this investigation,

882
01:04:45,606 --> 01:04:47,164
why didn't you want me?

883
01:04:47,726 --> 01:04:49,717
You really think it's
the time to talk about this?

884
01:04:51,446 --> 01:04:55,519
If you think I'm Cahill's man,
you're wrong, you're wrong, Frank.

885
01:04:55,606 --> 01:04:59,042
- I'm on your side, old man, on your side.
- How about trying to be independent?

886
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,006
Listen ... John, what I need on this case,

887
01:05:02,006 --> 01:05:05,006
it's someone who wonders if
God is here or not,

888
01:05:05,006 --> 01:05:06,917
that's all that matters to me.

889
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:09,395
You stopped asking that question long ago.

890
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:11,481
Frank ... Frank.

891
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:14,159
- Do you remember ?
- What?

892
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:16,634
- When you took your vows?
- Yes.

893
01:05:17,885 --> 01:05:19,921
What did you feel then, do
you remember?

894
01:05:23,005 --> 01:05:24,965
They were very strong feelings, right?
Like ... emotion, pride!

895
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:27,115
Like ... emotion, pride!

896
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:28,195
Fear.

897
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:31,800
And joy....joy.

898
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:35,153
It has never left me, Frank.

899
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,673
I don't need to ask myself questions.

900
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:39,757
Because I know.

901
01:05:40,844 --> 01:05:42,357
Good for you.

902
01:05:43,364 --> 01:05:45,878
I'm sincere, good for you.

903
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:47,996
You're a lucky guy.

904
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:58,483
Make a wish.

905
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:01,123
Think about what you
most want in the world.

906
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:03,200
Think of something really good.

907
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:06,521
Open your hand!
Let go of the balloons!

908
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:50,196
I'm asking you if it's right ...

909
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:54,353
if you servant Helen would need me ...

910
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:57,517
among all men.

911
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:01,157
Her heart was made of love ...

912
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:02,515
and I...

913
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:06,997
Oh, sweet Jesus.

914
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:11,229
I'm not even a good priest.

915
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,750
Make me worthy.

916
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,315
Helen, make me worthy.

917
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,793
- Hello.
- Hello.

918
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,789
Do you want to go inside?

919
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:46,077
You could book a couple of
tickets for a saint I know.

920
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:48,078
Santa Monica.

921
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,627
Saint Kitts.

922
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:52,192
If only...

923
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:56,351
Something is wrong ?

924
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:02,596
I will recommend that Rome
hear your mother's cause.

925
01:08:04,878 --> 01:08:07,233
We will submit a "Positio".

926
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:11,953
This is an account of her virtuous life
and ...

927
01:08:12,198 --> 01:08:13,711
all miracles performed in her name.

928
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,631
If it's approved, there will be a tribunal.

929
01:08:17,638 --> 01:08:21,472
We risk waiting a long time for the answer.
It can take years.

930
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:26,514
- Should I be happy?
- No. I didn't expect you to be.

931
01:08:30,957 --> 01:08:32,948
Do you want me to be happy for you?

932
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:34,869
I will have to...

933
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,990
prepare to defend her cause.

934
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,148
So God won?

935
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:51,150
Forgive me.

936
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:54,394
My friend Jean ...

937
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:59,189
She wants to become Catholic and you want to know Why ?

938
01:08:59,876 --> 01:09:01,548
She says Catholics ...

939
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,553
can do anything they want ...

940
01:09:03,956 --> 01:09:06,072
and that they just have to go to the confessional ...

941
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:10,145
and say some
hail Marys to be forgiven.

942
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:15,352
Well, it was a real kick.

943
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:20,352
Mr. Priest, the holy man.

944
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:22,232
I am not a holy man.

945
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:26,507
No. You're not.

946
01:09:27,235 --> 01:09:29,305
You're like everyone else, Frank.

947
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:35,783
Roxanne.

948
01:09:37,235 --> 01:09:39,226
What could I possibly do to hurt you?

949
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:42,266
Nothing at all, absolutely nothing at all.

950
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:50,226
No, don't ... go....

951
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:11,072


952
01:10:23,713 --> 01:10:25,192
Please.

953
01:10:54,912 --> 01:10:57,220
Why don't you give me
a hint what's in there?

954
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:58,351
I did my best, Your Excellency.

955
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:01,551
Don't give me "Excellence"!
Am I going to like what I'm going to read or not?

956
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:04,349
Whether you like it or not, this is the truth.

957
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,585


958
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,703
The body of Christ.

959
01:12:59,787 --> 01:13:02,016
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

960
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,416
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

961
01:13:08,866 --> 01:13:11,255
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

962
01:13:23,986 --> 01:13:26,419
Frank? Frank?

963
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:36,104
What's the matter ?

964
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:41,537
The Vatican is sending an investigative
tribunal

965
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,697
to see if the church is willing
to advance Helen's cause.

966
01:13:45,305 --> 01:13:46,294
So fast ?

967
01:13:46,425 --> 01:13:49,542
Rome is finally catching up
on the rest of the world, God be praised.

968
01:13:49,705 --> 01:13:51,544
It is only a preliminary tribunal,

969
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:52,977
but they're sending bigwigs:

970
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:57,422
2 cardinals, theologians of the
Congregation for the Cause of the Saints.

971
01:13:57,504 --> 01:13:59,574
Your holy housewife is causing a sensation.

972
01:13:59,664 --> 01:14:00,779
I guess so.

973
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:05,055
You've seen them send a tribunal
on the road, like that?

974
01:14:05,264 --> 01:14:07,144
No.
No never

975
01:14:07,144 --> 01:14:09,624
This is undoubtedly because the devil's advocate they want is here in the United States.

976
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:12,536
- And who is he? You know it ?
- Werner.

977
01:14:13,064 --> 01:14:14,783
- The German?
- German.

978
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,694
- The one that we met?
- Yes, the one we met at the gala.

979
01:14:17,303 --> 01:14:20,215
You can get him, Frank.
You can get him.

980
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:32,615
Have the cardinals arrived?

981
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:34,701
Yes, Wednesday morning.

982
01:14:34,823 --> 01:14:38,372
There is Nola from Rome, and Sarrazin from Leon.

983
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:47,375
This bleeding statue, are you willing to go 5 minutes out of the way?

984
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,976
Bless me Father!

985
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:15,328
Werner has a doctorate
in theology and canon law.

986
01:16:15,419 --> 01:16:16,819
He writes in all the languages ??of Europe,

987
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:19,457
18 years with the Congregation
for the Propagation of the Faith.

988
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,290
He should be a cardinal.

989
01:16:21,378 --> 01:16:24,814
- Why isn't he?
- Too unpredictable. He scares them.

990
01:16:24,898 --> 01:16:27,048
Yes, well he scares me too.

991
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:47,575
Please have a seat.

992
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,409
Our task is twofold.

993
01:16:54,497 --> 01:16:58,012
First, determine if the
servant of God, Helen O'Regan ...

994
01:16:58,297 --> 01:17:01,733
practiced virtue to a heroic degree;

995
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:06,174
then, to look in miracles,
the special favor of God to her.

996
01:17:06,897 --> 01:17:10,411
We have read the Positio written
by the Postulator-Advocate

997
01:17:10,496 --> 01:17:13,096
Father Francis Xavier Shore.

998
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:13,972
Your Eminence.

999
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:16,570
It is a learned and pious document.

1000
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:17,532
Thank you.

1001
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:19,129
Monsignor Archbishop Werner ...

1002
01:17:19,256 --> 01:17:21,724
- Yes.
- Our dear friend.

1003
01:17:22,856 --> 01:17:26,451
As a promoter of faith, you
you oppose the cause of this woman.

1004
01:17:26,576 --> 01:17:28,134
Yes, your Eminence.

1005
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,409
We can start.

1006
01:17:34,695 --> 01:17:36,492
We live in a fallen world.

1007
01:17:36,655 --> 01:17:41,809
Martyrdom, with its great and defined
acts of faith seem impossible today.

1008
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:45,375
So much so that acts of simple kindness
like the opening of a soup kitchen

1009
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:48,287
or generosity
towards the most deprived

1010
01:17:48,655 --> 01:17:51,408
have come to appear worthy of a saint.

1011
01:17:51,615 --> 01:17:55,972
But true sainthood
is of another world

1012
01:17:56,495 --> 01:18:00,009
Let's start with the beginning,
Helen O'Regan was married.

1013
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:02,454
Now, the Father's document
Shore makes no

1014
01:18:02,454 --> 01:18:08,370
reference to the obstacle that marriage
creates between the soul and God!

1015
01:18:08,454 --> 01:18:10,934
- Because I see no obstacle.
- Do you think sex is not an obstacle?

1016
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:11,534
No.

1017
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:13,414
Contamination of the mind
by the flesh either?

1018
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:14,324
No.

1019
01:18:14,414 --> 01:18:15,767
Respectfully, your Eminences.

1020
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:18,694
It has been many centuries since the church has regarded the human body as

1021
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,922
being a vehicle of sin.

1022
01:18:20,094 --> 01:18:21,652
You yourself are single,

1023
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:25,521
don't you approve of the Council of Trent
who says celibacy is the most blessed state?

1024
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:28,373
All I'm saying is that there have been married saints.

1025
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:31,683
Saint Elisabeth of Hungary, Saint Monica
and our Saint Elisabeth Seton.

1026
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,053
The exceptions mark the rule,

1027
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:35,533
except that it was more than a soup kitchen Elisabeth Seton founded,

1028
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:38,491
but a powerful religious order.

1029
01:18:41,693 --> 01:18:44,733
"The union between man and wife is
the first link in human society. "

1030
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:48,532
Such that even for the youth, there is still the odor of charity

1031
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:51,729
between husband & wife. Of course.

1032
01:18:53,252 --> 01:18:56,449
We read Saint Augustine,
Father Shore, so what's your point?

1033
01:18:56,572 --> 01:19:00,281
The "odor of charity" is my point.

1034
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:01,926
Your Eminence.

1035
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:05,363
Yes, Helen was married.

1036
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:09,491
Let me tell you about her marriage.
Her husband died of cancer

1037
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:13,684
For 7 years, she stayed by his side
while his body was degrading.

1038
01:19:13,931 --> 01:19:18,004
She was tireless, and even happy
to clean up the stink and mess of his sickness

1039
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:19,763
because she loved him.

1040
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:23,327
The Archbishop says
that's an obstacle. But...

1041
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:26,961
she took care of others, in the same way that
she took care of her husband.

1042
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:32,604
Your Eminence, we have many
saints who have spent their lives in chaste prayer.

1043
01:19:33,331 --> 01:19:35,367
God blessed their piety.

1044
01:19:35,531 --> 01:19:38,681
But Helen is a people's saint.

1045
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:42,201
The people who live in the ordinary world.

1046
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:45,803
Let them have her blessing.

1047
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,519
Let them have their Saint.

1048
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,169
Is a Chicago woman
to become the next saint?

1049
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,162
This is what is being decided at the moment
even at the Cathedral of the Holy Name

1050
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,884
within a grand jury
Roman Catholic prelates

1051
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,767
which held its first meeting today.

1052
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,881
The woman in question,
the late Helen O'Regan,

1053
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:06,603
was a working parishioner
at the Saint Stanislas church

1054
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:10,045
and whose death had aroused
much excitement among the faithful.

1055
01:20:16,489 --> 01:20:18,889
Has not yet let anything filter.

1056
01:20:18,889 --> 01:20:21,881
We will have to wait as long as it takes for an official press release from ...

1057
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,882
Bystrica.

1058
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:43,721
It indicates the origin on the pottery
sold to tourists.

1059
01:20:43,848 --> 01:20:48,478
Bystrica is in Czechoslovakia, in the
Slovak part. We were looking in Austria.

1060
01:20:48,568 --> 01:20:49,688
Yes, because Helen was from Austria.

1061
01:20:49,688 --> 01:20:51,678
And this is where the story of
Roxanne could not stand up because

1062
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:54,446
the city that Helen was supposed to come from
has never been bombed.

1063
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:55,243
But was Bystrica?

1064
01:20:55,327 --> 01:20:57,557
- Yes, Bystrica was?
- Yes, this whole area was bombed.

1065
01:20:57,687 --> 01:20:59,847
How'd you get that out of the daughter, anyway?
She refused to cooperate!

1066
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:01,246
If this story is true ...

1067
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:04,200
It's a fairy tale that his mother
told to keep her from being afraid.

1068
01:21:04,287 --> 01:21:06,278
Maybe, but if it were true?

1069
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,483
I don't know, and even
if her passport was ...

1070
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:13,487
What, what about her passport?
Are you hiding something from me?

1071
01:21:13,487 --> 01:21:15,045
I don't want to give you false hope.

1072
01:21:15,446 --> 01:21:17,914
I think I could probably handle it, so what is it?

1073
01:21:18,246 --> 01:21:20,714
I told you that there was
no birth certificate.

1074
01:21:20,886 --> 01:21:22,239
Yes, so ?

1075
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:26,877
The Austrian consulate put me in touch with
the hall of records of where she was supposed to be from.

1076
01:21:27,646 --> 01:21:31,002
No trace of her birth,
nor any Helena Gabor anywhere.

1077
01:21:31,126 --> 01:21:34,721
She could very well have been born elsewhere,
as for example here in Slovakia.

1078
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:37,195
That would explain why no one
never heard her speaking German.

1079
01:21:37,286 --> 01:21:39,083
Yes maybe but listen ...

1080
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,845
the Gabor family with whom she immigrated had only one child, one boy

1081
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:45,439
but the US military issued
a passport to four of them,

1082
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:46,924
including Helen.

1083
01:21:47,605 --> 01:21:49,641
They processed refugees by the boatload.

1084
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:51,317
Most of the papers were a mess.

1085
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:53,555
Okay, but what are you saying, anyway?

1086
01:21:53,685 --> 01:21:56,285
That parents, and the whole family, lied in
saying she was their daughter?

1087
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:57,479
Why would they do that?

1088
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,561
- Does your order have people over there?
- In Austria ?

1089
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:02,040
No, forget Austria!
It's Slovakia?

1090
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:04,325
The church is under siege by the communists,

1091
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:07,122
you are going to have to find someone
who speaks the language to guide you.

1092
01:22:07,204 --> 01:22:08,273
I'll find someone, but why?

1093
01:22:08,404 --> 01:22:11,316
Because the answer lies
there, where this statue comes from.

1094
01:22:11,444 --> 01:22:12,763
Where the bombs actually fell.

1095
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,163
And what am I supposed to find?

1096
01:22:14,244 --> 01:22:16,678
Maybe the real
identity of Helen O'Regan.

1097
01:22:17,884 --> 01:22:20,956
Maybe even ... a miracle.

1098
01:22:21,684 --> 01:22:25,233
It was wonderful.
A wonderful evening. Thank you

1099
01:22:27,444 --> 01:22:29,275
- Excellent wine.
- Yes quite.

1100
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:31,036
Father Shore

1101
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:34,680
Did the dinner meet with your standards, your Excellency?

1102
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:37,914
I'm in the heart of the American midwest
I don't expect miracles.

1103
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:38,958
That's a good rule.

1104
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:41,511
I don't know why you are smiling.
I do believe in miracles,

1105
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:42,718
I saw one once.

1106
01:22:42,803 --> 01:22:46,239
- Are you talking about Father Kurtswall?
- No, I wasn't thinking of him.

1107
01:22:46,323 --> 01:22:48,041
But it's ironic, isn't it?

1108
01:22:48,123 --> 01:22:52,162
I firmly believe in miracles,
when you don't believe in anything.

1109
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:53,477
Nothing at all.

1110
01:22:53,563 --> 01:22:57,441
And yet, you will do anything to prove your little housewife's miracles ...

1111
01:22:58,242 --> 01:22:59,391
... are real.

1112
01:22:59,522 --> 01:23:02,161
Am I not right?
You don't believe in anything at all.

1113
01:23:02,882 --> 01:23:04,952
I see why you are
called the Devil's Advocate.

1114
01:23:05,202 --> 01:23:06,760
Be careful, Frank.

1115
01:23:06,922 --> 01:23:09,482
You are all that
I was afraid you were.

1116
01:23:09,562 --> 01:23:14,682
Intelligent, insolent and
above all, sentimental.

1117
01:23:15,642 --> 01:23:17,872
It is in fact very important that you be taught a lesson.

1118
01:23:17,962 --> 01:23:20,714
- Important to you?
- No no.

1119
01:23:21,441 --> 01:23:26,231
Important to God's holy church. Thank you.

1120
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,073
You are not God or his church.

1121
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:29,150
- Frank.
- Yes, John?

1122
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:31,681
You can't talk to
the Archbishop in this way.

1123
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:32,875
I just did.

1124
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,760
- How are you otherwise?
- Fine. What about you?

1125
01:23:39,241 --> 01:23:42,551
- Is he your friend?
- Yes, Brother Gregory, Father John Leone.

1126
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:46,116
- Nice to meet you, Father.
- Me too. I have heard of you.

1127
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,592
- Brother Gregory helps me in my ...
- I know, yes.

1128
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,119
- Yes.
- I know.

1129
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,714
Good evening.

1130
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,192
It was interesting.

1131
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:18,117
- Hello.
- Good evening, are you Jean?

1132
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,673
- How do you know ?
- I can guess.

1133
01:24:20,799 --> 01:24:22,232
Roxanne!

1134
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:24,228
You must be Frank.

1135
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:25,668
Yes.

1136
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:33,827
- Thank you, Jean.
- You're welcome.

1137
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,150
I don't have to ask you if it's a bad time. Sorry.

1138
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,355
I've heard that before somewhere.
What are you doing here ?

1139
01:24:40,478 --> 01:24:41,547
I need your help.

1140
01:24:41,878 --> 01:24:45,029
Really ? You are a goddam stubborn Irishman, aren't you?

1141
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:47,757
They will talk about you tomorrow during the tribunal.

1142
01:24:48,398 --> 01:24:49,353
They are?

1143
01:24:49,478 --> 01:24:53,232
They will say your mother abandoned you.
They will present it like that.

1144
01:24:53,318 --> 01:24:55,991
At the same time ... that's what happened.

1145
01:24:56,078 --> 01:24:59,752
No. She was torn.
she was guilty.

1146
01:25:00,317 --> 01:25:02,069
She must have been.

1147
01:25:02,637 --> 01:25:04,309
They need to hear you say that.

1148
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:07,109
You are really amazing.

1149
01:25:07,557 --> 01:25:09,195
Excuse me, I have a party to go to.

1150
01:25:09,277 --> 01:25:10,995
But Helen needs you

1151
01:25:11,597 --> 01:25:12,996
I need you.

1152
01:25:13,277 --> 01:25:15,188
Forgive me, Father.

1153
01:25:41,156 --> 01:25:44,068
Reverend Postulator, in a moment
we will hear you with interest

1154
01:25:44,156 --> 01:25:47,148
about Roxanne O'Regan,
Helen's only daughter but I ...

1155
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,273
I have to ask you first
why she is not herself a witness?

1156
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:52,586
She did not wish to come, your Eminence.

1157
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:53,944
Oh really ?

1158
01:25:54,075 --> 01:25:59,593
If she had wished, would she have testified
in favor of the beatification of his mother?

1159
01:25:59,675 --> 01:26:02,348
Miss O'Regan thinks that
her mother abandoned her ...

1160
01:26:02,635 --> 01:26:03,545
to serve the church.

1161
01:26:03,715 --> 01:26:05,990
And you, Father Shore,
do not share this opinion?

1162
01:26:06,115 --> 01:26:11,428
No, I'm sure Helen wanted quite simply &
above all to be with God.

1163
01:26:14,074 --> 01:26:14,665
Who are you ?

1164
01:26:16,674 --> 01:26:19,711
I'm sorry I'm really confused
I thought it was a courtroom.

1165
01:26:19,794 --> 01:26:23,309
I thought I could sneak in the back, sit down and listen.

1166
01:26:23,674 --> 01:26:25,392
Roxanne O'Regan, your Eminence.

1167
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:28,432
You finally decided to come.
You are welcome.

1168
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:30,466
Take a seat, please.

1169
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:32,023
Well...

1170
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:38,268
I have nothing to ... I have nothing to say.
I just wanted ...

1171
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:40,671
... see how you make a saint, that's all.

1172
01:26:40,793 --> 01:26:43,227
Miss O'Regan has no notion of
what holiness is, your Eminence.

1173
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:45,344
She is not a practicing Catholic.

1174
01:26:45,553 --> 01:26:48,067
This is...
Yes, it's true.

1175
01:26:49,193 --> 01:26:52,310
How could I have a concept
of what a saint is?

1176
01:26:52,393 --> 01:26:55,271
Maybe you could explain it to me, Father.

1177
01:26:57,793 --> 01:27:00,182
Or someone else.
Your Eminence?

1178
01:27:01,273 --> 01:27:05,663
A Saint loves God, far beyond the
ordinary human power to love him.

1179
01:27:05,752 --> 01:27:07,743
A Saint is love.

1180
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:12,230
You experienced the loss of love
from your mother when you were 16 years old.

1181
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:15,701
I did not die of it.

1182
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:18,062
Of course, but it was
a terrible loss for you.

1183
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:22,341
Well yes...
I mean of course it was.

1184
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,110
Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.

1185
01:27:26,192 --> 01:27:28,227
Do you know what prompted her to leave you?

1186
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:32,826
No.

1187
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:36,664
You still had to
ask yourself why she left you.

1188
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:38,790
What was her reason?

1189
01:27:39,991 --> 01:27:41,106
I do not know.

1190
01:27:41,191 --> 01:27:44,820
But was it out of indifference?
Was it for convenience?

1191
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:47,546
Or just out of selfishness?

1192
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:52,461
I do not know...
I do not know.

1193
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:56,020
What did she say to you?
She must have given you an explanation.

1194
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:01,068
She didn't just leave like that one day, what did she say to you, Roxanne?

1195
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,143
She...

1196
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:15,260
She told me that she owed God.

1197
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,102
Owed him?

1198
01:28:19,229 --> 01:28:23,222
Yes, I didn't get it then, & by the way I don't think I'll get it now either.

1199
01:28:23,389 --> 01:28:25,619
When she left you ...

1200
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:27,664
it must have been painful.

1201
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:29,262
Of course it was painful.

1202
01:28:29,589 --> 01:28:31,705
Do you think it was painful for her too?

1203
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:35,905
I don't know if I can answer that.

1204
01:28:35,989 --> 01:28:37,627
Maybe, for her...

1205
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:42,224
her love for god was so strong she got you
left although she loved you.

1206
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:46,302
Even though she really loved you.

1207
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:49,301
And that it was extremely
painful for her.

1208
01:28:51,428 --> 01:28:53,225
You can understand that.

1209
01:28:53,348 --> 01:28:57,261
You can imagine it even though
you don't understand it, do you?

1210
01:28:57,868 --> 01:29:01,986
I can imagine it being painful
to leave someone you love.

1211
01:29:04,828 --> 01:29:08,979
I can't imagine leaving your daughter.

1212
01:29:10,187 --> 01:29:12,098
That I can't imagine.

1213
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:14,781
But that's me.

1214
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:16,141
And...

1215
01:29:17,427 --> 01:29:20,021
God knows I'm not a saint, so ...

1216
01:29:27,227 --> 01:29:30,344
- Yes
- America ?

1217
01:29:30,507 --> 01:29:34,021
- Yes.
- Receive you collect call from Bystrica Slovakia.

1218
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:38,100
Do you agree to accept charges, sir?
Okay ?

1219
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:40,177
Yes Yes. Yes.

1220
01:29:41,986 --> 01:29:43,897
Call America.

1221
01:29:47,346 --> 01:29:48,699
Hello, Frank?

1222
01:29:48,826 --> 01:29:50,464
It's really extraordinary Frank!

1223
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:53,862
Everyone here knows this story
or remembers hearing it.

1224
01:29:54,226 --> 01:29:57,615
Well, on the other hand, our big problem,
is that there are no eyewitnesses.

1225
01:29:58,025 --> 01:29:59,014
Or...

1226
01:29:59,265 --> 01:30:00,778
At least no one who wants to talk.

1227
01:30:00,865 --> 01:30:03,299
Those who agree,
their children prevent them.

1228
01:30:03,665 --> 01:30:07,453
They're afraid to help us Frank, they're afraid of going to church. for crying out loud!

1229
01:30:08,305 --> 01:30:10,023
OK now, look, look.

1230
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:12,665
I know this is a problem and of course
I will continue to look,

1231
01:30:12,745 --> 01:30:16,135
Listen, I managed to piece together what happened, between one account & another.

1232
01:30:17,225 --> 01:30:19,420
It's an incredible story.

1233
01:30:19,825 --> 01:30:21,621
You read to write?

1234
01:30:24,224 --> 01:30:28,376
If there is any hope, we wish it
sustain her life, whatever the cost.

1235
01:30:28,784 --> 01:30:30,775
If I thought there were, Father, I would.

1236
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:33,061
Madame Witkowski.

1237
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:35,258
Go for it.

1238
01:31:00,023 --> 01:31:02,139
- Is she dead?
- Not yet.

1239
01:31:02,503 --> 01:31:04,573
Only a few more minutes.
We will leave you alone.

1240
01:31:10,942 --> 01:31:12,421
Lord, have mercy.

1241
01:31:13,662 --> 01:31:15,334
You should go on to the tribunal.

1242
01:31:15,742 --> 01:31:16,857
I'll stay here.

1243
01:31:25,822 --> 01:31:28,097
God doesn't waste miracles.

1244
01:31:37,461 --> 01:31:40,658
Holy Mary mother of God protect my daughter.

1245
01:31:41,421 --> 01:31:45,175
Holy Mary mother of God,
protect her, I beg you

1246
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:46,221
Concerning the first of miracles
attributed to the servant of God,

1247
01:31:46,221 --> 01:31:49,461
Concerning the first of miracles
attributed to the servant of God,

1248
01:31:49,461 --> 01:31:51,497
the cure of Maria Witkowski ...

1249
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:52,616
Yes, your Eminence.

1250
01:31:52,701 --> 01:31:55,534
We have your detailed story
from the day she was cured of a

1251
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:58,579
terminal lupus
by the blood of Helen O'Regan

1252
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:01,094
to whom the girl was in the habit of praying.

1253
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,974
Yes, the events I learned from Maria herself.

1254
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,494
I have here the testimony of people who have seen

1255
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:09,129
Maria enter the church that morning,
covered in blood.

1256
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,171
What looked like blood.

1257
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:14,457
As a result, she recovered
in a totally inexplicable way.

1258
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,695
Yes, your Eminence.

1259
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:22,020
Forgive me, but the Consulta Medica de
the Catholic University issued a report

1260
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,931
which confirmed that this healing could not
be explained scientifically.

1261
01:32:25,459 --> 01:32:28,929
Bishsop, you asked
for a review of their report.

1262
01:32:29,019 --> 01:32:30,372
Could we have water?

1263
01:32:30,499 --> 01:32:33,491
Is it that hard to make sure
that these glasses remain full?

1264
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:39,094
Sorry, I have a question, I would like
find out where Maria Witkowski is now.

1265
01:32:40,379 --> 01:32:42,734
She ... until now,
she was in a coma,

1266
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:44,093
as you know very well, Monsignor.

1267
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:47,535
But this morning, about an hour ago ...

1268
01:32:47,659 --> 01:32:50,331
A coma ... caused by
an overdose of cocaine.

1269
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:53,018
- I'm trying to answer your question ...
- She's a drug addict.

1270
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:57,895
If we refer to the police reports,
she was suspected of prostitution, ...

1271
01:32:58,178 --> 01:33:00,009
ask for money for
the most degrading practice ...

1272
01:33:00,098 --> 01:33:04,011
We all know the definition of the word
"prostitution", Archbishop Werner.

1273
01:33:04,138 --> 01:33:06,606
Of course, your Eminence. I apologize.

1274
01:33:07,098 --> 01:33:09,817
So your Helen O'Regan
intercedes with God ...

1275
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:15,332
to spare Maria so that she leads later
a life of debauchery and extreme degradation.

1276
01:33:15,497 --> 01:33:17,613
Is this an example of
her love, her wisdom?

1277
01:33:17,697 --> 01:33:20,609
It is the virtue that is
required of a Saint, Archbiship.

1278
01:33:20,857 --> 01:33:22,495
Not the ability to predict the future.

1279
01:33:22,617 --> 01:33:26,292
And we learn today
that Maria  has died.

1280
01:33:29,177 --> 01:33:31,611
I intended to make you
aware of this information immediately

1281
01:33:31,777 --> 01:33:32,971
after having received confirmation.

1282
01:33:33,057 --> 01:33:36,447
Dead, unrepentant in the powerlessness of sin.

1283
01:33:36,537 --> 01:33:38,413
How dare you say that?

1284
01:33:40,256 --> 01:33:42,326
How dare you sit there...?

1285
01:33:42,856 --> 01:33:45,529
How could you possibly know
the state of her soul?

1286
01:33:47,616 --> 01:33:48,890
Who are you to ...

1287
01:33:49,736 --> 01:33:51,647
Who do you think you are?

1288
01:33:51,856 --> 01:33:53,528
You are not God!

1289
01:34:00,616 --> 01:34:02,572
Excuse me, your Eminence.

1290
01:34:05,935 --> 01:34:07,163
- John, what ...
- Frank.

1291
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:11,649
My Fathers. Your Eminence.
Come see, all of you, please.

1292
01:35:02,093 --> 01:35:04,049
Father Shore, Father Shore!

1293
01:35:04,213 --> 01:35:08,001
- Good morning, John. Big crowd today.
- They wanted a miracle, they got it.

1294
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:09,492
- Father Shore.
- No questions, please.

1295
01:35:09,573 --> 01:35:10,767
What about the miracle?

1296
01:35:10,853 --> 01:35:12,923
It's a glorious day,
That's all I can say.

1297
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:14,692
Frank ...

1298
01:35:14,973 --> 01:35:17,202
be careful today.

1299
01:35:20,052 --> 01:35:23,089
I spoke to the Holy See this morning.

1300
01:35:23,212 --> 01:35:27,091
Records of the deathbed recovery of Maria
Witkowski

1301
01:35:27,172 --> 01:35:30,926
are under review by the
College of Relators of Rome.

1302
01:35:31,652 --> 01:35:34,849
Their conclusions should
reach us within 2 days.

1303
01:35:36,412 --> 01:35:39,882
It will be a time of prayer for us.

1304
01:35:40,492 --> 01:35:41,924
Your Eminence...

1305
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:47,086
Before adjourning the meeting, I would like the tribunal to know that I will continue despite everything ...

1306
01:35:47,971 --> 01:35:52,010
to oppose ... the beatification
of Helen Gabor O'Regan.

1307
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:55,880
You are a surprise to us.
May we hear your reasons?

1308
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:58,002
Yes, there are 2. The first is that

1309
01:35:58,091 --> 01:36:00,924
even if we accept the dubious virtue of
Helen O'Regan ...,

1310
01:36:01,571 --> 01:36:05,689
this case involving Maria Witkowski is but one canonical miracle.

1311
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:10,561
The Canon law requires 2,
long tradition insists on 3.

1312
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:16,009
My second reason touches
at the heart of these proceedings.

1313
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:20,369
It is about the state of the soul of our Postulator.

1314
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:25,764
I deny that God would entrust his servants' cause to a faithless priest.


1315
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:28,200
To a man unable to say to us, even now ...

1316
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:32,408
that he accepts the truth of God and his church!

1317
01:36:36,049 --> 01:36:38,040
I defy him to do so.

1318
01:36:55,569 --> 01:36:57,206
You doubt me.

1319
01:36:58,168 --> 01:36:59,237
Very well.

1320
01:37:03,048 --> 01:37:05,084
But why do you doubt Helen?

1321
01:37:08,168 --> 01:37:08,998
You saw Maria.

1322
01:37:09,088 --> 01:37:11,966
- I don't know at all what I saw.
- You saw her with your own eyes.

1323
01:37:12,048 --> 01:37:13,959
Perhaps it wasn't the work of God?

1324
01:37:14,048 --> 01:37:15,083
Father Shore.

1325
01:37:16,848 --> 01:37:19,237
- Come closer, please.
- Yes, your Eminence.

1326
01:37:28,367 --> 01:37:33,805
Do you hold to the truth of the Church,
one, Holy, Catholic and apostolic?

1327
01:37:35,007 --> 01:37:38,966
- I need time, Your Eminence.
- Time? For a simple declaration?

1328
01:37:39,247 --> 01:37:40,726
Time to pray.

1329
01:37:40,927 --> 01:37:44,681
No. Swear it to us, Father Shore.
Swear before God!

1330
01:37:45,886 --> 01:37:47,717
What good would that do?

1331
01:37:48,846 --> 01:37:52,885
If I didn't believe in God, why would I hesitate to swear falsely before Him?

1332
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,122
That's too clever, my son.

1333
01:37:55,246 --> 01:37:59,159
Help me before I start to
share the doubts of the Archbishop.

1334
01:38:03,206 --> 01:38:06,118
I have struggled with my faith, your Eminence.

1335
01:38:06,646 --> 01:38:09,444
But what does this have to do
with the virtue of this woman?

1336
01:38:10,445 --> 01:38:13,835
If God chooses to trust His cause to a ...

1337
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:16,602
to a priest like me ...

1338
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:18,755
But would God do so?

1339
01:38:19,805 --> 01:38:21,955
Who knows the will of God?

1340
01:38:23,045 --> 01:38:24,717
You, Archbishop?

1341
01:38:25,805 --> 01:38:27,875
- Do you?
- Do you?

1342
01:38:30,165 --> 01:38:32,679
God has given me doubts. Yes.

1343
01:38:33,605 --> 01:38:36,164
But he also gave me Helen.

1344
01:38:37,364 --> 01:38:38,956
I believe that.

1345
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:41,594
We will meet again tomorrow.

1346
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,553
Not a single real witness, Frank.

1347
01:39:45,362 --> 01:39:46,272
No.

1348
01:39:47,242 --> 01:39:48,834
No, I failed you.

1349
01:40:00,081 --> 01:40:00,121
Your Eminence, I am compelled to bring one final matter before you.

1350
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:03,636
Your Eminence, I am compelled to bring one final matter before you.

1351
01:40:10,801 --> 01:40:13,873
I admit, not having the proper evidence.

1352
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,756
I had hoped that with a little time ...

1353
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,991
But I'm not asking for more time.

1354
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,879
I have failed to defend
the cause of Helen Gabor O'Regan

1355
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,871
because of the weakness of my faith.

1356
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:31,072
But I'm not willing to remain
silent...

1357
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,396
about a great miracle
of which she was part.

1358
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,278
- I protest.
- Of course you do.

1359
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,908
Are we to hear the story
of a miracle without proof?

1360
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,156
It's all childishness,
a whim, nothing else.

1361
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:43,150
Your Eminence, I implore you to ...

1362
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,268
Conti
nue.

1363
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:50,757
I'll start with a discrepancy of fact dating 
from when Helen was naturalized.

1364
01:40:51,599 --> 01:40:55,308
Her maiden name was not Gabor,
as we thought.

1365
01:40:55,599 --> 01:40:57,635
She was also not from Austria.

1366
01:40:57,999 --> 01:40:59,148
It may not seem important ...

1367
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:01,588
Nothing under the heavens is unimportant.

1368
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:04,393
But why did her family change her name?

1369
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:08,312
Her family were gypsies who were on the run from the nazis.

1370
01:41:08,678 --> 01:41:10,878
Helen was lucky,
didn't look like a gypsy,

1371
01:41:10,878 --> 01:41:14,029
her father gave her to a family
of non-gypsies named Gabor.

1372
01:41:14,598 --> 01:41:18,193
She stayed with them and kept
their name when they arrived in America.

1373
01:41:18,718 --> 01:41:22,711
Her real name was Helena Kralova
of Bystrica in Slovakia.

1374
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:26,508
How are you, Monsignor?
Do you want some water?

1375
01:41:27,638 --> 01:41:30,390
No, no, thank you.
It's good, it will be fine, thank you.

1376
01:41:31,157 --> 01:41:31,873
The...

1377
01:41:32,237 --> 01:41:36,025
August 9, 1944

1378
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:39,834
an American bomber squadron
under allied command

1379
01:41:40,197 --> 01:41:43,667
were strafing several factory towns where German troops were stationed.

1380
01:41:43,837 --> 01:41:45,748
Among them was Bystrica.

1381
01:41:46,797 --> 01:41:50,073
According to accounts, while
the bombers were approaching,

1382
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:53,676
a child, Helena, fled from her
father as well as a young priest

1383
01:41:53,676 --> 01:41:55,746
who also tried to catch her.

1384
01:41:55,836 --> 01:41:59,112
She ran to the church,
knelt down and started to pray.

1385
01:41:59,236 --> 01:42:00,305
Your Eminence...

1386
01:42:00,636 --> 01:42:02,308
Your Eminence I ...

1387
01:42:02,556 --> 01:42:03,545
Let me ...

1388
01:42:03,836 --> 01:42:05,952
I would like to ... Let me ...

1389
01:42:06,756 --> 01:42:08,792
Is the Archbishop
not feeling well ?

1390
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:11,676
Your Eminence, I think we
should suspend the meeting,

1391
01:42:11,676 --> 01:42:12,665
Monsignor Werner is not feeling well.

1392
01:42:12,756 --> 01:42:13,268
I...

1393
01:42:14,596 --> 01:42:15,745
We will suspend the meeting.

1394
01:42:16,236 --> 01:42:19,386
Hoping that his Excellency
Archbishop Werner will be better tomorrow.

1395
01:42:19,635 --> 01:42:23,025
Yes, I will be much better tomorrow,
thank you, give me this cane.

1396
01:42:38,635 --> 01:42:40,034
Yes?

1397
01:42:48,634 --> 01:42:49,430
This way.

1398
01:42:56,794 --> 01:42:57,544
Thank you.

1399
01:43:07,114 --> 01:43:10,025
Ah, it's you.
Preposterous.

1400
01:43:10,993 --> 01:43:13,063
What? Bystrica's miracle?

1401
01:43:13,553 --> 01:43:18,069
No no. The idea that God made you his
messenger, you are preposterous.

1402
01:43:19,113 --> 01:43:21,911
1944, where were you in 1944?

1403
01:43:22,713 --> 01:43:25,625
I was a child. At the time,
I was in 4th grade.

1404
01:43:25,873 --> 01:43:28,913
I'm more than tired of trying
to explain the war

1405
01:43:28,913 --> 01:43:31,029
to your generation of insolent people,
but without results.

1406
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:33,230
Really i'm tired altogether.

1407
01:43:33,432 --> 01:43:36,185
It's to tell me what you got me
brought here, in the middle of the night?

1408
01:43:38,232 --> 01:43:42,544
Bystrica was a filthy factory town.

1409
01:43:42,872 --> 01:43:45,466
Apart from the gypsies or the communists ...

1410
01:43:46,632 --> 01:43:51,752
there were only ignorant peasants ...
came from the countryside to work in the ...

1411
01:43:52,432 --> 01:43:54,150
ammunition factories.

1412
01:43:54,952 --> 01:43:58,387
There was no decent meal there,
no companion worthy of sharing it.

1413
01:43:59,631 --> 01:44:02,543
The air was only smoky.

1414
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:07,100
The buildings had the color
rotten straw.

1415
01:44:10,831 --> 01:44:12,344
You were there.

1416
01:44:15,431 --> 01:44:18,468
Yeah, yeah, I was.

1417
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:24,388
You like to say "Let God be
God, we are not to judge for him. "

1418
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,660
You were there, weren't you?

1419
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:32,787
What did you see ?

1420
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:36,461
Did you see the miracle?

1421
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,625
No, it was a thoughtless miracle.

1422
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,986
Reckless and unreasonable.

1423
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:44,421
to grant a little gypsy girl's wish to be

1424
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:46,704
spared, she and her
family while ...

1425
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:49,344
millions more have died.

1426
01:44:50,509 --> 01:44:51,862
A whim of God.

1427
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:55,499
And I would tell God if he was in
this room, yes I would tell him!

1428
01:44:55,829 --> 01:44:57,342
And he isn't in this room?

1429
01:44:57,469 --> 01:44:59,380
Don't play with me.

1430
01:44:59,549 --> 01:45:02,586
We are not standing before some drunken fool Sarrazin.

1431
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:04,108
We are facing only our own consciences.

1432
01:45:04,349 --> 01:45:06,988
God gave us custody of the church for safe keeping.

1433
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:11,939
We have to live among the people
of this world, and judge of ...

1434
01:45:12,668 --> 01:45:16,820
what is best for them to hear,
or not to hear.

1435
01:45:17,188 --> 01:45:19,019
And this miracle ...

1436
01:45:20,108 --> 01:45:23,145
... it is not good for them to
hear. Not good at all.

1437
01:45:23,468 --> 01:45:27,780
And who were you?
You were the priest, right?

1438
01:45:29,148 --> 01:45:32,823
Communists destroyed the archives
from the church, we couldn't find him.

1439
01:45:33,948 --> 01:45:35,381
Was that you?

1440
01:45:38,907 --> 01:45:42,695
You told me...
I remember ...

1441
01:45:43,507 --> 01:45:45,498
that once you had seen a miracle.

1442
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:49,096
I no longer know what I saw.

1443
01:45:49,867 --> 01:45:51,346
Yes you did.

1444
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:53,380
Yes you do.

1445
01:45:54,427 --> 01:45:55,826
Tell me.

1446
01:45:57,987 --> 01:46:00,137
What did you see, Archbishop?

1447
01:46:02,186 --> 01:46:04,063
Tell me what you saw.

1448
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:06,664
You said...

1449
01:46:07,906 --> 01:46:13,538
that only two people witnessed the miracle, the priest and the father of the child.

1450
01:46:14,706 --> 01:46:20,178
But in reality a third
who also saw the girl.

1451
01:46:21,146 --> 01:46:24,536
A German army soldier.

1452
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:27,096
A most hardened skeptic.

1453
01:46:27,505 --> 01:46:31,464
He watched the little girl pray, and then ...

1454
01:46:31,665 --> 01:46:34,737
he watched the bombs.

1455
01:46:35,705 --> 01:46:37,935
the bombs fell ...

1456
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:41,535
and turned into a vast flock of birds

1457
01:46:41,705 --> 01:46:44,902
the most peaceful there is.

1458
01:46:48,425 --> 01:46:50,143
Pigeons.

1459
01:46:51,984 --> 01:46:53,736
Thousands.

1460
01:46:54,624 --> 01:46:56,660
I had never seen so many.

1461
01:46:57,224 --> 01:47:00,614
Before or since.

1462
01:47:01,544 --> 01:47:07,096
I have never seen so many pigeons.

1463
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:13,140

1464
01:47:48,302 --> 01:47:49,894
Watch out for the door!

1465
01:47:49,982 --> 01:47:52,416
We'll take a picture before you
go away.

1466
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:54,772
Don't be afraid, the little ones in front.

1467
01:47:54,862 --> 01:47:58,411
Everyone in the frame.
Keep your beautiful smiles.

1468
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:02,174
- Everyone say "Monkey"!
- Monkey!

1469
01:48:02,262 --> 01:48:04,302
- Everyone says "Chickens"!
- Smile!

1470
01:48:04,302 --> 01:48:05,131
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1471
01:48:05,261 --> 01:48:06,216
Its good.

1472
01:48:06,301 --> 01:48:07,700
Great, well done everyone.

1473
01:48:08,061 --> 01:48:09,972
Trevor, you sang really well today!

1474
01:48:10,181 --> 01:48:11,933
Thank you so much.

1475
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:16,854
Hello ! Hello...

1476
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:18,334
Roxanne?

1477
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:20,651
Frank?

1478
01:48:21,101 --> 01:48:23,569
What are you doing here ?
In this neighbourhood ?

1479
01:48:24,221 --> 01:48:25,661
I live here now.

1480
01:48:25,661 --> 01:48:28,858
I needed less rent
expensive and a little more space.

1481
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:31,060
- It's yours ?
- Yes, yes, it's my daughter.

1482
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,254
She is magnificent.

1483
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,659
So ?

1484
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,736
Does my mother
became a saint?

1485
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,940
We have two miracles,
Maria and the bombing of Bystrica.

1486
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:46,408
The church doesn't like to talk about Bystrica but they're counting it..

1487
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,131
We're waiting for a third.

1488
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,252
And you're a priest?

1489
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,494
Yes.

1490
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:56,536
And you're a mother.

1491
01:48:57,379 --> 01:48:58,175
Yes.

1492
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:00,418
Yes, I am a mom.

1493
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:02,530
She is really adorable.

1494
01:49:02,659 --> 01:49:03,296
Thank you.

1495
01:49:03,459 --> 01:49:06,019
I will hurry to bring her back
at home before it rains.

1496
01:49:06,379 --> 01:49:08,210
Yes my dear, we are going.

1497
01:49:08,299 --> 01:49:10,210
- Glad to see you.
- Yes me too.
