[Amy] Thanks,
It'll take me a second, oops.

70
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,579
[Helena] Don't you dare call
your mommy anything but, Amy.

71
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,789
Amy Sutton.

72
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,041
-[Helena] Right, that's correct.
-Okay.

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,377
She's a little tricky, the...

especially with...

75

So thing is... [chuckles]

76
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,845

that you going to steal her,

78
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,141

Twenty eight years old. [laughs]

81
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,355
So what do you think?

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,941
Jesus Joe, it's crooked.

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,945
[Abe] That's a real good
picture, Sherriff.

84
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,071
You think so, Abe?

85
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,990
You don't think it's too rural?

86
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:48,038
-Na, you look real... honest.
-[laughs]

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,289
I'd buy a used truck from you.

88
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,207
You'd buy a used truck from me?

89
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,210
I tell you what, I've got
this pretty little number

90
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,629
in my back yard, it used to
belong to this old trucker lady

91
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,465
and I would love
to sell it to you, Sir.

92
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,924
Throw in an old lady?

you're the only doctor
around these parts.

97

It is a mystery why you can't
find anything wrong!

98
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,690
It's a mystery alright,
that it is.

99
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,818
Maybe you ought to uh,
talk to Dr. Lindenheim.

100
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,614
Oh, so now you think I need
a shrink? Thanks allot!

[Joe chuckles]
When will you be back, Abe?

109
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,963
Two or three days.

110
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,257
Wait till you see
the new paint job on my truck.

111
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,509

Well, here's um,

123
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,621
Yeah, so this is the girl you've
been telling me so much about.

124
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,872
Hi.

125
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,458
Yeah, but we've never had
anybody with a baby before.

126
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,085
-[Amy] Oh don't worry--
-[Helena] Well, the baby's so--

127
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,211
[Helena] quiet.

128
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,630
[Amy] The baby won't interfere
with my work, I promise.

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
[Helena] She's wonderful.
Really wonderful.

130
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,719
In fact, she's going to be
hanging around much more.

131
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,514
-What's your name?
-Amy, Amy Sutton.

132
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,100
You're a widow?

133
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,978
[Helena] Um... yes. It's um...

134
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,106
it happened quite recent so...

135
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,526
-[baby whimpers]
-better not talk about it.

136
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,238
What do you think, Joe?

137
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,498
-[baby moans]
-Shh.

138
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,918
-[baby cries]
-Well we could use the help.

139
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,256
Yes, [laughs] I assure you,
you won't regret it.

140
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,842
I'll show you to the trailer
where you'll be staying.

141
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,302
-Just follow me, huh--
-[Helena] Good lady--

142
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,680
[inaudible whispers]

143
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,936
[Amy] See, we've gotta
get to work, yes we are.

144
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,272

Closing awfully early.

150
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,065
[Joe] It's been a long day.

151
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,487
I thought I'd go
to the drive-in movie.

152
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,366
Take Amy with me...
it'll be a break for her.

153
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,786
Well, I'd better freshen up.

154
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,497
Have fun!

155
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,084
I'll wait up. Don't be late.

[calm music]

157
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,191
[Joe] Did you enjoy the movie?

158
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,901
Yes. Yeah!

159
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,237
-[sighs]
-God.

160
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,408
This just doesn't seem real
to me, it feels like a dream.

161
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,827
[frogs croaking]
[Amy sighs]

162
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,662
Everything's so peaceful.

163
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,583
It's like another world,
it's like...

164
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,837
God, a world without killing,
without torture.

165
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,047
It just seems so...

166
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,304
-I don't--
-You don't have to explain.

167

00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,443
How is Maria?

171
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,903
Um, Maria is fine.

172
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,865
She wants very much
to come see you

173
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,074
and bring the baby but...

174
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,036
I keep telling her
it's too dangerous.

175
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,538
This is true.

176
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,252
I think I must go back
to my country, very soon.

177
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,882
Only thing Felipe, is...

178
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,135
you know that this time
if they get you...

179
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:23,928
they going to kill you.

180
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,352
[inhales]
I would like very much...

181
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,730
for Maria and the baby
to stay here, in America.

182
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,858
[inhales]

183
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,652
Maria may not agree with that!

184
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,363
Please, it's not her decision.

185
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,492
After what they have done to me,
I can't be her husband. I can't.

186
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:46,826
Oh, Felipe.

187
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,371
So many ways.

188
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,126
So many ways is that you can...
make love to a woman.

189
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,214
[Felipe] I am not crazy.
I don't need a shrink.

190
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,718
[laughs] I am not, I'm not
your shrink.

191
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,553
I'm your friend. I hope!

192
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,263
Well, you've been uh...

193
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,808
you've been brought to lies!

194
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:20,860
[sighs] I think perhaps
I must rest.

195
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,240
I'll take it.

196
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,450
Have a nice rest.

197
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,870
[solemn guitar music]

198
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,633
Where you headed?

199
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,514
Los Angeles.

200
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,851
Los Angeles? Oh you a very
lucky lady. Get in.

201
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,477
[door squeaks]

202
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,025
Come on!

203
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,795
[sighs] God, I've missed you,
Connie.

204
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,173
Why do you insist
on calling me Connie?

205
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,717
My name's Conchita,
call me Conchita.

206
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,595
Conchita is too formal.
I told you that.

207
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,181
You mean it sounds too Mexican.

208
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,059
Christ, we not going to
start that again are we?

209
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,852
Yeah! Let's start that again!

210
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,941
[sighs] No, let's not
start that again.

211
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,985
-Good.
-I don't wanna go to L.A.

212
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,195
Just take me home.

213
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,197
Why you doing this, huh?

214
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,991
God damn it!
Why are you doing this?

215
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,159
Because I'm sick and tired

216
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,660
of being treated
like a cheap whore.

217
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,954
-[sighs]
-Now turn around. Take me home.

218
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,085
As usual you're
not listening to me.

219
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,171
I said turn around
and take me home!

220
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,548
I said take me home!

221
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,805
[panting] Why do you have to
do this, huh?

222
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,140
Why do you always have to
put us through this crap?

223
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,600
If you want to sleep with me

224
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,811
come to my apartment
or I'll come to yours.

225
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,479
But don't drag me
to 20 different

226
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,897
flea bag motels in L.A.

227
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,817
You know why, we have to wait
until after the election.

228
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,069
-It won't be any different.
-Yes, it will.

229
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,155
Keep living a lie now,
it won't be any different after!

230
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,783
-Yes it will, God damn it!
-Why, why will it be different?

231
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,243
Because I love you!

232
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,122
[romantic music starts]

233
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,667
[sighs]

234
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,337
[sighs]

235
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,427
Why haven't you
said this before?

236
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,933
Because,
I don't want to lose you.

237
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,739
[romantic music continues]

238
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,551
[music continues]

239
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,855
[ominous music]
Señora.

240
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,484
Señora?

241
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,570
[in Spanish] Do you
speak Spanish?

242
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,408
[in Spanish] Do you
speak Spanish?

243
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,578
I'm sorry, are you asking me
if I speak Spanish?

244
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,833
No, just a couple of words
from high school.

245
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,044
Oh. [chuckles]

246
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,589
[in Spanish] Thank you
very much, Goodbye.

247
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,050
[Castillo] Vamos.

248
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,183
Rick, do me a favor.
Follow up on that

249
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,394
vandalism complaint out at the
Indian cemetery, alright?

250
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,521
[Rick] Yeah, we sure getting our
share of wacko's around here

251
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,398
-aren't we?
-Rick!

252
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
Listen, I hate to lay
all this crap on you.

253
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,860
-But the election's so close--
-Hey, no problem.

254
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:31,986
I'm rooting for you.

255
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,738
You win the election,
I'm the new Sherriff.

256
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,407
You think
I look like John Wayne?

257
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:36,991
[puffs] Shit.

258
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,374
Hi.

259
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,336
Can I help you?

260
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,674
Carl Moller,
Immigration, Washington.

261
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,552
This is Kernel Castillo,
his aid Lieutenant Vargas.

262
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,181
You boys have come a long ways.

263
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,058
I'm Sherriff Jenkins.

264
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,310
Country's got a lot of problems.

265
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,062
The papers are filled
with it all the time.

266
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,230
Unfortunately.

267
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,234
Outside the provocateurs
stirring up the people...

268
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,777
creating unrest.

269
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,071
Very unfortunate.

270
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,490
So how can I help you?

271
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,201
[Castillo] We have been looking
all over Central America...

272
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,039
for this man.
His name is Felipe Soto.

273
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,209
We believe that he may be
in this... vicinity.

274
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,212
[Fred] What's the name
of the girl?

275
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,630
Maria.

276
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,343
What'd he do?
What do you want him for?

277
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,511
-Murder.
-Murder!

278
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,433
Well, I tell you what, if I
run into him, I'll let you know.

279
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,852
We've noticed you running
for assembly.

280
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,355
Good luck.

281
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,024
Thank you.

282
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,039
[Joe] How did
your husband die?

283
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,124
You must have
been really young.

284
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,377
[Amy] Car accident.

285
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,713
[emotional music]

286
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,508
I need you.

287
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,387
[whispers] Joe please, don't.

288
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,640
Don't we need each other?

289
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,269
Joe... it's too soon, please.

290
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,024
I have to um,
get this to the baby. Excuse me.

291
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,506
[Sonny] Very nice and sweet.

292
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,299
[sighs]

293
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,429
A stupid girl with somebody
else's baby.

294
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,472
I don't know why
you want to get involved.

295
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,850
-I'm not.
-Oh, good.

296
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm going to get rid of her.

297
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,353
Will you leave her alone?

298
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,397
She's got enough
without you adding to it!

299
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,400
She will have some other fool
drooling over her

300
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,194
-wherever she gets her next job.
-[thud]

301
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,363
God you're nuts.

302
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,658
You have a glass pill bottle
where once you had a heart.

303
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,995
You sit there... sick!

304
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,039
No place but in your head!

305
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,958
You call it sick,
when I can't walk!

306
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,418
Of course you can walk!

307
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,379
Every doctor in this county
says you can walk!

308
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,256
Well it's easy for them to say!

309
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,634
-Morning fella's.
-Morning ma'am.

310
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,682
-Coffee gentlemen?
-Yes please.

311
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,124
[casual music]
[people chattering]

312
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,509
[agent] ...I don't want
your hair to look untidy

313
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,469
so I've made an appointment
tomorrow at two 'clock,

314
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,304
and I want you to bring the
brown suit. And...

315
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,475
...sorry I don't have the speech
ready for tonight's rally but...

316
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,143
I'll bring it to the station
in a couple hours,

317
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,937
and don't want any ad-lib's

318
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,231
no Eastern Europe,
South Africa, Central America.

319
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,775
Nobody cares! I want you to take
a look at these poll reports.

320
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,486
There are only three things
the voters give a damn about.

321
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,197
And that's crime,
taxes and drugs.

322
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,282
Did I ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

323
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,453
Can the charm crap Fred,
you dumped me two years ago.

324
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:51,996
I didn't dump you.

325
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,666
You're the one who didn't want
to move out in the boonies.

326
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:55,792
Remember?

327
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,877
And, speaking of the boonies.

328
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,380
I warned you
about your Mexican girlfriend.

329
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,090
Let's not get personal, alright.

330
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,967
-I'm not getting personal.
-No?

331
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,469
As your campaign manager,
I care about one thing--

332
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:07,929
[dramatic music]

333
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,931
Hey!

334
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,064
[Fred] Get up!

335
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,232
Get up!

336
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,610
Thanks!

337
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,030
No problem.
I'm Sherriff Jenkins.

338
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,033
-Dick Homer. Immigration.
-[panting]

339
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,200
What is he Mexican?

340
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,246
Guatemalan, El Salvador,
I don't know what. [pants]

341
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,998
Whatever he is, he's illegal.

342
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,958
[panting] Please Señor.

343
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,295
Please don't take me back.

344
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,758
My mamma sent me here.
[panting]

345
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,055
[crying] Four brother's killed,
my father killed.

346
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,682
[panting heavily]

347
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,559
I'm the only man left.

348
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,067
[crying]
She say I must not go back.

349
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,236
I hear the same story every day.
Ten times over--

350
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,571
Well maybe
he's telling the truth, huh--

351
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,615
What difference does it make,
we've got a job to do.

352
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,451
Jesus.

353
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,161
Alright, I'll lock him up.

354
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,163
How soon can you get
the paperwork done?

355
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,956
Uh, sometime tomorrow.

356
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,251
-Come on, it's alright. Come on.
-No!

357
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,879
Don't forget I'll meet you at
the station in a couple hours.

358
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,089
[Fred] Alright.

359
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,115
Here's twenty dollars.

360
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,119
There's a bus bound for L.A
in about 15 minutes.

361
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,162
Disappear!

362
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,960
Go on, get the hell out of here.
Before I change my mind.

363
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,586
Go on!

364
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,967
[engine starts]

365
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,016
[upbeat music]

366
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,228
[baby crying in background]

367
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,523
[Joe sighs] Go take care
of the baby, Amy.

368
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,608
You've got plenty
of time till lunch.

369
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,697
Do you mind Mrs. Moore,
it will just take me a minute.

370
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,491
-[Sonny] Go ahead.
-[Amy] Thanks.

371
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,373
[Sonny sighs]
She's not really that pretty.

372
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,208
I don't know
what you see in her.

373
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,672
You know, there was this
beauty contest I entered once.

374
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,966
and everybody said
I would have won it too.

375
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,179
Except they found out
I was pregnant... with you!

376
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,558
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah.

377
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,479
I heard! And you were just 17.

378
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,189
Well you don't have to
get so touchy.

379
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,607
You never answer me

380
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,318
so I'm never sure
if you hear me or not!

381
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,611
I hear you Sonny!

382
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,530
-What is the matter?
-I always hear you.

383
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,824
[inhales]

384
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,706
Let me go! Will you let me go?

385
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,001
[sighs] I don't know what
you're talking about, Joe.

386
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,878
You not my prisoner.

387
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,382
[exhales]
Your wheelchair is my prison.

388
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,802
Now how long a sentence
do I gotta serve?

389
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,346
[gasps] I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,056
-How long?
-[gasps]

391
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,768
Listen. [gasps]

392
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,938
Oh, you know I thought
that song sounded familiar.

393
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,858
Oh, you remember?

394
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,528
-You and I danced to this song
-[breathing heavily]

395
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,697
at cousin Sadie's wedding.

396
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:58,576
And you were 18... and I was 35.

397
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,205
And everybody there kept
saying how...

398
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,582
how we look,
just like brother and sister.

399
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,294
Do you remember?

400
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,255
Yes I remember.

401
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,049
I remember how you held me.

402
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,261
[sighs]

403
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,848
And everybody... formed a great,
big circle around us.

404
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,393
And everybody clapped
their hands. [panting]

405
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,439
And you whirled me around,
and around and around. [laughs]

406
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,899
-That I did!
-[laughing]

407
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,777
Let me hold you like I used to.

408
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,655
Like that.

409
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,825
And like this.

410
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,952
-[gasps]
-You wanna go dancing?

411
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,748
Oh I can't. I can't dance,
I can't even walk!

412
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,958
[Joe] Sure you can Sonny.

413
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,045
Let me take you dancing.

414
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,464
-We're up.
-[gasps] Wait!

415
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:56,634
Oh Joe!

416
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,637
[Sonny] Hold me! [gasps]

417
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,683
[Joe] I got you.

418
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,185
Hold me tight

419
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,603
[Joe] Hey, you're as light
as you ever were.

420
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,521
[Sonny gasps]

421
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,070
I love it when you hold me!

422
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,365
[Sonny crying]

423
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,496
[laughing]

424
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,881
[sighs and chuckles]

425
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:47,268
No! [moans]

426
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,897
[screams] You bastard!

427
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,651
You heartless,
rotten, bastard. You're crazy!

428
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,320
Ever since that girl got here

429
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,948
you've been acting
wild and crazy,

430
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,324
like when you used to drink!

431
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,868
For a while there,
you were normal!

432
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,705
You mean dead!

433
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,373
Mrs. Moore, what ha--

434
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,835
Get your dirty hands
off me, you little slut!

435
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,421
I don't want
your dirty hands on me

436
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,172
after they've been
all over him!

437
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,300
I will get you!

438
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,888
I will get you, and that
backseat baby of yours,

439
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,766
thrown out of town
by the Police.

440
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,060
You hear that, the Police!

441
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,479
Amy get out.
It's got nothing to do with you.

442
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,650
Shut up! You'll find out
it has something to do with her!

443
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,236
This is my place!

444
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,448
And I own it! It's in my name!

445
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,284
And so you'd
better get out, and quick!

446
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,328
[squawks]

447
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,332
[sobbing]

448
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,753
[sighs]

449
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,313
[car approaching]

450
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,567
Oh... Fred, huh?

451
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,735
-Hi.
-[chuckles]

452
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,362
How you doing?
How are all your sick people?

453
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,655
What do you mean sick people?
[giggles]

454
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,408
But anyhow, it's better
than what your opponent says.

455
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,995
How are all your loonies today,
he says. [chuckles]

456
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,538
So you still going to
vote for me, huh?

457
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,333
Oh sure,
I tell everybody it's...

458
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,669
good for your mental health.

459
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,253
-[laughs] That's good.
-[giggles]

460
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,797
That's a good slogan.
I'm going to keep that.

461
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,049
Listen Helena, there's some
some things I needed

462
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,842
-to talk to you about, um.
-Oh yeah?

463
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,344
I know how involved you are

464
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,929
in helping out people
in Central America.

465
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,265
What can you tell me about
a guy named Felipe Soto?

466
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:53,645
Felipe?

467
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,898
-Felipe S... Sota?
-Soto.

468
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,108
Now who is he, huh?

469
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,609
[Fred] Well I'm not too sure.

470
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,695
So what do you wanna know?

471
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,698
Well, there were these three
guys, um...

472
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,491
there's this Kernel
from Central America.

473
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,702
-what's his name? Um...
-You mean Castillo?

474
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,203
Yeah!

475
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,123
And his bodyguard and there's
this big tall blonde American.

476
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,458
-From Immigration.
-Not from Immigration.

477
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,253
He's uh... CIA.

478
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,005
-The CIA?
-Mm-hmm.

479
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,967
Jesus Christ,
it's what I was afraid of.

480
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:28,263
[both speak together] There's an
election in two weeks, yeah.

481
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,016
For God sakes,
I'm the Sherriff here you know

482
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,642
-I could be accused of uh...
-Nothing.

483
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,520
[Helena] What has he
got to do with you?

484
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:38,106
Well they showed me a
wedding photograph, right.

485
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,859
And the guys wife is the girl
working down at the diner.

486
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,193
-Amy?
-Amy.

487
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,361
-Yeah.
-Think it's Amy?

488
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,405
Now I've been told
Felipe is dead, right?

489
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,991
But these guys obviously think
he's very much alive,

490
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,951
-and they want him for murder.
-[laughs]

491
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,204
Well it can't be Amy, you know,
Amy was married to an American.

492
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,249
His name was, uh...
Frances Sutton.

493
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,210
Yes, I don't know of allot
about her, you know.

494
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,670
It's friends
of the family but...

495
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,632
anyhow, Frances Sutton,
he died in a car accident and...

496
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,844
and um,
Amy and the baby survived.

497
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:09,929
so um...

498
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,767
[chuckles] I wouldn't worry
about it. Really. [laughs]

499
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,187
You should go to the supermarket
and have your picture taken.

500
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,439
-Kissing some babies. [laughs]
-[laughing]

501
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,566
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

502
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,277
-Alright.
-Okay, keep it going, ja.

503
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,488
-You look good.
-Thank you.

504
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,451
[dramatic music]

505
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,295
Jerry!

506
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,802
Got to get him out of here,
Castillo is here.

507
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:51,429
Pack his things, put that in.
It's from the pharmacy.

508
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,098
-Right, straight away!
-Thanks.

509
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,767
Said that he'd fight him, shit!

510
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,060
[Jerry] Come on, get up!

511
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,145
Gotta get you out of here,
right now! Let's go.

512
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,452
Martin, I'm bringing Felipe
to L.A.

513
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,538
Kernel Castillo is here.

514
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,666
It's just a question of...
time, minutes. [huffs]

515
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,669
Um... no I haven't spoken
to her, but--

516
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,839
They know about her... yes.

517
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,551
Um... I'll be in L.A in about
an hour and half.

518
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,804
So would you try figure
something out. Right, bye-bye.

519
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,600
We'd like a few moments
of your time.

520
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,687
As you know I'm a doctor and
I have an appointment

521
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,939
-and I have to leave.
-This won't take long.

522
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,858
I don't think you understand
what I'm saying.

523
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,067
I'm a doctor and I have an ap--

524
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,029
Please sit down Dr. Lindenheim.

525
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:53,074
[Jerry] Easy on the steps,
let me help.

526
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,493
Things bleeding again.

527
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,746
We can stop at
Dr. Robinson's on the way

528
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,122
and tell him
to have a look at that, huh?

529
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,248
Okay.

530
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,636
[Jerry] Alright now.

531
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,638
Wait here,
and I'm going to go in

532
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,474
and find out who's in there
with Helena, alright.

533
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,146
Amy, forgive her.

534
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,398
It's just talk.

535
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,360
It was me.

536
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,488
I was a drunk
from the time I was 15.

537
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,075
We were on our way back
from some party.

538
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,744
As usual I drank too much.

539
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,413
And we went down an embankment.

540
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,791
I ended up with a few scratches.

541
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,211
She got stuck
in that wheelchair.

542
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:48,630
[whispers] Joe.

543
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,092
I've been a member of AA
for 10 years now.

544
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:54,636
What else can I do?

545
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:56,888
She still blames me.

546
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,683
But I want to live.

547
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,394
I want to be alive.

548
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,815
She can't... but we can!

549
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,775
Joe, it can't work.

550
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,237
She won't let me stay

551
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:17,075
and [sighs] it couldn't
work between us anyways.

552
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,537
[whispers] I'm so sorry, Joe.

553
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:24,833
I'm so sorry, Joe.

554
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,880
I have to speak
to Dr. Lindenheim.

555
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,758
She's waiting for some
information-- it's important!

556
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:36,970
Wait!

557
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,514
Kernel.

558
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:41,725
[sighs]

559
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,479
Yes?

560
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,441
I have to speak
to Dr. Lindenheim.

561
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,109
It's rather urgent.

562
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,819
She's very busy.

563
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,989
[laughs] It will only
be a minute. Just one.

564
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,407
Impossible.

565
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,367
Why don't you wait in there.

566
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,662
[laughs] Well um...

567
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,875
actually... I have some...

568
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,918
things that I need
to take care of outside.

569
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,047
The Dr. Lindenheim would prefer
if you waited in there.

570
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,258
[ominous music]

571
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,474
[gunshots]

572
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:23,933
[thud]

573
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,685
[more gunshots]

574
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,115
[gunshot]

575
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,375
[ominous music continues]

576
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,973
[footsteps]

577
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,241
[thud]

578
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:39,217
[huffs] But this is the
third time I've called.

579
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,555
You tell him, I pay him plenty
for his services, Conchita.

580
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,640
I am not going to wait
for him to call me back.

581
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,350
This is an emergency!

582
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,043
[speaking Spanish]

583
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,422
Mrs. Moore has called
three times.

584
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:18,965
She says it's an emergency.

585
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,051
What else is new? [chuckles]

586
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:25,805
-[child] Not again.
-[Conchita laughs]

587
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,392
Oh Dr. Robinson [pants]
I'm in terrible pain.

588
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,229
Joe threw me clear across
the restaurant.

589
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,858
I need a shot.
[panting] Please?

590
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,235
[sighs] Thanks Tom.

591
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,831
[slow Spanish music]

592
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,520
Well I told you you're not
going to find anything.

593
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,188
-You're a liar--
-You're wasting your time--

594
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:16,314
Dr. Lindenheim.

595
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:18,400
Our governments are friendly

596
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:22,612
Your country gives us
economic aid, military aid...

597
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,906
In Washington we were told

598
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,700
we would get the fullest...

599
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,493
cooperation.

600
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,953
Really?

601
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,414
Did you tell them that you were
going to break into my office

602
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,666
pull a gun at me,
and ransack my place?

603
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,668
Turn everything upside down,
I mean, really!

604
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:40,547
You should, you should produce
a search warrant,

605
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,341
in a perfectly orderly fashion,
just like everybody else.

606
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,260
Who the-- who the hell do you
think you are?

607
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,053
[Castillo] Things like that
take time.

608
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,223
The man we are looking for
is dangerous.

609
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,226
He's accused of murder.

610
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,561
[Helena] Yeah,
you make me laugh.

611
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:58,189
I mean it's really,
amusing I mean, in your country

612
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:02,027
murder is the official policy
of the government. [laughs]

613
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,112
Thousands of people
are being murdered every day.

614
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:07,115
[Helena] Yes, your highest
religious leader

615
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,410
was assassinated in his
own cathedral--

616
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,578
Be careful Dr. Lindenheim.

617
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,872
Your political sympathies
are well documented.

618
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:17,167
Don't, Don't.
Don't threaten me Carl.

619
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,503
Cause it doesn't work on me.
It's a complete waste of time.

620
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,882
You know, I live in a democracy,
cause hundr--

621
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,265
[gasps then moans]

622
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,817
[slow Spanish music]

623
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,492
-How do you do?
-What, what do you want?

624
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,954
Please, I'm looking for my wife.

625
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,540
She works at a
cantina near here.

626
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,793
Do you know
the name of the place?

627
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,133
No.

628
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:54,723
Shall I call a doctor?

629
00:41:56,725 --> 00:42:00,395
It's okay, but could I possibly
rest here for a moment?

630
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,441
Thank you very much. [sighs]

631
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,213
Is this what you're looking for?

632
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,632
Yes.

633
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:33,928
[Joe sighs] So you ready to go?

634
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,764
Almost.

635
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,475
I packed the baby's stuff,
I just have to pack mine.

636
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,268
I'll come with you.

637
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:42,395
Oh Joe, you can't.

638
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:44,689
You don't understand.
You don't know.

639
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,024
No, I'll come with you.

640
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,651
[sighs] Joe,
it wouldn't be right.

641
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,904
Right? It's not a word.

642
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,156
Alone! Now that's a word.

643
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,700
You're not alone Joe,
you have your mother.

644
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,911
-She needs you.
-She needs pills.

645
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,538
And a miserable day, after day,
stretching nowhere.

646
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,248
Well I can't do it anymore.

647
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:07,170
I tell you Amy, when I stand
close to you, I come alive.

648
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:09,589
You have one life
inside yourself,

649
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:11,758
and you deserve
all the years it has.

650
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:16,471
Not to be lost, lousy, wasted
years, don't you believe that?

651
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,598
Yes, I do believe that.

652
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:20,892
But you don't know who I am.

653
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,186
[Amy gasps]

654
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:31,027
I love you.

655
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:34,989
Joe.

656
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:36,950
It isn't that.

657
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:39,369
Well it's not anything.
It's not that.

658
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,664
Joe, it can't be between us!

659
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:45,417
Don't leave me.

660
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:51,089
Joe, listen to me.
It can't be!

661
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:55,677
Amy... I'm begging you.

662
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:59,639
-Don't leave me.
-Joe please stop, Joe!

663
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,559
Listen to me! I can't!

664
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:08,982
Amy!

665
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,699
[crying]

666
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,147
My name is Joe,
and I'm an alcoholic.

667
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,486
My name is Joe,
and I'm an alcoholic.

668
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,241
My name is Joe,
and I'm an alcoholic.

669
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,544
You bet I am.

670
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,138
[sighs]

671
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:32,065
[car honks]

672
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,734
-Hey Doc.
-Hi Fred.

673
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,195
Hey kids, how are ya?

674
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,572
[Fred] How you doing today?
Good to see ya.

675
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,408
You not going to get
many votes around here.

676
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,078
Well actually Doc I came to see
Connie-- Conchita.

677
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,997
In broad daylight? My-my.

678
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:50,166
She's inside.

679
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:53,545
Thank you Doc.

680
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,058
[Conchita gasps]

681
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:09,477
[Fred moans]

682
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,855
-Fred. [giggles]
-Conchita.

683
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:14,315
-[both giggle]
-Not here, huh.

684
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,693
-How about some fleabag motel
-[laughs]

685
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:18,820
-in Los Angeles, huh?
-[gasps]

686
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:22,532
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

687
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,868
[inhales] Well, uh...

688
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:27,746
you know that girl
who works down at Joe's café?

689
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:30,665
-Amy? The one with the baby.
-Yeah, yeah.

690
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:32,834
What's she like?

691
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:34,294
Well, she is very nice.

692
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,379
Very sweet,
but she seems a little troubled.

693
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,006
Yeah? She ever talk
about her husband?

694
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:39,758
No, he's dead isn't he?

695
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,093
Yeah, I mean, she ever
tell you what he did,

696
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:43,303
or how he died? Anything?

697
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:45,138
Well no,
there was never reason to.

698
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:48,808
-What's wrong?
-I don't know, I don't know.

699
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,019
What do you think
her nationality is?

700
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,522
Nationality? I don't know.

701
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,149
I've never thought about it.

702
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:58,651
Alright.

703
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:01,321
[Fred] I gotta go.

704
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,075
Listen um...

705
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,745
I got to do this rally
at the high school tonight.

706
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:15,168
I was wondering... if you'd
like to come with me?

707
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:22,550
I love you.

708
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:31,643
Are you sure you don't want me
to send for the doctor?

709
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:35,397
No... no I'm okay now.

710
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,316
Thank you very much
for your kindness.

711
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,236
I must find my wife.

712
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:43,738
Here, take my cane!

713
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,283
-No, I couldn't do this.
-I have many.

714
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:49,369
I... I make them myself.

715
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,089
[in Spanish] Thank you
very much, granny.

716
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,430
[in Spanish] Good bye.

717
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,517
There's a café
a couple miles down the road.

718
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,811
Maybe that's where she is.

719
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:19,274
God bless you.

720
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:31,870
[knocking on door]

721
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:33,788
[knocking]

722
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,166
[knocking]

723
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,335
Hey J--

724
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,003
Come on.

725
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,173
-Can't you read?
-You always open by now.

726
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:44,758
[Joe laughs]

727
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,176
What the hell's wrong with you?

728
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,261
What the hell's wrong?

729
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:52,974
[Joe laughs]

730
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,100
[knocking]

731
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:57,145
Read my lips.

732
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,690
[thud]

733
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:06,905
[phone rings]
I'll get it.

734
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,329
[sighs]

735
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:19,000
It's Mrs. Moore again.
She says Joe's been drinking.

736
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:21,795
I don't believe it.

737
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:23,588
Well she sounds
pretty hysterical.

738
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,714
[sighs]

739
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,801
-Tell her I'll be right there.
-Okay.

740
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,731
[Amy] Joe... what are you doing?

741
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,984
-[Amy] What?
-Never mind.

742
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:46,736
Never mind about that.

743
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:48,488
I got it all figured out.

744
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,700
I gonna pack a bag, and you,
me and the baby go--

745
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,201
-Oh God.
-You know where we going?

746
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:55,412
You know where?
We going to, where...

747
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:57,914
where the sidewalks are shady

748
00:49:57,997 --> 00:49:59,708
they got trees
planted all along.

749
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,377
Joe you haven't heard a word
I've been saying to you--

750
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,753
And when the baby's asleep,

751
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:05,797
we going to listen
to fine music.

752
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,257
-Or read a book--
-Joe.

753
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:10,301
-How does that sound?
-Sounds very nice.

754
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:12,053
-Let me go.
-Hey!

755
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,931
-Joe let me go!
-You think it's a woman I want?

756
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,767
Look, I can buy that.

757
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,477
-I can buy that alright.
-Joe.

758
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,396
[coins falling]

759
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,232
-I can't buy what you--
-You don't know who I am.

760
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:27,444
-Come here. Hey, hey.
-[groans]

761
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:28,987
Now you tell me
who you are!

762
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,280
You tell me who the--

763
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,491
My name isn't Amy,
it's Maria!

764
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,496
My husband is Felipe Soto,
I'm still married!

765
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,374
He was leading his people in our
position to their government

766
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,377
they arrested him
and tortured him and we escaped!

767
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:47,589
And we told everybody he was
dead and they didn't believe us

768
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:50,008
and now they after him,
and they want to kill him.

769
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,218
And I couldn't
tell you that then.

770
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,482
[puffs]

771
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:11,696
[screams]
[dramatic music]

772
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:19,496
[thud]

773
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:24,417
[screaming]

774
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:29,631
[shouts]

775
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:36,429
[loud clanging and banging]
[music continues]

776
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,976
[clanging]

777
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,737
[screams]
[dishes smashing]

778
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,872
Please save me [sobs]

779
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,043
[Joe screaming] What do you
want to see, huh?

780
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:10,880
Get out!
Get out you lousy bitch!

781
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,301
[dramatic music continues]

782
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:18,680
Hey Joe, what's the rush?

783
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:20,306
Hey, what did you do
to your hand?

784
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,311
[Abe] Hey Joe,
where are you going?

785
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:29,274
[tires screech]

786
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:32,986
[Abe] Hey Joe, God damn it.
What the hell are you doing?

787
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:35,739
[Sonny] Dr. Robinson,
Joe cut his finger off!

788
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,865
What?

789
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:39,242
Let me drive Joe, I'll take you
anywhere you want to go!

790
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,209
-[groans]
-[Joe] Demon aboard! [laughs]

791
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,920
-[Abe groans]
-[Joe laughing]

792
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,214
-[Joe] Hey you're on. [laughing]
-[Doctor] Okay.

793
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:54,591
Now listen to me Joe.

794
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:56,676
You don't want to stop,
that's okay.

795
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:59,054
You got to keep driving,
that's okay.

796
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:01,806
But let me,
take care of your hand,

797
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,059
or we going to have to
take it off at the shoulder.

798
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:06,561
Alright Doc. [laughs]

799
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:08,146
But, if you send me a bill

800
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,107
I'm going to report you to
the American Medical Association

801
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:13,610
for practicing medicine
on a moving vehicle.

802
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:14,736
[Doctor] Fine you do that.

803
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,237
Hold that open for me,
would you Abe.

804
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:52,482
[Fred] Hi.

805
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,653
-[gasps] Twice in one day?
-Yeah.

806
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:58,738
-What's wrong?
-[sighs]

807
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,865
I see.
You've got cold feet

808
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,117
and you don't want me
to come with you tonight.

809
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,243
No, no, no, look,

810
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:05,537
you always reading these
Spanish language newspapers.

811
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,663
-Right?
-Yeah.

812
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:08,623
Well who in the hell
is Felipe Soto?

813
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,166
[sighs]

814
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,168
I've heard the name, uh...

815
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:15,839
he's, one of the Gorilla leaders
down in Central America.

816
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:18,174
-I'm not sure, why?
-Is he dead?

817
00:54:18,299 --> 00:54:19,384
[Connie] I don't remember.

818
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:21,261
There are three men.
They looking for him.

819
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,346
-They say he's married to Amy.
-Amy?

820
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,306
Yeah, they also said
he's wanted for murder.

821
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:28,643
But Dr. Lindenheim said Amy's
husband is an American,

822
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,395
and that he's dead.
Now what is that?

823
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,105
Well, why are you so concerned?

824
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:34,733
I'm the Sherriff goddamn it,
that's why I'm concerned.

825
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:36,276
I've got an election
in two weeks.

826
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:37,777
That's why I'm concerned!

827
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,821
And maybe, I don't know,
just maybe,

828
00:54:39,904 --> 00:54:41,865
I feel like I should be
doing more, alright.

829
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,242
And these three
son of a bitches.

830
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,327
Let me tell you, I don't like
the smell of it at all.

831
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,080
[phone rings]
[Fred sighs]

832
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,875
No, I'm sorry. Um,
I'll pick you up later alright.

833
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,626
Mmm.
[phone continues ringing]

834
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:55,253
Doctor's office.

835
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,339
Fred, wait a second.

836
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,883
Yeah.

837
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,845
-Okay.
-What?

838
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:06,473
[Connie] Okay, I'll tell him.

839
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:10,226
That was Rick.
Mrs. Moore's hysterical.

840
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,562
[Connie] It seems that Joe
is drinking again.

841
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,648
Dr. Robinson went out there,
but now she says

842
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,484
Joe's wrecked the place
and wants you out there.

843
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,071
Why can't these people wait
till after the election, huh?

844
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,573
I mean, then they can all
go crazy!

845
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,034
[Fred sighs]

846
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:28,787
I'm sorry.

847
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,298
[Doctor] Joe,
I really should be getting back.

848
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:42,884
I'm not ready
to go back yet, Doc.

849
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,182
It will all be there
when I get back.

850
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:53,061
Except the one thing
I really care about.

851
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:58,483
So another minute, another day

852
00:55:58,566 --> 00:55:59,818
what difference
does it make, huh?

853
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,029
[Doctor] I have things to do,
Joe. Things.

854
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,239
[Abe] Hey Doc.

855
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:05,990
Why don't you have a drink?

856
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:07,951
Come on. Sit down.

857
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:09,661
Sit down a minute, relax.

858
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,038
[Doctor] Maybe I will.

859
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,837
[Abe groans]

860
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:40,233
It's about time you got here,
Fred. I could've died.

861
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,402
Jesus, when Joe
falls off the wagon,

862
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:43,737
he doesn't kid around, does he?

863
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:45,071
Did you find him yet?

864
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,615
No, not yet.
But don't worry um...

865
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,659
Rick put out a A.P.B
with highway patrol.

866
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:50,785
They'll pick him up.

867
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,121
What the hell is this? Blood?

868
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,790
Where'd it come from?

869
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:57,334
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

870
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,129
Fred... I want to
press charges against Joe.

871
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:02,714
You what?

872
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:06,051
Now you listen to me.

873
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,636
You don't want to
press charges against your boy?

874
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,764
That's your flesh and blood.

875
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:14,225
So what do you say I go
find him, talk to him...

876
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:16,144
and then I bring him back here,
alright?

877
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:18,396
Maybe you're right.

878
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,275
Besides how the hell am I going
to run this place alone, huh?

879
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:24,361
[laughs] That's a good point.

880
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:27,072
Besides, I have a pretty good
idea where he is.

881
00:57:29,824 --> 00:57:31,701
[baby gurgling]

882
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:32,994
So where you headed?

883
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,913
Well I tried calling
Dr. Lindenheim,

884
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:37,040
but I didn't get an answer.
So, I guess...

885
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:38,625
I'll just go over there,
and wait.

886
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,379
I tell you what. I've gotta go
out to the lake and pick up Joe.

887
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,255
That's the opposite
direction, but uh...

888
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:47,550
I'll call my partner and
have him come pick you two up.

889
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,552
No, no, no, no. I can wait
for the bus.

890
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,929
Really it's not a problem.

891
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,263
Really?

892
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,141
You wait here. Alright?

893
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,777
Oh, do you mind stopping at
Dr. Robinson's first?

894
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,320
I'd like to
leave the baby there.

895
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:08,571
[Rick] No problem.

896
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:12,117
Doctor... Lindenheim.

897
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:15,078
It's me.

898
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:21,543
Our patience...
is wearing very thin.

899
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,255
Where... is Felipe?

900
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,810
You're being very...
very foolish!

901
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:40,145
[Carl] Frances Sutton.

902
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:43,732
Frances Sutton, Felipe Soto,
Frances Sutton.

903
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,108
That's not very smart, Doctor.

904
00:58:46,776 --> 00:58:47,819
[sighs]

905
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,240
Wife, Amy. That's the name
of the girl at the diner.

906
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:55,702
What day is today, Kernel?

907
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:58,747
The twenty fifth.

908
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:02,334
Well then just yesterday
Señor Sutton,

909
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,253
had a complete physical
at the offices of Dr. Robinson.

910
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:09,716
[Carl] Is he still there?

911
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:19,517
Kernel, you and Bruno,
drop in on the doctor

912
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,102
and see if our friend
is still there.

913
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:24,272
I'll wait here.

914
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:31,196
Why are you doing this?

915
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,825
[sighs]

916
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:39,621
When I was um...

917
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,541
when I was ten years old, I...

918
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:46,378
I saw something that um.

919
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:50,965
[sighs]
affirmed something in me.

920
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:52,967
I have never forgotten.

921
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:54,636
Thank God.

922
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,805
I was in a concentration camp.

923
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,392
And um... there was a group
of women, they were...

924
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,770
going into a gas chamber.

925
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:06,815
They were, naked and um...

926
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,151
one of them, was a dancer.

927
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,822
Very beautiful.
Beautiful body, long black hair.

928
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:15,699
One of the SS guards.

929
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,244
Maybe he had been intimate
with her, I don't know.

930
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:23,331
He um... said um...

931
01:00:23,998 --> 01:00:26,084
[speaks German]
[chuckles]

932
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,003
Dance for me. [chuckles]

933
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:29,838
Very dramatic.

934
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,381
And she did.

935
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:33,425
She got closer and closer and...

936
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:39,389
this black hair
sort of embracing him, right.

937
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:42,892
[laughs] He forgot all about
that he wanted to kill her.

938
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:47,480
And he didn't notice that she
took his gun, right.

939
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:49,733
And she shot him.

940
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,861
Of course the next moment,
she was...

941
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,613
Shot down
by the other guards but...

942
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:59,200
didn't matter, see.

943
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:02,829
Cause she lived!

944
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:04,914
And died. [chuckles]

945
01:01:05,915 --> 01:01:07,250
On her own terms.

946
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,217
[gun cocks]

947
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,021
[gunshot]

948
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,940
[Amy] Okay, Jerry will help me
get the rest of the stuff in--

949
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:32,400
-Thanks Amy.
-Thank you.

950
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:34,194
-See ya.
-[Rick] See ya.

951
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:40,492
[suspense music]
[car engine starts]

952
01:01:57,842 --> 01:01:58,968
Felipe?

953
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,974
-[Amy screams]
-Where is he?

954
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:07,102
-Keep going.
-[screams]

955
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:09,854
-Is he in this one here, huh?
-[screams]

956
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,272
-Is he in here?
-[screams] No!

957
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:14,150
[Amy] Felipe! Felipe!

958
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,029
[Amy screams] Felipe! Felipe!

959
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:31,001
-Helena! Helena!
-Where the fuck is he?

960
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,226
[Joe] We not buying any, Fred.

961
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:50,478
[Fred] You alright there, Joe?

962
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:52,105
You feeling okay?

963
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:53,606
Never better.

964
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,442
-Hey Doc.
-[Doctor mumbles]

965
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:56,776
You always saying
you need time off.

966
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,153
Good to see you
out here relaxing.

967
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:00,655
I'm not sure
this is what I had in mind.

968
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,117
Mrs. Moore called me
and said that uh...

969
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:05,535
Joe had cut his finger off.

970
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:07,746
I was wondering if that was just
another one of her stories?

971
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:11,291
No Fred. That isn't
just one of her stories.

972
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:14,919
Jesus Christ, you actually
cut off your finger.

973
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:16,838
What the hell's
the matter with you? Why?

974
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:18,923
Well I'm not sure now.

975
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,260
But I'm sure I'm going to have
one hell of a hangover tomorrow.

976
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:23,553
[sighs]

977
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:27,724
And I'm sure I'm going to go
back to that diner,

978
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,435
pack my things and leave.

979
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:32,771
Where you going to go?

980
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:35,482
Where you headed?

981
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:37,692
Sacramento.

982
01:03:38,651 --> 01:03:39,694
Sounds good.

983
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:42,530
Think I might even stop off and
have a chat with the Governor.

984
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,284
I think we should be
getting back now, Joe.

985
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:49,412
[sighs] He's got me beat anyway.

986
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,290
We've got them
coat hangers to deliver.

987
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:54,250
Don't want to keep
them dresses waiting.

988
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:56,419
[Fred] You boys mind
if I tag along?

989
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:03,760
Son of a bitch.[laughs]

990
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:07,472
Señora.

991
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,893
Who are you?

992
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,521
Please, forgive me.

993
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:17,982
But I have come,
I'm looking for Maria?

994
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,277
Maria?

995
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,197
There's nobody
here by that name.

996
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:34,791
Do you mind if I sit?
For a moment. I'm very tired.

997
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,003
[car horn]
Thank you.

998
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:53,476
[sighs]

999
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,190
Señora?

1000
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:02,944
Forgive me.

1001
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:05,655
I didn't recognize you.

1002
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:09,242
[laughs]

1003
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:14,330
I see they've wounded you too.

1004
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,087
So many of us, killed.

1005
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:26,718
Or wounded.

1006
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,056
[Felipe sighs]

1007
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:36,227
Cantina since changed.
So much time.

1008
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:40,023
I used to
come back here with Maria,

1009
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:41,399
it was before the baby.

1010
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:43,401
We used to come
with our friends.

1011
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,239
And we danced!

1012
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,745
And sang, and laughed.
And tears too.

1013
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:57,707
So very long ago.

1014
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,422
You say the baby
and Maria are not here?

1015
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:08,510
Sorry.

1016
01:06:11,262 --> 01:06:13,348
[sighs] Me too.

1017
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:25,193
Don't leave without me, okay?

1018
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:27,654
Alright, I'll wait.
But don't be too long.

1019
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:29,823
I'm already way behind schedule.

1020
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,827
Joe. Joe!

1021
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,162
Before you go anywhere,

1022
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,915
you'd better stop by the office
and let me fix that hand right.

1023
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,126
You won't like it
if you get blood poisoning.

1024
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:43,336
I know a better doctor
in Sacramento.

1025
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:45,672
I'll be at the house
if you want--

1026
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:46,798
[Fred] Joe!

1027
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,137
I don't want any more
trouble out of you today.

1028
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,097
You understand?
I got to go back to the station.

1029
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,223
Now you behave yourself.

1030
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:57,058
I mean it.

1031
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,269
Joe!

1032
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:01,396
There's a crazy man inside.

1033
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:03,773
He should feel right at home.

1034
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:15,285
What does he want?

1035
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,496
He's looking for some woman,
named Maria.

1036
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,165
And a baby.

1037
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,045
He's Amy's husband.

1038
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,840
[Sonny] I thought
her husband was dead?

1039
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:32,969
[inhales] Hey.

1040
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:37,474
Can I help you?

1041
01:07:41,936 --> 01:07:43,104
I remember you.

1042
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:48,151
You're an American reporter
with a kind face.

1043
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:52,864
I remember you wanted a story
you wanted me to tell you

1044
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:54,115
and there was no time.

1045
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:57,077
You will listen now?

1046
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,412
[Joe] Yeah, sure.

1047
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:00,997
Let me get you
something to drink.

1048
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:04,084
-Something cold?
-Oh very nice.

1049
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:05,835
Water please.

1050
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:07,921
-[Joe] Okay.
-Just water.

1051
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,548
Okay.

1052
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,760
- Sí.
-Gracias.

1053
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,057
Alright Amígo. Uh...

1054
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:21,643
hey, you better get
Dr. Robinson this man's in pain.

1055
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:25,939
[speaking Spanish]
[phone rings]

1056
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:29,317
-[baby crying]
-Good afternoon doctor's office.

1057
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,444
Ah, Mrs. Moore.

1058
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:34,989
I'm sorry Dr, Robinson isn't
here right now, but if--

1059
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,118
[ominous music]

1060
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:41,204
Well he's been out
for quite a while.

1061
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:43,915
He has lots of appointments
for the rest of the day.

1062
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:47,919
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

1063
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:49,546
Her husband?

1064
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,506
Amy's husband is at the diner?

1065
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:55,010
Well did you call
Dr. Lindenheim?

1066
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:57,220
[door slams]
[baby crying continues]

1067
01:08:57,303 --> 01:08:59,305
Okay, okay.
The minute he gets here.

1068
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:01,099
Bye-bye.

1069
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:03,351
Where'd they go.

1070
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,482
[baby screaming]

1071
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,615
[phone ringing]

1072
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:21,745
I was a teacher.

1073
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:24,581
At a catholic university.

1074
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:27,751
Then my sweet children,
my students.

1075
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:30,754
[inhales]

1076
01:09:31,713 --> 01:09:32,756
[laughs]

1077
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:34,966
They demanded democracy.

1078
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:42,515
-Freedom.
-[people chanting]

1079
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:46,811
And the Government
shut them down.

1080
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:51,483
So, I had to join them
in the streets.

1081
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:58,573
[people screaming]
[gun shots]

1082
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:01,451
Thou shalt not kill.

1083
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,162
I said.

1084
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:09,834
I told them,
there must be an end to war.

1085
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:13,963
An end to the tearing
of the flesh.

1086
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,925
I pleaded with them, no weapons.

1087
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,259
No war!

1088
01:10:18,843 --> 01:10:23,264
And they cast... blows...
upon my body.

1089
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,184
And they bruised my flesh.

1090
01:10:27,894 --> 01:10:29,396
And the authorities were there.

1091
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,648
Meaning the greed of their sins.

1092
01:10:32,148 --> 01:10:35,068
[Abe] Hey Joe,
I got to be going!

1093
01:10:37,445 --> 01:10:42,826
I knew then only the word...
only the Spirit of Christ.

1094
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,330
Thou shalt not kill.

1095
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,544
And they threw me out of the
university for...

1096
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,588
political activities, they said.

1097
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:58,550
Following the teachings
of Christ.

1098
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,888
[sighs]

1099
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:08,059
Not much has changed
in 2000 years, huh?

1100
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:14,399
[Joe] Felipe,
would you like to lie down?

1101
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:19,446
No, little brother. Very soon
I will sleep for all eternity.

1102
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:23,158
I fear I'm half asleep already.
Just listen! Please! Now!

1103
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:27,495
Because it was then
that I met Maria. [inhales]

1104
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:29,831
She was born in America.

1105
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,376
Louisiana, she told me.

1106
01:11:34,544 --> 01:11:35,837
When she finished college...

1107
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,883
her parents were homesick
for their homeland...

1108
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,552
returned to our country.

1109
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:48,725
Maria was visiting them,
when the demonstration started.

1110
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:52,729
Maria stayed at my side.

1111
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:57,650
During all my troubles
at the university.

1112
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,240
But when finally there was
no hope in continuing my work...

1113
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,369
we joined my people
in the hills.

1114
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:13,166
To help fight...
destroyers of our country.

1115
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:28,515
We went from village to village
asking people to join us.

1116
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:31,685
Against the oppressors.

1117
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,107
The killers of our children.

1118
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:51,371
And then I was captured.

1119
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:58,253
They threw me in a room, and
asked me a thousand questions.

1120
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,588
People's names and places.

1121
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,133
[speaking Spanish]

1122
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,940
[continues speaking in Spanish]

1123
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,826
I couldn't tell them a thing.

1124
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:35,707
But if only.

1125
01:13:38,209 --> 01:13:40,795
They had beat me more,
killed me.

1126
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:46,634
If only they had hit me more
with stones on my bruised flesh.

1127
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:51,014
If only, if only,
if only they had left me whole.

1128
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,736
[screaming]

1129
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,211
But the rest,
for me is like a dream.

1130
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:25,548
Escape!

1131
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:29,302
In an airplane.

1132
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:34,474
Hospital, and American doctor.

1133
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,027
You will tell our story!

1134
01:14:49,614 --> 01:14:50,657
Thank you.

1135
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,289
I think maybe I'll rest now.

1136
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,960
[acoustic guitar music]

1137
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:18,018
[gunshots firing]
[screams]

1138
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:21,688
[Castillo laughing]

1139
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:24,858
Well good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1140
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:29,821
Ah, the good Professor! [laughs]

1141
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,198
Goodbye Señor.

1142
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:38,329
[gunshots firing]

1143
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:40,123
[screams]

1144
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:45,795
[groans]

1145
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:50,967
[yells]

1146
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:55,180
[gunshots]

1147
01:15:58,808 --> 01:15:59,976
-[Fred] You alright?
-[Joe] Yeah.

1148
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,978
-Jesus Christ.
-Where's Amy?

1149
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,563
I took her
to Dr. Lindenheim's house.

1150
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,273
[Joe] Okay,
that's where I'm going!

1151
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:06,524
No you're going nowhere.

1152
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:07,776
-No, I'm going--
-Now you listen to me.

1153
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:09,652
You are going nowhere!
You understand?

1154
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:12,655
Now this is just two of them.
There's still the American.

1155
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,616
Let's go Rick. Stay here!

1156
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,777
-[panting] Anything?
-Nothing.

1157
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:56,825
[Carl] Drop your gun Sherriff!

1158
01:16:57,325 --> 01:16:58,410
I said drop your gun,

1159
01:16:58,493 --> 01:17:00,495
and tell your flunky
downstairs to drop his too!

1160
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,622
That is if you want to see
the young lady live?

1161
01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:04,207
I didn't know
Immigration Officers

1162
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,959
were in the habit
of going around killing people.

1163
01:17:06,209 --> 01:17:08,294
Let's end
all conversation, Sherriff.

1164
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:11,631
You hand over Mr. Soto,
and I'll let you have Mrs. Soto.

1165
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:15,635
Sherriff, I told you to tell
your friend to get lost.

1166
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:17,387
No, you stay
right where you are, Rick.

1167
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,516
-I'm asking one last time.
-Fuck you!

1168
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,601
-Fuck you!
-[Amy yelps]

1169
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,478
Lay your gun down.

1170
01:17:26,062 --> 01:17:29,065
I tell you what, first,
you give me the lady, alright.

1171
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:32,318
You give me the husband,
I'll give you the lady.

1172
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:35,613
[Amy panting and whimpers]

1173
01:17:35,947 --> 01:17:38,575
-[Amy yelps]
-Alright, alright.

1174
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:40,869
-No! Don't tell him where he is.
-Shut up!

1175
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:44,039
He's at the diner with the
rest of your goddamn friends.

1176
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,331
[Amy] Oh God!

1177
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:48,668
Now, Mrs. Soto is an American
citizen, you understand?

1178
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:51,046
I suggest you release her
to me, right now!

1179
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:54,090
-Drop your gun, Sherriff.
-[whimpers]

1180
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:57,635
When I get to the door,
with both your guns.

1181
01:17:57,802 --> 01:17:58,928
You can have the lady.

1182
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,932
For the last time,
drop your gun.

1183
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:05,310
Don't you hurt her!

1184
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:09,230
Alright.

1185
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,066
[Amy whimpers]

1186
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:16,154
[whimpering]

1187
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:18,782
[thud]

1188
01:18:19,574 --> 01:18:20,658
Okay.

1189
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:21,826
[Carl softly] Now kick it
over here.

1190
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,412
-What?
[louder] Now kick it over here!

1191
01:18:27,123 --> 01:18:28,166
[Carl] Back up!

1192
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,711
Now tell your friend
to drop his gun.

1193
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:35,215
Throw it away, Rick.

1194
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:36,341
Come on, Fred you kn--

1195
01:18:36,424 --> 01:18:37,884
Goddamn it,
you do what I tell you!

1196
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:41,971
[thud]

1197
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,473
[Carl] Up the stairs!

1198
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,934
-Move!
-[Fred] Come on Rick.

1199
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:50,271
[Carl] Back up! Move,
move, move!

1200
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,241
[Amy groans]
[squeals and moans]

1201
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:05,578
[both groaning]

1202
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:08,373
[huffing and groaning]

1203
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,710
[moaning]

1204
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:16,297
Good try. [huffing]

1205
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,967
You knew I wasn't going to
leave anyone of you alive.

1206
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:22,345
[gunshots]
[dramatic music]

1207
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:44,284
[dramatic music continues]

1208
01:19:58,548 --> 01:19:59,591
[Doctor] Hey.

1209
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:02,052
I was hoping
I could see Joe, before I left.

1210
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,722
Well... he has his hands full,
you know,

1211
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:08,350
Getting Sonny set up
with her sister in San Diego.

1212
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,977
Getting the café sold.

1213
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,229
Yeah, I know. I spoke
to him allot over the phone.

1214
01:20:15,523 --> 01:20:17,275
-Hey guys.
-Hi!

1215
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:19,486
I'm uh, sorry I'm late.

1216
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,864
Too many reporters, and uh,
too much champagne.

1217
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:25,408
Congratulations!
Saw you on the tube last night.

1218
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,077
-Wow!
-[Doctor] Pretty good speech.

1219
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,371
-Yeah, you think so?
-It was great!

1220
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:31,623
Listen, you really didn't have
to come all this way

1221
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,376
to pick me up, I could have
taken a taxi to the airport.

1222
01:20:34,876 --> 01:20:37,796
Well I want the folks
in your country to know that uh,

1223
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:40,799
most Americans are pretty
friendly and hospitable people.

1224
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:42,634
Am I right, Conchita?

1225
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:44,678
-Uh huh.
-[laughs]

1226
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,514
-[Fred clears his throat]
-Well, thanks for everything.

1227
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:48,890
[Amy] Um, listen...

1228
01:20:50,016 --> 01:20:51,142
listen um...

1229
01:20:51,893 --> 01:20:54,187
If you see Joe, could you
please tell him that I'm r--

1230
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:55,313
Maria!

1231
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,403
Joe!

1232
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:07,450
I'm really glad you made it
out here to say goodbye.

1233
01:21:08,326 --> 01:21:09,369
Goodbye?

1234
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:11,246
[huffs]
What do you mean goodbye?

1235
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:15,166
You, the baby and me,
we're all going.

1236
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,211
I got my ticket
and the passport.

1237
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,716
-[gasps]
-I want to be there for you Amy.

1238
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:24,884
Maria.

1239
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:27,887
There's a war going on
down there, Joe.

1240
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:32,308
I know. Felipe told me.

1241
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:35,687
Well, you wanted
tree lined streets, you wanted..

1242
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:37,647
quiet!

1243
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,149
You wanted peace.

1244
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:44,738
We'll make peace there!

1245
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:51,119
[romantic music]
[birds chirping]

1246
01:22:13,975 --> 01:22:15,018
[Fred] You know you guys
keep this up,

1247
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:16,269
you going to miss you plane.

1248
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,105
Let's go. I got a big backseat.
You can hug all you want.

1249
01:22:19,814 --> 01:22:20,857
[Fred] Let's go!

1250
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:36,873
-Oh, thank you Conchita.
-She's ready for her mamma.

1251
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,835
-[Connie in Spanish] Good luck.
-[in Spanish] Thanks a million.

1252
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,463
[Connie] Bye Joe.

1253
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,676
[engine starts]
Bye Joe, bye Amy.

1254
01:23:10,323 --> 01:23:11,908
