499
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:03,386
            KATRINA,

00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:05,922
        I HAVE TO GO.

501
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,059
    KATRINA, DEAR, THIS IS
    MR. ICHABOD CRANE,

502
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:12,111
    OUR NEW SCHOOLMASTER.

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,163
            I AM ENCHANTED
            TO MAKE

504
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:17,517
            YOUR ACQUAINTANCE,
            MISS VAN TASSLE.

                AH, KATRINA
                VAN TASSLE.

506
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:23,740
SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
GIRL I EVER SAW.

507
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:25,108
            AND THE RICHEST.

508
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,660
    THERE WASN'T A MAN
    ALIVE IN SLEEPY HOLLOW

509
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,679
    WHO WOULDN'T SELL
    HIS SOUL TO THE DEVIL

510
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:32,047
    FOR FAIR KATRINA'S
        HAND.

511
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:34,067
            TILL ICHABOD CRANE
            CAME ALONG.

512
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,151
        AYE.

513
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,202
    WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
    SUSPECT IT

514
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,319
    JUST LOOKING AT HIM.

515
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,622
            AND WHO'D
            HAVE TAKEN HIM

516
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,373
            FOR A THIEF
            OF HEARTS?

517
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:43,242
            BROM BONES
            CERTAINLY NEVER DID.

518
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,661
        MM!

519
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,749
    #	 TO WICKED MEN HIS EAR #	

520
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:55,421
    #	 NOR LED HIS LIFE
    AS SINNERS DO #	

521
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,560
        #	 NOR SAT
    IN SCORNER'S CHAIR #	

522
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:06,849
        #	 BUT IN THE LOVE
        OF THE LORD #	

523
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:11,854
    #	 DOTH SEND HIS HOLY LIGHT #	

524
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:16,893
    #	 AND IN THE SAME,
    DOTH EXERCISE #	

525
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:23,999
    #	 HIMSELF BOTH DAY
        AND NIGHT #	

526
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,170
            I'M SORRY KATRINA
            COULDN'T COME.

527
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:29,021
            SHE'S GONE
            TO DOBB'S LANDING

528
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:31,190
            FOR THE CUP RACES
            TOMORROW.

529
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,441
             THEY'VE GONE
             TO CHEER ON

530
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,859
            OUR TOWN'S
            CHAMPION--

531
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,795
            MR. ABRAHAM
            VAN GRUNT.

532
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,930
OH, I'M RELIEVED
TO HEAR IT.

533
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,215
 I WAS DISAPPOINTED
 TO THINK OUR CHOIR

534
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:40,633
WOULD HAVE TO DO
WITHOUT HER ANGELIC

535
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:43,202
COLORATURA.

536
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,571
            HER--HER WHAT?

537
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,557
    OH.

538
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,292
THAT'S A RUSSIAN PHRASE

539
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:51,661
FOR A SINGING VOICE
OF MANY BRIGHT COLORS...

540
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,512
                    OH.
IF YOU WILL.

541
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:56,149
LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT
IN THE LAND OF EGYPT.

542
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:59,602
THE SORT THAT IS
SUITABLE FOR OPERA.

543
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,487
THE VOICE, THAT IS,
NOT THE COAT.

544
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,856
            OH, MY, MY!

545
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:05,491
            I DON'T BELIEVE
            WE'VE EVER HAD

546
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,043
            SUCH A CULTURED
            GENTLEMAN

547
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:08,928
            IN SLEEPY HOLLOW.

548
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:10,396
            WHY DON'T YOU COME
            TO DINNER WITH US

549
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:12,381
            TOMORROW NIGHT,
            MENEER CRANE.

550
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,851
    WELL, I'D BE HONORED.

551
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,653
            HA HA! WAIT TILL
            I TELL KATRINA

552
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:20,223
            SHE SINGS IN COLORS!

553
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,024
            GOOD NIGHT,
            MENEER CRANE!

554
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:29,999
    [PEOPLE CHATTERING]

555
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,616
            I WAS JUST TALKING
            TO A FELLA I KNOW

556
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:06,218
            FROM SING SING.
            THADDEUS KINKLE?

557
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:07,736
            I'LL BE RACING
            AGAINST HIM.

558
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:10,306
OH, YES? I KNOW THADDEUS.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

559
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,592
        HE TOLD ME HE'S LEAVING
        FOR THE OHIO TERRITORIES

560
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,010
        IN A WEEK.

561
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:15,194
BROM, I THOUGHT
WE WEREN'T GOING

562
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,346
TO TALK ABOUT THIS
ANYMORE.

563
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:20,650
            KATRINA, HE'S A YEAR
            YOUNGER THAN ME.

564
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,867
            THERE ARE MEN
            EVEN YOUNGER

565
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,902
             THAT HAVE MADE
             THEIR FORTUNES

566
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:25,337
            FARMING OUT WEST.
            THERE'S NO LIMIT

567
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,939
            TO WHAT A MAN
            CAN DO OUT THERE

568
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:28,624
            IF HE'S GOT
            A STRONG BACK...

569
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:31,194
             AND A GOOD WIFE.

570
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,965
BROM, PLEASE.

571
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,316
YOU KNOW HOW
I FEEL ABOUT IT.

572
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:38,701
WHY DO YOU BRING IT
UP AGAIN?

573
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,286
        WHAT ABOUT HOW I FEEL?

574
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:43,239
        OPPORTUNITY'S
        PASSING ME BY.

575
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:45,775
        THIS IS A ONCE
        IN A LIFETIME CHANCE.

576
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:48,578
BUT I CAN'T
GO WITH YOU. I WON'T.

577
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,599
             I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
             KATRINA.

578
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:55,284
            I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
            MORE OUT OF LIFE

579
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:56,886
            THAN JUST
            SLEEPY HOLLOW.

580
00:28:56,955 --> 00:29:00,339
I DO WANT MORE,
BUT NOT LESS.

581
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:02,575
I WANT TO SEE
THE CIVILIZED WORLD,

582
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:04,326
NOT THE PRIMITIVE
WILDERNESS.

583
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:07,313
I WANT TO SEE AMSTERDAM

584
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,732
AND ATTEND CONCERTS,
AND SEE THE FASHIONS

585
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:12,134
 AND THE GREAT MUSEUMS.

586
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,270
AND I WANT TO
COME HOME AGAIN

587
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:15,588
TO THE BEAUTIFUL FARM

588
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:19,008
MY PARENTS HAVE SPENT
THEIR LIVES BUILDING.

589
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:22,078
BROM, I AM THEIR ONLY HEIR.

590
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,480
I CAN'T JUST TURN

BUT WHAT MAKES
A PLOW HORSE FAMOUS?

1201
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,614
    HAD NO SENSE OF DIRECTION!

1203
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:41,385
AND WHEN GUNPOWDER
PLOWED A FIELD,

1204
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:46,173
IT LOOKED LIKE THE PATTERN
ON A PATCHWORK QUILT!

    THAT STRANGLED HER COFFIN.

    BY THE DUST OF HER GRAVE,

01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:08,648
        WHEN SUDDENLY,

1287

THE WOMAN'S HANDS PULLED HIM
INTO THE BLACK PIT SCREAMING!

1292
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:23,397

01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:24,614
            FOR OUR
            HONORED GUEST.

1294
01:11:24,683 --> 01:11:26,166
            NO ONE TELLS IT
            LIKE YOU DO.

1295
01:11:26,235 --> 01:11:31,672
OHH. I'M AFRAID MR. CRANE
IS VERY HARD TO IMPRESS.

1296
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,441
I TOLD HIM THE TALE
AT THIS VERY HOUSE

1297
01:11:34,509 --> 01:11:36,577
AND HE STILL WALKED
THE SLEEPY HOLLOW ROAD

1298
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:38,228
AFTER THE WITCHING HOUR,

1299
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:39,579
ALTHOUGH I OFFERED LODGING.

1300
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:41,097
DIDN'T YOU, MR. CRANE?

1301
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,215
        I DID.

1302
01:11:42,284 --> 01:11:43,933
            I THINK YOU'D BE
            MORE IMPRESSED

1303
01:11:44,002 --> 01:11:46,036
            IF YOU RAN INTO HIM.

1304
01:11:48,907 --> 01:11:50,757
    OH, BUT I DID
    RUN INTO HIM, MENEER,

1305
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:53,727
    BUT I'M NOT ALTOGETHER SURE

1306
01:11:53,795 --> 01:11:56,747
    THAT IT WAS YOUR...
    HEADLESS HORSEMAN

1307
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:58,231
    AND NOT SOME OTHER
    SOLDIER OF SATAN,

1308
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:02,152
    FOR I DID NOT SEE HIS HEAD
    OR LACK OF ONE THEREOF,

1309
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:06,823
    BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU HE CAME
    WITH COMPANION GHOSTS.

1310
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:10,577
WHAT HAPPENED, MR. CRANE?
TELL THE TALE!

1311
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:12,195
 TELL THE TALE!

1312
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:13,914
        All: TELL THE TALE!

1313
01:12:17,519 --> 01:12:20,120
        WELL, UH, I WAS
        PROCEEDING HOMEWARD

1314
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:21,137
        TO THE VAN RIPPER'S

1315
01:12:21,206 --> 01:12:22,806
        WHERE I WAS BOARDED
        THAT WEEK,

1316
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:25,525
        WHEN THE HAUNTS
        CHARGED ME ALTOGETHER.

1317
01:12:25,594 --> 01:12:26,977
    [ALL GASP]

1318
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:30,430
        WELL, HAD I SHOWN FEAR,

1319
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:32,215
    THEY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED
    IN THEIR PURPOSE,

1320
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:34,217
    BUT I STOOD MY GROUND,

1321
01:12:34,285 --> 01:12:37,704
    AND JUST AS THEY WERE
    ABOUT TO TRAMPLE ME,

1322
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:41,358
        THEY VANISHED
        LIKE THE MIST...

1323
01:12:41,426 --> 01:12:43,176
        INTO NOTHINGNESS.

1324
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:45,829
JUST VANISHED, DID THEY?

1325
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:48,432
        LIKE THAT.

1326
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:52,251
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.

1327
01:12:52,338 --> 01:12:54,154
        I DOUBT IT WAS
        THE HORSEMAN HE SAW,

1328
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:57,858
        FOR NO MAN CAN STAND
        IN HIS WAY AND LIVE.

1329
01:12:57,943 --> 01:12:59,109
    WELL, MR. VAN BRUNT,

1330
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:00,310
    I BELIEVE YOUR
    HEADLESS HORSEMAN

1331
01:13:00,362 --> 01:13:01,878
    FEARS THOSE
    WHO DO NOT FEAR HIM,

1332
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:03,864
    WHICH EXPLAINS
    WHY HE CHARGED ME

1333
01:13:03,932 --> 01:13:06,166
    IN THE COMPANY OF A HOST
    OF OTHER MOUNTED GHOSTS

1334
01:13:06,235 --> 01:13:10,653
    AS IF HE KNEW
    THAT BY HIMSELF

1335
01:13:10,722 --> 01:13:12,956
    HE WOULD BE
    AT THE DISADVANTAGE.

1336
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:14,290
        BRAVE WORDS SITTING HERE

1337
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:17,177
        IN A ROOM FULL OF
        GOD-FEARING PEOPLE,

1338
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:19,062
        WITH LIGHT AND GOOD FOOD

1339
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:21,932
        AND WHISKEY
        TO WARM YOUR SOUL.

1340
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,316
    BUT I'LL WAGER YOUR BLOOD

1341
01:13:23,402 --> 01:13:24,634
    WOULD RUN AS COLD
    AS MINE DID

1342
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:26,603
    WERE YOU TO MEET THE REAL
    HEADLESS HORSEMAN

1343
01:13:26,672 --> 01:13:28,788
    ON THE DARK ROAD
    ALL ALONE.

1344
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:33,109
            YOU'VE SEEN THIS
            HEADLESS HORSEMAN?

1345
01:13:33,178 --> 01:13:34,695
        SEEN HIM...

1346
01:13:34,763 --> 01:13:36,446
        AND MORE.

1347
01:13:36,515 --> 01:13:39,649
                TELL THE TALE!
                TELL THE TALE!

1348
01:13:39,717 --> 01:13:41,268
    All: TELL THE TALE!

1349
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:48,224
        I WAS RETURNING HOME

1350
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:49,509
        FROM A NAME DAY
        CELEBRATION

1351
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:51,261
         FROM MY UNCLE
         IN SING SING.

1352
01:13:51,313 --> 01:13:54,330
    THOUGH IT WAS WELL PAST
    THE WITCHING HOUR,

1353
01:13:54,383 --> 01:13:56,233
        WE CAME ALONG
    THE SLEEPY HOLLOW ROAD

1354
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:59,068
    TO SAVE US AN HOUR MORE
        OF RIDING.

1355
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:01,038
    SOME SAY IT WAS FOOLISH
    TAKING THE CHANCE,

1356
01:14:01,106 --> 01:14:03,440
    KNOWING WHAT THE HORSEMAN
        DONE TO BREWER,

1357
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:06,143
    BUT I'D NEVER SPOKEN
    DISRESPECTFUL OF HIM

1358
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:09,045
    AND ME AND DAREDEVIL
    COULD OUTRUN AND OUT-RIDE

1359
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:10,296
        ANY MAN OR GHOST!

1360
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:12,865
        OR SO I THOUGHT.

1361
01:14:12,934 --> 01:14:14,000
        AND SO IT WAS.

1362
01:14:14,086 --> 01:14:17,003
        AS WE COME
    TO MAJOR ANDRE'S TREE,

1363
01:14:17,072 --> 01:14:19,272
    DAREDEVIL PULLED UP
        IN HIS GALLOP

1364
01:14:19,341 --> 01:14:20,490
    AND REARED UP SO HIGH,

1365
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:21,708
    HE NEARLY THROWN ME DOWN...

1366
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:23,226
                [ALL GASP]

1367
01:14:23,295 --> 01:14:25,111
    AND THERE BEFORE ME

1368
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,898
    WITH THE BRIGHT RED MOON
        BEHIND HIM...

1369
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,767
    SAT THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN

1370
01:14:30,836 --> 01:14:32,218
    IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

1371
01:14:32,287 --> 01:14:33,836
            [ALL CHATTER]

1372
01:14:33,905 --> 01:14:36,139
    Brom: HE DIDN'T MOVE...

1373
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:41,128
    SO I STARTED DAREDEVIL
    AT A GENTLE TROT TOWARD HIM,

1374
01:14:41,196 --> 01:14:43,563
    THINKING I COULD DASH
THROUGH THE STREAM AROUND HIM

1375
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:45,332
    AND MAKE A RUN FOR MY LIFE.

1376
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:47,967
    I<i> KNEW</i> ME AND DAREDEVIL
        COULD DO IT...

1377
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:50,621
    BUT AS WE CAME ABREAST,

1378
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:53,190
        HE DREW HIS SWORD
        FROM HIS SCABBARD

1379
01:14:53,258 --> 01:14:54,324
        AND RAISED IT HIGH

1380
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:55,992
    AND THEN HE SWUNG IT AROUND
        TO TAKE MY HEAD!

1381
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,411
    IF I HADN'T DUCKED DOWN,

1382
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:00,680
    HE WOULD HAVE SLICED IT
CLEAN OFF WITH HIS FIERY SWORD!

1383
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:02,882
    WELL, SIR, ME AND DAREDEVIL,

1384
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:05,018
         WE RUN LIKE
     WE NEVER RUN BEFORE,

1385
01:15:05,103 --> 01:15:06,135
    BUT THAT DEVIL HORSE

1386
01:15:06,204 --> 01:15:07,971
    WAS BREATHING FIRE
    ON DAREDEVIL'S RUMP,

1387
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,174
AND THAT SWORD WAS FLASHING
AND SLASHING THROUGH THE DARK,

1388
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:14,077
        AN INCH FROM
    THE BACK OF MY NECK.

1389
01:15:14,146 --> 01:15:16,597
     WE BOTH KNEW WHAT IT WAS
     WE WERE UP AGAINST.

1390
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:19,466
    WE WERE RUNNING, I TELL YOU,

1391
01:15:19,534 --> 01:15:24,004
    BUT NEVER DID WE GAIN
    A STRIDE ON OUR PURSUER.

1392
01:15:24,072 --> 01:15:25,338
    I KICKED THAT HORSE OF MINE

1393
01:15:25,407 --> 01:15:27,073
    LIKE I NEVER KICKED HIM
        'FORE OR SINCE,

1394
01:15:27,141 --> 01:15:30,010
        AND HE KNEW
    WHAT IT WAS I WANTED.

1395
01:15:30,078 --> 01:15:32,245
    ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS
    GET ACROSS THE LOG BRIDGE,

1396
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:35,315
    THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD, AND
    PAST THE HESSIAN'S GRAVE.

1397
01:15:37,385 --> 01:15:40,387
    BUT AS WE COME TO THE EDGE
        OF THE STREAM,

1398
01:15:40,455 --> 01:15:43,173
    I FELT A BLACKNESS

1399
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:45,025
    COVER ME AND DAREDEVIL.

1400
01:15:45,094 --> 01:15:48,879
IT WAS SO THICK, I COULDN'T
SEE MY HAND IN FRONT OF MY FACE,

1401
01:15:48,947 --> 01:15:51,031
    AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
        THERE HE WAS...

1402
01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:53,867
        IN FRONT OF ME,
        ACROSS THE STREAM.

1403
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:56,970
    HE PASSED RIGHT<i> THROUGH</i> ME!

1404
01:15:57,038 --> 01:15:59,272
        I KNEW THEN
        IT WAS ALL OVER.

1405
01:15:59,341 --> 01:16:01,241
    HE COULD DO WITH ME
    WHAT HE WANTED.

1406
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:05,161
        I CLOSED MY EYES
    AND WAITED FOR THE BLOW...

1407
01:16:06,882 --> 01:16:07,997
                AND?

1408
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,720
                AND?

1409
01:16:13,788 --> 01:16:15,505
        NEVER COME.

1410
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:20,460
    I OPENED ONE EYE TO SEE
    WHAT WAS TAKING HIM SO LONG.

1411
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:24,280
    HE'D SHEATHED HIS SWORD,

1412
01:16:24,349 --> 01:16:25,632
    AND IF HE HAD A HEAD,

1413
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:27,050
    I HAD A FEELING
    IT'D BE SMILING.

1414
01:16:30,055 --> 01:16:31,371
    HE TURNED HIS HORSE AROUND

1415
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:33,473
    AND TROTTED BACK
    INTO THE CHURCHYARD

1416
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:38,478
     AND DOWN, AS THOUGH
     INTO A RAVINE...

1417
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:41,248
    UNTIL NOTHING
    OF HIM REMAINED.

1418
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:48,455
        BUT I AM JUST
    AN IGNORANT BLACKSMITH

1419
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:52,542
    WITHOUT ANY OF THE EDUCATION
        MR. CRANE BOASTS OF.

1420
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,927
    I DOUBT IF I'VE GIVEN HIM

1421
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:56,629
        ANY REASON TO FEAR
THE SLEEPY HOLLOW ROAD AT NIGHT.

1422
01:16:56,698 --> 01:16:57,714
    HAVE I, MR. CRANE?

1423
01:16:59,284 --> 01:17:01,384
        INDEED, THOUGH THE TALE
        YOU TELL IS TERRIFYING,

1424
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:02,669
        TO BE SURE,
        MR. VAN BRUNT...

1425
01:17:02,737 --> 01:17:05,672
        I'M CONFIDENT
        AND PREPARED

1426
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:07,674
        FOR ANY SUCH ENCOUNTER.

1427
01:17:29,064 --> 01:17:30,213
YOU STILL HERE, ICHABOD?

1428
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:35,551
        OHH. OH...

1429
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:39,139
        I'LL BE ON MY WAY
        MOMENTARILY, BALTUS.

1430
01:17:39,207 --> 01:17:42,409
         I'M JUST HOPING TO HAVE
         A MOMENT IN PRIVATE

1431
01:17:42,477 --> 01:17:44,427
        WITH MISS KATRINA.

1432
01:17:44,496 --> 01:17:47,364
AH, WELL, THEN,
GOOD NIGHT, ICHABOD

1433
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:50,099
AND, UH...GOOD-BYE.

1434
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:05,949
                HERE YOU ARE,
                KATRINA.

1435
01:18:06,017 --> 01:18:07,333
    ICHABOD.

1436
01:18:07,402 --> 01:18:10,270
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN ON YOUR WAY BY NOW.

1437
01:18:10,339 --> 01:18:13,189
        THERE'S, UM...

1438
01:18:13,258 --> 01:18:15,424
        THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE
        BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU

1439
01:18:15,493 --> 01:18:17,677
        ALL EVENING LONG
        AND, WELL...

1440
01:18:17,746 --> 01:18:20,513
        AND I THINK
        THE MOMENT...

1441
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:23,249
        HAS COME.

1442
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:35,228
        MY DEAR KATRINA,

1443
01:18:35,296 --> 01:18:40,784
        I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
        WHAT I WISH TO SAY.

1444
01:18:41,937 --> 01:18:45,722
        I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
        WHAT IS IN MY HEART.

1445
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:48,207
I BELIEVE I DO, YES.

1446
01:18:48,293 --> 01:18:49,709
        MY DARLING...

1447
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:54,898
        I AM PREPARED TO GIVE UP
        MY LIFELONG STUDY

1448
01:18:54,966 --> 01:18:57,133
        OF THE MYSTERIES
        OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD

1449
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:58,752
        ALL FOR YOU.

1450
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:03,789

        I ASK FOR NOTHING...

1451
01:19:03,858 --> 01:19:05,725
        BUT YOUR DEAR HAND
        IN MARRIAGE

1452
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:12,415
        THAT I MAY BE YOUR
        HUSBAND AND PROTECTOR,

1453
01:19:12,484 --> 01:19:14,150
        YOUR HELP MATE
        AND MENTOR,

1454
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:19,772
        YOUR GUIDE AND TEACHER--

1455
01:19:19,841 --> 01:19:21,207
YOU CARE NOTHING FOR ME.

1456
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:23,977
I DOUBT IF YOU CARE
FOR ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.

1457
01:19:26,882 --> 01:19:29,449
            WHAT DID YOU SAY,
            MY DEAR KATRINA?

1458
01:19:29,517 --> 01:19:32,752
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS
MY FATHER'S PROPERTY AND WEALTH.

1459
01:19:32,821 --> 01:19:34,537
            WHAT?

1460
01:19:34,606 --> 01:19:37,240
        WHO PUT SUCH THOUGHTS
        INTO YOUR HEAD?

1461
01:19:37,308 --> 01:19:38,491
        UH--UH--UH...

1462
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:42,696
        IS IT BROM THAT POISONED
        YOUR MIND AGAINST ME?

1463
01:19:42,764 --> 01:19:44,430
BROM MAY HAVE NO EDUCATION,

1464
01:19:44,499 --> 01:19:46,248
BUT HE<i> DOES</i> LOVES ME.

1465
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:49,235
IT'S ME HE WANTED.

1466
01:19:49,304 --> 01:19:50,519

1467
01:19:50,588 --> 01:19:52,472
        BUT, KATRINA, YOU...

1468
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,823
        YOU ACCUSE ME UNJUSTLY.

1469

        I SWEAR

01:19:57,445 --> 01:19:58,961
CAREFUL, MR. CRANE.

1472
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,097
TO SWEAR FALSELY
BY ALL THAT'S HOLY

1473
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,481
