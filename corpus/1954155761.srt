00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:21,873
Beverly Weston: ...“Life is very long...”

2
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:23,228
TS Eliot.

3
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,219
Not the first person to say it,

4
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:29,183
certainly not the first person to think it.

5
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:32,881
But he’s given credit for it because
he bothered to write it down.

6
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:40,154
Now, if you say it,
you have to say his name after it.

7
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:44,199
“Life is very long:” TS Eliot.

8
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:47,433
Absolutely, goddamn right.

9
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,032
Violet.

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,783
My wife.

11
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,048
She takes pills,

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,578
sometimes a great many.

13
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:05,816
The facts are:

14
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,301
my wife takes pills and I drink.

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,500
That’s the bargain we’ve struck, a
little paragraph of our marriage contract...

16
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,706
Rather than..

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,526
once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed.

18
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:24,457
I’ve chosen to turn my life over
to a Higher Power..

19
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,494
and join the ranks of the Hiring Class.

20
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:34,850
It’s not a decision with
which I’m entirely comfortable.

21
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:37,949
I mean, I know how to launder my..

22
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,756
...dirty undies. Done it all my life,

23
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,423
but I’m finding that
it’s getting in the way of my drinking.

24
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:50,513
Violet: Bev?

25
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,741
Yes.

26
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,179
Did...

27
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,888
..you..?

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,990
Oh, goddamn it!

29
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:05,959
Are the police here?
- Could you come here?

30
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,393
Oh. Hello.

31
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,467
Johnna, the young woman
I told you about.

32
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,360
You tell me she’s a woman.

33
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:25,981
Wo-man. Wo-man.

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,180
Whoa-man.

35
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,472
That I’m hiring --
- Oh,

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,012
you hire women’s now the thing.

37
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,691
I thought you meant the other.

38
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:36,789
To cook and clean,
carry you to the clinic..

39
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,518
Hello.
- Hello.

40
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:43,634
I’m sorry.

41
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:46,165
Like this.

42
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,364
Yes, ma’am.

43
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:52,878
You’re very pretty.

44
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,077
Thank you.

45
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,256
Are you an Injun?

46
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,829
Yes, ma’am.

47
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:03,202
What kind?
- Cheyenne.

48
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,655
Do you think I’m pretty?

49
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:10,854
Like this?

50
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,103
Like..
- Careful...Careful...!

51
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,917
I’m sorry,
I took some...

52
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,338
medicine for my mumm...

53
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,754
for my mus...

54
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,634
My muscular.

55
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,970
..for my muscular.

56
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:41,301
Why don’t you go back to bed,
sweetheart?

57
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:45,205
Why don’t you go fuck
a fucking sow’s ass?

58
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,253
All right.

59
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:52,859
Oh..

60
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,230
I’m sorry.

61
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,930
I’ll be sickly sweet.

62
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:08,246
sickly sweet.

63
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:12,508
I’m soooooooo sweet.

64
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,623
I’m soo..

65
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,908
In-el-a...

66
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,702
In-el-abrially sweet.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,603
We keep unusual hours here.

68
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,214
My wife has been diagnosed with a touch of..

69
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:40,793
cancer and she’ll need to be driven
to Tulsa for her final..

70
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,643
chemotherapy treatments.

71
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,813
What kind of cancer?

72
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,818
Ah, My God, I nearly neglected
the punch line:

73
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,359
mouth cancer.

74
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:52,522
Do you have any questions?

75
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,108
What pills does she take?
- Ohhh..

76
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:59,135
Valium. Vicodin.

77
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:03,591
Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan,
Percocet..

78
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,194
Xanax for fun.

79
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:08,023
OxyContin in a pinch.

80
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:13,507
And of course, Diluadid.
I can’t forget Diluadid.

81
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,869
My last refuge, my books..

82
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,973
simple pleasures,

83
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,571
like finding..

84
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:31,015
wild onions by the side of a road,
or requited love.

85
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,490
Oh here..

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,785
Here, TS Eliot.

87
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,179
Read it or not.
It's not a job requirement

88
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:45,473
just for your enjoyment.

89
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,017
Here we go, round the prickly pear...

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,797
Prickly pear prickly pear...

91
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,427
ere we go, round the prickly pear...

92
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,211
August: Osage County

00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,820
Mom...?

95
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,503
Mom..

96
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,669
Mom...!

97
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:37,894
You didn’t hear the phone?

98
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,985
If it’s your father,
tell him to fuck off.

99
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,740
It’s Aunt Ivy,

100
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,516
from Oklahoma.

101
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:55,821
...Ivy?

102
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,776
..what’s wrong?

103
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:03,796
..When...?

104
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,515
What’d you tell Barb?

105
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,459
I told her Dad was missing.

106
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:35,973
Goddamn your father,
for putting me through this.

107
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:37,442
Seen that office of his?

108
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:42,916
He hired this Indian for some goddamn
reason and now I have a stranger in my house.

109
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,127
What’s her name?

110
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,326
Johnna.

111
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,484
I can’t handle this all by myself!

112
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,142
I called Karen.

113
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,537
Oh..

114
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:58,924
Yeah, What did she say?
- She said she’d try to get here.

115
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,210
She’ll be a big fat help,

116
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,324
just like you.

117
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,929
I need Barb.

118
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,370
What’s Barb going to be able to do?

119
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:17,656
What did you do to your hair?

120
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:21,102
I had it straightened.
- Why would anybody do that?

121
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:22,853
I just wanted a change.

122
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:24,451
You’re a pretty girl.

123
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,789
Why don’t you wear makeup?

124
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:27,988
Do I need makeup?

125
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,746
Every women needs makeup.

126
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,022
Don’t let anybody tell you different.
The only woman..

127
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:37,361
pretty enough to go without makeup
was Elizabeth Taylor.

128
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,931
and she wore a ton.

129
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,829
Your shoulders are slumped
and your hair’s all straighten out..

130
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,766
..and you don’t wear makeup.
You look like a lesbian.

131
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:45,965
Mom.

132
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,515
You could get a decent man
if you spruced up.A bit,

133
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,697
that’s all I’m saying.

134
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:53,398
I’m not looking for a man.

135
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:05,017
How many was that?

136
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,559
I wasn’t counting.

137
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,904
Is your mouth burning?

138
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:21,380
Like a son-of-a-bitch.
My tongue is on fire.

139
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,149
Are you supposed to be smoking?

140
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,270
Is anybody supposed to smoke?

141
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,347
Are you scared?

142
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,181
Course I’m scared.

143
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,342
And you are a comfort, sweetheart.

144
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,482
Thank God one of my girls stayed
close to home.

145
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,742
In my day..

146
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,624
family stayed together.

147
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:12,144
Aunt Mattie Fae’s here.
- She means to come in here..

148
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:13,973
..and tell me what’s what.

149
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,620
I don’t know how Uncle Charlie
puts up with it.

150
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:18,429
He smokes a lot of grass.

151
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:20,682
He does?

152
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:25,974
He smokes a lot of grass.

153
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,710
I told Vi, “Take all those goddamn books
 he’s so fond of..

154
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,550
..and make a big pile in the front yard
and have yourself a bonfire.”

155
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,739
You don’t burn a man’s books.

156
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,911
You do, if the situation calls for it.

157
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,711
The man’s books didn’t do anything.

158
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:46,535
You get any ideas about just up and taking off,
Charlie Aiken, you better believe..

159
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,734
..that i'd have your..
- I’m not going anywhere.

160
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,949
I’m saying if you did,

161
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:54,524
I’ll give you two days to get your head straight.
Then it’s all going up in a blaze of glory.

162
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,031
Not that, you have any books lying around.

163
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,207
I don’t think I’ve ever seen you
read a book in my life.

164
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:02,048
That bother you?

165
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,206
What’s the last book you read?

166
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:05,595
Beverly was a teacher;

167
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,988
teachers read books,
I’m in the upholstery business.

168
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,187
Ah, sweeheart.

169
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:13,011
Your daddy’s done this before.

170
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,659
Just takes off, no call, nothing.

171
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,268
I told your mother,

172
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:21,918
“You pack that son-of-a-bitch’s bags and have
‘em waiting for him on the front porch.”

173
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:23,651
Where’s your mother?

174
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,153
Upstairs.

175
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,798
He’ll come back again,
I know he will,

176
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,393
he always does.

177
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,501
Beverly is a very complicated man.

178
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,695
Kind of like Charles.

179
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:46,264
Little Charles isn’t complicated,
he’s just unemployed.

180
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:49,460
You don’t think that Little Charles and

181
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,695
Beverly share some kind of...

182
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,364
..complication.

183
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,405
You have to be smart to be complicated.

184
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,674
Are you saying our boy isn’t smart?

185
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,983
Yes, that’s what I’m saying.

186
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,936
I’m sweating.

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,278
Why is it so dark in here?

188
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:10,304
Are you sweating?

189
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,281
Hell, yes, I’m sweating,

190
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:15,063
it’s ninety degrees in here.

191
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,692
Feel my back.

192
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:21,891
I don’t want to feel your back.

193
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,081
Sweat is just dripping down my back.
- I believe you.

194
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,280
Feel it.
- No.

195
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:28,162
Come on, put your hand here.
- Goddamn it --

196
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:31,749
Sweat’s just dripping...

197
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,122
Ivy, when did this start?

198
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,389
This business with taping the shades?

199
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,059
Been a couple of years now.

200
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,808
Do you know its purpose?

201
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,256
You can’t tell if it’s night or day.

202
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,149
I think that’s the purpose.

203
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,824
What were these people thinking...

204
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,054
The jokers who settled this place.

205
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:09,449
Who was the asshole, looked at flat hot
nothing and planted his flag?

206
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,328
I mean..

207
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,710
we fucked the Indians for this?
- Well, genocide,

208
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,489
always seems like such a good idea
at the time.

209
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,001
Right, you need a little hindsight.

210
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,000
If you want me to explain the creepy
character of the Midwest,

211
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,094
Please, the Midwest.

212
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,850
This is the Plains.

213
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:31,302
A state of mind,
A spiritual affliction, like the Blues.

214
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,883
Don’t.

215
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,221
What are you doing?

216
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,292
‘Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you
for another beer?

217
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,373
Goddam it, she’s not a waitress.

218
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,627
I'll get it.

219
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:09,753
I know that.

220
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,273
Then, get your own beer.

221
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,548
I don’t believe you.

222
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,115
Watchin’ a ball game, drinkin’ beers.

223
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,640
You have any sense of
what’s going on around you?

224
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,953
Am I supposed to sit here like a statue?

225
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,525
You’re drinking whiskey.

226
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,615
I’m having a cocktail.

227
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:32,657
You’re drinking straight whiskey!

228
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:33,856
Just...

229
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,578
Have a little class.

230
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:46,867
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

231
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,199
You’ve encouraged that.

232
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:56,127
I haven’t encouraged anything.
- You admire her for getting hooked at fourteen,

233
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:58,715
makes her seem even more mature.

234
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,193
Goddamn, it’s hot.

235
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,714
Suppose your mom’s turned on
the air conditioner?

236
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,216
You kidding?
Remember the parakeets?

237
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,586
The parakeets?

238
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,010
I didn’t tell you about the parakeets?

239
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,422
She got a parakeet, for some insane reason
 and the little fucker croaked after two days.

240
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,815
So, she went to the pet store
and raised hell,

241
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,393
and they gave her another one.
That one died after a day.

242
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,070
Then, she went back and they gave her
a third parakeet. That one died too.

243
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:31,623
So, the chick from the pet store came out here
to see just what in the hell

244
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:35,307
this, serial parakeet killer was doing
to bump off these birds.

245
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:36,506
And?

246
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,705
The heat.

247
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,661
It was too hot.
They were dying from the heat.

248
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:41,860
Jesus.

249
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,059
These are tropical birds, all right?

250
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,629
I mean, They live in the fucking tropics!

251
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:47,828
Mom?!

252
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,027
It's Barbara..it's Barb.

253
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:50,226
Barbara!

254
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,659
Oh my gosh!

255
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:53,858
You.

256
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,265
Come give me some sugar.

257
00:16:56,825 --> 00:17:00,028
Bill, look how skinny you are!

258
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,729
Will you look at this one?

259
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:06,037
Come here and give your Aunt Mattie
Fae some sugar!

260
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:07,236
Hi, Charlie.
- Hey Bill,

261
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:10,570
you've dropped some weight, haven't you?

262
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,418
Look at her boobs! - Last time i saw..
- How was the flight from Denver?

263
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,617
you looked like a little boy!

264
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:17,816
Barbara?

265
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:21,653
Hey, Mom. I’m here!

266
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:25,562
Barb...Barb..Barb..
- It’s okay, Mom.I’m here.

267
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,536
Saturday morning.

268
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,887
The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy.
We ate some,

269
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,110
he walked out the door,
this door right there.

270
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,575
That was it.

271
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,503
He just left...?

272
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:45,861
uh, huh.

273
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,678
I went to bed Saturday night,

274
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:53,175
got up Sunday mornin'

275
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:55,413
... still no Beverly.

276
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,020
I didn’t make much of it,

277
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:00,808
thought he’d gone out on a bender.

278
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:03,915
Why would he do that?
When, he can drink at home.

279
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,509
Unless, you were riding his ass.
- I never said a word to him..

280
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,407
about his drinking, I didn't.
I never got on him about it.

281
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,606
So, Sunday,

282
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:16,314
still no sign of him...
- That’s when I got worked up about that,

283
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,991
safety deposit box. Because..

284
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,660
We kept an awful lot of cash in that box,
some expensive jewelry.

285
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:25,859
I had a..

286
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:30,520
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars.

287
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,970
Wait, wait, wait,
I’m missing something.

288
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,068
Why do you care about a safety
deposit box?

289
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,136
Your father and I had an arrangement.

290
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:41,552
If something were to ever happen to one of us,
the other one would go empty that box.

291
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:45,928
Vi, you sure there wasn’t some incident
that triggered his leaving, some event.

292
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:47,736
like a fight?
- Yeah. - No.

293
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:52,337
And we fought enough...
you know... but no.

294
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,728
Maybe he needed some time away from you.

295
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,458
Oh, That’s nice of you to say.

296
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,274
Hey, it's no crime.

297
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:02,993
Marriage is hard.

298
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,554
Under the best of circumstances.

299
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,216
So..

300
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:13,563
Nothing? No, 'see you later,
I'm taking a walk'?

301
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,531
Mmmmhm.

302
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:18,698
Good old unfathomable Dad.

303
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:23,174
Oh. That man. Oh..

304
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,371
What I first fell in love with,
you know, was his mystery.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,848
I thought it was sexy as hell.

306
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:36,852
You knew he was the smartest one in the room,
knew if he just said something...

307
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,344
knock you out.
But No, he’d just stand there,

308
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,005
little smile on his face...

309
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:47,743
not say a word.

310
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:53,575
Sexy.

311
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:57,814
You can’t remember anything unusual --

312
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,511
He hired this woman.

313
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:07,235
He didn’t ask me, just hired this woman
to come live in our house. Few days before he left.

314
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:08,690
You don’t want her here?

315
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,302
I have an Indian in my house.

316
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,100
You have a problem with Indians, Violet?

317
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,688
I don’t know what to say to an Indian.
- They’re called Native Americans, Mom.

318
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:19,639
Who makes that decision?
- It’s what they like to be called.

319
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,821
They aren’t any more native than me.
- In fact,

320
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,153
..they are.
- What’s wrong with Indian?

321
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:26,687
Why can't you call people
what they wanna be called?

322
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:30,058
Let’s just call the dinosaurs “Native Americans”
while we’re at it.

323
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:35,727
She may be an Indian, but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

324
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,595
He hired a cook.
It makes no sense. We don’t eat.

325
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:43,331
And now you get biscuits and gravy.
Kind of nice, huh?

326
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,682
That is nice.

327
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:46,155
Nice for you, now.

328
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,132
But, soon you’ll be gone,

329
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,491
never to return.

330
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,355
When was the last time you were here?

331
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:53,757
Don’t get started..
- Alright!

332
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:54,956
I don’t care about you two.

333
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:58,045
But, I’d like to see my granddaughter
every now and again.

334
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,244
Well, you’re seeing her now.

335
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,937
But your father.
You broke his heart when you moved away.

336
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,764
That is wildly unfair! -You know you were Beverly’s favorite;
- Am I going to have to separate you two?

337
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,406
 ..don’t pretend you don’t know!

338
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:12,550
I’d prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally.

339
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:21,299
I’m sure you’d prefer to think that Santy Claus
brought you presents at Christmas, too.

340
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,536
If you’d had more than one child, you’d know

341
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:26,265
a parent always has favorites.

342
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,911
Mattie Fae was my mother’s favorite. Big deal.
I got used to it.

343
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,498
You were your Daddy’s favorite.

344
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:36,037
Broke his heart.

345
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,134
What was I supposed to do?!

346
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,765
Colorado gave Bill twice what he's making at TU.
- Why are we even getting into this?

347
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,206
You think Daddy wouldn’t have jumped
at an opportunity like that?

348
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:48,818
You’re wrong there. You never would’ve gotten
Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.

349
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,017
He gave me his blessing.

350
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,371
That's what he told you. Yeah..

351
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:56,708
And now, you’re going to tell me the true story,
some terrible shit he said behind my back?

352
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:57,907
Alright, everybody’s on edge..

353
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:01,634
Beverly didn’t say terrible things behind your back
- Vi, come on!

354
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,494
He just told me he’s disappointed in you
because you settled.

355
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,739
He thought you had talent,

356
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,189
..as a writer.

357
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,613
Daddy never said anything like that to you.

358
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,605
What a load of absolute horseshit.

359
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:16,894
horseshit.

360
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:22,121
Horseshit? Oh, horseshit,
let’s all say horseshit.

361
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:25,022
Say horseshit, Bill.

362
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,041
Horseshit.

363
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,955
Are you high?
- Excuse me.

364
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:41,155
I mean literally.
You taking something?

365
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,284
A muscle relaxer.
- You listen to me. I'll not go through this with you again.

366
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:48,484
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

367
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:53,993
These fucking pills? Calls at three AM
about stars in your backyard?

368
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,462
This isn't..it isn't same thing.

369
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,801
I didn’t have reason then.

370
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,735
So, it’s okay to get hooked now
because you have a reason.

371
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:03,935
I’m not hooked on anything.

372
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,209
I don’t want to know if you are or not,

373
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,095
I’m just saying.. I'm not gonna
go through it again.

374
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:11,856
I’m not. I’m in pain!

375
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:14,462
Because of your mouth?

376
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:18,310
Yes, because my mouth burns.

377
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:19,509
I have got..

378
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,268
Cancer in my mouth.

379
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:23,697
And it burns, look.

380
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,896
Look.

381
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:28,094
And it burns like a... bullshit.

382
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:37,013
And Beverly’s disappeared and
you’re yelling at me.

383
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:38,212
I’m not..

384
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:47,629
You know, you couldn’t come home
when I got cancer.

385
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:52,910
Beverlys disappeared..

386
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,690
you rushed right back.

387
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:07,452
I’m sorry.

388
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:17,590
I’m sorry...

389
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,147
You know where I think he is?

390
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:25,821
I think he..

391
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,369
I think he got some whiskey,
a carton of cigarettes, and

392
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,427
a couple of good spy novels...and..

393
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:35,806
I think he got out on the boat.

394
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,494
and steered it to a nice spot,
close to shore like he likes em.

395
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,681
and he’s fishing, and reading
and drinking,

396
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,169
maybe even writing a little.

397
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:51,766
And, I think..

398
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:53,915
he’s gonna walk through that door..

399
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:59,077
...any time.

400
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:06,074
Mom?

401
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:09,113
Mom, the sheriff's here.

402
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:10,312
What? Wha...

403
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:20,186
Hey, sweetheart.
Go back to bed.

404
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,094
What about Aunt Ivy?

405
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,522
I guess we’ll stop on the way.

406
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:05,982
Christ, I have to call Karen too.

407
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:08,849
Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

408
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,573
Izza story.

409
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:30,892
Barely’s back.

410
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,560
Gizza cig...

411
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:39,146
cigezze?  Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
- Ma’am?

412
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,169
Gizza cig...

413
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,667
Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
some cigezze?

414
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:46,952
Cigz, cig-aa..

415
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:56,346
archa-tex?

416
00:27:58,352 --> 00:28:00,629
I’m Inna bottom of them.

417
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:13,562
It's good beat, right?

418
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:18,934
Barb..!

419
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,107
From the day I..

420
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,919
..the day..

421
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:38,408
Beverly..

422
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,991
and then..

423
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,963
and then you’re here..

424
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:52,199
And Barbara, you’re here, and Beverly,
and then you’re here, and then..

425
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,617
..you’re here..

426
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,543
I used to go out with that boy.

427
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:10,929
That man.
- What man? The Sheriff?

428
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,847
In high school. He was my prom date.

429
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:18,710
You’re kidding.

430
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,077
Day of the prom, his father got drunk
and stole his car,

431
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:23,898
stole his own son’s car,

432
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,261
went somewhere, Mexico.

433
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,069
Deon showed up at the house.
He’d been crying.

434
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:35,588
Confessed he didn’t have a way
to take me to the prom.

435
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,042
So, we got a six-pack..

436
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:42,107
..and broke into the chapel, stayed up
all night talking and kissing.

437
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,715
And, now here he is,

438
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,327
..showing me.

439
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:51,966
It’s so surreal.

440
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,733
Thank God we can’t tell the future.
We’d never get out of bed.

441
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:14,589
Listen to me.

442
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,640
Die after me, all right?

443
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,098
I don’t care what else you do,

444
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:29,149
where you go, how
you screw up your life, just...

445
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:35,131
Survive.

446
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:44,823
please.

447
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,976
Holy shit, that’s Karen.

448
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,970
Do you remember your Aunt Karen?
- Kind of...

449
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,476
That must be this year’s man.

450
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,164
I spent so much time in our bedroom,

451
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,496
pretending my pillow
was my husband..

452
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,773
..and did he like the dinner I just made
and where were we going that winter on vacation..

453
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:17,670
..and then, he’d surprise me with tickets
to Belize and we’d kiss.

454
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,937
I mean I’d kiss my pillow!

455
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,832
and then I’d say that
I’d been to the doctor that I am..

456
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:26,031
maybe, I was pregnant.

457
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:30,352
I know how pathetic that sounds now,
but it was innocent enough.

458
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:33,794
Then real life kicks in,

459
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,293
Things don’t work out like you planned.

460
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:38,427
They never do..and then,

461
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:42,315
That pillow was a better husband
than any real man I’d ever met;

462
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,737
And you punish yourself and tell yourself
it’s your fault you can’t find a good one.

463
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,704
I don’t know how well you remember Andrew.
You remember Andrew?

464
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,904
No, I remember him.

465
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:54,562
I loved him.. so intensely,

466
00:33:54,563 --> 00:33:58,491
so, the things he did wrong, were just
opportunities for me to make 'em right.

467
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:01,543
When he'd cheat on me or called me a cunt,

468
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:04,523
I’d say, “No, love is forever,

469
00:34:04,722 --> 00:34:07,242
this is just an opportunity for me,

470
00:34:07,442 --> 00:34:10,112
..to make an adjustment in the way
that I view the world.”

471
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:13,795
And thank God, one day I looked
in the mirror and said, “Moron,”

472
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:15,742
and I walked out.

473
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,830
But, one day..
finally I said,

474
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,614
“It’s me.

475
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,768
It's just me.

476
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:25,915
I don’t need anything else,
I can live my life with myself.”

477
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:31,146
 And, that's how I got my license, I
threw myself into my work, sold a ton of houses,

478
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:32,346
..and that’s how I met Steve.

479
00:34:35,335 --> 00:34:37,523
That’s how it works, Barb.

480
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:38,722
Ah, he's ten years older,

481
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:40,879
but he is such a thinker,

482
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,078
 ..and he’s such a good man.

483
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:45,539
He’s such a good heart
and he’s good for me.

484
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:49,167
I guess, the best thing
about him, for me,

485
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:51,206
...is that now..

486
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,225
..what I think about is now.

487
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:55,254
I live now.

488
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,902
My focus, my life, my world is now.

489
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,239
And you can’t plan the future.
You just can't. Cause as soon as you do,

490
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,108
something happens, some..

491
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:08,666
terrible thing happens..
- Like your father drowning himself.

492
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,355
That’s exactly what I mean.

493
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,683
You take it as it comes,
here and now!

494
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:21,819
Steve had a huge presentation today
for some big-wig government guys who could be..

495
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:26,756
..really important for his business
and he’s put together for months now,

496
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,504
But.. as soon as we found about Daddy,

497
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,653
he just cancelled his meeting.

498
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,641
He has his priorities straight.

499
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,550
And, you know what the kicker is?

500
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,649
Do you know what the kicker is Barb?

501
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:41,763
What’s the kicker?

502
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:45,361
We’re going to Belize on our honeymoon!

503
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,818
Is it always this hot?

504
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:09,951
Usually, it’s hotter.

505
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,409
That's hard to imagine.

506
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:21,502
How old are you, about,
seventeen?

507
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,785
Fourteen.

508
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:25,984
Fourteen, right...

509
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,738
You know what I was doing
when I was fourteen?

510
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,197
Cattle processing.

511
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:38,265
Know what that is?
- It doesn’t sound good.

512
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:40,424
Slaughterhouse sanitation.

513
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:41,623
That’s disgusting.

514
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,542
I wouldn’t recommend it.

515
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:47,460
But hey. Put food on the table.

516
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:51,202
Get it?

517
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:57,434
What’s that smell?

518
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:58,993
I don't know?

519
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,842
It's probably, that stop thrash can
over there?

520
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,231
Nah, that’s not what I’m smelling.

521
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,198
What are you doing?

522
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:11,420
Do I smell what I think I smell?
- I don't know,

523
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
What do you smell?
- Is that... pot?

524
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:14,750
You smoking pot?

525
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:16,712
No.
- You can tell me.

526
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:20,121
You a little dope smoker?
- No!

527
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,280
Then you are in luck.

528
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,428
Because, I happen to have some
really tasty shit.

529
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,296
Here we go!

530
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,681
No Pinots, but they had some decent
California Merlots.

531
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:40,763
Ahh! Look at me! Look at me.
- You’re beautiful, Mom.

532
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,599
I was beautiful.

533
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,568
Hah..

534
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:47,055
Not anymore.
- Oh, now --

535
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:48,255
You’re still beautiful.

536
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:51,504
One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.

537
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:55,951
Women are beautiful,
when they’re young and not after.

538
00:37:56,621 --> 00:38:00,129
Men can still preserve their sex appeal
into old age.

539
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,577
Not those men like you see with shorts,

540
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:06,765
and little purses around their waists.
- Lord..lord.

541
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:13,991
Some men can maintain a weary masculinity.
Women just get old..

542
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:16,449
..and fat and wrinkly.

543
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,237
I beg your pardon?
I'm still very sexy.

544
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:22,962
Thank you very much.
- Yeah, you’re about as sexy

545
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:25,244
as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae.

546
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:27,921
you and me both.

547
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:33,824
Look, wouldn’t we be better off all of us,
if we stopped lying about these things,

548
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:35,671
..and told the truth?

549
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,069
“Women aren’t sexy when they’re old.”

550
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:40,968
I can live with that.
Can you live with that?

551
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,445
What about Sophia Loren?

552
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:47,887
What about Lena Horne?
She stayed sexy till she was eighty.

553
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,086
The world is round.

554
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,080
Get over it.

555
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,648
Hey, try this dress on.

556
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,307
I’m sorry, I won’t.

557
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,638
You don’t know how to attract a man.
I do.

558
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:00,837
That’s something I always..

559
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:03,641
We just buried my father,
I’m not trying to attract a man.

560
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,840
I’m not talking about today, dummy,
I'm just saying..

561
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,225
this is something..
- I have a man. All right?

562
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,424
I have a man.

563
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:11,314
You said, you weren’t looking for a man.

564
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,887
And I’m not.
Because I have one.

565
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:17,545
Now will you leave it alone?
- No, I won’t leave it alone. - No, let’s not leave it alone.

566
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,294
I wish you both could see,

567
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:21,870
..the brainsick looks on your faces.

568
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,070
Who is it?
- Nobody. Forget it..

569
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:27,118
Tell us, is he someone from school?
How old is he, what’s he do?

570
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:28,318
I’m not telling you anything..

571
00:39:28,738 --> 00:39:30,840
You have to tell us something!
- No, I really don’t.

572
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:35,615
Are you in love, Ivy?
- I...I don’t...I’m...

573
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:58,999
No, we maintain the accounts offshore,
just until we get approvals.

574
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,067
- What..to get around approvals?

575
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:04,096
To get around approvals
until we get approvals.

576
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,090
There’s a lot of bureaucracy, red tape..
I don’t know how much you know about Florida,

577
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,289
 Florida politics.

578
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:13,103
Only what I read and that’s..
- Right, right, this kind of business in particular.

579
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,621
...Charlie?
- Picking up Little Charles.

580
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:25,706
Give. Me. The wine.

581
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,758
Is that what you were in such a
hurry to get home for?

582
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:44,026
What the hell’s on TV
that’s so important you?

583
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,830
Phantom of the Opera, 1925.

584
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:48,933
They’re showing it with the scene
in color restored.

585
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:51,032
Cool.

586
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:54,510
Let me make sure I’ve got this.
when you threw a fit..

587
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,748
about going to the store with your dad...
Hey, look at me.

588
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:03,973
And you were so distraught over the
start time of your Grandpa’s funeral.

589
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:05,173
Was this your concern? Huh?

590
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:08,880
Getting back here in time to watch
Phantom of the Fucking Opera?

591
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:12,181
I guess.

592
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,452
Christ.

593
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,314
Phantom of the Opera, huh?

594
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:24,842
Huh-uh.
- Hi, doodle.

595
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,779
Doodle.

596
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:34,217
Hey, baby.

597
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,494
I want to show you our old fort.

598
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,261
Man, the air in here
just doesn’t move.

599
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,360
I'll hook you up, later.

600
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,478
I’m sorry, Dad.

601
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:11,456
No need to apologize.
- I know, Mom’s mad at me.

602
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,675
Don’t worry about her.
- What did she say?

603
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:17,397
Your mother,
she says what she says.

604
00:42:17,597 --> 00:42:18,596
I set the alarm. I did.

605
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:21,950
I know you did.
- I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.

606
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,839
Just stop, apologizing.

607
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,488
I missed his funeral!

608
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:28,826
Ah, its..

609
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:31,615
It’s a ceremony.

610
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:33,663
It’s ceremonial.

611
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:36,582
It doesn’t mean anything compared to..

612
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:38,401
what you have in your heart.

613
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,390
Hold on,

614
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,089
comb your hair.

615
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:50,574
Uncle Bev, must be disappointed in me.

616
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:56,920
Your Uncle Bev has got
bigger and better things ahead of him.

617
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,459
He doesn’t have time for spite.

618
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:01,548
He wasn’t that kind of man, anyway.

619
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:12,811
Hey,

620
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,138
hey..It’s okay.

621
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,450
Just...

622
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:31,521
I know how things are.
I know how  they..

623
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,869
..think about me;

624
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:36,658
and something like this...
you want to be there for people,

625
00:43:37,427 --> 00:43:40,246
I’m sorry I let you down, Dad.
- Hey, You haven’t let me down.

626
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:43,864
You never let me down.

627
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:45,712
Now listen...

628
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:49,550
you’re wrong about these people, they love you.

629
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,779
They love you.

630
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:53,568
Some of them,

631
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,056
haven’t gotten a chance to see
what I see.

632
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:00,574
A fine man,

633
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,352
very loving,

634
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:06,481
..a with a lot to offer.

635
00:44:11,828 --> 00:44:12,767
Now take this

636
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:18,964
Give me my comb.

637
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,767
I love you, Dad.

638
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:36,000
Love you too, son.

639
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,200
Phantom of the Opera?

640
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,069
You don’t remember
what it was like to be fourteen?

641
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,302
She’s old enough to exhibit a little character.

642
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:50,438
But, that’s something you normally
learn from your parents.

643
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:53,081
That’s a shot across my bow, right?
I missed something.

644
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:54,393
Really? Instilling character.

645
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,342
Our burden as parents.
- I got that part.

646
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,435
And you really haven’t
been much of a parent lately,

647
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:00,634
..so it’s tough to..
- Just because you and I are..

648
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:03,831
..struggling with this Gordian knot
It doesn’t mean..

649
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:06,607
..but her fourteen-year-old
self might view it differently.

650
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:08,146
might consider it “abandonment”

651
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:11,504
Oh, come on, she’s a little more sophisticated
than that, don’t you think?

652
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,119
Pretty fucking sophisticated,

653
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,715
the restored whatever from Phantom of the Opera,
I know that makes your dick hard..

654
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,558
Barbara --
- Precocious little shit.

655
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,910
I’m not defending her.
- I am not blaming her.

656
00:45:22,627 --> 00:45:24,987
I'm on your side.
- ..selfish sonofabith!

657
00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:28,698
Be a father! Help me!
- I am her father, goddamn it!

658
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:31,968
Her father in name only!
- I have not forsook my responsibilities!

659
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:33,167
It’s “forsaken,” big shot!

660
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,548
Actually, “forsook” is also an
acceptable usage.

661
00:45:35,748 --> 00:45:37,519
Oh, “forsook” you and the horse
you rode in on.

662
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,387
You don’t fight fair.

663
00:45:40,877 --> 00:45:42,346
I’ve seen where that gets me!

664
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:46,879
GROW UP! while you’re dyeing your hair
and going through your fifth puberty,

665
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,226
the world is falling apart
and your kid can’t handle it!

666
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:52,407
Our kid is just trying to deal with this
goddamn madhouse you’ve dragged her into.

667
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:53,606
This madhouse is my home.

668
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:55,933
Think about that statement
for a second, why don’t you?

669
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:57,132
Jean is here with me because..

670
00:45:57,332 --> 00:45:59,718
..this is a family event.
- Jean’s here with you because she’s a buffer..

671
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:02,560
between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother.

672
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,802
Y’know, you’d have a lot more credibility
if you had any credibility.

673
00:46:05,002 --> 00:46:06,002
You’re a easy mark.
- You’re so goddamn self-righteous,

674
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:08,428
..you know that? You’re so..
- Surely you must’ve realised..

675
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:12,010
when you started porking Pippi Longstocking
you were due for a little self-righteousness,

676
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,904
..just a smidge of indignation on my part.
- Maybe, I split because of it!

677
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:18,866
Is this your confession, then,

678
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:20,435
when you finally, unload all? Hmm?

679
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:24,342
You’re thoughtful, Barbara,
but you’re not open.

680
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:26,691
You’re passionate, but you’re hard.

681
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,829
You’re a good, decent, funny,
wonderful woman, and I love you, but..

682
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,728
You’re a pain in the ass!

683
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:16,327
One for me.

684
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:19,581
One for the girls.

685
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:40,989
Mom’s casserole.

686
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:42,988
They said you overslept.

687
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,365
Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept.
I don’t know.

688
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,606
I’m so sorry.
- Please.

689
00:47:51,223 --> 00:47:52,193
I know you had one of the worst
days of your life and..

690
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:57,310
I’m sorry that I wasn't there.
- We don’t have to do that with each other.

691
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:01,347
You’re breaking our rule.

692
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:06,784
They’re on to me.
Not us, just me.

693
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,543
I told them I was seeing someone.

694
00:48:10,522 --> 00:48:11,941
I didn’t tell them who.
I just wanted you to know,

695
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:14,537
in case it came up.

696
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:18,925
What?

697
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,697
Charles...

698
00:48:24,897 --> 00:48:25,943
I adore you.

699
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,899
Pass the casserole, please?

700
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:35,098
My casserole’s coming.

701
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:36,997
I’ll eat some of yours, too.

702
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:38,486
Mom?! Let’s eat!

703
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,505
Oh, There he is.

704
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,010
I wanted to put you at a kid’s table
but they wouldn’t let me.

705
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:46,502
Where do you want me to put this?

706
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:50,240
Hi, Little Charles.
I want you to meet my fiance Steve.

707
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,352
Goddamn it --! O-pah!

708
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,915
You goddamn clumsy goofball!

709
00:48:58,455 --> 00:48:59,844
Mom, I’m so sorry.
- All right, nobody’s hurt.

710
00:49:00,514 --> 00:49:04,586
What about me? I’m hurt.
- It's not a party, until somebody spills something.

711
00:49:04,786 --> 00:49:05,786
That’s my casserole!

712
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,539
Let it go, Mattie Fae.
- I’m so sorry.

713
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:10,414
Who wants chicken?

714
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,077
Jean, you didn’t get any chicken.

715
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:14,276
I don’t eat meat.

716
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:15,475
You don’t eat meat.

717
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,043
Okay.
Mom!

718
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:24,078
Just put it on his plate for him or he’s liable
to burn the house down.

719
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,467
All right, Mattie Fae.

720
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:28,528
Barbara...

721
00:49:33,815 --> 00:49:34,964
..will you put this?

722
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:37,153
Over there.
- Yeah, sure.

723
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:42,220
MATTIE FAE: That’s so nice.
KAREN: So, sweet.

724
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:46,852
I see you gentlemen have all stripped
down to your shirt fronts.

725
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:48,357
I thought we were having a
funeral dinner,

726
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:51,895
not a cockfight.

727
00:50:11,873 --> 00:50:13,292
Someone should probably say grace.

728
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Barbara?

729
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:24,476
Uncle Charlie should say it.
He’s the..

730
00:50:25,176 --> 00:50:26,765
patriarch around here now.

731
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,623
I am?
- By default.

732
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,690
Okay.

733
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,857
Dear Lord...

734
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,375
We ask that you..

735
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:45,994
watch over this family..

736
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:48,922
in this sad time, O Lord...

737
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:51,251
that you..

738
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,989
bless this good woman and..

739
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,738
keep her in your..
in your...

740
00:50:58,727 --> 00:50:59,656
..grace.

741
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,993
I gotta to take this.

742
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:20,084
Work..it's very important.

743
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,223
...in Oklahoma. Yeah..

744
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:30,548
We ask that you watch over..

745
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:32,457
Beverly, too, as he...

746
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,265
as he...

747
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:40,193
as he makes his journey.

748
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,080
We thank thee, O Lord,
that we are able to join together,

749
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:49,738
to pay tribute to this fine man.

750
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:53,116
in his house, with his..

751
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:55,794
beautiful daughters.

752
00:51:57,543 --> 00:52:01,171
We are truly blessed in our fellowship,

753
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,880
our togetherness,
our... our..

754
00:52:07,518 --> 00:52:08,557
fellowship.

755
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:14,224
We thank thee for the food,
O Lord, that we can..

756
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:17,362
share this food...

757
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:21,210
and replenish our bodies with...

758
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,729
nutrients.

759
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:25,917
We ask that you help us..

760
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:27,616
get better.

761
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:29,195
Be better people.

762
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:35,042
We recognize now more than ever
the power, the...

763
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:37,730
joy of family.

764
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:44,121
We ask that you bless and watch
over this family. Amen.

765
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:48,067
Amen. So, sorry folks.
- Let’s eat.

766
00:52:53,591 --> 00:52:56,440
Barb, you have any use
for that sideboard?

767
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,718
That sideboard there,

768
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,867
you have any interest in that?

769
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:02,444
It's so pretty.

770
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:05,051
No. I mean, why?

771
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:08,905
I’m getting rid of a lot of this stuff and I thought
you might want that sideboard.

772
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,541
No, Mom, I...I wouldn’t have any
way to get that home to Colorado.

773
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,230
Maybe, Ivy’ll take it.

774
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,828
I have something like that, remember.
- Clearing all this out of here.

775
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:20,296
It's really pretty.
- I want to have a brand new everything.

776
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:24,499
I guess I’m just sort of...
not prepared to talk about your stuff.

777
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,139
Suit yourself.

778
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,817
The food is just spectacular.

779
00:53:36,317 --> 00:53:38,815
Johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.

780
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:42,574
It's what she’s paid for.
Y’all did know she’s getting paid, right?

781
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:45,212
Jean,

782
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,200
so..I’m curious,

783
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,417
when you say you don’t eat meat,
you mean, you don’t eat meat of any kind?

784
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:54,617
Right.

785
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:58,644
Is that for health reasons, or...?

786
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:02,062
When you eat meat,
you ingest an animal’s fear.

787
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:03,260
Ingest what?

788
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,474
It’s fur?
- Fear.

789
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,767
I thought she said --

790
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,425
How do you do that?
You can’t eat fear.

791
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,623
Sure you can. I mean..

792
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,849
What happens to you,
when you feel afraid?

793
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:20,125
Doesn’t your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions?

794
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:21,323
I don't know..
Does it?

795
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:22,521
It does.
- Yes.

796
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:23,720
Adrenaline, and, and --

797
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:27,247
Your body goes through a whole chemical process
when it experiences fear.

798
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:30,022
..and cortisol.
- Don’t you think an animal experiences fear?

799
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:31,220
You bet it does.

800
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,594
I used to work at a
cattle processing plant,

801
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:36,525
lots of fear flying around that place.

802
00:54:36,725 --> 00:54:37,723
So, when you eat an meat,

803
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:42,589
you’re ingesting all that fear
it felt when it was slaughtered to make food.

804
00:54:44,419 --> 00:54:45,877
You mean I’ve been eating fear, what,

805
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:47,524
 three times a day for..

806
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,390
..sixty years?

807
00:54:51,189 --> 00:54:53,684
This one won’t have a meal

808
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:57,600
that doesn't meat in it.
- I guess it’s the way I was raised,

809
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:03,741
but, somehow it just doesn’t seem like a legitimate meal
‘less it has some meat somewhere.

810
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,875
If I make a pasta dish of some kind,
he’ll be like,

811
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,372
 “That’s fine for an appetizer,
but where’s the meat?”

812
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,868
Isn’t that some TV commercial,

813
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:14,695
the old lady says, “Where’s the meat?”

814
00:55:15,214 --> 00:55:16,153
“Where’s the beef?”

815
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:20,624
"Where’s the meat?!” "Where’s the meat?!”

816
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:23,403
"Where’s the meat?!”
"Hey, Where’s the meat?!”

817
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:25,260
That’s pleasant.

818
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:30,631
I thought, the services were lovely.

819
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:32,805
Yes, weren’t they?
- Preacher did a fine job.

820
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:39,404
I give it a...Ehhhhh!
- Really? you thought so?

821
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,399
Great, now we get some dramatic criticism.

822
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,510
Too much talk about poetry and teaching.

823
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:46,269
He hadn’t written any poetry,

824
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:47,827
to speak of since ‘65

825
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:52,141
He never liked teaching worth a damn.
Nobody talked about the good stuff.

826
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,105
Man was a world-class alcoholic,
more’n fifty years.

827
00:55:56,994 --> 00:56:01,597
Nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner...

828
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:07,409
Drank a whole bottle of
Ron Bocoy White Rum,

829
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:08,936
don’t know why I remember that,

830
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:11,223
and got up to give this talk,

831
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:13,170
and he fouled himself!

832
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:20,952
Comes back to our table with this great..
- Yeah, I can’t imagine why no one told that story.

833
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:24,675
Well, he didn't get invited back to
anymore TU alumni dinners.

834
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:25,873
I can tell you that.

835
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:31,444
I don’t know much about poetry, but..

836
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:33,461
I thought his poems were extraordinary.

837
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:35,638
And your reading was very fine.

838
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:37,755
Thank you.

839
00:56:38,823 --> 00:56:39,912
Who are you?

840
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:44,924
This is my fiance, Steve,
you met him at the church.

841
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:46,871
Steve Heidebrecht.

842
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:49,458
Hide-the-what?
- Heidebrecht.

843
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:55,299
Hide-a-burrr...It's German.
- Well, German-Irish, really..

844
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,495
That’s peculiar, Karen,

845
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:01,161
to bring a date to your father’s funeral.

846
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,544
I know the poetry was good, but I really
wouldn’t have considered it date material.

847
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:08,514
He’s not a date, he’s my fiance.

848
00:57:08,714 --> 00:57:11,430
We’re getting married on New Years, in Miami,

849
00:57:11,755 --> 00:57:13,633
And, I would love it,
if you can make it.

850
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,239
I don’t really see that happening, do you?

851
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:18,056
Steve.

852
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,563
That right? Steve?

853
00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,430
Yes, ma’am.

854
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,046
You ever been married before?

855
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:27,383
Yes, ma’am, I have.

856
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:30,169
More then once?

857
00:57:30,498 --> 00:57:32,196
Three times, actually,
three times before this.

858
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:36,000
You should pretty much
have it down by now, then.

859
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:38,706
Right,
right..

860
00:57:41,602 --> 00:57:43,410
I had that one pegged. Didn't I?

861
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:46,935
I mean, look at him,
you can tell he’s been married.

862
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:51,829
I went outside to show Steve the old fort
and it’s torn down!

863
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:54,402
That’s been gone for years.
- I was so sad!

864
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,455
What is this now?
- Our old fort, where we used to play..

865
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,586
Cowboys and Indians.
- Daddy said rats were getting in there.

866
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:00,784
Karen! Shame on you!

867
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,508
Don’t you know not to say
Cowboys and Indians?

868
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,321
You played Cowboys and Native Americans,

869
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,498
right Barb?

870
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:15,353
What are you taking?
What pills?

871
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:18,336
Oh, Leave me alone.

872
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:21,145
Uh-oh!

873
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:23,142
What is it?

874
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,658
What is it?

875
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:29,523
What’s the matter?
- You okay, Uncle Charles.

876
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:34,166
UH-OH!
I got a big bite of fear!

877
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,098
Fear never tasted so good.

878
00:58:42,884 --> 00:58:45,969
It’s pretty good once
you get used to the taste.

879
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:47,856
I’m shakin’ in my boots!

880
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,316
I do catch her eating a cheeseburger
every now and again.

881
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:59,090
No, you don't!
- Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.

882
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,288
Mom, you are such a liar!

883
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:01,487
No stop. You are!

884
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:04,810
Y’know, if I ever called my mother a liar?

885
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:09,104
She would’ve knocked my goddamn
head off my shoulders.

886
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:19,530
You girls know there’s a will.

887
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,729
Mom...

888
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:22,896
We took care of it some time back.

889
00:59:23,984 --> 00:59:25,155
We don’t want to talk about it.

890
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:28,637
I want to talk about it.
What about what I want to talk about?

891
00:59:28,997 --> 00:59:30,075
Does that count for anything?

892
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,843
Bev made some good investments,
believe it or not,

893
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:38,024
We had money for you girls
in his will, but..

894
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:43,450
we talked it over
after some times passed

895
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:47,829
and decided to change things,
leave everything to me.

896
00:59:48,028 --> 00:59:52,006
We didn't get around to
taking care of it legally, but..

897
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:55,728
you should know he meant
to leave the money to me.

898
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:01,980
Okay.

899
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:06,209
Okay.

900
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:07,407
Okay?

901
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:11,253
Okay.
Karen, Okay?

902
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:13,614
Yeah, Okay.
- Okay.

903
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:16,726
But now some of this furniture,
some of this old shit you can just have.

904
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,024
I don’t want it, got no use for it.

905
01:00:19,813 --> 01:00:20,902
Maybe, I should have an auction.

906
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:25,765
Sure, an auction’s a fine idea.

907
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:29,689
Some things, though, like the silver,
that’s worth a pretty penny.

908
01:00:30,238 --> 01:00:31,836
But, if you like I’ll sell it to you,
If you like.

909
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:33,923
For cheaper’n I might get in an auction.

910
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:36,190
Or you might never
get around to the auction,

911
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:39,283
and then we can just have it
for free after you die.

912
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:40,481
Barbara...

913
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:44,527
You might at that.

914
01:00:46,205 --> 01:00:47,164
Bill? I was wondering,
You reading those poems..

915
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,098
Which ones did you..

916
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:54,961
..choose in the end to read?
- Well I..

917
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:57,325
Bill, Where are you living now?

918
01:00:58,018 --> 01:00:59,156
You want this old sideboard?

919
01:01:01,523 --> 01:01:03,889
I beg your pardon.
- You and Barbara are separated, right?

920
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:07,734
Or, are you divorced already?

921
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,717
No, we’re separated.

922
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:16,022
You thought you could slip that
by me, didn’t you?

923
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:20,356
Nobody slips anything by me.

924
01:01:21,983 --> 01:01:23,201
I know what’s what.

925
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:27,835
Your father thought he’s slipping
one by me too, right?

926
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,731
What is the matter with you?
- I’m sorry you two’re having trouble,

927
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,498
maybe you can work it out.

928
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:35,993
Bev’n I separated a few times,

929
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:39,228
course we didn’t call it that.

930
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:41,595
Help us, with an illustration
from your storybook marriage.

931
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:46,312
Truth is, you just can’t compete
with a younger woman.

932
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:49,821
It's just one of those unfair
things in life.

933
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:54,037
Is there a younger woman involved?
- You’ve said enough on this topic.

934
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:56,413
Yes. There’s a younger woman.
- Well, Y’see?

935
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:58,530
Odds’re against you there, babe.

936
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,711
Mom believes women don’t grow
more attractive with age.

937
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:08,895
Oh, I disagree, I..
- No..

938
01:02:09,694 --> 01:02:10,862
I didn’t say they
“don’t grow more attractive,”

939
01:02:11,242 --> 01:02:13,698
I said they get ugly.

940
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,946
And it’s not really a matter
of opinion, Karen dear.

941
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:18,722
You’ve only just started
to prove it yourself.

942
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:22,246
You’re in rare form today, Vi.

943
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:24,043
Well, The day calls for it, doesn’t it?

944
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,179
What form would you have me in?

945
01:02:28,028 --> 01:02:28,886
Hmm?

946
01:02:29,256 --> 01:02:31,612
I just don’t understand
why you’re so adversarial.

947
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:33,839
I’m just truth-telling.

948
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:36,985
Some people are
antagonized by the truth.

949
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:39,411
Everyone here loves you, dear.

950
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,788
You think you can shame me, Charlie?

951
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,605
Blow it out your ass!

952
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,488
Three days ago...
I had to identified my father’s corpse.

953
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:52,003
Now I’m supposed to sit here and listen
to you viciously attack,

954
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:54,899
every member of this family.
- Attack my family?!

955
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,265
Have you ever been attacked..

956
01:02:57,705 --> 01:02:58,783
in your sweet spoiled life?!

957
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,258
Tell her ‘bout attacks, Mattie Fae.

958
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,911
Tell her what an attack looks like!
- Settle down, Mom.

959
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,848
Don't tell me to settle down, goddam it!

960
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,518
I’m not a goddamn invalid!
Am I to be abided now.

961
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:10,906
Have I been passed over?!

962
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:13,891
C'mon, Honey..
- This woman..

963
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:18,235
came to my rescue when
one of my dear mother’s many..

964
01:03:19,074 --> 01:03:22,538
gentlemen friends was attacking me,
with a claw hammer!

965
01:03:22,878 --> 01:03:24,366
This woman has..

966
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:28,290
dents in her skull,
fro hammer blows.

967
01:03:30,268 --> 01:03:31,296
What do you know about

968
01:03:31,785 --> 01:03:33,922
..life on these Plains?
What do you know..

969
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,869
..about hard times?

970
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,702
We know you had a
rotten childhood, Mom.

971
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:41,566
Who didn’t?
- You DON’T know! You do NOT know!

972
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,803
None of you know,
‘cept this woman right here.

973
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:47,342
And that man we buried today!

974
01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:53,294
Sweet girl, sweet Barbara,

975
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:56,390
my heart breaks for every time,

976
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,669
you ever felt pain.
I wish I coulda shielded you from it.

977
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:01,868
But if you think,

978
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,547
you can fathom
for one solitary second..

979
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:07,449
the pain that man endured
in his natural life,

980
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:09,977
you got another think coming.

981
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,595
Do you know where your father lived
from age four till about ten?

982
01:04:14,174 --> 01:04:15,103
Do you?

983
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,439
Do you?

984
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:18,637
No.

985
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:21,024
In a Pontiac Sedan.

986
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,648
With his mother, his father,
in a fucking car!

987
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:26,847
Six fucking years in a car!

988
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:31,279
Now, what do you want to say about
your rotten childhood?

989
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:32,477
Jesus.

990
01:04:32,677 --> 01:04:33,676
That’s the crux of the biscuit.

991
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:34,874
We lived too hard..

992
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:38,494
and then rose too high.
We sacrificed everything!

993
01:04:38,693 --> 01:04:39,692
We did it all for you.

994
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:44,394
Your father and I were the first in
our families to graduate high school.

995
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,986
And he wound up,
an award-winning poet.

996
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:49,703
You girls, just..

997
01:04:50,362 --> 01:04:51,740
given a college education,

998
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:55,165
taken for granted, no doubt.
Where did you wind up?

999
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:56,882
What did you do?

1000
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:59,029
What did you do?

1001
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:02,814
Who are you?

1002
01:05:03,013 --> 01:05:04,012
Jesus!

1003
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:06,358
Jesus, you worked as hard as us,
you’d all be President.

1004
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:08,442
You never had real problems.

1005
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:10,689
So, you got to make all
your problems yourselves.

1006
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:11,887
Why are you screaming at us?

1007
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:14,487
Just time we had some truth’s
told ‘round here.

1008
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:17,402
Damn fine day,
to tell the truth.

1009
01:05:20,108 --> 01:05:21,886
Well, the truth is...

1010
01:05:22,735 --> 01:05:25,601
I’m getting full.
- Amen.

1011
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:27,767
There’s dessert, too.

1012
01:05:28,656 --> 01:05:31,562
She baked pies.
They look so lovely.

1013
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:32,760
I got a truth to tell.

1014
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,298
It speaks.

1015
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:36,515
What is it, son?

1016
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:45,082
I have a truth.
- Little Charles...?

1017
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:49,062
I..
- Charles, not like this, please...

1018
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:54,159
The truth is...

1019
01:05:58,773 --> 01:05:59,941
I forgot to set the clock.

1020
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:04,572
The power didn’t go out,
I I...forgot to set the clock.

1021
01:06:04,772 --> 01:06:05,770
Sorry, Mom.

1022
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:09,317
I’m sorry, everyone.

1023
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:12,183
Excuse me...I...just..

1024
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:19,962
Scintillating.

1025
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:21,719
I gave up a long time ago...

1026
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,286
Little Charles is your project now.

1027
01:06:25,684 --> 01:06:26,612
Charles.

1028
01:06:27,171 --> 01:06:28,589
His name is Charles.

1029
01:06:30,477 --> 01:06:31,645
Poor Ivy.

1030
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,940
Poor baby.
- Please, Mom...

1031
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:39,175
She's always had a feeling
for the underdog.

1032
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,803
Don’t be mean to me right now, okay?
- I am not..

1033
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:43,700
Everyone’s got this idea..

1034
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,029
I’m mean all of a sudden.
- Please, momma.

1035
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:49,100
I’m just telling the truth.
- You’re a drug addict.

1036
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:52,125
That is the truth!
That’s what I’m getting at!

1037
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:54,222
Hey, everybody.
Everybody listen...

1038
01:06:54,632 --> 01:06:56,080
I am a drug addict.

1039
01:06:57,038 --> 01:06:58,157
I love drugs.

1040
01:06:58,616 --> 01:07:00,333
Specially, pills,
specially downers.

1041
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:02,740
Y’see these little blue babies?

1042
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:04,957
These are my best fucking friends,

1043
01:07:05,656 --> 01:07:07,971
..and they never
let me down.

1044
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,169
Try to get ‘em away from me;

1045
01:07:10,758 --> 01:07:12,186
I’ll eat you alive.

1046
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:16,476
Gimme those goddamn pills..
- I’ll eat you alive, girl!

1047
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:20,585
Holy shit!

1048
01:07:27,012 --> 01:07:28,669
Barbara, stop it.

1049
01:07:33,735 --> 01:07:38,348
Hey, now, c’mon!

1050
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:40,066
Give that to me!

1051
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:45,109
Goddamn you...

1052
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:47,994
goddamn you..

1053
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,626
Sit down.
- Okay. Pill raid.

1054
01:07:53,996 --> 01:07:55,863
Remember this?
Remember how it goes?

1055
01:07:57,211 --> 01:07:59,278
Search everything!
Every closet...

1056
01:07:59,797 --> 01:08:02,786
Every drawer, every shoebox.

1057
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:05,489
Karen, call Dr. Burke.

1058
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,934
You can’t do this!
This is my house!

1059
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:11,440
This is my house!

1060
01:08:12,918 --> 01:08:14,067
You don’t get it, do you?

1061
01:08:14,866 --> 01:08:16,263
You don’t get it.

1062
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:18,940
I’M RUNNING THINGS NOW!

1063
01:08:27,627 --> 01:08:29,754
Why’d Dr. Burke write her so many
prescriptions?

1064
01:08:30,313 --> 01:08:31,511
Didn't he know?

1065
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:35,065
It’s not just him.
She’s got a doctor in every port.

1066
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,183
And you knew,
 this was going on again?

1067
01:08:58,562 --> 01:08:59,621
I'm sorry about you and Bill.

1068
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:01,598
Me too, Barb.

1069
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,642
You think, it's temporary or..

1070
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:09,558
Who knows?

1071
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:11,583
We've been married a long time.

1072
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:18,633
Now what?

1073
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:26,188
DR. BURKE: The chemotherapy and radiation,

1074
01:09:26,388 --> 01:09:27,387
coupled with the overuse of..

1075
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:29,366
pain medications.
- Right..

1076
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,698
and without the benefit of more
thorough testing,

1077
01:09:31,898 --> 01:09:32,897
an MRI or CT scan,

1078
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:38,390
I believe your mother is suffering from
Mild Cognitive Impairment.

1079
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:39,588
- Mild Cognitive Impairment?

1080
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:40,786
Brain damage.

1081
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:45,858
It may be time to consider placing her
in a long term care facility.

1082
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:50,483
I know i'd feel more comfortable If I know,
she was receiving that level of supervision.

1083
01:09:50,683 --> 01:09:51,681
And, where would you have us put her?

1084
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,918
A psychiatric hospital?

1085
01:09:54,192 --> 01:09:55,110
Well, Beverly’s gone.

1086
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,226
Well, not so much as “gone”
as “dead,” but I see your point.

1087
01:09:58,925 --> 01:10:02,420
Legal guardianship, for you and your
sisters, with my recommendation..

1088
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:05,760
So you’re thinking, if the three of us
cooperated with this,

1089
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:10,598
commitment end-around,
we’d be less likely to sue your ass?

1090
01:10:12,116 --> 01:10:14,213
I’m sorry?
- “Mild Cognitive Impairment?”

1091
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:15,411
Are you fucking kidding me?

1092
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:18,297
All right?

1093
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:20,014
Know whose name is on these bottles?

1094
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:23,283
Do you?
- Your mother's a very sick person.

1095
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:26,073
We've a whole bucket of these
with your name on it.

1096
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:27,271
Evidence for the medical board.

1097
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:34,443
Let's go.
I thing we're done.

1098
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:50,745
Pull the car over.

1099
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:51,943
We’ll be home in a minute.

1100
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:54,799
Pull the car over.

1101
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:57,979
I’m going to be sick.

1102
01:11:36,611 --> 01:11:38,528
Mom. Mom?

1103
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:43,500
Mom?!

1104
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:08,954
Mom!

1105
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,528
Mom!

1106
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:14,627
Mom! Wait!

1107
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:24,259
Mom!

1108
01:12:29,597 --> 01:12:31,052
What are you doing?

1109
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:33,640
Where the fuck are you going?

1110
01:12:40,135 --> 01:12:42,725
There’s no place to go.

1111
01:12:51,685 --> 01:12:52,863
I’m sorry.

1112
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:56,937
Honey, please?
- No, it’s important I say this.

1113
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:02,130
I lost my temper at dinner
and went too far.

1114
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:04,466
Barbara.

1115
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,923
The day, the funeral...

1116
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:09,779
the pills. I was..

1117
01:13:11,356 --> 01:13:13,473
spoiling for a fight and you
gave it to me.

1118
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:20,568
So... truce?

1119
01:13:23,269 --> 01:13:24,917
Truce.
Yeah, sure.

1120
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:27,902
Now, what?

1121
01:13:31,168 --> 01:13:32,216
How do you mean?

1122
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:37,758
Don’t you think you should consider
going back to a rehab center?

1123
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,503
I can't go through that again.

1124
01:13:42,282 --> 01:13:43,450
I can do this.

1125
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:45,577
You've..

1126
01:13:46,446 --> 01:13:49,219
You took all my pills, right?

1127
01:13:49,419 --> 01:13:50,631
All that we could find.
- Well...

1128
01:13:50,831 --> 01:13:53,810
I don’t have that many hiding places.
- Now..Mom, come on.

1129
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,710
You wanna search me?
- No.

1130
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:05,425
If the pills are gone, I’ll be fine.

1131
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:11,046
I just need a few days
to get my feet under me.

1132
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,095
I want you to know, you’re not alone.
If you need any help.

1133
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:16,362
I don’t need help.

1134
01:14:16,971 --> 01:14:18,849
I wanna help.
- I don’t need your help.

1135
01:14:19,637 --> 01:14:21,104
Mom?
- I don’t need your help.

1136
01:14:21,304 --> 01:14:23,893
I’ve gotten myself..

1137
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:34,716
I know how this goes.

1138
01:14:35,245 --> 01:14:36,703
Once all the talking’s through,

1139
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:38,880
people go back to their own..

1140
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,407
...nonsense.

1141
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:42,025
I know that. So,

1142
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:46,309
Don’t worry about me. I’ll manage.
I get by.

1143
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:02,514
Remember when we checked her
in the psych ward, that stunt she pulled?

1144
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:03,713
Big speech..

1145
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:07,407
she’s getting clean, making this incredible
sacrifice for her family,

1146
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:09,296
she’s let us down but now
she’ll prove she’s a good mother.

1147
01:15:09,745 --> 01:15:11,872
She smuggled Darvocet
into the psych ward..

1148
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:13,649
...in her vagina.

1149
01:15:14,029 --> 01:15:16,749
There’s your Greatest Generation for you.

1150
01:15:16,948 --> 01:15:17,947
She's giving this speech
to us while she was..

1151
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:20,739
..clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch.

1152
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:23,721
I’ve never heard this story.

1153
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,919
Did you just say “cooch”?

1154
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:26,980
The phrase “Mom’s pussy” seems gauche.

1155
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:29,486
You’re a little more comfortable
with “cooch,” are you?

1156
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:32,089
What word should I use to describe
our mother’s vagina?

1157
01:15:32,288 --> 01:15:34,308
I don’t know, Barb.
- “Mom’s beaver”?

1158
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,385
 “Mother’s box”?
- Oh God, Barbara!

1159
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:41,729
One thing about Mom and Dad.

1160
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:48,090
You have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long.

1161
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,076
Karen. He killed himself.

1162
01:15:51,135 --> 01:15:53,877
We don't know that, for sure.

1163
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:59,419
Is there something going on between
you and Little Charles?

1164
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,010
I don’t know that I’m comfortable
talking about that.

1165
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,461
Because, he’s our first cousin. You know.
- Give me a break.

1166
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,690
You know you shouldn’t consider children.

1167
01:16:09,918 --> 01:16:13,316
I can’t anyway,
I had a hysterectomy last year.

1168
01:16:13,872 --> 01:16:15,699
Why?
- Cervical cancer.

1169
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:19,643
I didn’t know.
- Neither did I.

1170
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:20,841
I didn’t tell anyone except Charles.

1171
01:16:21,471 --> 01:16:22,599
That’s where it started between us.

1172
01:16:23,338 --> 01:16:27,300
Why not?
- And hear it from Mom the rest of my life?

1173
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:30,428
She doesn’t need another excuse to treat me
like some damaged thing.

1174
01:16:31,397 --> 01:16:32,655
You might have told us.

1175
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,361
You didn’t tell us about you and Bill.
- That’s different.

1176
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:36,559
Why?

1177
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:39,830
Because it’s you, and not me?

1178
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:44,243
ecause divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat.

1179
01:16:44,443 --> 01:16:46,701
Cancer’s fucking cancer,
you can’t help that.

1180
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,264
We’re your sisters.

1181
01:16:50,309 --> 01:16:51,308
I don’t feel that connection very keenly.

1182
01:16:51,837 --> 01:16:53,934
I feel very connected, to both of you.

1183
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:56,401
We never see you, you’re never around,

1184
01:16:57,489 --> 01:17:00,085
you haven’t been around...
- I still feel that connection!

1185
01:17:00,405 --> 01:17:03,575
I can’t perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore.

1186
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:06,077
We’re just people, some of us accidentally
connected by genetics,

1187
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:08,396
a random selection of cells.

1188
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:11,628
When did you get so cynical?
- That’s funny, coming from you.

1189
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:15,563
Well, Bitter, Yes, but
“random selection of cells?”

1190
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:21,840
Maybe my cynicism came with
the realization that the responsibility,

1191
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:24,643
of caring for our parents was mine alone.

1192
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:26,482
Don’t give me that. I participated.

1193
01:17:26,682 --> 01:17:30,812
Till you had enough and got out,
you and Karen both. I’m not criticizing.

1194
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:32,936
Do what you want.
You did, Karen did.

1195
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:34,134
And if you didn’t, that’s not my fault.

1196
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:36,882
That’s right, so don’t lay this sister
thing on me, all right?

1197
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,882
When I leave here I won’t feel
any more guilty than you two did.

1198
01:17:42,114 --> 01:17:44,850
I can’t believe
your world view is this dark.

1199
01:17:47,197 --> 01:17:48,655
You live in Florida.

1200
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:52,609
You’re thinking of leaving?

1201
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:53,807
Yeah.

1202
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:57,781
Charles and I are going to New York.

1203
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,809
What are you going to do in New York?

1204
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:01,267
We have plans.

1205
01:18:01,736 --> 01:18:03,973
Like what?
- None of your business.

1206
01:18:04,482 --> 01:18:05,830
What about Mom?
- What about her?

1207
01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:08,187
You feel comfortable leaving her here?
- Do you?

1208
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:12,940
You’re going back to Miami, right?
- Yes. I can't stay.

1209
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:18,419
There you go, Barb.

1210
01:18:18,618 --> 01:18:21,542
You want to know what we’re
doing about Mom? Karen and I are leaving.

1211
01:18:21,742 --> 01:18:25,820
You want to stay, that’s your decision.
But nobody gets to point a finger at me.

1212
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,740
Nobody.

1213
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,106
My three girls,

1214
01:18:44,364 --> 01:18:45,812
all together.

1215
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:53,841
Hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling.

1216
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:57,335
You had a bath?
- Yeah.

1217
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,934
You want something to eat?
Some coffee?

1218
01:19:00,401 --> 01:19:02,538
I’m fine. Honey, thank you.

1219
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:14,000
I'll bet, this house must have heard
a lot of Weston girl secrets.

1220
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:18,906
I get embarrassed
just thinking about it.

1221
01:19:20,482 --> 01:19:22,399
Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about.

1222
01:19:24,057 --> 01:19:26,508
Secret crushes, secret schemes.

1223
01:19:27,052 --> 01:19:30,448
I can’t imagine anything more
delicate, or bittersweet.

1224
01:19:30,647 --> 01:19:35,373
Some part of you girls
I always identified with...

1225
01:19:35,573 --> 01:19:38,060
no matter how old you get,

1226
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:43,849
a woman’s hard-pressed to throw off
that part of herself.

1227
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:48,322
That smells so good.

1228
01:19:48,961 --> 01:19:50,828
It’s apple. You want some?

1229
01:19:54,852 --> 01:19:56,329
Sure, I do.

1230
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:03,732
Hey, did I ever tell you
the story of Raymond Qualls?

1231
01:20:04,848 --> 01:20:07,773
That's a Boy I had a crush on
when I was thirteen or so.

1232
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:10,959
Rough-looking boy,

1233
01:20:11,888 --> 01:20:16,509
beat-up jeans and messy hair.

1234
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,059
Terrible underbite.

1235
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:21,633
But he had these
beautiful cowboy boots,

1236
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:25,029
shiny chocolate leather.

1237
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:30,181
He was so proud of those boots,
you could tell, the way..

1238
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:35,973
he’d strut around, all arms and elbows,
puffed up and cocksure.

1239
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:45,895
I convined myself that
I needed to get a girly pair of those boots;

1240
01:20:48,614 --> 01:20:51,530
and I was sure if I did that
that he’d ask me to go steady.

1241
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:57,655
You know, He’d see me in those boots and say
“That's the gal for me.”

1242
01:20:59,179 --> 01:21:00,058
Oh, gosh!

1243
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:10,032
So, I found the boots
in a window downtown,

1244
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:15,156
And, I just went crazy!

1245
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:18,341
Praying for those boots,
I'm rehearsing the..

1246
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,747
conversation that I’d have with Raymond
when he saw me in my boots.

1247
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:28,996
Must’ve asked my momma a hundred times
if I could get those boots.

1248
01:21:29,365 --> 01:21:30,873
“ Vi, What do you want for Christmas?”

1249
01:21:31,402 --> 01:21:36,450
“Momma, I’ll give all of it up just to have
those boots.” Bargaining..

1250
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:43,577
So, She started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree..

1251
01:21:45,574 --> 01:21:48,348
she had wrapped up,
about the size of a boot box,

1252
01:21:48,777 --> 01:21:51,443
Real nice wrapping paper.

1253
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,898
“Now, Vi, don’t you cheat

1254
01:21:55,298 --> 01:21:58,264
 and don't you go in there
before Christmas morning.”

1255
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:03,702
Little smile on her face.
Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy,

1256
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:07,021
 under the tree,
I was tearing the paper...

1257
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:27,429
There were boots in there,
men’s work boots,

1258
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:32,268
holes in the toes, chewed up laces and..

1259
01:22:32,903 --> 01:22:34,032
caked in mud..

1260
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,980
Caked in mud and dog shit.

1261
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,951
Lord,

1262
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:53,454
my momma laughed for days.

1263
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:02,041
Please, don’t tell me
that’s the end of the story.

1264
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,268
Oh, no. That..

1265
01:23:07,736 --> 01:23:09,247
That’s the end.

1266
01:23:10,729 --> 01:23:12,047
You never got the boots?

1267
01:23:14,233 --> 01:23:16,198
No, huh-uh.

1268
01:23:19,805 --> 01:23:22,082
My momma was a mean..
nasty-mean old lady.

1269
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:29,232
I suppose that’s where I get it..

1270
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,968
..from.

1271
01:23:34,424 --> 01:23:39,803
You’re not nasty-mean.
You’re our mother and we love you.

1272
01:25:17,675 --> 01:25:18,873
Is the coast clear?

1273
01:25:20,271 --> 01:25:21,340
Never very.

1274
01:25:23,215 --> 01:25:24,267
What are you watching?

1275
01:25:24,725 --> 01:25:25,823
Television.

1276
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:29,249
Can I watch it with you?

1277
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:30,566
I wish you would.

1278
01:25:38,994 --> 01:25:41,261
Are you mad at me?
- Nope.

1279
01:25:47,781 --> 01:25:48,680
I was trying to be brave.

1280
01:25:49,599 --> 01:25:50,557
I know.

1281
01:25:53,783 --> 01:25:57,382
I just... I want everyone to know that
I got what I always wanted.

1282
01:25:57,582 --> 01:26:01,326
And that means... I’m not a loser.
- Hey.  Hey.

1283
01:26:03,499 --> 01:26:04,926
You’re my hero.

1284
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,700
I wrote this for you.

1285
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,898
Sit down.

1286
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:36,350
Well, I've never been a

1287
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:39,866
man of many words.

1288
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:47,949
And, there's nothing I could say
that you haven't never heard.

1289
01:26:50,816 --> 01:26:57,222
But, I'll sing you love songs
till the day I die.

1290
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,800
The way I'm feeling,
I can't keep it inside.

1291
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:11,448
I'll sing a sweet serenade whenever
you're feeling sad.

1292
01:27:14,057 --> 01:27:19,444
And, a lullaby each night
before you go to bed.

1293
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:28,426
I'll sing to you for the rest of your life..
- Liberace!

1294
01:27:29,654 --> 01:27:31,351
You beter get yourself together,

1295
01:27:31,721 --> 01:27:33,728
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs.

1296
01:27:33,928 --> 01:27:34,926
They’ve probably eaten
the drapes by now.

1297
01:27:36,244 --> 01:27:39,329
I’m sure the house is fine.
- Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has got the TV on.

1298
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:41,507
This one watches so much television,

1299
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:43,569
it’s rotted his brain.
- I’m sure that’s not true.

1300
01:27:43,768 --> 01:27:44,772
What was it I caught you
watching the other day?

1301
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:48,067
I don’t remember.
- You do so remember,

1302
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:51,153
..some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives.

1303
01:27:51,352 --> 01:27:52,351
I don’t remember.

1304
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:56,616
Too bad there isn’t a job where
they pay you to sit around watching TV.

1305
01:27:56,815 --> 01:27:59,987
C’mon, Mattie Fae..
- Y’know he got fired from a shoe store?

1306
01:28:00,187 --> 01:28:01,185
Mattie Fae.

1307
01:28:01,438 --> 01:28:03,275
we’re gonna get in the car and go home.

1308
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:07,309
And if you say one more mean
thing to that boy..

1309
01:28:08,058 --> 01:28:09,870
I’m going to kick your fat Irish ass..

1310
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:12,130
onto the highway.
- What the hell did you say to me?

1311
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,890
You kids go outside, would you please?

1312
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,469
I don’t understand this meanness.

1313
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:25,563
I look at you and your sister..

1314
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:28,878
and the way you talk to people
and I don’t understand it.

1315
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:32,802
I can’t understand why
folks can’t be

1316
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:34,620
respectful of one another.

1317
01:28:35,998 --> 01:28:37,356
I don’t think there’s any excuse for it.

1318
01:28:38,484 --> 01:28:40,980
My family didn’t treat each other that way.
- Maybe that’s because your family...

1319
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:44,985
You had better not say anything
about my family right now. I mean it.

1320
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:51,276
We buried a man I loved very much.

1321
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:53,952
And whatever faults..

1322
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:55,549
he may have had,

1323
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:57,666
he was a good, kind,

1324
01:28:58,006 --> 01:28:59,464
decent man!

1325
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,538
And to hear you tear into your own son.

1326
01:29:04,427 --> 01:29:07,582
not even a day later that
dishonors Beverly’s memory.

1327
01:29:12,345 --> 01:29:14,392
We’ve been married thirty-eight years.

1328
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:17,228
And I wouldn’t trade them
for anything.

1329
01:29:20,393 --> 01:29:22,730
ut if you can’t find a
generous place in your heart

1330
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:25,866
for your own son,

1331
01:29:27,014 --> 01:29:30,465
We’re not going to make
it to thirty-nine!

1332
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:56,512
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.
I froze.

1333
01:29:56,712 --> 01:29:57,711
That’s --

1334
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,366
you have a cigarette, hon?

1335
01:30:06,224 --> 01:30:07,773
No, I quit years ago.

1336
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:09,611
So did I.
Just sounded good to me.

1337
01:30:14,557 --> 01:30:16,245
I thought at dinner...

1338
01:30:16,735 --> 01:30:18,563
at that horrible dinner seemed like,

1339
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:21,541
something might be going on between
Ivy and Little Charles.

1340
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,561
Do you know if that’s true?

1341
01:30:27,116 --> 01:30:28,045
I’m not sure..
- just.

1342
01:30:28,485 --> 01:30:29,693
Is it true?

1343
01:30:33,837 --> 01:30:35,986
Yes. It’s true.

1344
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:37,185
Okay.

1345
01:30:38,436 --> 01:30:39,425
That can’t happen.

1346
01:30:40,264 --> 01:30:41,673
This is going to be difficult,

1347
01:30:42,752 --> 01:30:44,011
 uh... Ivy and Little Charles have always

1348
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:47,959
 marched to their own...
and I’d expect this to be toughest on you..

1349
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:49,158
Barb...?
- They’re in love.

1350
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:53,009
They think they are. I know it’s
unorthodox for cousins to get together,

1351
01:30:53,209 --> 01:30:54,208
 ...at least these days.
- They’re not cousins.

1352
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,669
Beg pardon?

1353
01:31:00,637 --> 01:31:03,489
Little Charles is not your cousin.
He’s your brother.

1354
01:31:03,974 --> 01:31:05,442
He’s your blood brother.

1355
01:31:06,422 --> 01:31:07,501
Half brother.

1356
01:31:09,669 --> 01:31:10,898
He’s your father’s child.

1357
01:31:12,826 --> 01:31:14,195
Which means that he is Ivy’s brother.

1358
01:31:17,308 --> 01:31:18,737
Do you see?

1359
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,819
Go away.

1360
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:23,257
We’re just going to...
- Go away!  NOW!  GO AWAY!

1361
01:31:23,457 --> 01:31:24,456
All righ..alright.

1362
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:30,760
You and Dad.

1363
01:31:31,939 --> 01:31:33,058
Who knows this?

1364
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:35,087
I do. And you do.

1365
01:31:36,016 --> 01:31:38,664
Uncle Charlie doesn’t suspect?
- We’ve never discussed it.

1366
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:42,361
What?
- We’ve never discussed it. Okay?

1367
01:31:43,509 --> 01:31:44,668
Did Dad know?

1368
01:31:44,868 --> 01:31:45,867
Yes.

1369
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:49,936
Y’know, I’m not proud of this.
- Really.

1370
01:31:50,164 --> 01:31:51,273
You people amaze me.

1371
01:31:51,922 --> 01:31:54,450
What, were you drunk? Was this just some..
- I wasn’t drunk, no.

1372
01:31:56,798 --> 01:31:59,295
Maybe it’s hard for you to believe,
looking at me, knowing me the way

1373
01:31:59,296 --> 01:32:02,863
you do, all these years. I mean, I know to you,
I’m just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae.

1374
01:32:03,202 --> 01:32:04,861
I’m more than that, sweetheart,

1375
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:10,600
there’s more to me than that.

1376
01:32:13,323 --> 01:32:16,698
I don’t know why Little Charles
is such a disappointment to me.

1377
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,199
Maybe he,

1378
01:32:20,677 --> 01:32:22,096
well, I don’t know why.

1379
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:29,576
I’m disappointed for him,
more than anything.

1380
01:32:36,753 --> 01:32:39,397
I made a mistake, a long time ago.

1381
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:43,674
Okay? I paid for it.

1382
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,535
But the mistake ends here.

1383
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,561
If Ivy found out, it would destroy her.

1384
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:52,519
I’m sure as hell not gonna tell her.

1385
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,682
You have to find a way to stop it.

1386
01:32:57,882 --> 01:33:02,065
You have to put a stop to it.

1387
01:33:44,314 --> 01:33:45,214
Hold it.

1388
01:33:45,733 --> 01:33:46,982
Don’t let it out.

1389
01:33:48,301 --> 01:33:49,360
That’s a kick, huh?

1390
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:10,579
If you won’t look,
there’s no point in showing them to you.

1391
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:12,320
Okay, okay.
I'll look.

1392
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,029
You’re gonna get us both in trouble.

1393
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:15,987
I’m white and over thirty.
I don’t get in trouble.

1394
01:34:22,395 --> 01:34:23,587
Oh my God...

1395
01:34:23,787 --> 01:34:24,786
Oh, my God!

1396
01:34:25,818 --> 01:34:27,497
Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

1397
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,495
Stop! Stop!

1398
01:34:31,923 --> 01:34:33,232
What is wrong with you?

1399
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:37,029
Steve!

1400
01:34:37,228 --> 01:34:38,957
What happened?

1401
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,090
She was messing with Jean?

1402
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:42,289
Baby are you okay?

1403
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:45,297
Jean, what are you doing up?

1404
01:34:45,497 --> 01:34:46,496
Do I need to call a doctor?

1405
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:47,999
I don’t know.

1406
01:34:49,338 --> 01:34:50,817
Johnna, what’s going on?

1407
01:34:51,306 --> 01:34:53,009
He was messing with Jean,
so, I tuned him up.

1408
01:34:53,209 --> 01:34:54,208
Messing with, what do you mean,
messing with?

1409
01:34:55,133 --> 01:34:57,084
He was kissing and grabbing her.

1410
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:58,765
I’ll murder you, you prick!

1411
01:34:58,965 --> 01:34:59,964
You know how old that girl is?

1412
01:35:02,976 --> 01:35:04,725
She's fourteen years old!
- I didn’t do anything!

1413
01:35:05,044 --> 01:35:07,871
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- Just back off, Barbara!

1414
01:35:08,071 --> 01:35:09,680
That son-of-a-bitch is a sociopath!

1415
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,677
What is the matter with you?
Will you please stop freaking out?

1416
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:14,606
Why don’t you start at the beginning?

1417
01:35:15,315 --> 01:35:18,133
What are you even doing up?
- Sweetheart, we need to know what went on here.

1418
01:35:18,892 --> 01:35:20,161
Nothing “went on.”

1419
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:26,576
Nothing, okay? Can we not turn
everything a federal case here? okay..

1420
01:35:27,075 --> 01:35:30,072
I came down smoked a little pot.
Smoked a little pot and..

1421
01:35:31,112 --> 01:35:34,304
we were just goofing around
and then everything just got a little bit crazy.

1422
01:35:34,504 --> 01:35:37,028
What have I told you about smoking that shit?!
- Then Johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel?

1423
01:35:38,555 --> 01:35:40,876
Just tell me what he did!
- He didn’t do anything!

1424
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:43,707
What’s the big deal?
- The big deal, Jean,

1425
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:44,906
is that you’re fourteen years old.

1426
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:47,687
Just a few years younger than
you like ‘em.

1427
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:53,546
I hate you!

1428
01:35:53,746 --> 01:35:56,643
What’s the matter with you?

1429
01:35:58,098 --> 01:35:59,007
Jean.

1430
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:10,759
I can do without a speech.
- Where is he?

1431
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:13,825
Out at the car. We’re leaving.
Back to Florida, tonight, now.

1432
01:36:14,574 --> 01:36:15,783
Me and Steve, together.

1433
01:36:16,302 --> 01:36:19,364
You wannna give me some grief about that?
- Now you wait goddamn it.

1434
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:22,345
You better find out from Jean
exactly what went on..

1435
01:36:22,545 --> 01:36:23,544
before you start pointing fingers.

1436
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,280
Because, I doubt Jean’s
blameless in all this.

1437
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,870
And I’m not saying that I blame her..

1438
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:33,951
just cause I said she’s not blameless,
It doesn’t mean I’ve blamed her.

1439
01:36:34,151 --> 01:36:38,224
I’m saying she might
share in the responsibility.

1440
01:36:39,212 --> 01:36:40,781
It’s not cut and dried,

1441
01:36:40,981 --> 01:36:44,424
It lives where everything lives,
somewhere in the middle.

1442
01:36:44,678 --> 01:36:46,265
Where the rest of us live,

1443
01:36:46,465 --> 01:36:48,410
everyone but you.
- Karen--

1444
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:50,043
I'm no angel myself.

1445
01:36:51,002 --> 01:36:52,781
I’ve done some things
I’m not proud of.

1446
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:55,748
Things you’ll never know about.

1447
01:36:56,757 --> 01:36:59,225
And, I may even have to do some things
I’m not proud of again.

1448
01:37:00,934 --> 01:37:05,225
Cause, life puts you in a corner that way.

1449
01:37:07,098 --> 01:37:10,712
Anyway..
You have your own hash to settle.

1450
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:14,559
Before you start making
speeches to the rest of us.

1451
01:37:15,911 --> 01:37:19,310
And, Come January...
I’ll be in Belize.

1452
01:37:21,366 --> 01:37:25,790
Doesn’t that sound nice?

1453
01:37:40,669 --> 01:37:44,430
I’m taking Jean with me,
heading back to Colorado in the morning.

1454
01:37:50,311 --> 01:37:51,540
You're never coming back to me,
Are you, Bill?

1455
01:37:57,574 --> 01:37:58,853
Never say, never.

1456
01:38:03,309 --> 01:38:04,279
But no.

1457
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:10,803
And I’ll probably never really
understand why, am I?

1458
01:38:17,677 --> 01:38:18,716
Probably not.

1459
01:38:58,961 --> 01:39:00,440
Where are Bill and Jean going?

1460
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:03,057
Karen, left too?

1461
01:39:04,156 --> 01:39:05,046
Yeah.

1462
01:39:05,905 --> 01:39:07,124
Is mom clean?

1463
01:39:09,812 --> 01:39:12,358
She’s moderately clean.
- Moderately?

1464
01:39:12,558 --> 01:39:13,840
You don’t like moderately?
Then let’s say..

1465
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,039
...tolerably.
Is she clean, or not?

1466
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:16,238
Back off.
- I'm nervous.

1467
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:20,193
Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.
- I have to tell her, though.

1468
01:39:20,662 --> 01:39:22,111
We’re leaving for New York tomorrow.

1469
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,498
I don't think, it's a good idea.
For you and Charles to take this any further.

1470
01:39:26,297 --> 01:39:27,563
Where is this coming from?

1471
01:39:27,763 --> 01:39:28,724
There's lot of fish in the sea.

1472
01:39:28,924 --> 01:39:32,363
Surely you can rule out the one single man
in the world you’re related to.

1473
01:39:32,563 --> 01:39:33,562
I love the man I’m related to.

1474
01:39:33,762 --> 01:39:36,810
Fuck love, what a crock of shit.
Love..

1475
01:39:37,288 --> 01:39:41,276
People can convince themselves
they love a painted rock.

1476
01:39:42,373 --> 01:39:44,621
Looks great. What is it?

1477
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:45,820
Catfish.

1478
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,269
Bottom feeders, my favorite.

1479
01:39:48,758 --> 01:39:52,374
You’re nearly fifty years old, Ivy,
you can’t go to New York, you’ll break a hip.

1480
01:39:52,573 --> 01:39:56,298
Here, Eat your catfish.
- Oh, you're infuriating..

1481
01:39:56,498 --> 01:39:58,980
I'm not the one,
who's fucking my cousin.

1482
01:39:59,512 --> 01:40:01,117
I have lived in this town,
year in and year out,

1483
01:40:01,317 --> 01:40:03,345
hoping against hope someone
would come into my life..

1484
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:05,674
Don’t get all Carson McCullers on me.

1485
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:11,245
Now, wipe that tragic look off
your face and eat some catfish.

1486
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:20,315
Howdy, Mom.
- What’s howdy about it?

1487
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,461
Look, catfish for lunch.
Johnna!

1488
01:40:22,661 --> 01:40:25,375
You hungry?
- Ivy, you should smile. Like me.

1489
01:40:25,575 --> 01:40:27,761
Mom needs her lunch, please.

1490
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:29,422
I’m not hungry.

1491
01:40:29,742 --> 01:40:31,833
You didn’t eaten anything today.
You didn’t eat anything yesterday.

1492
01:40:32,033 --> 01:40:33,032
I’m not hungry.

1493
01:40:33,232 --> 01:40:35,376
You're eating, do what I say.

1494
01:40:35,576 --> 01:40:37,519
Everyone do what I say.

1495
01:40:38,015 --> 01:40:41,431
Why aren’t either of you is dressed?

1496
01:40:42,101 --> 01:40:43,320
It's not like we're sitting here naked.

1497
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:45,808
Right, we are dressed.
Or, should we be dressed up?

1498
01:40:46,428 --> 01:40:47,926
Right, cos you're coming over for fish?

1499
01:40:48,566 --> 01:40:50,514
I'll eat in my room.
- That's fine, thank you.

1500
01:40:53,841 --> 01:40:54,754
Eat.
- No.

1501
01:40:54,954 --> 01:40:55,953
Eat it, Mom.

1502
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,247
Eat it.
- No.

1503
01:40:58,627 --> 01:41:00,525
Eat it, you fucker.
Eat that catfish.

1504
01:41:00,725 --> 01:41:01,724
Go to hell.

1505
01:41:01,924 --> 01:41:04,727
That ain’t cutting fucking ice with me.
Eat that fucking fish.

1506
01:41:04,927 --> 01:41:05,926
Mom, I have something to talk to you about.
- No you don’t.

1507
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:08,326
Barbara--
- No you don’t. Shut up.

1508
01:41:08,525 --> 01:41:09,525
Shut the fuck up.

1509
01:41:09,368 --> 01:41:12,205
Please--
- What’s to talk about?

1510
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:15,355
Forget it. Eat that fucking fish.
- I’m not hungry.

1511
01:41:15,555 --> 01:41:16,681
EAT THE FISH, BITCH!

1512
01:41:16,881 --> 01:41:17,880
Barbara...!

1513
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,878
Okay, fine, fuck it,
do what you want.

1514
01:41:26,363 --> 01:41:28,031
I have to tell you something.

1515
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,357
Ivy’s a lesbian.
- Barbara--

1516
01:41:31,556 --> 01:41:33,577
No, you’re not.
- No, I’m not--

1517
01:41:33,776 --> 01:41:35,266
Yes, you are.
Did you eat your fish?

1518
01:41:35,466 --> 01:41:36,465
Barbara, stop it!

1519
01:41:36,665 --> 01:41:38,909
Mom, please.
This is important.

1520
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:42,307
Eat your fish. Eat your fish.
Eat your fish.

1521
01:41:42,507 --> 01:41:44,286
What the fuck!

1522
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:47,375
I have something to say.
- Are we breaking shit now? huh?

1523
01:41:47,844 --> 01:41:49,213
‘cause I can break shit!

1524
01:41:50,652 --> 01:41:52,450
Hey, see, we can all break shit.

1525
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,997
Charles and I..
- You don’t want to break shit with me,

1526
01:41:55,197 --> 01:41:56,196
muthah-fuckah..
- Charles and I

1527
01:41:57,366 --> 01:41:58,495
Johnna?! Little spill in here!

1528
01:41:58,695 --> 01:41:59,694
Barbara, stop it!

1529
01:41:59,894 --> 01:42:03,631
Mom, Charles and I..

1530
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:06,304
Little Charles.
- Barbara --

1531
01:42:06,504 --> 01:42:09,277
You gotta say Little Charles or she
is not gonna know who you’re talking about.

1532
01:42:11,254 --> 01:42:12,123
Little Charles and I...

1533
01:42:14,081 --> 01:42:15,011
Little Charles and I are --

1534
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:18,358
Little Charles and you
are brother and sister.

1535
01:42:19,487 --> 01:42:20,596
I know that.

1536
01:42:23,703 --> 01:42:25,042
What? No,

1537
01:42:25,661 --> 01:42:26,521
Little Charles and I..

1538
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,229
I’ve always known that.

1539
01:42:31,366 --> 01:42:32,665
I told you, nobody slips anything by me.

1540
01:42:33,165 --> 01:42:35,025
Mom --
- Don’t listen.

1541
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:38,430
I knew the whole time
Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on.

1542
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:42,449
Charlie should have known too,
if he wasn’t smoking all that grass.

1543
01:42:42,649 --> 01:42:44,195
It’s the pills talking.
- Pills can't talk.

1544
01:42:45,814 --> 01:42:47,243
Your father tore himself up over it,

1545
01:42:47,652 --> 01:42:50,073
thirty some-odd years, but..

1546
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,227
Beverly wouldn’t have been Beverly
if he didn’t have plenty to brood about.

1547
01:42:54,426 --> 01:42:57,456
Mom, what are you about?

1548
01:42:57,656 --> 01:43:00,622
Better you girls know now though,
now you’re older.

1549
01:43:00,822 --> 01:43:03,776
You never know when someone
might need a kidney.

1550
01:43:06,476 --> 01:43:08,796
Why in God’s name
did you tell me this?

1551
01:43:09,054 --> 01:43:10,133
Hey, what do you care?

1552
01:43:14,309 --> 01:43:15,348
You’re monsters.

1553
01:43:16,327 --> 01:43:17,826
Come on now!
- Monsters...

1554
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:22,678
Who’s the injured party here?

1555
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,897
Ivy, listen...
- You will never see me, again.

1556
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:31,000
Mattie Fae told me,
I didn’t know what to do.

1557
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,199
I was trying to protect you.

1558
01:43:32,234 --> 01:43:34,385
We’ll go anyway,
we’ll still go away.

1559
01:43:34,585 --> 01:43:37,705
This is not my fault.
Mom told you! It wasn’t me, it was Mom!

1560
01:43:38,318 --> 01:43:39,687
There’s no difference.

1561
01:44:02,667 --> 01:44:06,204
Ivy..Ivy!

1562
01:44:16,593 --> 01:44:18,479
Ivy!

1563
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:58,478
We couldn’t let Ivy run off
with Little Charles.

1564
01:44:59,548 --> 01:45:00,827
Just wouldn’t be right.

1565
01:45:04,144 --> 01:45:05,413
She’ll be back.

1566
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:11,343
She’s a sweet girl, Ivy,
and I love her to death. But..

1567
01:45:12,996 --> 01:45:14,375
she isn’t strong.

1568
01:45:15,534 --> 01:45:16,393
Not like you.

1569
01:45:18,082 --> 01:45:19,360
Or me.

1570
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:24,024
You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?

1571
01:45:24,846 --> 01:45:25,735
Oh sure.

1572
01:45:25,935 --> 01:45:26,934
Sure.

1573
01:45:27,893 --> 01:45:28,972
But, I never told them I knew.

1574
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:31,480
But your father knew.
He knew I knew.

1575
01:45:33,448 --> 01:45:34,837
But, we never talked about it.

1576
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:40,651
I chose the higher ground.

1577
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:44,291
If I’d had the chance,
there at the end,

1578
01:45:44,491 --> 01:45:45,490
I would’ve..

1579
01:45:46,137 --> 01:45:49,882
I would’ve told him,
“I hope this isn’t about Little Charles,

1580
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:52,721
cause you know I know all about that.”

1581
01:45:53,191 --> 01:45:56,151
If I’d reached him at that motel,
I would’ve said,

1582
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:57,350
“You’d be better off if you quit

1583
01:45:58,097 --> 01:46:00,894
sulking about this ancient history.”

1584
01:46:03,492 --> 01:46:04,641
..what motel?

1585
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:07,069
I called over there on Monday

1586
01:46:08,058 --> 01:46:11,096
after I got into that safety deposit box.
But it was too late,

1587
01:46:12,384 --> 01:46:14,139
he’d checked out.

1588
01:46:14,339 --> 01:46:16,194
How did you know where he was?

1589
01:46:16,394 --> 01:46:21,665
The note. He said I could call him
over at the Country Squire Motel.

1590
01:46:22,745 --> 01:46:23,924
He left a note?

1591
01:46:24,704 --> 01:46:27,878
And I did, I called over there on Monday.

1592
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,249
After you got your money,

1593
01:46:30,559 --> 01:46:31,588
out of your safety deposit box...

1594
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:36,463
We had..

1595
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:39,321
..an arrangement.
You have to understand,

1596
01:46:41,289 --> 01:46:43,138
for people like your father and me,

1597
01:46:43,507 --> 01:46:46,015
who never had any money,
ever, as kids,

1598
01:46:47,284 --> 01:46:51,069
people from our generation,
that money is important.

1599
01:46:51,269 --> 01:46:52,268
If you could’ve stopped Daddy

1600
01:46:54,008 --> 01:46:58,951
from killing himself, you wouldn’t have
needed to get into your safety deposit box.

1601
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:03,740
Well, hindsight’s always twenty
twenty, isn't it?

1602
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:06,867
Did the note say he was
going to kill himself?

1603
01:47:09,235 --> 01:47:10,194
Mom?

1604
01:47:13,232 --> 01:47:14,840
If I had my..

1605
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:18,307
wits about me, maybe
I might’ve done it different. But..

1606
01:47:19,286 --> 01:47:20,265
I was,

1607
01:47:22,374 --> 01:47:23,383
your father and me both,

1608
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:26,180
we were...
- You were both fucked-up...

1609
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:28,588
You were fucked-up...

1610
01:47:30,487 --> 01:47:31,801
You are fucked-up.

1611
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:37,660
You’d better understand this,
you smug little ingrate.

1612
01:47:38,929 --> 01:47:42,566
There’s only  one reason Beverly
killed himself and that’s you.

1613
01:47:43,205 --> 01:47:47,351
Think there’s any way he would’ve done
what he did if you were still here?

1614
01:47:47,551 --> 01:47:48,550
No,

1615
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:53,387
just him and me,
in this house, alone in the dark,

1616
01:47:53,586 --> 01:47:57,360
abandoned, wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort.

1617
01:47:57,653 --> 01:47:58,532
Oh, yes..

1618
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:03,794
You stick that knife of judgment in me,
go ahead, but make no mistake,

1619
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:06,915
his blood is just as much on your hands
as it is on mine.

1620
01:48:08,563 --> 01:48:09,523
He did this though,

1621
01:48:10,332 --> 01:48:12,670
This is his doing, not ours.

1622
01:48:15,398 --> 01:48:20,423
Can you imagine anything more cruel,
to make me responsible?

1623
01:48:20,623 --> 01:48:21,622
Why?

1624
01:48:21,822 --> 01:48:25,601
Just to weaken me,
make me prove my character?

1625
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,892
So, No. I waited, I waited to get my hands
on that safety deposit box.

1626
01:48:30,092 --> 01:48:31,658
But, I would have waited anyway.

1627
01:48:31,858 --> 01:48:34,670
You want to show who’s stronger, Bev?

1628
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:38,450
Nobody’s stronger than me, goddamn it.
When nothing is left,

1629
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:40,991
when everything is gone
and disappeared,

1630
01:48:41,191 --> 01:48:43,621
I’ll be here.

1631
01:48:48,209 --> 01:48:50,267
Who’s stronger now,
you son-of-a-bitch?!

1632
01:48:54,529 --> 01:48:56,108
You’re right, Mom.

1633
01:48:56,308 --> 01:49:00,160
You’re the strong one.

1634
01:49:13,437 --> 01:49:14,706
Barbara?

1635
01:49:19,592 --> 01:49:20,841
Barbara?

1636
01:49:23,179 --> 01:49:24,577
Oh, Barb?

1637
01:49:25,487 --> 01:49:27,125
Barbara?!

1638
01:49:30,822 --> 01:49:32,910
Barbara?

1639
01:49:37,496 --> 01:49:38,745
Barbara?!!

1640
01:49:53,562 --> 01:49:54,681
Ivy?!

1641
01:49:58,688 --> 01:50:00,087
Ivy, you here?!

1642
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:06,479
Johnna?!

1643
01:51:26,322 --> 01:51:27,591
Johnna?!

1644
01:51:35,923 --> 01:51:37,452
Johnna?!

1645
01:51:47,084 --> 01:51:51,332
And then you’re gone, and Beverly,
