them for staring at you.

was the telephone going dead

a coyote or some other animal.

366
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,167
Still want to go on?

367
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,969
Yeah.

368
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,336
OK, let's go.

369
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:49,648
[Car engine starting]

370
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,451
I don't get it.

371
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,287
The tracks just stop right here.

372
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,488
That's impossible.

373
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,124
They've got to
continue somewhere.

374
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:58,925
Yeah, but they don't.

375
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,762
Well, then somebody
must have destroyed

376
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,797
Them, someone who
didn't want anyone

377
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:06,732
To know where they led to.

378
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,038
Well, there's no way to
find more tracks tonight,

379
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:15,041
Even if they're still there.

380
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:15,841
I guess not.

381
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:23,815
But I'm not giving up.

382
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:33,525
They were deliberately led
into that canyon by someone

383
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,262
They met in that town.

384
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:39,331
You still think there's
some kind of satanic town out

385
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,332
Here someplace?

386
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,600
Yeah.

387
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,003
And I feel that whatever's
happened to my sister

388
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,538
And her fiance started there.

389
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,146
So you think that's what
that pentagram was all about?

390
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,214
It's possible.

391
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,848
You know, satanism
isn't something that's

392
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:57,883
Practiced out in the open.

393
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:01,653
It's... especially
when there's animal

394
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,124
Or human sacrifice concerned.

395
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,527
Isn't that a bit far-fetched?

396
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,130
No more far-fetched
than, uh, tire

397
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,731
Tracks vanishing into thin air.

398
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,336
I mean, you yourself
said that people

399
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,637
Have disappeared in this area.

400
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,206
I mean, maybe it's because
they found something

401
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,207
They weren't supposed to find.

402
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:24,743
What do you want to do now?

403
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,717
I came here to find my sister,
and that's what I intend to do.

404
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:32,518
How?

405
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,589
Maybe we should
call the police.

406
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,958
Look, I got an idea.

407
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,361
Why don't you come
back to my place?

408
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,396
I mean, it's not much,
but you can get a hot bath

409
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:45,564
And get a good night's sleep.

410
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,099
You'll be able to think
more clearly tomorrow.

411
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,035
We can't do much here tonight.

412
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,636
- No, really, I can't.
- All right, listen.

413
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:51,670
You can take the bed.

414
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,804
I'll take the couch.

415
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,673
No, really, I can't.

416
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:58,044
You don't trust me.

417
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,046
All right, you've got a guest.

418
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,013
Great.

419
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,281
But I think we
should do one thing

420
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,250
Before I sleep in your bed.

421
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,051
What?

422
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:05,851
Introduce ourselves.

423
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,522
My name's Dan Allen.

424
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,758
Susan Russell.

425
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,194
I'll have your car
here by morning.

426
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:21,567
Well this ain't Caesar's Palace,
but it's, uh, it's comfortable.

427
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,269
Make yourself at home.

428
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,436
Can I make you a drink?

429
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,138
Oh, that'd be great.

430
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:26,938
Good.

431
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,440
Uh, bourbon OK?

432
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,541
Yeah, that, that's fine.

433
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,812
You're being awfully kind to me.

434
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,148
Why?

435
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,217
I guess I'm just a sucker
for pretty girls in distress.

436
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:47,326
Have you, um, lived
here all your life?

437
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,328
Practically.

438
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,964
I was born about
five miles from here.

439
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:53,765
Cheers.

440
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,105
All that's kind
of boring though.

441
00:33:59,205 --> 00:33:59,971
I'd rather hear about you.

442
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:09,081
Well, what is it that
you'd like to hear?

443
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,382
Well, to begin with,
how come you know

444
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,385
So much about this black magic?

445
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,787
I teach anthropology.

446
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,788
What?

447
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,989
Anthropology.

448
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,992
It's the study of man
and his various cultures.

449
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:24,096
Um, since the beginning
of time, man has studied

450
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,964
Some form of ritual magic.

451
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,500
That pentagram we saw?

452
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,104
It represents one of
the most extreme forms.

453
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:38,177
It's the belief
that Satan is God

454
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:42,414
And evil is the
highest form of good.

455
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:43,549
It's all very interesting.

456
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,418
You mind if I put on some music?

457
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,255
I'd really like
to take my bath.

458
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,055
Yeah, sure.

459
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:50,856
It's right in here.

460
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,026
This is it.

461
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,795
Uh, bathroom's right in there.

462
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:57,596
Thanks.

463
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,968
Sorry I don't have any
pajamas for you to wear.

464
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,170
That's OK.

465
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,970
I'll manage.

466
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,277
Well, good night.

467
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,179
Good night.

468
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,047
Uh, Susan?

469
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,083
You said something about
going to the police.

470
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,751
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea yet.

471
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:24,089
There's something about
that sheriff I don't trust.

472
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,525
Maybe you're right.

473
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,693
Good night.

474
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,494
Good night.

475
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,673
[Water running]

476
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,233
[Screaming]

477
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,142
Sheriff?

478
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:11,943
Morning.

479
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,111
What can I do for you?

480
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,813
I want to file a
missing person report.

481
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,147
Who's missing?

482
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,315
My sister and her fiance.

483
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,617
They were on the road to Baker.

484
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:23,855
How long?

485
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,223
Over 24 hours.

486
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,725
She called me from
some town out there.

487
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:37,368
24 hours, sister,
phone, from Kelso.

488
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,169
No, not Kelso.

489
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,505
It was another town.

490
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:40,506
Another town?

491
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:41,707
She said it wasn't on the map.

492
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:42,908
It was Elliv something.

493
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,243
The line went dead as
soon as she said the name.

494
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,746
Somewhere between
Highway 40 and 15.

495
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:56,087
You say it was between
Highway 40 and 15.

496
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,757
On the road to Baker.

497
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,626
Well, your sister's
right about one thing.

498
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,928
It isn't on the map.

499
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,663
Well, maybe it's too
small to be on the map,

500
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:05,997
But I know that it
has to be there.

501
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,065
Why?

502
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,900
Because my sister
phoned me from there.

503
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,701
Excuse me, Sheriff.

504
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,236
Telephone call for you.

505
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,037
OK, Miss Russell.

506
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,438
I'll get to it in a minute.

507
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,774
The operator said that she had
no listing for any such town.

508
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:19,044
Look, Miss Russell, it's
very easy to get mixed up

509
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,912
Out there, especially at night.

510
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,147
Did it ever occur
to you your sister

511
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,582
Could have been mistaken?

512
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,751
Yeah, until I found her car.

513
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,654
It was in a canyon, and there
was a hole in the gas tank.

514
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,321
I think someone
deliberately led them there.

515
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,489
Go on.

516
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,258
I followed the tire
tracks back about a mile.

517
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,059
And?

518
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,060
They just stopped.

519
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,427
What do you mean,
uh, they stopped?

520
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:37,529
They just disappear.

521
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,130
I think someone
deliberately destroyed

522
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,668
Them so that no one could
follow them back to that town.

523
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:46,104
Well, here we are back
to that mysterious town.

524
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,239
Look, my sister could
be in serious trouble.

525
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,808
I found a pentagram
burnt into the ground

526
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:52,310
Near that canyon in blood.

527
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,111
Pentagram.

528
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,113
Do you know what that means?

529
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,682
Yeah, I know what it means.

530
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:57,482
Nothing.

531
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,316
Nothing.

532
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,417
- Did you find a body?
- No.

533
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,485
Well, then there's
nothing I can

534
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,688
Do, not for another
24 hours anyway,

535
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,724
Until they are officially
considered missing.

536
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,559
Now, if they don't
show up by tomorrow...

537
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:10,896
Well, they could
be dead by then.

538
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:15,867
Well, where can I reach you in
case something does turn up?

539
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,335
The devil's playground.

540
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,045
SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

541
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,814
DAN (VOICEOVER): There's
something about that sheriff

542
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:29,981
I don't trust.

543
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,316
SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

544
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,450
DAN (VOICEOVER): There's

something about that sheriff.

548
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:36,554
SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
Nothing I can do.

549
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:37,188

550
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:37,823

551
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:38,790

552
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,305

553
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:50,675
God damn it.

554
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,971
Get up front,
I'll slow her down.

555
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,429
Hey lady, you're
starting to piss me off.

556
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,360
God damn it.

557
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,362
It's so I can't even see.

558
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:35,340
Pull over, you punk.

559
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,341
Oh, shit!

560
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,267
Right there, that's
where they went off.

561
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:08,906
It's gone.

562
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,241
They must have taken it away.

563
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,280
Well, something went
off here all right.

564
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:19,784
You stay here.

565
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:20,818
I'll go down and check it out.

566
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,402
There's blood down
here, all right.

567
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,437
Could be an animal's,
I don't know.

568
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,238

569
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:45,876

570
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,248

me to do about it?

571
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,084

572
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,785
I want you to go
after those bastards.

573
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,586
[Sigh]

574
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:56,621
Well, who are they?

575
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,755
I don't know.

576
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,258
I saw them pass the gas
station the other day.

577
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,560
What difference does
that make, anyway?

578
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,028
It makes all the
difference in the world

579
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,197
Because if you don't know who
they are, who the hell am I

580
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,932
Supposed to go after?

581
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,134
Look.

582
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:10,868
If you just follow the
tracks, I'm sure that they

583
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:11,969
Came from that town.

584
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,471
Look, Miss Russell,
with all due respect,

585
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,306
What you know about dune
buggies don't amount

586
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,841
To a pitcher of warm spit.

587
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,477
I mean, they could be
anywhere out there.

588
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,746
I'm not about to go
chasing after them, tracks

589
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:24,515
Or no tracks, not in that.

590
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,050
And as far as another
town is concerned,

591
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,285
It's like I told you before.

592
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,586
It isn't on the map.

593
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:31,322
If you just follow the road,
you'll see where it goes.

594
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,424
I know where it goes.

595
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,460
Nowhere.

596
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,094
Just like every other
road in this desert,

597
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,964
Mile after empty mile,
point blank into oblivion,

598
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:41,932
And that's it.

599
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,033
So then you won't do it.

600
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:43,868
No, ma'am.

601
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:44,702
Well then...

602
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,371
I guess that's a waste of time.

603
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,905
I'll follow it myself.

604
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,807
Look, I can't tell you,
tell you what to do.

605
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:50,608
I can't tell you...

606
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,876
That's right, you can't.

607
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,312
No, but I can give you
some friendly advice.

608
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,447
Why don't you go home before
you get yourself into trouble?

609
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:57,648
Huh?

610
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,217
I can't wait that long,
and neither can my sister.

611
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,404
Miss Russell?

612
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,973
I just want you to know that
I'm going to do everything

613
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,175
I can to help find your sister.

614
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,310
And I admire your spunk.

615
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,479
I just think it's a damn
stupid idea to go back

616
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,913
Out there, especially alone.

617
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:03,748
I get your point.

618
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,191
Susan, why don't you
go home, get some rest,

619
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,494
And let me handle this?

620
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,329
Do that for me?

621
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:19,830
OK?

622
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,332

It is his intent
that you be here.

638

You've done with my

639

sacrificed themselves to Satan.

Yeah, I'm out on past

736
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,909
So if you need me,
I'll be out here.

737
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:20,910

01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,483
[Crying]

748
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:52,488
I found the town.
[talking while crying]

749
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:55,091
I've got to get to the
police before they get away.

750
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:56,192
Now hold on.
Hold on.

751
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:56,993
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

752
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,197
Take this.

753
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:01,998
Take this.

754
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:07,403
[Cough]

755
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:11,774
Son of a bitch.

756
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:15,478
I'm sorry.

757
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:16,645
You just had me nervous.

758
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:19,082
Why did you leave
without telling me?

759
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:23,319
I... I had this nightmare.

760
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,654
I dreamed that you were
a disciple of Satan,

761
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:30,326
That you had the number
666 tattooed on your wrist.

762
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:31,127
666?

763
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:36,232
The mark of the beast.

764
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,368
A satanic symbol of evil.

765
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,270
Susan, Susan.

766
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,409
It was just a dream, nightmare.

767
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:55,618
The night Sandy died,
I had a nightmare.

768
01:20:55,718 --> 01:21:00,523
Now that I think about it,
it's more like a premonition.

769
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:04,693
Guess that was why
I was so frightened

770
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,730
The night... the night that I
had the nightmare about you.

771
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:08,764
Don't worry about it.

772
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,765
Forget it, forget it.

773
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,734
Come on.

774
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:13,202
Come on, let's go.

775
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:37,560
This whole thing
has been a nightmare.

776
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,527
It'll be over soon.

777
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,511
Did anyone else know you
were coming back out here?

778
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:56,712
Why?

779
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:58,547
I'm just curious.

780
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:02,185
I phoned, the, um, sheriff's
office yesterday evening.

781
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,052
What?

782
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:04,387
Yeah.

783
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:08,391
If, they, uh, don't hear from
me they're to talk to you.

784
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:10,793
Why me?

785
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,261
Why not?

786
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,632
You're one of 'em.

787
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,367
Sue, you've been out
in the sun too long.

788
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,669
You don't know what
you're talking about.

789
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,371
I know that wasn't a
nightmare I had about you.

790
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:25,341
It was a premonition, just
like I had about Sandy.

791
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,776
Only the 666 wasn't
on your wrist.

792
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:30,846
It was on the back of your neck.

793
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,015
Susan, I tried to
warn you to stay

794
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:33,216
Out of the devil's playground.

795
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:35,584
We could have had something.

796
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,253
We could have had
something special.

797
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:40,723
But no, you wouldn't
listen to me.

798
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:44,660
Now you leave me no choice.

799
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,130

800
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:49,598

[Yelling]

803
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:55,538
Oh!

804
01:23:04,547 --> 01:23:33,809
[Explosion]

805
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,479
Susan!

806
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:37,280
Susan!

807
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:01,104
Susan!

808
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:04,573
Susan!

809
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:12,981
Susan!

810
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:24,393
Susan!

811
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:25,894
Stay away from me?

812
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,863
The hell's the matter with you?

813
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:28,864
You're one of them!

814
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:29,698
That's not true.

815
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:30,833
Now, listen, Susan.

816
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:32,000
Your sister wasn't the
only one to disappear.

817
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:33,302
There were others too.

818
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,938
And I've known for... or I've
suspected for a long time

819
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:38,441
There, there was a cult behind
it and that Dan was one of 'em,

820
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,508
But I couldn't prove it.

821
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:40,343
Not until now.

822
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:43,379
But I know now, and it's OK now.

823
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:44,413
Give me your hand.

824
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:45,614
Keep away from me.

825
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:46,482
[Screaming]

826
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:54,890
Come on.

827
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:57,593
Jesus Christ.

828
01:24:57,693 --> 01:24:59,195
Are you all right?

829
01:24:59,295 --> 01:24:59,995
Huh?

830
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:14,109
It's OK.

831
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:20,983
Come on.

832
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,085
Let's get home.

833
01:25:23,186 --> 01:25:26,389
