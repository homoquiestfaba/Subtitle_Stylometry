1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,277
(singing in foreign language)

2
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,159
(choir singing)

3
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,670
(speaking Latin)

4
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,272
(choir continues)

5
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,845
(speaking Latin)

6
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,090
(speaking Latin)

7
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,661
(choir continues)

8
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,261
Partition.

9
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,329
Now that the British are leaving

10
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,331
India, the subcontinent will be

11
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,967
divided into two countries--

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,269
India, where the Hindus are

13
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,272
majority, and East and West

14
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,608
Pakistan, where Muslims will be

15
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,943
the rulers.

16
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,678
Yes, Sunita?

17
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,846
Is this something the British

18
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,848
want, or do we Indians want it?

19
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,950
Oh...

20
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,585
Opinions are divided on all

21
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,919
sides.

22
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,588
Mahatma Gandhi is against

23
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,390
partition, but many people who

24
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,592
follow him are all for it.

25
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,927
They believe that Hindus and

26
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,262
Muslims cannot live together

27
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,398
in free country.

28
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,632
Alice?

29
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,566
What do you think,

30
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,702
Sister Teresa?

31
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,804
There was a reason God asked

32
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,839
me to join his church.

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,574
He knows I have no head

34
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,842
for politics.

35
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,710
(laughter, bell rings)

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,412
Oh, 4:00, girls.

37
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,713
That's all for today.

38
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,915
We'll be late for Vespers.

39
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,453
What do you mean there is

40
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,654
no food?

41
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,822
Headmistress, we haven't had

42
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,191
any deliveries for two weeks.

43
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,927
Hadi, there is nothing

44
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,396
to cook, at all?

45
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,397
No.

46
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,698
But we have 200 girls

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,733
to feed.

48
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,834
There are riots in the

49
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,902
street, ma'am.

50
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,303
No one can go out.

51
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,704
This is not a safe area for us

52
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,639
to live in.

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,640
It's right in between the Hindus

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,607
and the Muslims.

55
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,577
Sister Gabriella...

56
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,645
if the mountain don't come

57
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,746
to Mohammed...

58
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,882
Mr. Pradesh's warehouse

59
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,717
should be down here.

60
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,319
This is it.

61
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,992
Hello? Hello?

62
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,527
Mr. Pradesh!

63
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,695
Hello?

64
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,498
(crowd shouting)

65
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh!

66
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,305
(gasps)

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,541
(child cries)

68
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,779
What brings two nuns out of

69
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,481
cloisters at a time like this?

70
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,482
An emergency.

71
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,749
We are from Loreto Convent,

72
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,618
with 200 hungry girls to feed

73
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,552
and no food.

74
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,553
Well, there's only meat for

75
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,454
vultures out here.

76
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,956
No, I can't let those girls

77
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,923
go hungry.

78
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,758
Oh, come on, then. Douglas!

79
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,060
I'm sure they won't miss a bag

80
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,395
or two.

81
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,798
(crowd continues shouting)

82
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,103
On board, ladies, on board.

83
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,638
Ah!

84
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,675
This should keep your little

85
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,711
lot fed till this mess is over.

86
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,379
Are we stealing this?

87
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,447
Requisition is the word.

88
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,548
I'm sure your credit's good,

89
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,482
Sister.

90
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,051
Come on, lad.

91
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,486
Come on!

92
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,862
When you see what we had these

93
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,830
last few days, you'll say to

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,898
yourself, "We've given them

95
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,065
everything we can,

96
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,066
so let 'em have their blasted

97
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,701
independence."

98
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,870
(car horn honking)

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,405
Get off!

100
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,107
Back off, make way!

101
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,075
(crowd continues shouting)

102
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,577
Get back!

103
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,578
Get off!

104
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,313
Get out of the way!

105
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,117
Please, Sahib, help us!

106
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,152
Please help, Sahib!

107
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,922
Rice for me and for my child!

108
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,690
Pay no attention, Sister.

109
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,691
The war has caused these people

110
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,725
to be put through the worst

111
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,893
famine in Indian history.

112
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,961
They've been starving ever

113
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,129
since.

114
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,430
Get off!

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,731
Ride, man, ride!

116
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,334
(crowd continues shouting)

117
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,674
Go, go, go!

118
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,675
You're gonna get yourselves

119
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,376
killed!

120
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,982
Come on, Douglas, open the gate.

121
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,820
Now, move it! Go!

122
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,964
What's going on?

123
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,765
Mother, we have food.

124
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,666
We have food!

125
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,834
Oh, glory be to God!

126
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,869
Cook! Food!

127
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,472
(crowd shouting)

128
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,018
(girls screaming)

129
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,756
(gasps)

130
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,392
Ashad!

131
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,961
To infirmary.

132
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,230
Yes, yes, Sister.

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,765
He's bleeding-- I don't know

134
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,701
how to help.

135
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,803
Oh, Lord.

136
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,906
Right.

137
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,575
Put pressure on his wounds.

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,011
He's lost a lot of blood.

139
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,545
No, no.

140
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,813
You must keep up the pressure.

141
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,949
We've got to stop the bleeding.

142
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,684
Can you do it?

143
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,752
Sister, I am geography

144
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,120
teacher.

145
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,791
(sighs)

146
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,966
Sister Teresa,

147
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,201
I thought I'd find you here.

148
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,504
May I speak with you?

149
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,642
Sister Gabriella told me how

150
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,044
distressing it was to go

151
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,846
outside.

152
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,114
I'm so ashamed.

153
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,282
Ashamed?

154
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
But you went out for a good

155
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,085
reason.

156
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,687
I saw the starving children

157
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,855
of God out there, Father.

158
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,657
I did nothing to help.

159
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,925
You were bringing food for

160
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,094
our girls.

161
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,095
There were girls out there

162
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,197
too, Father.

163
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,899
Hungrier than ours.

164
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,600
But our first duty is to our

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,636
school and our convent, Sister,

166
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,838
surely.

167
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,807
How can that be?

168
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,575
How can God wish me to be

169
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,743
concerned only about the girls

170
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,211
in here?

171
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,846
Surely, he cares as much about

172
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,947
the people living outside

173
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,683
these walls?

174
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,918
We're all under strain

175
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,220
right now, Sister.

176
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,022
I spoke with Mother Superior.

177
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,623
We both feel you should go on

178
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,258
retreat sooner than planned.

179
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,127
You need time to think things

180
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,228
through--

181
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,330
to rediscover the joy

182
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,599
in your work.

183
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,604
Father Verru was right.

184
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,972
But I could not forget what I

185
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,741
had seen outside.

186
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,576
And I knew I had to do something

187
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,844
to make life better for the

188
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,946
poor.

189
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,748
Mary can't sleep, Sister.

190
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,715
She says she's having

191
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,617
nightmares.

192
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,652
Mary, Mary.

193
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,189
Hey.

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,095
When I was nine years old,

195
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,998
my father died.

196
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,100
In my own country, Albania,

197
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,603
where I was born, there was a

198
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,738
lot of political strife.

199
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,007
For many years, I couldn't

200
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,343
understand what happened,

201
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,980
why my father didn't come home.

202
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,681
And I used to recite a poem to

203
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,284
myself over and over.

204
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,091
"His red heart beat with love

205
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,761
for child, wife, and country,

206
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,764
and then burst into bloom,

207
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:29,002
like crimson rose dropped

208
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,839
on crumpled shirt."

209
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,275
This poem is about believing in

210
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,711
love, Mary, even when everything

211
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,780
you see around you is hatred

212
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,982
and destruction.

213
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,884
To bed.

214
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,323
Mary?

215
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,392
Tomorrow, I think you have a

216
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,761
poem to write,

217
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,962
just like I did when I was

218
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,363
nine years old and when

219
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,199
my father died.

220
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,137
Goodnight, girls, God bless you.

221
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,307
(girls) Goodnight, Sister.

222
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,143
Sister?

223
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,278
I-- some of the older girls,

224
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,847
they say we shouldn't take care

225
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,015
of the injured Muslims.

226
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,183
They say they are to blame for

227
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,219
the violence.

228
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,253
We take in whoever needs

229
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,188
our help, Maria.

230
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,357
Hindus, Muslims-- makes no

231
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,259
difference to God.

232
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,767
(train whistle blowing)

233
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,703
Darjeeling!

234
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,439
Darjeeling train, all aboard!

235
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,942
All aboard, Darjeeling train!

236
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,911
All aboard!

237
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,982
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty,

238
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,950
I'm thirsty.

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,288
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty.

240
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,091
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, ma'am.

241
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty,

242
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,862
I'm thirsty, ma'am.

243
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,764
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty--

244
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,366
Sister Teresa, come on,

245
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,035
we're leaving.

246
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,804
Thirsty, I'm thirsty.

247
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,973
I'm thirsty.

248
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,875
(groans)

249
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,681
I'm thirsty, ma'am, I'm thirsty.

250
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,251
Please, Sister.

251
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,186
I'm thirsty.

252
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,023
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty.

253
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,064
(train whistle blowing)

254
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,240
So, what can I bring you

255
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,875
today, sir?

256
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,418
(sighs)

257
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,786
Look at it.

258
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,821
Breathtaking, isn't it?

259
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,989
I so look forward to these

260
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,857
retreats.

261
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,292
I can almost taste the mountain

262
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,394
spring water right now.

263
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,431
It's so fresh-- and the fruit!

264
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,199
It always tastes much better

265
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,901
up there.

266
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,108
(flute playing)

267
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,911
(train whistle blowing)

268
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,317
(overlapping chatter)

269
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,156
The more time I spent

270
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,392
outside, the more I became aware

271
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,927
of the privileges that were

272
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,528
being granted to me

273
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,364
but denied to others.

274
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,598
Why?

275
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,166
Why should I be treated any

276
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,534
differently?

277
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,470
We are all children of God.

278
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,374
Sister?

279
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,308
Come-- your friend, come.

280
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,376
What-- what is it?

281
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,244
She's gone into third class.

282
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,420
(gasps) Sister Teresa!

283
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,489
What on Earth are you doing?

284
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,961
It's another world, isn't it?

285
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,863
It's completely unacceptable

286
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,297
behavior.

287
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,800
I mean, what will people think?

288
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,304
I wish I had time to find

289
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,973
out.

290
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,016
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty.

291
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,552
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty,

292
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,288
thirsty, I'm thirsty...

293
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,132
Welcome back.

294
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,168
I understand you were very quiet

295
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,271
on retreat, very withdrawn.

296
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,405
I'm sorry, Father.

297
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,473
Oh, it's not to apologize

298
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,974
for.

299
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,376
I understand you were deep in

300
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,644
your thoughts.

301
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,579
And you do seem more rested.

302
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,314
Yes, Father.

303
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,650
I am resolved.

304
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,285
In fact, God himself told me

305
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,920
what I must do.

306
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,089
God lets us know him by our

307
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,090
own feelings.

308
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,691
He spoke to me.

309
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,093
He spoke to me through the voice

310
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,094
of a sick beggar.

311
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:21,961
Sister--

312
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,029
I heard him clearly.

313
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:23,963
Sister, you realize

314
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,664
what you're--

315
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,432
He said, "I am thirsty,"

316
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,366
Father.

317
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,135
You think you heard the voice

318
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,436
of God?

319
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,271
Same way I heard him when he

320
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,473
called me to his church, even

321
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,709
though I was too young, only 13.

322
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,378
Now, he has called me again.

323
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,513
He wants me to follow him

324
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,515
into the slums, to help the

325
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,217
poorest of the poor.

326
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,485
But you're a cloistered nun,

327
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,019
you can't go outside.

328
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,722
Father, it is a call.

329
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,991
It's a call within the call.

330
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,961
Do you remember what Mahatma

331
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,062
Gandhi told the Christians in

332
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,396
India?

333
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,266
He said, "If you want to help,

334
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,402
go to the people as one of them.

335
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,037
Work among them."

336
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,639
How can we do that from behind

337
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,040
these gated walls?

338
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,242
You no longer want to be

339
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,209
a nun?

340
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,410
Heaven forbid, Father,

341
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,247
the church is my life.

342
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,648
No, I only want permission

343
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,283
to work outside.

344
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,592
I've heard of nuns suffering

345
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,261
delusions as a result of heat

346
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,031
stroke, but this takes the cake.

347
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,199
We've all been affected by

348
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,567
the troubles.

349
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,035
And it could be that Sister

350
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,237
Teresa is struggling to reaffirm

351
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,572
her faith.

352
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,541
But she believes God has called

353
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,776
her to follow him into the slum.

354
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,378
Well?

355
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,346
I believe that Sister Teresa

356
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,315
is sincere.

357
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,083
She just hasn't considered

358
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,285
the implications.

359
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,486
Which are?

360
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,021
It'll upset the entire

361
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,056
convent if a nun of Sister

362
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,591
Teresa's experience gives up

363
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,159
everything and leaves.

364
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,360
She wants to apply for

365
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,063
exclaustration, Mother Superior.

366
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,264
This would allow her to remain

367
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,799
in the Loreto Order and live

368
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,467
by her vows.

369
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,303
All she's asking for is

370
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,504
permission to work outside

371
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,438
the walls.

372
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,507
That's the other problem.

373
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,642
The Loreto Order has always

374
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,277
been cloistered.

375
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,745
And now a nun comes along and

376
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,782
says she heard the voice of God,

377
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,717
in a tunnel!

378
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,285
But she makes a compelling

379
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,687
argument.

380
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,754
She says that in the face of

381
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,690
every suffering man, woman

382
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,226
and child in India, we can find

383
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,228
the face of Jesus Christ.

384
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,363
She calls it God's distressing

385
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,364
disguise.

386
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,832
Heaven forbid one of the

387
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,201
children hears that the

388
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,338
headmistress is hearing voices

389
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,606
and seeing visions.

390
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,707
I think it's clear this

391
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,208
matter should remain strictly

392
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,176
confidential.

393
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,477
Of course, but what are we

394
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,412
to tell Sister Teresa?

395
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,447
Tell her nothing.

396
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,581
But Your Grace--

397
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,682
This isn't the first time

398
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,251
a nun has asked for permission

399
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,753
to leave the cloister.

400
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,755
Last time, I advised the

401
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,291
applicant to wait a year.

402
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,660
12 months later, she sat in that

403
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,696
chair and thanked me for not

404
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,632
taking her request seriously.

405
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,834
Sister Teresa, Your Grace,

406
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,169
she's never not serious.

407
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,437
Tell her to write a letter to

408
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,574
me in a year's time.

409
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,476
Until then,

410
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,412
this matter is closed.

411
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,814
♪♪

412
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,822
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty,

00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,191
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty,

Commissioner?

417
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,722
Harry Harper.

418
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,890
We met the other night at the

419
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,525
reception at Governor House.

420
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,427
Ah, yes, yes.

421
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,628
The American journalist

422
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,662
hungry for a face-to-face

423
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,630
with Mr. Gandhi.

424
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,498
Yes, well, I'd like to report

425
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,933
on India's transition to

426
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,802
independence fairly.

427
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,170
People need to hear about

428
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,338
official ceremonies like this,

429
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,639
but they also need to hear about

430
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,240
Gandhi's presence in Calcutta

431
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,575
to protest the violence.

432
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,444
(people applauding)

433
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,611
Do you really care about the

434
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,880
Muslims and Hindus, Mr. Harper?

435
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,583
Absolutely.

436
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,251
(chuckles)

437
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,654
(trumpet calling)

438
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,502
(band playing)

439
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,861
(applause)

440
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,299
Now, the year is finished.

441
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,734
The Archbishop has agreed to

442
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,269
forward your letter to Rome,

443
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,605
but only under one condition--

444
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,707
that you apply for a decree of

445
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,276
secularization.

446
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,677
But that means I would have

447
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,712
to leave the order.

448
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,480
It's the only way he will

449
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,482
consider your request.

450
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,484
If you leave, you leave as a

451
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,387
laywoman, not as a nun.

452
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,356
But... I've lived as a nun

453
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,857
for 17 years, I can't live

454
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,326
any other way.

455
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,394
Then you must give up the

456
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,262
idea.

457
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,297
I can't leave Loreto.

458
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,866
Hello, there, Sister.

459
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,668
This is my family.

460
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,670
It's too much of a risk.

461
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,439
If your plan doesn't work out,

462
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,740
you won't be able to come back

463
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,542
here.

464
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,913
It's God's plan, Father,

465
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,715
not mine.

466
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,951
I will rewrite the letter.

467
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,055
A sad day, isn't it?

468
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
No, not really.

469
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,858
It was good while it lasted.

470
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,496
So...

471
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,831
you going back to England soon?

472
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,332
No, not me, sir.

473
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,467
I lost my wife and kids

474
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,968
in the Blitz.

475
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,870
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

476
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,005
Well, I've got my pension.

477
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,307
I might get around to opening up

478
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,842
a little hotel, gentlemen's

479
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,876
club, that sort of thing.

480
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,344
Uh-huh.

481
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,413
Your first time in India?

482
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,749
No, I was, um, born here

483
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,783
actually.

484
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,419
My parents moved to the States

485
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,520
and settled there when I was

486
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,721
a kid.

487
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,722
Oh, you work for the

488
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,857
International Chronicle?

489
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,091
Yep.

490
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,426
And I have a feeling things

491
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,460
aren't gonna stay quiet around

492
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,862
here for very long.

493
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,896
You let me know if anything

494
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,431
interesting happens in Calcutta?

495
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,999
Right you are, sir.

496
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,501
(laughing)

497
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,870
(overlapping chatter)

498
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,607
Sister? Sister?

499
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,975
You see that street?

500
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,476
The families we visit during

501
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,745
our Sodality outings live there.

502
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,813
Would it be all right if we

503
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,047
looked in on them?

504
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,048
Oh, please?

505
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,650
Then they can meet you.

506
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,051
Well, if we all stick

507
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,820
together, I suppose it'll be

508
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,821
all right.

509
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,855
You must not take more than

510
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,923
half an hour.

511
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,458
They will be worried at Loreto.

512
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,026
All right, girls.

513
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,428
Stick together.

514
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,831
(overlapping chatter)

515
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,453
(gasps)

516
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,030
This woman must be taken

517
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,932
to hospital.

518
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,143
What's wrong with you?

519
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,145
She's dying.

520
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,414
She needs care.

521
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,920
(flies buzzing)

522
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,959
(speaking foreign language)

523
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,928
It's all right.

524
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,797
We will help you.

525
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,168
Our hospitals are so crowded,

526
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,870
we just don't have any space.

527
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,005
It would be a waste to use

528
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,773
valuable resources on a hopeless

529
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,908
case.

530
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,142
But she's a person.

531
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,712
We can't do a thing for her.

532
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,013
Like anyone else, she's one

533
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,181
of God's children.

534
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,883
I understand your feeling,

535
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,184
Sister, but we just can't

536
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,486
take her.

537
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,887
What are we to do with her?

538
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,089
Try another hospital,

539
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,724
I don't know!

540
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,195
I want my cart back.

541
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,730
But they won't take her.

542
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,965
That's not my problem!

543
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,801
(thunder cracking)

544
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,937
Sister, take the girls

545
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,005
back to Loreto.

546
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,940
But what will you do?

547
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,675
I don't know.

548
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,611
Come on, girls, single file.

549
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,979
You come with me.

550
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,748
I take care of you.

551
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,982
Come on.

552
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,084
(woman groaning)

553
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,760
You have to leave.

554
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,095
You're blocking the entryway.

555
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,633
Don't worry now.

556
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,238
All right, Ma?

557
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,206
(rain falling)

558
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,911
Sister, the doctors have

559
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,014
agreed to take her in.

560
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,716
Bless you.

561
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,054
Ma...

562
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,255
You are doing a beautiful thing

563
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,190
for God.

564
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,631
(thunder roaring)

565
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,001
My mother always said if you do

566
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,736
something good, do it without

567
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,538
big fuss.

568
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,543
Suddenly, I realized I was lost.

569
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,644
Lost in the back streets of

570
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,145
Calcutta.

571
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,313
Give me money.

572
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,748
Money, rupees for food.

573
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,683
I don't have anything.

574
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,951
No money.

575
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,119
Why you in such a hurry?

576
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,786
No.

577
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,021
What are you hiding from us?

578
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,622
No, no.

579
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,825
Give me money. Money!

580
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,227
Money!

581
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,130
Can somebody help me?

582
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,765
Please, can...

583
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,300
(gasps)

584
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,701
Hari!

585
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,203
Are you all right, Sister?

586
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:04,870
Oh, yes.

587
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,672
I didn't realize the outside

588
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,208
world could be so confusing.

589
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,176
You are very lucky, Sister,

590
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,277
in this neighborhood.

591
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,179
No, Hari.

592
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,082
They're just very poor.

593
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,785
I must get used to that.

594
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,187
(organ playing)

595
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,758
I have the reply to your

596
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:26,625
letter.

597
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,893
(gasps)

598
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,161
If you like, I'll tear it up

599
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,231
unread.

600
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,199
If they've granted your request,

601
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,101
this may be your last mass

602
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,936
as a nun.

603
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,741
Let me pray first, Father.

604
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,557
Whatever God has decided for me.

605
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,832
Oh.

606
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,700
Oh!

607
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,837
It is manifestly God's will.

608
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,138
You've been granted the decree

609
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,840
of exclaustration for a trial

610
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,809
period of one year.

611
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,277
You can leave Loreto as a nun

612
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,180
and remain in our order.

613
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,048
How did this happen?

614
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,850
I changed your request to

615
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,919
secularization.

616
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,187
It's as if...

617
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,988
God knows what he wants.

618
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,023
Yes!

619
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,057
He knows.

620
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,826
Yes!

621
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,198
My friend Mr. Pillay has

622
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,233
about the best saris.

623
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,868
This is pure silk,

624
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,369
worthy of a princess.

625
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,104
The thread is real gold.

626
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,840
Cotton, Hari.

627
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,843
I asked for a cheap cotton sari.

628
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,678
I told him, but he said it's

629
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,413
not fit for a European.

630
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:58,350
Ah, how 'bout this, Sister?

631
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,152
The cloth flows like wine.

632
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,386
And probably costs the same

633
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,454
too.

634
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,724
Ah... what about this one?

635
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,025
That one?

636
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,260
That one he gave me very

637
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,761
reluctantly.

638
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,231
It cost just a few rupees.

639
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,066
This is the one.

640
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,937
May the Father, Son, and Holy

641
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,939
Ghost bless this habit and

642
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,474
enable you to be faithful to

643
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,876
your commitment for the rest of

644
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:24,943
your life.

645
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,944
In the name of the Father,

646
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,479
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

647
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,147
Amen.

648
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,452
His Grace, the Archbishop,

649
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,853
would like you to keep a record

650
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,755
of your activities.

651
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,056
With all you hope to do for the

652
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,358
poor in Calcutta, you'll need

653
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,393
help of all kinds.

654
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,394
Are you planning to meet

655
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,495
with the governor?

656
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,030
Oh, no, I won't do that.

657
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,299
Then where will you begin?

658
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,367
All I know is I must leave

659
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,067
Loreto.

660
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,937
After that, God will direct me.

661
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,039
(bells tolling)

662
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,949
After dreaming of this day for

663
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,151
two years, leaving Loreto

664
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,452
Convent was the most difficult

665
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,188
thing I had ever done--

666
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,490
much more difficult than leaving

667
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,759
my family.

668
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,527
It was only my firm belief in

669
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,329
God's plan that gave me the

670
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,497
courage to give up everything

671
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,433
once again.

672
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,302
He would not let me down.

673
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,784
(overlapping chatter)

674
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,328
(bell ringing)

675
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,367
Mommy?

676
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,535
You should go around

677
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,469
the back.

678
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,804
I will ask my cook to give you

679
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,305
something to eat.

680
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,408
I-- I'm looking for Mr. Goma.

681
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,543
Father Verru wrote to him

682
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,410
about me.

683
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,079
I am Sister Teresa from

684
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:07,946
Loreto Convent.

685
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,848
(sighs)

686
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,318
I'm so pleased!

687
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,821
Forgive me, I was expecting

688
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,888
a nun.

689
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,357
Please come, Sister.

690
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,925
My husband is waiting.

691
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,426
Oh, thank you for your

692
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,295
generosity.

693
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,496
And the church wants you to

694
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,832
work in a place like Moti Jihl?

695
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,967
That's a huge risk, isn't it?

696
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,268
Something I do willingly,

697
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,204
Mr. Goma.

698
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,905
Father thought, as a member of

699
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,874
his parish, perhaps you could

700
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,509
suggest a place for me to stay

701
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,078
not too far from Moti Jihl.

702
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,114
As you can see, my own home

703
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,248
is a humble place,

704
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,317
and I have a large family.

705
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,285
I'll have to think if, uh--

706
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,554
Daddy, the two rooms upstairs

707
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,890
are empty, and the attic.

708
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,426
(clears throat)

709
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,194
I suppose they are.

710
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,529
But I doubt Sister will find

711
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,231
them comfortable or--

712
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,465
The simplest of rooms would

713
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,000
be perfect.

714
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,235
I won't be in the way.

715
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,503
I will be gone all day, only

716
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,538
need a place to sleep at night.

717
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,118
We have plenty of spare

718
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,286
furniture.

719
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,954
If you need anything, you can

720
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,489
just ask, Sister.

721
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,925
Thank you, you're very kind.

722
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,163
♪♪

723
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,145
Mr. Goma.

724
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,313
Oh, we have more chairs and

725
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,915
tables you can borrow, Sister.

726
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,950
The fewer possessions I have,

727
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,186
the better.

728
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,496
Nothing should distract me...

729
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,965
from my work for the poor.

730
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,909
(overlapping chatter)

731
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,554
Sister, Sister, money!

732
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,422
Hello.

733
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,224
Sister, money.

734
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,493
Money! Money! Money!

735
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,161
Sister!

736
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,396
Sister, money!

737
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,999
(kids continue begging)

738
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,440
I have no money.

739
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,976
No, I have-- I have no money!

740
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,978
My lunch!

741
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,380
(kids chattering)

742
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,389
My name is Sister Teresa.

743
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,557
I'm a daughter of the Christian

744
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,725
Church.

745
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,660
I have come to Moti Jihl

746
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,696
to work with you.

747
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,032
To try to improve your lives.

748
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,236
But I need your help.

749
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,071
I can't give you clothes,

750
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,406
or food or money.

751
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,543
I am as poor as you.

752
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:27,012
But I can teach your children

753
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,514
how to read.

754
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,716
(woman screaming)

755
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,625
(flies buzzing)

756
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,727
(screaming continues)

757
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,400
(gasps) What are you doing?

758
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,037
Leave her alone!

759
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,705
(baby crying)

760
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,080
(man singing in distance)

761
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,149
When I was a little girl in

762
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,151
Skopia, Mother used to take me

763
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,386
to visit the poor.

764
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,088
She taught us that it is our

765
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,656
responsibility to help the less

766
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,458
fortunate.

767
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,826
Sometimes we would come to the

768
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,095
dinner table and find total

769
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,496
strangers sitting down to share

770
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,498
our meals.

771
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,499
"Who are these people?"

772
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,467
we would ask.

773
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,468
She would say, "Distant

774
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,070
kinsmen."

775
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,504
But they were beggars and

776
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,173
destitutes that my dear mama

777
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,609
had brought in.

778
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,478
But never did I see such poverty

779
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,746
and suffering there

780
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,650
as I see here.

781
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,253
(overlapping chatter)

782
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,267
Come!

783
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,506
You want to eat my lunch again?

784
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,208
Oh!

785
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,349
Do you like to hear stories?

786
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,118
I have a wonderful story

787
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,119
I will tell you.

788
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,355
Sit down.

789
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,659
Once, a long time ago--

790
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,694
I'm going to tell a story.

791
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,229
A long, long time ago,

792
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,631
there lived a handsome prince

793
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,367
called Rama, and his beautiful

794
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,836
wife called Sita.

795
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,638
They lived in a big, beautiful

796
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,641
palace in a beautiful country,

797
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,678
but that was ruled by a very

798
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,646
nasty king...

799
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,448
And the king was slain by the

800
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,250
brave prince, who rescued his

801
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,818
princess, and they lived

802
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,354
happily ever after.

803
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,488
Another one!

804
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,489
Tell us another one!

805
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,590
You like stories?

806
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,625
Yes!

807
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,626
You like stories?

808
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,827
(children) Yes!

809
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,330
You know, you can tell

810
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,532
stories like that to each other.

811
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,766
We don't know any.

812
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,601
But you can read them.

813
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,271
From books, you can read any

814
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,739
story you want.

815
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,507
We can't read.

816
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,210
Ohh.

817
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,346
Let me test you.

818
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,282
Let's all together say the word

819
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,283
"king."

820
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,217
(children) King.

821
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,318
Now, I show you how

822
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,886
to write it.

823
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,825
Kh-- everyone, "kh."

824
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:27,759
(children repeat)

825
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,828
Then, "ih."

826
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:30,862
(children repeat)

827
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,598
Then, "nnn."

828
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,201
(children repeat)

829
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,770
Then, "guh."

830
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,871
(children repeat)

831
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,474
And all together, that is...

832
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,209
"Kh-ih-nnn-guh."

833
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,310
(children) King!

834
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,878
You see!

835
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,580
You have just learned to read

836
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,215
your first word!

837
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:50,949
(gasps)

838
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,517
Yay, we did it!

839
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,586
(all clapping)

840
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,822
"A."

841
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,691
"N."

842
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,829
"E." "N."

843
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,764
(children repeating)

844
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,333
"N," "N," "N."

845
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,768
"I."

846
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,236
(children repeat)

847
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,539
"N." E."

848
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,707
(children repeat)

849
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,442
Charu?

850
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,544
"U." "N."

851
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,246
Give this to the Sister.

852
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,548
Go on.

853
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,716
"Un."

854
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:25,650
(children repeat)

855
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,419
Oh!

856
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,324
Beautiful.

857
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,859
...lay them straight.

858
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,696
Nine, ten...

859
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,999
11, 12...

860
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,968
13, 14...

861
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,305
15, 16...

862
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,708
17, 18...

863
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,910
"L."

864
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,378
(children repeat)

865
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,612
"M."

866
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,514
(children repeating)

867
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,619
Why is she here?

868
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,388
European woman, what does she

869
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,355
want from us?

870
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,523
She is teaching them about

871
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,891
the Christian God.

872
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,326
She wants to convert them

873
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,294
to her faith.

874
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,695
No, she's teaching them

875
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,596
to read.

876
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,597
She's giving them a chance

877
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,465
in life.

878
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,466
She's a troublemaker.

879
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,467
You are a troublemaker,

880
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,334
Manik!

881
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,836
(scoffs) Women.

882
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,439
(children) "X,"

883
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,608
"Y,"

884
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,678
"Z."

885
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,012
Very good!

886
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,482
You all get a prize.

887
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,018
(groans)

888
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,989
You all get a prize.

889
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,692
Soap!

890
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:44,496
♪♪

891
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,944
Over here.

892
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,446
They arrived a week ago from

893
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,580
the country.

894
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,482
He came to get a job,

895
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,084
but he got sick.

896
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,987
Now, the whole family is sick.

897
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,989
No one can help them, because

898
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,056
they are afraid of getting

899
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:12,957
the disease too.

900
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,958
We'll take the worst case

901
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,128
to hospital.

902
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,564
(sighs)

903
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,932
(flies buzzing)

904
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,937
(people coughing)

905
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,988
(gasping)

906
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,066
Feeling better?

907
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,467
What happened?

908
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,535
You fainted.

909
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,903
You haven't been eating enough.

910
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,005
Your blood sugar was too low.

911
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,106
Don't you know that, when you

912
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,408
work in conditions like you're

913
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,609
in every day, you're supposed to

914
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,810
eat three meals and get plenty

915
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,512
of rest.

916
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,880
Oh.

917
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,848
No.

918
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,983
I'm Sister Stephanie.

919
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,052
Father sent for me.

920
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:16,020
Oh.

921
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,523
The sick family...

922
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,825
I have to help them.

923
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,994
I have to go.

924
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,897
You're not going anywhere.

925
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,967
The people in the slums...

926
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,202
I failed them, failed.

927
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,737
You neglected your own care

928
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,205
while worrying about others.

929
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,873
That is no way to bring charity

930
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,709
to the poor, Sister Teresa.

931
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,577
That is the way to-- to rob

932
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,846
yourself of your usefulness.

933
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,847
I've been through this all

934
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,682
myself.

935
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,750
You have?

936
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,051
In Patna.

937
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,620
I run a hospital in one of the

938
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,754
poorest areas for the Medical

939
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,022
Mission Sisters.

940
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,157
Believe me, to do this work,

941
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,692
you have to have strict rules

942
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,928
and rigorous discipline.

943
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,632
Will you be in Calcutta

944
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:01,599
for a while?

945
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,701
Will you teach me?

946
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,842
That's as clean as we can

947
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,477
get it.

948
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:13,244
Now, it's time to dress

949
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,946
the wound.

950
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,581
Now, remember, it's essential

951
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,749
that you take an hour of rest

952
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,817
every day, and one day off

953
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,819
a week.

954
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,887
To keep working in these

955
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,055
conditions, balance is

956
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,957
essential.

957
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,692
(indistinct conversation)

958
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:30,795
To guard against the spread of

959
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,996
disease, all clothing must be

960
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,565
washed every day.

961
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,501
And now, Sister, it's time for

962
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,036
you to administer this injection

963
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,872
yourself.

964
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,273
You delivered that little one

965
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,242
almost on your own, Sister.

966
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,544
You'll make a fine midwife.

(baby crying)

968
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,751
If the nuns at Loreto could

969
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,919
see me now!

970
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,922
(laughing)

971
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,726

I think you will find these more

comfortable in the heat of

Calcutta."

976
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,068
Ohh!

St. Teresa of Avila

986
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,358
Sister!

987
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,060
Thank you. Thank you, Sister.

988
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,695
Thank you.

00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,006
(bells tolling)

991
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,310
Today I learned an important

992
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,079
lesson.

993
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,680
I was going and going, and my

994
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,650
legs and my arms were so sore.

995
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,652
And then the comfort of Loreto

996
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,387
came to tempt me.

997
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,289
I had not heard those bells for

998
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,658
several months, and I could not

999
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,894
resist a glimpse into my past.

1000
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,395
Had I made the right decision

1001
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,898
by leaving?

1002
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,299
It did not take God long to give

1003
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,368
me an answer.

1004
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,371

00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,251
Oh, baby.

1009
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,953
Baby!

1010
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,827
Oh, dear, oh, baby.

1011
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,162
Come, baby, come, come.

1012
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,765
(crying continues)

1013
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,213
Oh, baby, baby--

1014
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,214
What are you trying to do

1015
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,248
with my child?!

1016
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,382
He's my child!

1017
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,017
Give me my child!

1018
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,252
He was alone and crying,

1019
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,087
I thought he was abandoned.

1020
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,122
But he's my child.

1021
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,058
I didn't abandon him.

1022
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,426
He's mine!

1023
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,862
Your baby is sick, so hot.

1024
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:51,829
I would like to help you

1025
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:52,697
take care of him.

1026
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:53,731
No, no, I don't need your

1027
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,432
help.

1028
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,366
What do you want from us?

1029
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,234
No, nothing--

1030
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:57,168
What are you trying to do

1031
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,035
to us?

1032
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:58,936
I was only trying to help.

1033
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,371
I know about you.

1034
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,472
You are trying to steal

1035
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,473
our children.

1036
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,108
Please, I don't want to

1037
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,109
cause any trouble.

1038
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,444
Then why are you here?

1039
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,079
You want to turn our children

1040
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,980
into Christians.

1041
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,680
No!

1042
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,982
You are stealing their souls!

1043
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,984
No, if I could just explain.

1044
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,918
We don't need your

1045
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:14,852
explanations.

1046
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,020
They're all lies anyway.

1047
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,021
We'd be fools to trust a

1048
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,022
white person.

1049
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,357
We learned that long ago.

1050
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:20,324
She was trying to steal

1051
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,859
my baby from me!

1052
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,728
No! No! I wasn't trying to--

1053
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:24,729
Ahh!

1054
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,131
(screaming in foreign language)

1055
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,745
Thank you.

1056
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:43,214
No!

1057
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,515
I should thank you.

1058
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,750
Don't you recognize me,

1059
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,450
Sister?

1060
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,852
I am Jyoti.

1061
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,887
You helped me at the convent.

1062
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,857
Kali decided to spare me.

1063
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,425
Manik, you of all people should

1064
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,194
welcome Sister into Moti Jihl.

1065
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,428
She can teach that layabout son

1066
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,829
of yours a thing or two!

1067
00:44:58,829 --> 00:44:59,897
I don't need help from a

1068
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,966
white woman.

1069
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,069
How can I thank you?

1070
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,237
You saved my life.

1071
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,505
You've taken a huge debt

1072
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,207
from my shoulders, Sister.

1073
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,776
Good.

1074
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,313
(kids chattering)

1075
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,081
(birds cawing)

1076
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,918
This will be a beautiful place--

1077
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,253
a place where people can die

1078
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,955
with dignity.

1079
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:24,889
But people here don't

1080
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,090
understand.

1081
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,491
Why would a European woman leave

1082
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,327
those beautiful, clean big

1083
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:30,494
buildings up there,

1084
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:31,996
where there's plenty of food,

1085
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:34,098
fresh air and safety, and come

1086
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,466
down here to live in the slum?

1087
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,801
I don't know how to explain

1088
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:37,568
it to you, Jyoti.

1089
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,537
But Sister, everyone around

1090
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,871
here would do anything to get

1091
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,975
out of Moto Jihl, including me.

1092
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,943
I choose this out of my own

1093
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,080
free will to do the work of God.

1094
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,454
(overlapping chatter)

1095
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:03,995
We should be removing the

1096
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,263
garbage from Moto Jihl,

1097
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,597
not adding to it.

1098
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,598
The people wouldn't like

1099
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,133
that.

1100
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,302
It's so unhealthy, look.

1101
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,070
(scoffs)

1102
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,375
If we all got together and

1103
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,043
cleared all this up, Moti Jihl

1104
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:20,344
would be a better place to live.

1105
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,213
Never! It's our livelihood.

1106
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:23,447
We survive by picking through

1107
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,915
the garbage of Calcutta.

1108
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,084
If this goes away...

1109
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,957
(overlapping chatter)

1110
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,132
I'll do it.

1111
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,434
You finish the beds.

1112
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,487
Your influence has even made

1113
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,257
a big impression on this pigsty.

1114
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,626
(chuckling)

1115
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,294
And I thought I was making

1116
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,929
a real sacrifice

1117
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,432
letting you use the place.

1118
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,203
You're a good and generous

1119
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,404
Christian, Mr. Goma.

1120
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,939
Your hospital pretends

1121
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,507
to know nothing about you.

1122
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,542
But my little Mabel refused

1123
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,043
to leave until they gave her

1124
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,212
some bandages.

1125
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,246
Thank you.

1126
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,481
Thank you.

1127
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,351
Every spot of life has

1128
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,920
infinite value.

1129
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,521
And every person counts

1130
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,290
no matter how sick,

1131
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,259
no matter how disfigured.

1132
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,496
Charu Ma.

1133
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,498
Have you seen Jyoti?

1134
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:49,333
He's out there, Sister.

1135
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,608
Jyoti, I need the water

1136
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,275
inside.

1137
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,044
I can't go in there, Sister.

1138
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,512
Why not?

1139
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:02,379
I'm Hindu,

1140
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,547
I can't be near death.

1141
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,615
It's impure.

1142
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,649
Only the<i> harijan</i> can deal

1143
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,650
with the dead.

1144
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,718
The untouchables.

1145
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,587
But he's not dead yet.

1146
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,521
We're trying to relieve

1147
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,455
his suffering.

1148
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,490
He has great suffering.

1149
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,325
The body's not important,

1150
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:15,493
the spirit is.

1151
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,094
If that man is suffering,

1152
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,330
it's his Karma, his destiny.

1153
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,431
You are interfering.

1154
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,499
I respect your beliefs,

1155
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:22,199
Jyoti.

1156
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,934
But I need you to respect mine.

1157
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,274
Shouldn't you say

1158
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,642
the last rites, Sister?

1159
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,579
Receiving the water from

1160
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,281
the River Ganges is the holiest

1161
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,117
of rites for Hindus.

1162
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,562
He's in the hands of God now.

1163
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,067
Give me courage now

1164
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,435
this very moment

1165
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,371
as you did when I was 18

1166
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,039
and I had to leave behind

1167
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,542
mother and sister and brother,

1168
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,277
knowing I might never see them

1169
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,611
again.

1170
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,484
Nanalokay,

1171
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:16,187
sister Agay,

1172
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,355
brother Lassar.

1173
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,229
So many years have intervened.

1174
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:29,533
So many words.

1175
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,105
Today, what tortures

1176
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,107
of loneliness.

1177
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,484
From the Calcutta Corporation,

1178
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,385
they will give us land

1179
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,587
and build a small school house

1180
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,555
when we have 100 pupils.

1181
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:52,756
It won't be long now.

1182
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,225
Meanwhile, I think we should

1183
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,459
open a school for only

1184
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,360
Muslim girls.

1185
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,661
(truck horn honks)

1186
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,063
(shouting)

1187
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,136
Sounds like trouble, Sister.

1188
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,205
(horn honks)

1189
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:16,747
(crowd shouting)

1190
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,518
It's for your own good!

1191
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,387
Don't you understand?!

1192
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,623
The authorities don't want you

1193
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:28,092
to live in filth anymore!

1194
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,427
Is this your doing, Sister?

1195
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,328
No!

1196
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,397
Then you have to stop them.

1197
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,765
Will they listen to me?

1198
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,500
It might make things worse.

1199
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,534
Please.

1200
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,037
(shouting)

1201
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,544
Hey, you!

1202
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,811
You're obstructing

1203
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,146
municipal workers!

1204
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,248
Get down!

1205
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:52,816
Get down, or I'll arrest you!

1206
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,758
Who are you?

1207
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,526
Sister Teresa

1208
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:03,861
from the Loreto Order.

1209
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,263
I work here in Moti Jihl.

1210
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,399
In this slum?

1211
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,300
With these hooligans?

1212
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,967
These people are

1213
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,503
my sisters and my brothers.

1214
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,571
We share the slum

1215
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,873
with the rats.

1216
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:17,341
She's not one of us!

1217
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,176
Take her away with you!

1218
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,878
We don't want a white woman!

1219
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,514
Did you hear that?

1220
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:24,548
Get out of the way

1221
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,582
before you get hurt.

1222
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,717
Their only fault

1223
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,218
is that they're poor.

1224
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,219
Poverty is an accident,

1225
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,220
it tells you nothing about

1226
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:30,888
a person.

1227
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:31,789
I don't have the time

1228
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:32,656
to be preached.

1229
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,724
This man there,

1230
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:34,792
Manik Sulamin,

1231
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:35,859
the man you want to arrest.

1232
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,163
He has four sons and a wife.

1233
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:40,531
He keeps them alive by salvaging

1234
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,733
garbage from this dump.

1235
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,501
What will happen to his family

1236
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,502
if you arrest him?

1237
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,237
City officials have ordered

1238
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,272
this operation.

1239
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,206
It's my job to make--

1240
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,574
Have the city officials asked

1241
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,842
these people what they want?

1242
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,711
No! No!

1243
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,612
If they're so eager to help,

1244
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,480
why don't they try

1245
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,348
and find a way to bring

1246
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,183
clean water to Moti Jihl?

1247
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:00,284
What about those toilets

1248
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,285
that are supposed to be cleaned

1249
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,853
once a week?

1250
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:03,921
The sanitation workers

1251
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,189
never come.

1252
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,657
No one can go near those places,

1253
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:07,891
they're smelling so badly.

1254
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,326
Some people use the gutters.

1255
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,328
It's not my responsibility.

1256
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,196
Then make it

1257
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:12,863
your responsibility.

1258
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,301
Please, Mr. Commissioner.

1259
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,303
I ask you on behalf

1260
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,438
of the people of Moti Jihl,

1261
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,741
go to your city authorities

1262
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:24,975
and ask them to cancel

1263
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,243
these orders.

1264
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,878
Yeah! Yeah!

1265
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,347
Yes! Yes!

1266
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,517
(crowd shouting)

1267
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,220
(camera shutter clicks)

1268
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,860
For the safety of the men,

1269
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,495
this operation is discontinued

1270
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,496
for now.

1271
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,498
Thank you, Commissioner.

1272
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,900
(cheering)

1273
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,235
You haven't heard

1274
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,669
the last of this.

1275
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,307
(cheering)

1276
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,716
Sister.

1277
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,552
I was wrong about you, Sister.

1278
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,887
No time for apologies.

1279
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,289
We have much work to do.

1280
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,193
(cheering)

1281
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:22,366
(scoffs)

1282
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,400
Well, I'll be.

1283
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,304
If it isn't that pushy

1284
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,339
little headmistress again.

1285
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,708
Now, she's working in the slums.

1286
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,546
Harry Harper,

1287
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,482
this may interest you.

1288
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,617
Now that you've

1289
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,485
finished school,

1290
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:42,453
will you go to Europe

1291
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,520
with your mother, Sunita?

1292
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,622
Perhaps. I first want to

1293
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:46,757
visit Sister Teresa.

1294
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:49,426
Ah, well, tell her

1295
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,461
we miss her.

1296
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,529
Good luck.

1297
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,831
God bless you.

1298
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,666
Thank you, Sister.

1299
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,569
Tell Sister Teresa that

1300
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,837
we want her to come back.

1301
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:00,704
Tell her that.

1302
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,839
They won't let her back.

1303
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,973
They say she's walking around

1304
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,575
Calcutta like a beggar woman.

1305
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,809
They say she's cracked.

1306
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,844
Oh, shut up.

1307
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:07,778
Is it true?

1308
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:08,745
That's not true.

1309
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,381
I want to see for myself.

1310
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,617
If I could, I'd run away

1311
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,485
and go and work with her.

1312
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,652
(laughing)

1313
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,654
You better finish school first,

1314
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,589
Maria.

1315
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,457
Just one year to go. Bye.

1316
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,659
Bye.

1317
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:28,332
Five more deaths,

1318
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:29,867
we are caring for 16 men,

1319
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,536
13 women, and six children.

1320
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,738
More come every day.

1321
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,442
(knocking)

1322
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:41,578
Who is it?

1323
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,714
Sunita.

1324
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,888
Sunita!

1325
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,023
How did you find me?

1326
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,058
What are you doing here?

1327
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,427
Father gave me your address.

1328
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:00,097
I've come to work with you.

1329
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,833
Oh!

1330
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,635
(gasping)

1331
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,005
This is the first time

1332
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:08,972
in my life I've seen you

1333
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,308
at a loss for words.

1334
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,021
The Sister of Calcutta

1335
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,556
to help her poor.

1336
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,391
Ah, morning, Mr. Goma.

1337
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,059
Good morning, good morning.

1338
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,427
The Bengalis have a custom

1339
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,762
of setting aside a cup of rice

1340
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:32,863
for a beggar.

1341
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,898
Sister Teresa has inspired

1342
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,067
our congregation to practice it

1343
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,602
liberally.

1344
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,841
Maria, what are you

1345
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,144
doing here?

1346
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:48,946
I have come to help.

1347
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,981
But what about school?

1348
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,115
What will your parents say?

1349
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,152
They want me to get married.

1350
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,753
But I want to be a nun.

1351
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,021
Please, Sister Teresa.

1352
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,723
Let me stay with you.

1353
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,992
We can't, Sister.

1354
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,560
She hasn't completed high school

1355
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,128
yet.

1356
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,031
But I want to help the poor.

1357
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,569
Come to Moti Jihl.

1358
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:13,804
Come and see.

1359
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,739
Come and see if this the life

1360
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,840
you really want.

1361
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,377
(chanting)

1362
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,495
(coughing)

1363
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,799
(people groaning)

1364
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,672
Come.

1365
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,541
Let me show you what to do,

1366
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,244
come.

1367
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,913
There are four of them now.

1368
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,148
It's outrageous.

1369
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,850
Sit, both of you.

1370
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,120
Do you realize

1371
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,221
what it looks like?

1372
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:06,056
A group of young Indian girls

1373
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,591
from the best families

1374
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,992
running around Calcutta

1375
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,227
unsupervised.

1376
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:11,561
But they are hardly

1377
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,262
unsupervised.

1378
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,730
Sister Teresa is their

1379
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,598
headmistress.

1380
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:15,499
She knows how to handle--

1381
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:18,769
I agree with the Archbishop.

1382
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,537
It's putting our whole order

1383
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,672
into a bad light.

1384
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,173
I'm putting a stop to this

1385
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,808
right now, Father.

1386
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:25,909
It's clear this experiment

1387
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,678
is grossly out of control.

1388
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:28,645
With all due respect,

1389
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,580
Your Grace, I think it's out

1390
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,082
of our control.

1391
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:34,951
Sister Teresa is inspiring

1392
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,586
young women to give selflessly

1393
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,854
to those who need service

1394
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:41,091
the most.

1395
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,859
Why would these young girls,

1396
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:43,760
who have their whole life

1397
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,028
ahead of them,

1398
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:48,198
give up everything to work for--

1399
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:49,800
To work for what?

1400
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,101
I believe they think

1401
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:52,903
they are working for our Lord,

1402
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,072
Jesus Christ.

1403
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,607
For her own safety,

1404
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:58,842
and for the welfare

1405
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,143
of those girls,

1406
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,079
I think we ought to insist

1407
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,013
that Sister Teresa

1408
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,581
return to Loreto.

1409
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,549
I beg you, Your Grace,

1410
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:06,817
let her complete her year.

1411
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,185
At least let her do that.

1412
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:15,325
Good morning.

1413
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,193
Good morning.

1414
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:17,094
Good morning, Mabel.

1415
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:18,295
Hope you slept well.

1416
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,196
Good morning, Maria.

1417
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:20,330
A letter arrived for you.

1418
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,632
Thank you.

1419
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,074
Are you okay?

1420
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,676
I wrote to my parents

1421
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,845
to try to explain.

1422
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,813
They didn't even open it.

1423
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,751
We are your family now.

1424
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,722
There are plenty of people

1425
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:46,957
in Loreto who will welcome you

1426
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,258
back at the end of the year.

1427
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,026
The only problem is,

1428
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,061
you've got these young girls

1429
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,362
involved.

1430
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,230
Why should there be

1431
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,664
a problem?

1432
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,233
They live by strict rules,

1433
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,167
and as religious women,

1434
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,034
even though they're not

1435
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,069
nuns yet.

1436
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,137
Yes, they're well into

1437
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,838
their training as postulants.

1438
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,807
And when you disband,

1439
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,808
they'll be able to become

1440
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,710
novitiates of the Loreto Order.

1441
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,245
Disbanding?

1442
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,213
What about the work?

1443
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,214
We can't just abandon

1444
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,316
these people we are helping.

1445
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,085
But what are you going to do?

1446
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,788
Father, I'm going to apply

1447
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,055
for recognition

1448
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,158
as a congregation.

1449
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:23,093
(scoffs) The Vatican hasn't

1450
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,628
authorized a new congregation

1451
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,663
since 1850.

1452
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:27,731
They'll say your work can be

1453
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,899
taken over by lay people.

1454
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,267
No.

1455
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,835
There's a lot involved

1456
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:33,236
in getting recognized.

1457
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,672
You need to present a proposal,

1458
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,641
document your work,

1459
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,109
explain why a new order

1460
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,210
is required,

1461
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,878
write the constitutions.

1462
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,847
A proposal, documentation,

1463
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:44,748
constitutions.

1464
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,284
Father, come.

1465
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,227
Missionaries of Charity.

1466
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,069
You're brilliant.

1467
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,771
And this one?

1468
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,140
"Angel of the Slums."

1469
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,441
The local newspapers can't get

1470
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,876
enough of her.

1471
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:14,044
She even has the city council

1472
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,112
on her side because of the work

1473
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,347
she's doing.

1474
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,882
If her group is recognized

1475
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,851
as a congregation, Your Grace,

1476
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,285
four of our girls will qualify

1477
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,153
as novitiates.

1478
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,021
She's paid close attention

1479
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:25,889
to their religious--

1480
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,757
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1481
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,759
I see she proposes a fourth vow

1482
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,328
in addition to poverty,

1483
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,429
chastity, and obedience.

1484
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,296
That's what makes her order

1485
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,398
unique.

1486
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:39,202
It's not her order yet.

1487
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,104
"To give wholehearted and free

1488
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,272
service to the poorest

1489
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:43,306
of the poor.

1490
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,709
There are over 200 rules

1491
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,143
explaining the responsibilities

1492
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,278
and training for membership

1493
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,179
in her order.

1494
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,480
I did read these documents,

1495
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,350
Father.

1496
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,119
I leave for Rome next month.

1497
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,254
If, in the interim, I hear no

1498
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:58,889
negative reports of Sister

1499
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:01,291
Teresa's work...

1500
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,726
I'll take this application

1501
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:03,460
with me.

1502
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,161
But Your Grace, I...

1503
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,463
Oh, you mean you--

1504
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,232
I mean, I--

1505
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,300
Thank you, Your Grace.

1506
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,102
Thank you.

1507
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:14,237
(bells tolling)

1508
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,079
We are careful not to breathe

1509
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,247
in the scent of the flowers,

1510
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:24,948
Sister.

1511
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:27,817
It belongs to the goddess Kali.

1512
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,120
You see that man?

1513
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,122
He's a Brahmin, a holy man

1514
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,924
in charge of the temple.

1515
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,859
Where I grew up, there were

1516
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,360
many different religions--

1517
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,530
Orthodox, Muslim, Catholic.

1518
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,765
We all worshipped

1519
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,033
in different ways.

1520
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,235
But as a child I always

1521
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,403
believed we were praying

1522
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,271
to same God.

1523
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,074
What's that building?

1524
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,175
It was the pilgrims'

1525
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,311
rest house.

1526
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,246
(gasps) This is the place

1527
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,881
for my hospital!

1528
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,419
It's perfect.

1529
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:03,553
The Brahmins will not stand

1530
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,888
for it, Sister.

1531
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,022
This is the holiest of places

1532
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,057
for us Hindus.

1533
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,258
Then it's already sacred

1534
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,860
ground for God's work.

1535
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,963
Look, we can have beds here

1536
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,497
and here.

1537
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,277
(door opening)

1538
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:29,579
Ah, Sister.

1539
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,381
The city council has no idea as

1540
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,515
to what kind of troublemaker

1541
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,017
you are.

1542
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:35,385
They give you permission to run

1543
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:36,486
amok in Calcutta,

1544
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,554
and I am the one who has

1545
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:38,555
to clean up the disaster.

1546
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:41,224
Just like in Moti Jihl.

1547
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,525
I thought that you and I had

1548
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,927
succeeded in stopping the

1549
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,061
disaster, Mr. Commissioner--

1550
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,030
Sister, please.

1551
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,365
Don't try to whitewash

1552
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,933
your actions.

1553
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,601
What you did was incitement,

1554
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,836
encouraging the poor

1555
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:54,070
to resist authority.

1556
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,438
(scoffs)

1557
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,307
You can't hide your political

1558
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:58,274
agitations behind

1559
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,277
religious vows.

1560
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,346
Is teaching the uneducated

1561
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,581
and feeding the hungry now

1562
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,783
considered political agitation?

1563
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:10,920
All we are doing is providing

1564
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,522
a little of God's love,

1565
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,524
to make people's last days

1566
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,626
on Earth less painful.

1567
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,561
By making the slum a better

1568
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,195
place to live?

1569
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,231
No, a better place to die,

1570
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,565
Mr. Commissioner.

1571
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,234
So, you intend helping each

1572
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,002
and every one of the millions of

1573
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,937
sick and dying in Calcutta.

1574
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:28,638
How do you count

1575
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,506
to a million?

1576
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,107
That's my point, Sister,

1577
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,142
it takes forever.

1578
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,077
But where do you begin?

1579
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,348
One.

1580
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,983
That's where I am beginning.

1581
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,219
One, then two, then three.

1582
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,320
Already we have reached

1583
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,288
more than a hundred.

1584
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,389
And now you are seeking

1585
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,524
permission to move into

1586
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:48,558
the pilgrims' hostel.

1587
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,127
It has two sleeping rooms.

1588
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,529
It has electricity.

1589
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:56,232
It has connections for cooking.

1590
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,500
I am not interested in its

1591
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,502
pleasant features.

1592
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,371
The hostel is right next to one

1593
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,639
of the most enchanted, most

1594
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,009
revered shrines in Calcutta.

1595
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,310
How do you think Hindus will

1596
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,311
respond to your presence?

1597
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,913
Oh, I don't bring politics

1598
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,481
into charity, Mr. Commissioner.

1599
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:14,017
Sister! You are not the only

1600
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,486
kind-hearted person in Calcutta.

1601
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,255
You think no one else cares?

1602
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,292
This is my city, and every day

1603
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,127
I am brokenhearted to see our

1604
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,995
people dying in the streets.

1605
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:29,065
But for me, they're victims--

1606
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,600
victims of colonialism

1607
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,237
and 300 years of Christian rule,

1608
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,572
which has blighted our country

1609
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:38,308
and our culture.

1610
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,944
Why don't we let God decide

1611
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,145
whether we should do our work

1612
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,680
here or not?

1613
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,115
All you have to do

1614
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,283
is open the way.

1615
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,091
♪♪

1616
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,168
The permission is

1617
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:07,237
provisional.

1618
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,173
And... if your presence

1619
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:13,143
causes trouble...

1620
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,512
the council will reconsider.

1621
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,017
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

1622
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:33,530
(people singing)

1623
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,058
What's wrong, Sister?

1624
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,228
(sighs)

1625
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,263
The Albanian government have

1626
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,165
refused permission for my mother

1627
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,033
and my sister to leave

1628
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,702
the country.

1629
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,971
I'm so sorry.

1630
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,075
We must count our blessings,

1631
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,244
Sunita.

1632
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,214
(singing continues)

1633
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,452
Mabel said she'd go straight

1634
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,820
to Sister to give her your

1635
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,721
message.

1636
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,122
Oh, I'm only concerned about

1637
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,457
taking up your valuable time,

1638
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,825
Mrs. Goma.

1639
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,826
I'm used to waiting for

1640
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,228
Sister Teresa.

1641
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,129
Ah, here she is,

1642
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:43,066
back from the war front.

1643
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,400
I know you don't accept

1644
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,769
hospitality from anyone,

1645
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,338
as a rule.

1646
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,839
Please, Sister, can I make a cup

1647
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,140
of tea for you?

1648
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,175
Thank you, Mrs. Goma,

1649
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,244
I'm not thirsty.

1650
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,349
Is that true?

1651
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,152
The poor and the rich alike

1652
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,420
invite us to drink tea with them

1653
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,222
and to share their food.

1654
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:07,457
We would never take anything

1655
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,491
from people who have less

1656
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:09,525
than us.

1657
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,160
And to accept invitation only

1658
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,595
from the wealthy would offend

1659
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:13,830
the poor, so better say no

1660
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,499
to everyone.

1661
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,134
I'm sure that must frustrate

1662
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,837
a lot of people, Mother Teresa.

1663
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,705
Oh, I don't worry.

1664
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,540
Mother Teresa?

1665
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:28,778
(laughs)

1666
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,328
Desperate, the lost,

1667
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,497
the outcast.

1668
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,499
Taking care of them,

1669
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,768
rendering help to them,

1670
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:53,770
visiting them assiduously,

1671
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,839
living Christ's love for them,

1672
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,708
and awakening their response

1673
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,377
to His great love.

1674
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,680
Amen.

1675
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,814
God has triumphed through

1676
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,650
you, Reverend Mother Teresa.

1677
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,853
Welcome to the Calcutta diocese.

1678
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,590
Just Mother Teresa,

1679
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,359
Your Grace.

1680
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,927
I'm too small to carry

1681
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,163
so many names.

1682
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:27,537
(singing in foreign language)

1683
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:53,596
(girls) ...to quench the

1684
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,932
infinite thirst of Jesus Christ

1685
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,968
by wholehearted and free service

1686
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,471
to the poorest of the poor.

1687
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,973
Nursing the sick and dying

1688
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,943
destitutes, gathering and

1689
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,512
teaching street children.

1690
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,981
Visiting and caring for beggars

1691
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,916
and their children.

1692
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,786
Sheltering the abandoned,

1693
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:19,389
caring for the unwanted,

1694
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,457
unloved and lonely,

1695
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,260
living Christ's love in our

1696
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,863
spiritual work of mercy.

1697
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,265
(overlapping chatter)

1698
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,742
Sister Gertrude.

1699
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:40,910
We have been looking

1700
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,011
everywhere for you.

1701
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,746
I-- I was just thinking...

1702
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,451
My dear daughter!

1703
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,721
Mommy?

1704
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,923
Papa!

1705
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,425
How I wished I could have

1706
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,427
seen my family again.

1707
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,931
But God had other plans for me.

1708
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,413
You have no right to be here!

1709
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,681
You are desecrating

1710
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,949
this holy place!

1711
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:20,883
We are bringing the love

1712
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,819
of God to the dying.

1713
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:24,487
Not our God!

1714
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:25,655
Your God!

1715
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,290
Go back! Go back!

1716
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,495
(baby crying)

1717
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,397
Jyoti, take the baby

1718
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,331
to Sister Angela.

1719
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:35,998
Yes, Sister.

1720
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,467
Quickly.

1721
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,079
(protesters shouting)

1722
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,515
Mother! Mother, look!

1723
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,816
Don't let it distract you

1724
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,918
from your work.

1725
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,720
No, Mother.

1726
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:03,926
Ahh.

1727
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:04,961
Back up, back up.

1728
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:05,995
Calcutta's a pretty peculiar

1729
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:06,863
place for a holiday,

1730
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:07,797
if you ask me.

1731
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:09,499
Well...

1732
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:11,467
I can think of a lot worse.

1733
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,635
Actually, I'm here on a bit of

1734
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:14,003
a busman's holiday.

1735
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,037
I'm checking out the state of

1736
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,341
post-partition India-- oh.

1737
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:19,375
Well, while you're here,

1738
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,109
you should pay a visit to that

1739
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,577
nun I wrote to you about.

1740
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,012
You know, she's really not

1741
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,114
my kind of material, Stout.

1742
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,449
(clears throat) I'm a war

1743
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,584
correspondent, you know?

1744
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:29,719
Well, if ever there was a war

1745
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,687
to fight, she's found it, Harry.

1746
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,493
(horn honking, people shouting)

1747
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:49,505
Nirmal Hriday.

1748
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:50,540
What's that mean?

1749
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,941
That's "pure heart,"

1750
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,142
"immaculate heart."

1751
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,677
It's Bengali.

1752
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,046
This woman has some guts.

1753
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,981
(shouting continues)

1754
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,887
(baby crying)

1755
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,088
She was dying in the gutter,

1756
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,157
Sister.

1757
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,459
She wouldn't even speak to me.

1758
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,662
And see, Sister?

1759
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,433
She was clutching the baby.

1760
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,405
Take her on inside, Manik.

1761
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:23,773
Move toes.

1762
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,474
Ahh!

1763
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,877
(overlapping chatter)

1764
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,517
What are they saying?

1765
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,218
They called Gandhi

1766
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:36,419
"Gandhiji," they're calling her

1767
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:37,587
"Sisterji."

1768
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:38,888
There she is.

1769
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:40,923
I'll see you a little later on.

1770
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,493
Um, excuse me?

1771
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,529
Uh, my name is Harry Harper of

1772
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,597
the International Chronicle.

1773
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:48,564
I'd like to talk with you.

1774
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,166
Oh, I have little time for

1775
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,434
talking, Mr. Harper.

1776
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,569
Excuse me, um, I would like

1777
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,805
to write about your work.

1778
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:56,973
The conflict between your

1779
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,174
Catholic Order and Hindu

1780
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,809
worshippers illustrates the

1781
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,677
contradictions here in India.

1782
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:02,912
All that matters is we are

1783
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,480
serving the poor.

1784
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,548
Yes, I know.

1785
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,549
But wouldn't you like the world

1786
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,683
to hear about your work?

1787
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,820
God's work, not my work.

1788
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,988
Mr. Harper, don't waste your

1789
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:13,189
time writing about me.

1790
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,957
I'm only an instrument.

1791
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,826
Write about the poor.

1792
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:17,994
All you have to do is open

1793
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,528
your eyes, your ears,

1794
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:20,863
your heart.

1795
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,100
(people coughing, groaning)

1796
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,193
Mother Teresa!

1797
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,129
Oh!

1798
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:54,630
Oh, the wound is infected with

1799
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,665
maggots.

1800
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:56,599
You must cut out

1801
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,533
all dead tissue.

1802
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,634
Yes, Mother.

1803
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,269
Ooh.

1804
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,203
(man retching)

1805
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,104
Ugh!

1806
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,040
(coughing)

1807
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,145
He'll infect me!

1808
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:10,813
Don't be afraid of them.

1809
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,227
First day, it's a shock.

1810
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,129
But you can get used to it.

1811
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,898
Never, not that.

1812
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:29,999
I thought I'd seen suffering

1813
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,801
in the war, but...

1814
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,636
Soon you'll be washing them

1815
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:34,704
and feeding them.

1816
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,305
You'll see.

1817
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,873
How is that mother they

1818
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,976
brought in a while ago?

1819
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,278
I don't think she'll make it.

1820
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,913
There's no life in her eyes.

1821
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,116
But the little one is

1822
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:48,150
fighting to survive.

1823
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,820
Beautiful baby.

1824
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,888
Now, what happens to her

1825
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,889
if the mother dies?

1826
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:54,957
I mean, who would take a sick

1827
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,026
baby like that?

1828
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:57,927
I've been thinking

1829
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,962
about that, too.

1830
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,263
Here, we have home

1831
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,099
for destitute dying.

1832
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,567
Now, what we need is home

1833
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:07,003
for destitute living.

1834
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,671
A home for children who have

1835
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,839
nowhere to go.

1836
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,844
How do you plan it all?

1837
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,146
We have no plan.

1838
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,280
We start our work where the

1839
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,148
suffering of the people

1840
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,750
calls us.

1841
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:28,057
We start right from the ground.

1842
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:31,193
(typewriter clicking)

1843
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:36,132
> Let's see here.

1844
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,767
"Dateline Calcutta.

1845
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,001
Today, near a temple to a fierce

1846
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,336
Indian goddess, I saw the face

1847
01:15:40,336 --> 01:15:41,937
of human compassion."

1848
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:42,972
(groans)

1849
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:43,973
"Among the teaming masses of

1850
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,007
some of the poorest people on

1851
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,009
Earth, a bright light shines.

1852
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,077
Perhaps I saw the face of a

1853
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:49,211
saint today, as she bent over

1854
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,312
to change the bandages

1855
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,748
of a dying..."

1856
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,151
(sighs) Oh, Harry.

1857
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:04,660
(man groaning, coughing)

1858
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,698
Mother?

1859
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:10,800
Not to worry,

1860
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,767
we'll take care of you.

1861
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,836
Sister Agnes?

1862
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,339
He's a Brahmin.

1863
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,908
Yes, he's dying of TB.

1864
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:19,842
But the Brahmin want us

1865
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:20,509
evicted.

1866
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,744
They rejected him from every

1867
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,945
hospital in Calcutta.

1868
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:26,315
Don't worry, Jyoti.

1869
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:29,051
You are welcome here.

1870
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,687
(coughing)

1871
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,155
I won't die in

1872
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,925
this devilish house.

1873
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,993
I want to leave!

1874
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,900
Are you always

1875
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,935
in a hurry, Mother?

1876
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,002
There is a saying among

1877
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:47,970
missionaries.

1878
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,838
"If you want to preach

1879
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,805
successfully, you move

1880
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,107
your feet."

1881
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,007
They call us

1882
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,876
the running Sisters.

1883
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:54,944
Well, I don't think

1884
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:55,811
I'm fit enough to be

1885
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:56,912
a part of your order.

1886
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,181
But I-- I would like to help.

1887
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,182
If you'd let me have

1888
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,817
an interview...

1889
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:02,685
Do you know what we really

1890
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,320
need?

1891
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,655
A mobile clinic.

1892
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,724
Now, where would I find

1893
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,192
something like that?

1894
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,361
I don't know.

1895
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:15,998
"I'd like to tell the whole

1896
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,100
world, so all I want

1897
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,235
is an interview."

1898
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:20,102
Instead, she's sending me off

1899
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,738
on a mission.

1900
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:23,772
She's got under your skin,

1901
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:24,740
old boy.

1902
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,741
It's absurd.

1903
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:26,742
I mean, where am I gonna

1904
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:27,710
find a van?

1905
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,944
How much is something like that?

1906
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,079
Well, 100 pounds or so.

1907
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,014
Exactly.

1908
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,284
I'm not made out of money.

1909
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:36,952
I think I've got maybe

1910
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,153
ten pounds I can afford.

1911
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,822
I can't afford 100.

1912
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,424
Well... here.

1913
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:45,895
Change that little one up,

1914
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:48,164
you'll be up to 20.

1915
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,866
(laughs)

1916
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,335
(protestors shouting)

1917
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:06,081
How can you care for me

1918
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,450
when I despise you?

1919
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,920
Because I love you.

1920
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,088
I love you as God loves you.

1921
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:18,394
Hindus believe we suffer to

1922
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:21,163
pay for something we have done.

1923
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:22,464
(coughs)

1924
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,833
This is my time to understand

1925
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:29,138
God through my physical pain.

1926
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:32,207
Christ teaches us that

1927
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,143
even the good can suffer.

1928
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:36,278
Even the innocent.

1929
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,015
(coughing)

1930
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,117
Your God,

1931
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,019
when we see him on the cross,

1932
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,989
we ask, "What terrible thing

1933
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:49,291
did he do in his life

1934
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,461
to earn such a painful death?"

1935
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,830
Christ died on the cross

1936
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,498
to prove his greater love

1937
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,267
in action.

1938
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,469
He died for you.

1939
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,205
(people gasp, scream)

1940
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,356
I must go out there.

1941
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:21,857
I must talk to them.

1942
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,026
No, you can't!

1943
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,395
We have to get help.

1944
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:29,431
If they kill me...

1945
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,967
I will go to my God sooner.

1946
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,373
Attention!

1947
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:38,841
You are ordered to vacate the

1948
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,210
premises until your occupancy

1949
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,278
of Kalighat can be reviewed.

1950
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,114
If you don't do so voluntarily,

1951
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,548
you'll be removed by force!

1952
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,284
(cheering)

1953
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,485
Attention!

1954
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,387
What are we going to do?

1955
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:54,256
(protestors shouting)

1956
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,270
I warned you. And now...

1957
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,872
either you leave peacefully,

1958
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:10,873
or I will have

1959
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:11,573
all of you arrested.

1960
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,275
We have a lot of sick people

1961
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,378
in here who can't walk.

1962
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,280
If your plan is to remove us,

1963
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,515
perhaps you would like to see

1964
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:21,250
how many of us there are.

1965
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,518
But how can we?

1966
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:25,554
There is death in there.

1967
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,323
No, Mr. Commissioner.

1968
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,826
There is so much life.

1969
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:35,064
Come and see.

1970
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,568
All right.

1971
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,304
(protesters continue shouting)

1972
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,540
You realize that you'll all be

1973
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,974
arrested if you disobey the

1974
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,443
orders to vacate these premises?

1975
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:48,911
Yes.

1976
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:49,978
Arrangements have been made

1977
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,313
to move these patients to other

1978
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,948
facilities around Calcutta.

1979
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,217
We Indians are quite capable

1980
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,086
of taking care of our own.

1981
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,487
(flies buzzing)

1982
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:01,490
(people coughing, groaning)

1983
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:10,532
These patients will be removed

1984
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,000
to the city's facility for

1985
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,470
indigents, where...

1986
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,717
You-- you are taking care

1987
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,085
of him, too?

1988
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,954
Yes.

1989
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:34,556
Remember the words

1990
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:38,060
of Mahatma Gandhi.

1991
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,595
That you must think of the

1992
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:42,030
poorest and most helpless man

1993
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,465
we have ever seen.

1994
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:47,069
(coughing)

1995
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,738
We must ask ourselves if the

1996
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,107
step we contemplate is going to

1997
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,310
be of any use to him, what will

1998
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,179
the poor man gain from it?

1999
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,348
(coughing)

2000
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,683
Go out and tell your followers

2001
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:03,352
she is not welcome here.

2002
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:07,489
(coughing)

2003
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,562
♪♪

2004
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:43,725
(protestors shouting)

2005
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:55,804
I promised you that

2006
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,707
I will evict this woman.

2007
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,108
And I will.

2008
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:03,278
(cheering)

2009
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:06,548
I will evict the nuns as soon as

2010
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,483
I see you, your mothers,

2011
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:11,353
sisters, and wives

2012
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,356
come in here day in and day out

2013
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,557
to take over the work

2014
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:16,725
that they do here.

2015
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,560
(murmuring)

2016
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,632
(engine starts)

2017
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,138
(car horn honking)

2018
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,384
Pain?

2019
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:45,120
Hey!

2020
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,688
No pain here?

2021
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,624
Here?

2022
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,293
Not too tight, not too tight.

2023
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,362
Here, good man.

2024
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,631
Friend.

2025
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,598
Mother?

2026
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,599
Oh!

2027
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:58,367
I came to offer my

2028
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,868
congratulations.

2029
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,869
I won't be able to make

2030
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,137
the ceremony.

2031
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,205
Oh, I am only accepting for

2032
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,840
the poor, Mr. Harper.

2033
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,174
I'm only the instrument.

2034
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,509
Yes, yes.

2035
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,177
An international instrument

2036
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,513
working in over 30 countries.

2037
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:13,315
Ah, we are looking for new

2038
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:15,117
recruits, if you are interested.

2039
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,385
We have brothers working as

2040
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,519
missionaries too, you know.

2041
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:18,720
Oh, no, I'm too old

2042
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,522
and too wise, Mother.

2043
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:23,158
After what I've witnessed,

2044
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:24,626
the depth of wretchedness,

2045
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,662
extent of suffering,

2046
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:28,530
it's everywhere.

2047
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,531
But then I come here--

2048
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,499
Mother, what happened to the

2049
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,200
legacy of Gandhi?

2050
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,602
I passed a statue on the way

2051
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:34,536
here, it's surrounded by

2052
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,772
soldiers and barbed wire.

2053
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,340
They need guns to protect

2054
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,741
a monument to a pacifist?

2055
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,610
I mean, if a man like Gandhi

2056
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,744
can't transform people--

2057
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,880
Mr. Harper, come.

2058
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,682
I want to show you something.

2059
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,116
Come and see.

2060
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:53,555
This is Dr. Rama.

2061
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:54,823
He was a child

2062
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:55,791
in a leper colony.

2063
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:57,526
He got treatment because

2064
01:24:57,526 --> 01:24:59,895
we were able to reach him.

2065
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:01,763
The money you raised for the

2066
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,799
mobile clinic has changed the

2067
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:04,900
lives of many more people

2068
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,301
like him.

2069
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:09,304
(sighs)

2070
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,641
What is it?

2071
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,476
Mother Teresa, what is it

2072
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:15,644
that you expect to achieve

2073
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:18,447
in your lifetime?

2074
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,848
More.

2075
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,483
More, more, always more.

2076
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,485
But don't you see?

2077
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,220
Your beloved poor, these--

2078
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:25,921
these people that you call the

2079
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:27,689
blessed ones, are the result of

2080
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,958
a criminal failure of society.

2081
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,460
Isn't it better to correct

2082
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,228
the causes instead of treat

2083
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,629
the symptoms?

2084
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,564
Someone must comfort

2085
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:37,466
the poor.

2086
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,601
But that's the problem.

2087
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,269
With all due respect,

2088
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,604
Mother Teresa,

2089
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:43,872
Nobel Peace Prizes do little

2090
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,207
more than appease the conscience

2091
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:46,642
of the world. We can all shed

2092
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,910
a tear because someone like you

2093
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,446
is taking care of the needy.

2094
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:52,514
And then, when the speeches have

2095
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:53,782
been made, we go right on

2096
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:56,818
living our numb, ignorant lives.

2097
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,754
Maybe our work will inspire

2098
01:25:58,754 --> 01:25:59,821
others who are better able

2099
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,289
to change conditions.

2100
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:02,457
Not if you continue to make

2101
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:03,492
the poor into some kind of a

2102
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,761
holy icon, Christ's body on

2103
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:07,562
Earth-- they're not Christ!

2104
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:08,897
What good is it to pretend

2105
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,866
that they're saints?

2106
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,834
We owe them everything.

2107
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,970
You have Western mentality.

2108
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,705
You expect too much

2109
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:19,975
from poor humanity.

2110
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:20,976
No, Mother, I--

2111
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:22,544
I think you do.

2112
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:26,481
You expect infinite forgiveness.

2113
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:27,516
How can you forgive the

2114
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,819
violence, the corruption?

2115
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,354
Why don't you get angry?

2116
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:33,655
I get angry, Mr. Harper,

2117
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:35,657
I get angry often.

2118
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:37,392
When I find an abandoned child,

2119
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:38,927
I get angry.

2120
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,362
I got angry when I first saw

2121
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:41,530
Rama living in inhuman

2122
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,731
conditions.

2123
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:43,999
I get angry when I see young

2124
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:45,867
girls brutalized and raped

2125
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,702
during the wars.

2126
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,671
I am angry.

2127
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,840
But I have to forgive.

2128
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,774
Otherwise, how can I do

2129
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,476
the work?

2130
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:57,546
I forgive, but I don't accept.

2131
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,685
Well, I--

2132
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,921
I don't understand, Mother.

2133
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,723
I don't think I ever will.

2134
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:09,891
Will you do one last thing

2135
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,693
for me, Mr. Harper,

2136
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,795
before you go?

2137
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,572
(man speaking foreign language)

2138
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,439
Come on, come on, come on,

2139
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,075
come on.

2140
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,378
(man continues speaking)

2141
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,847
Excuse me, excuse me?

2142
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:33,048
What-- what, uh--

2143
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:36,384
what is he saying?

2144
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,886
(speaks foreign language)

2145
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,824
He's giving you his blessings.

2146
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:46,528
He was blessing me?

2147
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:47,395
Yes.

2148
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,497
I could buy him a million

2149
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:49,898
times over with the change

2150
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,767
in my pocket.

2151
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,635
Yes, but you couldn't

2152
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,370
buy his blessing.

2153
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,787
I never thought that I would,

2154
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,723
uh...

2155
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,825
when you cross that line.

2156
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:17,959
If I had not picked up that

2157
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,427
first person dying on the

2158
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,029
streets, I never would have

2159
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,864
picked up the thousands after.

2160
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,735
(patting leg)

2161
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,716
(applause)

2162
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,453
Welcome, Mother Teresa.

2163
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:46,755
On behalf of the Nobel

2164
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:48,056
Peace Prize Committee

2165
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,158
and the citizens of Oslo.

2166
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,526
His Majesty, the King,

2167
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:52,861
greets you and looks forward

2168
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:53,829
to meeting you personally

2169
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,631
at the ceremonial banquet.

2170
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,866
Banquet?

2171
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,569
Tomorrow night in your honor.

2172
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,070
Oh, please,

2173
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,805
have this banquet cancelled.

2174
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,440
Cancelled?

2175
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,808
Put aside the funds to feed

2176
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:07,776
the hungry and the poor

2177
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:08,977
in Calcutta.

2178
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:10,078
There, it can provide hundreds

2179
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,514
of meals for one whole year.

2180
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:13,815
All right?

2181
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,517
All right.

2182
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,452
Hello, beautiful child.

2183
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,588
God bless you.

2184
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:21,590
Mother Teresa? Mother Teresa?

2185
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:22,924
(overlapping chatter)

2186
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,060
Bless you.

2187
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,761
Bless you.

2188
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:30,832
Bless you.

2189
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,937
(applause)

2190
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,174
I accept this award for the

2191
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:41,643
glory of God,

2192
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:42,611
and in the name

2193
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:44,479
of the hungry,

2194
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,715
of the naked,

2195
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,217
of the homeless,

2196
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,186
of the crippled,

2197
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:52,787
the lepers,

2198
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:55,190
and the blind.

2199
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:56,691
In the name of all those

2200
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,194
who feel unwanted,

2201
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,829
unloved,

2202
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,197
uncared for,

2203
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:04,766
humiliated.

2204
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,501
In their name, I accept

2205
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:09,004
this award, because it will

2206
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:12,107
bring an understanding love

2207
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:15,844
between the rich and the poor.

2208
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:18,146
Because all of us here,

2209
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:20,749
we are proclaiming to the poor

2210
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,651
that we love them,

2211
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:25,186
that they too have been created,

2212
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:28,123
by the loving hand of God,

2213
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:31,126
to love and to be loved.

2214
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:35,263
If we turn our back on the poor,

2215
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,800
we are turning our back on God.

2216
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,569
And at the hour of our death,

2217
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:43,872
we shall be judged by what we

2218
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:47,542
have done for and to the poor.

2219
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:50,512
God bless you all.

2220
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:53,615
