00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:17,880
"I'm warning you, I'm
going to get angry. Do you see?

3
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:20,816
"We are going to have fun
on this island, understand?

4
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,351
"We are going to have fun
on this island.

5
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:25,020
"'Come now,' said the
Lord of the Flies.

6
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:28,624
"Get back to the others and
we'll forget the whole thing.

7
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:31,694
"This has gone quite far enough,
my poor, misguided child.

8
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:33,997
"Do you think you know
better than I do?"

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,601
Okay, so we have civilization
versus savagery,

10
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:40,803
and reason versus impulse.

11
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,808
So many exciting themes
in one little book, right?

12
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,713
Over the break, I want you to
read the next three chapters.

13
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,716
That's three chapters, and
I want you to write two pages...

14
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,250
on either one of our themes,
your choice.

15
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:56,218
Demerius.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,923
Care to read us out to the bell?

17
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,690
No, no, no, not that one.

18
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:03,793
The one that you have on your
lap there. What is it?

19
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:06,630
Uh... Demon Sword Z.

20
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:12,103
Okay, let's hear it. Oh, come
on. Let's finish class strong.

21
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:17,306
"Now I have the power
of the five souls.

22
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:19,341
"Let us see what the
Gauntlet of Destiny...

23
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,744
"has to say about that,
demon lover.

24
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:25,148
"Then, the squid leg splits
Okami-san in half.

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,817
"Blood sprays everywhere."

26
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,755
This is 26% stronger than
anything else on the market.

27
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,823
It lasts up to four hours.

28
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,892
Not only are the lips fuller...

29
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,860
they're the most fantastic
color.

30
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:41,031
Slight tingle at first,
but it's so worth it.

31
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,999
Better than collagen.

32
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,434
Where is this from?

33
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:49,104
The Orient... a lot of the
formulas are secret.

34
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,373
I own the North American rights.

35
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,041
Oh, that's lovely.

36
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,311
And this would be an exclusive
for Harold's.

37
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,781
Hm.

38
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,817
That's really starting to work.

39
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,085
What kind of comic is this?

40
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,086
It's not a comic, it's manga.

41
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:06,255
"Put your demon powers in me,
squid.

42
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,457
"I want to feel your might
deep within."

43
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,393
Damn, its tentacles are like
its dicks.

44
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:12,728
Zack, your right.

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,064
"Hold back nothing, my pet.

46
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,097
After I summon the demon,
all you can..."

47
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,100
Mr. Moss. Hello.

48
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,768
We found some surprising
thematic similarities...

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,137
between Lord of the Flies...

50
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,344
Okay, all right.
You owe me two pages.

51
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,780
Have a really good break.

52
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,148
Where is this from?

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,149
Asia.

54
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,223
D-P-R-K... isn't that
North Korea?

55
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:44,761
You're trying to sell Harold's
a North Korean product?

56
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:45,762
Maybe.

57
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,329
The North Korea against which...

58
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,333
the United States has
an embargo?

59
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,369
Now, that embargo is kind
of like Cuba, you know?

60
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,205
It's sort of symbolic.

61
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,808
20 years, Kate. Seen it all.

62
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,076
Right.

63
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,113
Well, maybe not sex
with an octopus.

64
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,981
That was a first.

65
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,782
That was mine, too.

66
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:07,750
Please.

67
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,254
I wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue...

68
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,288
because I see something
we both share.

69
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,524
A deep love for this school.

70
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:17,994
Go Falcons.

71
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:20,196
I wanna do a little
right-brained thinking...

72
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,930
about a left-brain problem.

73
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,866
Are we talking about the ARB
test scores?

74
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,102
I'm talking about empowerment.

75
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:29,272
I'm saying let's be the change.

76
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:35,011
Let's not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations.

77
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:38,180
Um... are you firing me?

78
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:39,281
What?

79
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,949
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,985
I'm trying to ground floor
the discussions...

81
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,120
so we don't waste our school's
resources on arbitration...

82
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,422
and severance packages.

83
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:49,191
Those things threaten the school
that we love.

84
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,994
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

85
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,363
Sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache...

86
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,566
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post.

87
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,434
You want me to quit?

88
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,304
No. That's a personal decision.
What I want doesn't matter.

89
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,273
But I will say this...

90
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:08,077
I see you flourishing in a
slightly less urban teaching...

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,215
environment or perhaps in an
altogether different...

92
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,185
Can I admit something?

93
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:18,124
You always have great hair.

94
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,324
Perhaps you'd be happy
cutting hair.

95
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,293
Look, I took this meeting...

96
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,361
because Lucas spoke
highly of you.

97
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,197
He better have.

98
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,533
But I don't think this
is a good fit for Harold's.

99
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,834
Best of luck.

100
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,070
Seriously? That's it?

101
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,339
Just because of where
a product's made?

102
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,942
A bit racist, don't you think?

103
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:41,077
Okay, we're done.

104
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,111
No, you're done.

105
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:46,315
Because I'll take my business
elsewhere.

106
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:47,550
Where's the bathroom?

107
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,188
Uh, there.

108
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,793
Oh my god. Oh...

109
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:03,301
What the fuck?
That's my fucking car! Fuck!

110
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,515
There she is!

111
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,483
Hey, how'd it go?

112
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:23,519
Come dance with me!

113
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:24,586
What's going on?

114
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:27,225
Shake that bony ass of yours!

115
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:31,159
Woo!

116
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:33,228
What is happening?
Did you sell it?

117
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,567
Party bump!

118
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,303
Meg, did you sell it?

119
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,305
Can we finally get rid of all
these boxes?

120
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,507
Remember all those little
North Korea stickers...

121
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,209
we peeled off the bottles?

122
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,610
Yeah, of course. There were,
like, 10,000 of them.

123
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:53,382
Well, it turns out
there's 10,001.

124
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:55,685
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

125
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:59,187
I am totally and thoroughly
fucked.

126
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,457
On the other hand my car
got towed.

127
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,692
How was your day?

128
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,694
Meg, it's...

129
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,329
I can't.

130
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,500
I don't even wanna talk
about it.

131
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:15,271
Wow, how much did you spend?

132
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,072
Oh, I'm gonna-I'm gonna
bring it back.

133
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,942
But I'm gonna keep some socks.

134
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,176
How was school?

135
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,947
Great.

136
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,716
Moss asked me to quit.

137
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,384
What?

138
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:31,721
He thinks that I'd be happier
cutting hair.

139
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,656
Did you point out that
he's bald as fuck?

140
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:37,360
No, I didn't tell him
he was bald as fuck.

141
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,329
Are you getting fired?

142
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,163
Excuse me.

143
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,699
I gotta get going.

144
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,666
Okay.

145
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,168
Can I get my clothes?

146
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,670
Oh, right.

147
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:49,372
Sorry.

148
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,039
I can't seem to... shirt, pants...

149
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,209
- Hi.
- Pants, pink underwear...

150
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,144
- Hi.
- Nope, that's mine.

151
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,182
Thanks for the lift.

152
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,317
You're gonna give me a good
review, right?

153
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,554
Five stars.

154
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:10,659
You buy socks and I suck...

155
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,329
Okay, okay, I got it,
I got it.

156
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,630
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

157
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:16,765
<i>Hey!</i>

158
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,300
<i>What?</i>

159
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,735
She's back?!

160
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:23,139
Oh my god! Holy shit.

161
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:27,010
<i>How's it going?</i>

162
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:30,079
That haircut took balls, you
have to hand it to her there.

163
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,481
Are we still drinking?

164
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,515
Hells to the yeah, mothafucka.

165
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,550
Sweet.

166
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:38,620
<i>I'm 28-years-old, I've had a
lot of success, and I'm ready.</i>

167
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:41,057
Meg, you're missing the abs.

168
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,226
<i>...with whom I spend the rest
of my life.</i>

169
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,293
Why do these girls play
hard to get?

170
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,596
If it was up to me I'd have his
pants around his ankles...

171
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,365
by the first commercial.

172
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,668
Well, it's a game.
They're playing strategy.

173
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,373
<i>...actually satisfy me
on a day-to-day basis.</i>

174
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,608
I actually think I'd be pretty
good on this show.

175
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,178
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,680
You're hardly competitive, dear.

177
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:07,617
You don't have an aggressive
bone in your body.

178
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,786
Against these girls, you'd have
to put on your big-girl pants...

179
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,721
or they'd have you for lunch.

180
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,589
<i>I think I'd describe myself as
definitely thinking outside...</i>

181
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,358
Whatever.

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,591
<i>I march to the beat
of my own drum.</i>

183
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,127
Ugh.

184
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,195
<i>A really nice day for me
is wak...</i>

185
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,197
I actually like the whole
construction worker thing.

186
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,765
You know, the whole, like,
works with his hands,

187
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,368
salt-of-the-earth motif.

188
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,603
The only thing salty about him
is his balls.

189
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,404
Lovely, Meg.

190
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:31,173
<i>Doesn't that just, like,
roll of your tongue-</i>

191
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,709
You can have him, if I can have
the fireman from last season.

192
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,511
Oh, that fireman.

193
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,813
He was a panty-dropper.

194
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,152
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

195
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,824
And for the record, just because
I don't sleep around...

196
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,225
doesn't mean I couldn't compete
against a group of women...

197
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,527
Did you just take a shot at me?
Was that a drive-by?

198
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,831
You drive-by-ed me.
"Big-girl pants"?

199
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,435
That was a slick move.
She's definitely getting a rose.

200
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:01,704
<i>I know it's crazy
to give out roses before...</i>

201
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:06,275
<i>the first rose ceremony,
but I don't care.</i>

202
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,845
You know, it's been a long day.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

203
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,583
I just opened a new bottle.
Come on, let's finish it.

204
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,251
No, I'm going to bed.

205
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,488
No morning re-cap.
I'm watching the rest.

206
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,455
<i>These girls mean nothing to me.</i>

207
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:23,161
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

208
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,863
Kate? Kate, wake up.

209
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,464
What, is there a fire?
No, there's no fire.

210
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:31,267
What's wrong? What's going on?

211
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,736
We're screwed up. Our lives,
things aren't going well.

212
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,438
Is it really 4:15?

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,406
Remember in the ninth grade
when you got stung...

214
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,474
by that jellyfish and I peed
on you and you got really mad?

215
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,209
Did you take one of my pills?

216
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,645
You were really mad until it
stopped hurting, right?

217
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:44,479
Yeah.

218
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,148
When you're faced with a
life-threatening problem...

219
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,518
which we are, you step away
from the problem...

220
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,854
and in a calm, adult way,
you self-medicate...

221
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,824
until the solution presents
itself.

222
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,358
Okay.

223
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,230
Preferably on a beach
with a margarita.

224
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,363
Okay, let's talk about it.

225
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,531
Yes! That's my girl.

226
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,932
Can we plan this in the morning?

227
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,334
No, we gotta go.

228
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,669
What? Where?

229
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,470
Fort Lauderdale...
I used your Sky Miles.

230
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,772
Today?

231
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,873
Now! Our flight's in three
hours.

232
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,943
Meg, absolutely not,
that's crazy.

233
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,478
I'm not going on vacation right
now. You're completely insane.

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,946
We are going
to miss this flight!

235
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:19,781
This is completely insane!

236
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,783
Why even ask me, if you're
gonna just make us...

237
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:22,818
miss the goddamn flight?

238
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,752
Sir, we can get out here.

239
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,253
Stop. Stop. Stop!

240
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,555
Don't yell at the poor guy.

241
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,924
Thank you, thank you, sir.

242
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,492
You pay the driver,
I'll get the bags.

243
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:32,695
Oh my god. Look at this line!

244
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,598
We are going to miss
this flight!

245
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,632
I cannot believe this.

246
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,768
I kept telling you that we had
to leave.

247
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,938
This happens every single
time. Look at this line!

248
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,605
There's no way we are making
this flight.

249
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,973
These are non-refundable
tickets.

250
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,742
I told you you can
take a bath...

251
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,911
or you can poach an egg
and not both.

252
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,814
Meg. Meg. What're you doing?

253
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,583
- Hold on.
- Get in line!

254
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,550
Excuse me.

255
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,520
My friend and I are about
to miss our flight.

256
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,689
Is there any way we can come
in this line?

257
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,857
Are you first class
or an Elite Club member?

258
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:05,795
We're first-class ladies.

259
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,897
Actually, I think I am
an Elite Club member...

260
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,364
if it didn't expire.

261
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,702
Hold on, let me check.

262
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,238
Ugh.

263
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,575
No, it's not... ugh.

264
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,345
Shoot. I guess not.

265
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,916
Sorry about that.

266
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:31,686
Thanks for your help.
And thanks for keeping us safe.

267
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:33,424
I just do check-in.

268
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,597
Why do you always do that?

269
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,268
- Do what?
- It's embarrassing.

270
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:52,211
Told you.

271
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:57,412
You can't just cut in front
of all these...

272
00:11:57,414 --> 00:12:01,383
Sorry. Ugh, sorry.

273
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:05,688
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

274
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,958
Oh my god, you are the sweetest
thing.

275
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,959
Don't worry about it.

276
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:15,564
You hungry?

277
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,436
You could have checked your bag.

278
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:21,671
I was trying to save some money.

279
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,738
- You okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,741
You got your headphones, pills,
neck pillow...

281
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

282
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,012
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be epic.

283
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,314
Yeah.

284
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,651
Deep breath.

285
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,919
Ma'am, no liquids
above 3.4 ounces.

286
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,454
You can dispose of it in that
trash can right there.

287
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,826
You want me to get rid of it?
Sure thing.

288
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:55,907
Whew!

289
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,078
It's easier when it's a beer.

290
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,046
Have a good flight.

291
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,948
Deep breath, girl.

292
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,719
We're going to Florida.
It's gonna be so much fun.

293
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,589
Think of the beach,
think of the sunshine.

294
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,424
Here's your neck pillow.

295
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,959
Six hours in the air.
Up and down.

296
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,361
Please don't say "down".

297
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,862
We're still on the ground.

298
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,031
Yeah, I know, but we're high
enough already.

299
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,965
Middle seats are for suckers,
right?

300
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,068
You know what? I actually think
it'd be better if we switched.

301
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,403
I would, but I need extra
legroom.

302
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,073
It's sort of a Gandalf-Bilbo
situation.

303
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,574
And I'm the hobbit?

304
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,611
Oh my... I'm just saying,
I'm taller.

305
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:36,878
Here, take a pill.

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,980
- I already took a pill.
- Take another.

307
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,749
Okay.

308
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,118
- I'll get you a water.
- No, I don't need any water...

309
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,554
Excuse me, can she
get a water...

310
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:47,589
so she can take her
anti-anxiety pill?

311
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,724
Certainly.

312
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,459
Can we please keep this
to ourselves?

313
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,695
I was just trying to help.

314
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,963
It's not like I gave him
your social.

315
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,397
Just quit with the flirty
routine...

316
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,831
it's getting really old.

317
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,535
I wasn't. Geez.
Take a deep breath, girl.

318
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,536
I'm surprised you didn't show
him your bra.

319
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,540
I think he might try and wear
it, am I right? Uh-oh.

320
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:07,877
Oh my god. Oh, my god!

321
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,612
Soda's coming up.

322
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,847
Oh, Jesus Christ, Meg.

323
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,715
I feel like I am in your
intestines.

324
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:14,749
- Take it.
- Stop it!

325
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,185
- Take it.
- Oh my god!

326
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,685
I got one more comin', too.

327
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,759
Excuse me. I think
I'm in the middle there.

328
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,409
Thank you.

329
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,648
Hi.

330
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,052
Here's your water.

331
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,855
- Thank you.
- Dear lord.

332
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,204
I'm Meg, by the way.

333
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,972
Ryan.

334
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:12,775
So what is it, Ryan?
Business or pleasure?

335
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:14,676
It's a wedding, actually.

336
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,778
Ah, which can sometimes feel
like work, right?

337
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,247
Mm.

338
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,015
I feel like last year,
I was at somebody's wedding...

339
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,550
every other weekend.

340
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,486
Yeah, they uh... come in waves,
don't they?

341
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,720
Yeah.

342
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:26,955
How about you?

343
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,891
- What brings you out?
- I have...

344
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,261
A girl's trip. I kinda hate that
expression, but it's true.

345
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:35,730
We are on a trip and we are
girls.

346
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:36,965
Okay, so you two are together?

347
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,800
Yeah, we're best friends.

348
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:41,036
We're just sitting in these
seats because, you know...

349
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,671
middle seats are for suckers.

350
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:47,478
Ah, my, uh, reputation
precedes me.

351
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,080
I love weddings.

352
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,549
As long as they're other
people's.

353
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,816
Yeah, that's the truth, right?

354
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,887
Single ladies in the house.

355
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,189
I'm Kate, by the way.

356
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,790
Hey, Ryan. It's good
to meet you.

357
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:02,892
You too.

358
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,759
I'm still Meg. Look at us!

359
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,762
Meg Ryan. We're America's
sweetheart.

360
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,565
Do you remember that deli scene?

361
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,166
Yeah, yeah, the, uh, "I'll have
what she's having".

362
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:20,709
I think that my roommate
is trying to do a scene...

363
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,545
from When Harry Met Slarry.

364
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,146
When Harry Met Smarly.

365
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:28,850
When Harry Met Smarly.
When... Smarly Met...

366
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,219
You okay?

367
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:32,921
Is she having a stroke?

368
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,556
- She's fine. She's just...
- Smarly...

369
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,791
- Terrified of flying.
- M-marley.

370
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,060
She took some pharmaceuticals.

371
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:40,228
- Stay there.
- I'm jealous.

372
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,033
It's gonna be all right.

373
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:46,834
Well, I'll, uh, stop bothering
you guys.

374
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,771
Oh, you're not bothering...

375
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,075
<i>Hello, folks.</i>

376
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,911
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

377
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,714
<i>Hurricane Cindy has headed
toward the Carolinas...</i>

378
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,748
<i>but it looks like she's
taken a bit of a turn...</i>

379
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,819
<i>and now they're re-directing
us to land in St. Louis.</i>

380
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:05,921
<i>We'll keep you updated as we
receive additional information.</i>

381
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:07,021
Oh, man.

382
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,224
Since when is there a hurricane?

383
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:12,827
It's... been in the news,
like all week.

384
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,230
I'm not much of a news junkie.
I'm more of a bookworm.

385
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,066
This is just a hate-read.

386
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:25,975
Excuse me, ladies, I'm gonna
need you to... oh, god.

387
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,042
Really?

388
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,277
Did you need something?

389
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,180
Put your seat up, and your
friend, too, please.

390
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,917
Kate? Kate. Wake up
for the male steward.

391
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,620
It's "flight attendant".
I'm moving her forward.

392
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,054
We're landing soon.

393
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,221
Holy shit.

394
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:44,093
Uh... is she... is she okay?

395
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,096
Let me just...

396
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,669
We're good. We're good.

397
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,690
Welcome to The Sheraton.

398
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,825
This is the pits.
Fuck you, Cindy.

399
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,094
Who's Cindy?

400
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,029
The hurricane.

401
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,865
I dunno, it looks like kinda
good weather for a hurricane.

402
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,768
The hurricane's in Florida,
we're in St. Louis.

403
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,874
Jesus, you took way
too many pills.

404
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,678
Welcome to the St. Louis
Sheraton, I am Anuj.

405
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,312
- How are we today?
- Not good, Anuj.

406
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,980
The airline says they
lost my bag.

407
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,049
They did? Did they lose mine?

408
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,017
No, they didn't.
You didn't check a bag.

409
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,453
Oh, right, I didn't check a bag.

410
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,322
My apologies, we're tight
on space...

411
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:48,923
because of the annual
jewelry convention.

412
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,892
Jewelers have conventions?

413
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:54,129
However, I can put you both
in a lovely junior suite.

414
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,430
Now, while you're here...

415
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,998
please enjoy our four-star
restaurant...

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,434
pool, spa, and complimentary
shuttle service...

417
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,938
to the majestic St. Louis Arch
and finally, Tut's Tomb...

418
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,007
the number one nightclub
in St. Louis two years running.

419
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,742
For that, take the elevator
down to P1.

420
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,745
That's super, but we're only
here for one night.

421
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,113
Excellent. Well, if you
enjoy your stay,

422
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,218
I do hope you'll consider
Yelping us.

423
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,250
Ugh. God.

424
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:18,754
This is what we get for being
spontaneous.

425
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,024
Oh my god, what is that color?

426
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,192
It's not a lipstick,
it's my Lip Lacerater.

427
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,361
Oh, it's fantastic.

428
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,029
Thanks.

429
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:31,467
Oh, hey, it's my seat mates.

430
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,267
Good to see you among
the living.

431
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,769
Yeah, thank you.

432
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,404
Okay, I need to go down
one more I think.

433
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm gonna work off some travel
frustration at the gym.

434
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:40,808
Oh, god, your friend's wedding.

435
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,376
Yeah, yeah. It's not
for a few days.

436
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,779
I was, uh, going down early
for the bachelor party...

437
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,815
but those guys'll be fine.

438
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,851
No natural disaster's gonna
stop my buds...

439
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,121
from getting embarrassingly
drunk.

440
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:57,926
Hey, um, you guys wanna get
a drink later on tonight?

441
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:01,363
Might as well make the best
of this, right?

442
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,030
- Yeah. Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

443
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,799
- I like... I like to drink.
- She does.

444
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,335
Not a lot, not to excess, but...

445
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,970
Alcohol.

446
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,271
Cool. How about 8:00?

447
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,141
Yeah, yeah, it's a date.

448
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,842
Well, not a date, but a plan.

449
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:16,111
Yeah.

450
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,447
- Have a good workout.
- Stretch, don't forget!

451
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:21,216
- Now don't... do gym.
- Don't hurt yourself.

452
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,818
- Oh, not bad.
- And it smells nice, too.

453
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,787
- Not bad at all.
- Yeah.

454
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,356
And look at us, having drinks
with a hot guy.

455
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:30,825
Hey, he's having drinks with us.

456
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,561
Right.

457
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:35,930
And who knows? Maybe one of us
will hook up, if he's lucky.

458
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,865
He might go for you.

459
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:40,869
Or you. You're gorgeous,
especially when you're loaded.

460
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:43,238
I am not, I look like
Mickey Rourke.

461
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,341
Enough with Mickey Rourke.
Why do you always say that?

462
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:48,811
- It's how I feel.
- Stop it.

463
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:51,246
You're beautiful.

464
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:55,484
This is called "Man Getting Out
of Cold Lake". Boop. Boop.

465
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,853
Ugh, thank god I packed
my Spanx.

466
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,154
Oh my god, my bag.

467
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:01,456
Can I borrow a dress?

468
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,526
Oh, I'm so sorry, I only packed
one.

469
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,862
Can I wear it?

470
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,229
No.

471
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:09,096
Well, what if you...

472
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,299
No.

473
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:12,968
Anuj.

474
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,335
Is there a mall around here?

475
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:16,004
Can you hold on one second,
please?

476
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,605
- What's that?
- The closest mall?

477
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,975
Uh, that would be the Westgate
Pavilion near the arch.

478
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,943
- How far is the arch?
- 30 minutes without traffic.

479
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,578
Damn it. I need a dress.

480
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,479
We can call a taxi for you.
June, will you please call...

481
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,217
No, I need one now, tonight.

482
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,985
What would you like me to do?

483
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:31,186
Fine.

484
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,554
Sir, are you still there?

485
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:34,488
Yeah, Okay, so those last
three digits...

486
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,191
How do I leave a review on Yelp?

487
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,927
Can you hold on just one more
second, please?

488
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,568
Hey. Wow.

489
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,371
Right?

490
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,073
Where's your other half?

491
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,875
I don't know. Might just be me.

492
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,644
Well, you uh, you look
very nice.

493
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:59,581
Thank you. I didn't pack too
much 'cause it's really...

494
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,316
just a girl's trip,
but I thought, you know...

495
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,951
I thought I'd try something
with what I have...

496
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:06,057
Holy shit.

497
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:10,992
You look amazing.

498
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:13,094
You like it? I wasn't sure
I could pull it off.

499
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:14,930
No, no. You look great.

500
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,632
Meg's an expert at pulling
off a dress.

501
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:21,068
Okay, uh, let me go see
if I can snag us a booth.

502
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,005
Where did you get that?

503
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,641
The Indian dude at the front
desk. His mom loaned it to me.

504
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,074
Crazy, right?

505
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:28,410
That is so crazy.

506
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:30,511
Hey there, you ladies here
for Jewel Con?

507
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,546
No, uh, we're just... we're
meeting some friends.

508
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:36,084
Yes, yes, you are... us.
<i>Namaste.</i>

509
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,586
I'm Craig, precious gems
are my specialty.

510
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:41,989
Chuck here is in, uh, high-end
watch repair.

511
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:44,191
Shahar does imports.

512
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,594
"Shahar" is Hebrew
for "sunrise"...

513
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:50,665
which you will experience
tomorrow morning in my bed.

514
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,500
That was smooth.
That was very smooth.

515
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:53,501
She didn't refuse, that's good.

516
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,304
- Yeah, well...
- I have cocaine.

517
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,305
Whoa, Chuck, put it away.

518
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:59,007
He's very excited he has
cocaine.

519
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,409
He's been showing it to
everybody.

520
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:03,577
I smuggled it on the plane
in my underpants.

521
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,515
Enough about us, and you guys
are...?

522
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,449
Undercover federal agents
investigating...

523
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,184
a counterfeit diamond ring.

524
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,720
So you can either step aside
and let us do our job...

525
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:15,023
or I'll give Kate here the green
light to shove her taser...

526
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,424
in your ass and light you up.

527
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,526
Okay, sorry, officers.

528
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,163
Let's go.

529
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:35,443
Hey. I glommed on to
some fellow travelers.

530
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:38,279
This is Roger and Nancy,
Kate and Meg.

531
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,681
Oh my god, you look like
a fucking princess.

532
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,184
Thanks, it's a sari.

533
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,988
Honey, you got nothing to be
sorry about.

534
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,123
Roger and Nancy are celebrating
their anniversary.

535
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,659
Ten years and I think
I'll keep her.

536
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,661
Aw.

537
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,062
That's sweet.

538
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:58,100
Shit. Category four?

539
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,700
So much for losing steam.

540
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:01,335
No one's getting out
of here tomorrow.

541
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,337
I'm not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner.

542
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,173
Oh, come on, don't think
like that.

543
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,677
Yeah, hurricanes are notoriously
unpredictable.

544
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,514
That's why they name them
after women, right?

545
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:15,683
It was a slam-dunk case, see
this guy didn't have a prayer...

546
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,120
but he did have this gorgeous
defense attorney.

547
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,721
Gorgeous and <i>gifted</i> defense
attorney.

548
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,090
All charges were dropped.

549
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:23,592
Well, not entirely...

550
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:26,128
I did manage to negotiate
into the plea bargain...

551
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,696
that Nancy go on a date with me.

552
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:31,432
First time in my career,
I got two men off in one day.

553
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:33,067
More than once, as I recall.

554
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,469
I could have you dis-barred,
you know?

555
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,505
Yeah? I could have you mounted.

556
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,774
- I'll mount you.
- Did you bring the cuffs?

557
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,741
- I'll blindfold you first.
- Oh, interrogation.

558
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,811
Or Q & A? Mm.

559
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:46,314
I think we lost them.

560
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,382
What about you guys?
What do you do?

561
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,251
I'm a CEO.

562
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:51,585
Wow.

563
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,788
I sell a line of skin care
products.

564
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,556
You know Michelle Obama?

565
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,824
Is she a client?

566
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,326
Well, obviously I can't talk
about it...

567
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,761
but how about her skin?

568
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:05,132
Damn. Damn.
What about you, Kate?

569
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,536
I'm a teacher...
I teach high school.

570
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,403
Oh, nice.

571
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,672
Special needs high school.

572
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:14,776
Wow. Is that hard?

573
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:18,212
You know what's hard is not
being with them right now.

574
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,115
A lot of people think that
I teach them... but...

575
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,717
but really, you know,
they teach me.

576
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,318
Yeah.

577
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,189
The blind teach me how
to listen better...

578
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,458
and the mute teach me...

579
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,796
you know, not to talk so much,
so I'm gonna stop.

580
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,700
Man, I can't compete with you
two. I'm just a firefighter.

581
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,606
<i>All right, what's up,
everybody? Come on.</i>

582
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:48,209
<i>Eh-yo, this is DJ Spooj,
rhymes with Anuj...</i>

583
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:52,380
<i>'cause we both gonna be on your
face by the end of the night.</i>

584
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:53,748
<i>All the junkies in the house
say "ho".</i>

585
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,650
Ho!

586
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,451
<i>All the wacky knickers
in the house say "ayo".</i>

587
00:25:57,453 --> 00:25:59,153
Eh-yo!

588
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:00,322
<i>All right, let's get to it.</i>

589
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:01,692
<i>Have a good night, everybody.</i>

590
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,161
You guys wanna dance?

591
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:08,162
Who me?

592
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:34,623
If you're having a good time.
You guys know what to do.

593
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,490
Yelp us.

594
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:18,767
<i>Oh shit, let's get a muh-fuckin
dance circle up in here!</i>

595
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:19,769
<i>Show DJ Spooj what you got!</i>

596
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:12,953
Meg! Hey! Your boob
is hanging out!

597
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,594
Got it.

598
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:29,304
How long was it out?

599
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,640
20 seconds.

600
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:34,575
That's the length of a fucking
Geico commercial.

601
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,010
You know, I'm impressed
anyone...

602
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:38,281
could have upstaged
that flight attendant.

603
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,952
Well, this is you, guys.

604
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:47,488
I had a... I had a really good
time tonight.

605
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,959
Yeah, me too...
despite, you know...

606
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,596
- Night.
- Night.

607
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,599
Hey.

608
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,433
- Yeah?
- What's up?

609
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,701
You know, since we're gonna be
stuck here tomorrow...

610
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,836
it may be nice to see the city.

611
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:05,507
Maybe get a little crazy, buy a
St. Louis magnet for the fridge?

612
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,042
Yeah, I-I actually need
a magnet.

613
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,742
I have a fridge.

614
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,077
Great. Let's just connect
in the morning then.

615
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,613
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

616
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:13,914
Hey, you know what?

617
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,683
I uh, I'm actually gonna
ride up with you.

618
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:18,053
The uh, the ice machine on our
floor is broken, so...

619
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,821
- Oh.
- What do you need ice for?

620
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,555
Ice water.

621
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,824
Wait, you can't go.
I need you to open our door.

622
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,459
We... we both have keys.

623
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,995
I left mine in the room.

624
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,595
- I think that's the bell...
- Well here, whatever...

625
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:29,898
you can... you can just
take mine.

626
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,433
You know what?
I'll just go with you.

627
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,568
Don't be silly, you don't need
two people to get ice.

628
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,937
Thank you.

629
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,706
I just thought it would be
easier for you.

630
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,773
Elevator's closing, good luck
with the ice, guys.

631
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:40,040
- Oh, goodnight!
- Goodnight!

632
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,344
Ice? Really?

633
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:43,611
At least I didn't pull
my boob out.

634
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,946
Do you think I did that
on purpose?

635
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,448
I know that you did.
You have great tits.

636
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,649
That's insane!

637
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,351
Listen, I know you wanna
do your thing...

638
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:51,952
- Not the great tits part.
- But I actually like him.

639
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:55,023
- Well, I love him.
- You love him?

640
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,391
Yes, I love him.

641
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:58,026
You don't even know
his last name.

642
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,628
So? Do Romeo and Juliet know
each other's last name?

643
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,797
Yes! Montague and Capulet.

644
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,134
Oh, I'm an English teacher.

645
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:09,603
I want him.

646
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,707
Not this time.

647
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:15,043
You want me to choose?

648
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,878
Whichever, we're totally cool
with it.

649
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,947
Yeah, totally. I'm cool, too.

650
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:22,717
Well, I mean, they say the
St. Louis art museum's pretty...

651
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,652
great, but what a day to hit
the botanical gardens, right?

652
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:26,720
Or door number three.

653
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:31,025
Boom! A hot air balloon ride!

654
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:33,161
- Now that is rad.
- A balloon?

655
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,461
He said he wanted to see
the city.

656
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:35,963
This way he can see all of it.

657
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,767
Aw, man, this seems way more fun
than paintings and plants.

658
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,802
Yeah well, you know, it's not
just paintings, it's...

659
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:43,571
it's furniture and sculptures
and...

660
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:46,074
Oh, I forgot your fear
of heights.

661
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,177
Oh... oh, we don't have to do
the balloon ride.

662
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,711
Oh, no, I know.

663
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:51,845
How about you hit the museum...

664
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,815
Ryan and I will go
in the balloon...

665
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:55,150
and then we can all meet up
for dinner later.

666
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,017
Yeah, if you're scared
of flying.

667
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,819
No, I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

668
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:01,722
It's just airplanes, so I'll go.
I'm going.

669
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,525
- You sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

670
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,093
It'll be an adventure.

671
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:07,996
All right then... go ballooning.

672
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,863
The ride should last
about an hour.

673
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,600
My brother will follow us
in the chase car.

674
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:15,103
Make sure all personal
belongings are secure.

675
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,739
Also, for the lovers, we have
cold champagne for purchase.

676
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,775
Okay, any questions?

677
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:24,778
Um, I don't mean to be rude,
but can you see?

678
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,617
Uh, don't worry, ma'am.
I, uh, see just fine.

679
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,155
Just messing with you.
All right then.

680
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:36,857
Let's touch the sky!

681
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:39,594
Woo!

682
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,496
Here we go!

683
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:58,182
Yeah!

684
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,191
Wow.

685
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:13,026
Beautiful, isn't it?

686
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:15,697
St. Louis doesn't look so bad
from up here.

687
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,798
It's pretty spectacular, right?

688
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,801
Yeah, it's really great.

689
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:23,004
You okay? You're sweating.

690
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:25,239
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm just... I'm really hot.

691
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:28,910
It'll be nice and cool when we
hit about 2,000 feet.

692
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,277
How high are we right now?

693
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,581
500.

694
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:36,250
You, uh, you sure you're okay?

695
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:38,054
Yes, yes, yes.

696
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:43,624
No, no, no, no, no!
You get me down right now!

697
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:45,293
Get me down right now!

698
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,194
Ma'am, ma'am, we gotta go
up to catch the current.

699
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:49,162
Fuck the fucking current!

700
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:50,765
I think she's having a panic
attack.

701
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,065
- Oh, great.
- Ssh.

702
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,767
She's fine.

703
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,538
Breathe. Breathe.

704
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:00,775
Find your breath. Look at me.
Find your breath.

705
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:04,312
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to disappoint you.

706
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:07,180
Now let's take my hands,
stare into my eyes.

707
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:09,150
They're... so beautiful.

708
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:12,253
Like... like a... robin's egg.

709
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:14,956
Let's sing a song, you and me,
okay?

710
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,825

713
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:25,065
I don't know, it was the first
song that came to my head.

714
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,066
I kinda like her.

715
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:28,303

Let's drink some champagne and
really take in this view.

730
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,269
You know, I'm not sure
alcohol...

731
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:03,938
is a good idea for her
right now.

732
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,306
I wasn't talking about her.
She's fine.

733
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:08,675
This happens all the time.

734
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:11,278
- Ssh.
- Oh, you should go and have fun.

735
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,784
Hey, I am having fun.

736
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,186
Me, too. So much fun.

737
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,688
- Agh, my eye!
- Oh, shit! Shit!

738
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,191
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

739
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:24,726
Did you hit him in his good eye?

740
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,362
- She hit me in my only eye!
- What?!

741
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,796
Here, let me take a look,
let me take a look.

742
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:30,999
Is it bad? I can't see.

743
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:32,633
Yeah, you got a small cut.

744
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,135
- Oh god, he's crying blood!
- Your pupil is red.

745
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,104
- Shit! Shit!
- I don't think it's too serious.

746
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:38,072
- There's a little bit of blood.
- Oh my god we're gonna die!

747
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,742
Everybody calm down!
No one's going to die!

748
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,976
We're just gonna have to land
a little early, okay?

749
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:44,778
- Okay.
- Okay.

750
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,150
Now, I just gotta ask:
has anybody ever piloted...

751
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,789
a hot air balloon before?

752
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,322
What?

753
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:56,057
What the fuck are you talking
about?

754
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,925
Calm down! It's gonna
be all right!

755
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,004
- Are you okay?
- No!

756
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:11,673
Oh my god! Oh my god!

757
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:15,242
Can somebody call
for an ambulance?

762
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,398
Hey, how was the balloon ride?
Nice view of the arch, right?

763
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,934
It was great.

764
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:42,269
I have some good news
from the airlines.

765
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,871
The flight's back on?

766
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:45,305
No, they found your bag.

767
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:46,807
I'm so sorry, I should have
led with that.

768
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,842
Yes! Thank you, Anuj.

769
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:51,012
Well, shall we celebrate
being alive?

770
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,947
Honestly, I think
I'm just gonna relax.

771
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:56,316
I'm gonna go upstairs, call
Florida, maybe hit the pool.

772
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,418
- Oh, I'll join you!
- I'll come with you.

773
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,253
I love the pool.

774
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,155
Now that I have a suitcase,
I don't have to go naked.

775
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:03,227
Maybe I'll just go naked.

776
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,298
Oh my god, I hate myself.

777
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:15,304
I think I'm ready.

778
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:18,972
Oh, cute suit.

779
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,344
I'll see you by the pool.

780
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,769
Lacerater.

781
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:57,914
Can I get two Mai Tai's
over here?

782
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,194
Hey!

783
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,526
This is amazing.

784
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:15,229
You've got to try it.

785
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:17,030
It looks very inviting.

786
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:19,499
I was actually wondering if
you're not doing anything later-

787
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,869
First, I wasn't talking to you,
and second...

788
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,104
it's not gonna happen, okay?

789
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:25,139
Um, this is closed.

790
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:26,907
And it's not what you think,
that you're not hot enough...

791
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,976
because you're totally hot
enough.

792
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,280
I've dated way lower.

793
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:33,213
This seat is taken.

794
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:36,416
Guys, leave the seat next
to Meg open.

795
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:40,190
Come on, scoot. There you go.

796
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,325
- Huh.
- Seriously? What are you doing?

797
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,827
Yeah, I don't know.

798
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,528
Hey!

799
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,036
Hey, Ryan! Look, I snagged
us a chair.

800
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:59,139
Oh my god. Oh, Jesus mother
fu.... Oh... oh my god.

801
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:00,541
Oh my god, oh...

802
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,880
I think I might just lay
out for a bit.

803
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,316
Wow, you look great.

804
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:10,521
Oh, thanks.

805
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:12,989
Stop.

806
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:22,929
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

807
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:25,465
See, this is a definition
of "cock block".

808
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,367
I'm really sorry about today.

809
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,338
Thank you so much. I'm really...
I'm embarrassed.

810
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,941
Embarrassed? I'm the one
that sang Pink.

811
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,610
I have the feeling that
that's not the first time...

812
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,445
that you've sang that out loud.

813
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:38,646
No comment.

814
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,447
Wanna take a dip?

815
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:42,316
Um, actually I think we're
just gonna hang out here...

816
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:43,483
Yeah, I wouldn't mind swimming.

817
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,887
Yeah, me, too.
I'd love to do that.

818
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,454
I'll come, too.

819
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,927
- You don't see that much.
- What?

820
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,630
A hotel pool you can actually
dive in.

821
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,398
We love diving!

822
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,666
We used to go every summer
at your...

823
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,568
At my dad's houseboat!

824
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,271
You were so nervous to jump
in at first, remember?

825
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,972
You told me there were
piranhas in the lake...

826
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,307
and it freaked me out...
that was so mean of you.

827
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,342
You're just mad 'cause I always
beat you at diving.

828
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:10,945
That's 'cause your dad
was the judge.

829
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:11,979
I would have won with an
impartial jury.

830
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:13,380
I was so much better than you.

831
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:15,349
That's funny.

832
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:16,987
Well, you got one now.

833
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,231
Okay, let's start with the
basics. Jack knife.

834
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:35,302
You call that a jack knife?
That was more like a belly flop.

835
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:38,072
And deduct points for splash,
that's the Olympic rules.

836
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,307
Got it.

837
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:42,476
Now, a jack knife...
the right way.

838
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:43,512
Whoa.

839
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,081
Oh, shit.

840
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,519
Impartial judge gives you
a five... both of you.

841
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:54,454
Time to step it up, back flip.

842
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,092
Go on, do it.

843
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,262
Okay!

844
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,333
Nice!

845
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:07,503
That was your best back flip?

846
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,445
What're you doing?

847
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:21,081
Forward one-and-a-half tuck.

848
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,249
- Uh...
- What is that?

849
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:25,186
Are you crazy?
That is so dangerous.

850
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,153
- Still scared, I guess.
- No, I'm not scared.

851
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:29,557
It's gonna kick out.

852
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,130
Okay, fine, go ahead, go ahead,
do what you want.

853
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,465
Front one-and-a-half tuck.

854
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,570
- Oh my god.
- Ooh, oh, no!

855
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:46,039
That hurts.

856
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,775
Meg? Meg, are you all right?

857
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:52,581
Why are you just sitting
down there? Are you okay?

858
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,220
Meg? Are you coming up?

859
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,692
Meg, are you alive? Meg!

860
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,016
Hi.

861
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:27,550
Hey.

862
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,421
Are we drinking?

863
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,158
She'll have a Screwdriver.

864
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:41,662
Not so much ice.

865
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:43,333
Just three cubes.

866
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:47,767
Are you okay?

867
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:50,637
Yeah. Actually, no.

868
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,405
I think I turned my eyelid
inside out.

869
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:54,340
Oh, there's my girls.

870
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:56,309
Can I have two Tequila Sunrises?

871
00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:57,811
Did you hear the weather report?

872
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,813
They said that the hurricane
has passed through...

873
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:02,148
so you two might get a little
beach time after all.

874
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,516
Hm.

875
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:04,617
Great.

876
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,387
Ah, great.

877
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,787
Yeah, a few days of a time share
isn't as good as a week...

878
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,624
but you know, I'll take
what I can get.

879
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:14,561
I'm not gonna see Roger
again for a month.

880
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:15,695
Is he traveling?

881
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:18,398
Back to the wife and kids.

882
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,833
Thank you.

883
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,235
I-I'm sorry, back to where?

884
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,637
Roger's married, just not to me.

885
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,405
You were celebrating your
anniversary.

886
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,809
Of a love affair.

887
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:31,878
Fuck you, don't judge me.
'Cause I don't like that.

888
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,380
'Cause let me tell you
something.

889
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:36,450
I am a lady who demands
perfection, okay?

890
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:37,517
Is it fair to his wife?

891
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,519
No.

892
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:39,686
Is it fair to his kids?

893
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:41,387
No.

894
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't care.

895
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:45,626
Because I would do anything
for Roger.

896
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:47,595
I would die for that man.

897
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:49,262
Wow.

898
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:50,697
It's true. I'd kill for him.

899
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,633
I'd kill his family,
I'd kill his wife.

900
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:53,900
Anybody got in my way,
I'd kill 'em.

901
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:55,735
Right there. Kill 'em.

902
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,670
I'd kill you, I'd kill you,
I'd kill everyone.

903
00:42:57,672 --> 00:43:00,209
And I know how to do it, too,
'cause my brother's a Navy Seal.

904
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,545
I'm just kidding!

905
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:05,514
Oh...

906
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:11,151
It was a joke. But seriously,
you know?

907
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,887
Sometimes you just gotta take
what you want...

908
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:14,621
whatever the cost.

909
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,624
Because at the end of the day,
nobody gives a shit...

910
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:19,459
whether you're happy or not,
you know what I'm sayin'?

911
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:21,264
You can put their drinks
on my tab.

912
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:25,568
Thanks for everything, guys.

913
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,376
- Ryan!
- Ryan!

914
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,880
- No, no, no!
- Wait! Wait up!

915
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:41,447
- Oh, hey!
- There he is.

916
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:42,849
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

917
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:45,519
I uh, was actually looking
for you two.

918
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:47,655
Oh, well, look and you shall
find.

919
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:49,722
Yeah, I wanted to see you guys
before I left.

920
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:51,559
There's my road buddy.

921
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:52,559
Hey.

922
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:53,793
- Ladies.
- Hi.

923
00:43:53,795 --> 00:43:55,195
How's your eye, Meg?

924
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:56,729
- It's fine.
- It looks a little...

925
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:58,365
You're leaving now?

926
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,800
Yeah, didn't you see
the weather report?

927
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,601
Our flight's gonna be back
on any moment.

928
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:04,304
I'm out of time. I just,
you know, can't take the chance.

929
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:05,572
If we drive through the night...

930
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:06,874
I can get you to Fort
by morning.

931
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:07,974
What fort?

932
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:10,211
Oh, local speak,
Fort Lauderdale.

933
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:12,579
You're going on a road trip
with a complete stranger?

934
00:44:12,581 --> 00:44:15,583
He could be a serial killer
for all you know.

935
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:17,450
I'm not a serial killer.

936
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:20,320
That's exactly what a serial
killer would say.

937
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:22,423
You're something, you know that?
Let's hit the road.

938
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:23,523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:25,626
Serial killer. That's great.

940
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:29,295
Awesome meeting you both.

941
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:30,933
- Bye.
- Bye.

942
00:44:34,402 --> 00:44:36,705
All right.

943
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,108
Yeah, okay.

944
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,780
- Bye.
- Wait!

945
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,483
- Got room for one more?
- Oh, shit.

946
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,851
I'll just be one minute.

947
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:53,954
Hey, you know what?
Make that... make that two!

948
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,193
I'll be right back, okay?

949
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:01,427
I can't help it.
I love fucked up women.

950
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,807
I gotta say, I did not see
this coming.

951
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:15,809
A little company, a little
conversation.

952
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:17,811
Usually I'd just be
blasting my tunes.

953
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:19,545
Uh, by the way, are you guys
on Google Plus?

954
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:21,447
- No.
- No, I'm on Tinder.

955
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,784
Well, get on it. We should all
be in each other's circles.

956
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:25,519
How long is the drive?

957
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,320
Oh, it'll be no time at all.
I know all the back ways.

958
00:45:27,322 --> 00:45:28,956
Uh, 17 hours?

959
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,590
I've got a million songs
on this thing...

960
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:32,425
so we're all covered on music.

961
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:36,329
Right now we're listening
to the "south on I-24 mix".

962
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:38,666
Please wait four songs
before complaining.

963
00:45:38,668 --> 00:45:41,802
This is gonna be fun.
Seven hours, no sweat.

964
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,604
Seventeen.

965
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:44,908
Oh.

966
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,842
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

967
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:54,447
a banana, an egg, a frog,
a um...

968
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,083
griffon, a haberdasher,

969
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:59,086
an icicle, a jackalope,
and a knight.

970
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:00,787
Ha!

971
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:02,523
It was "k", and you're an
English teacher!

972
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:04,691
No, it is "k", it's "k",
like a knight in shining armor.

973
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:06,626
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

974
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:09,496
a banana, a Chihuahua, a
dolphin, an egg, a frog...

975
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:12,066
a griffon, a haberdasher, an
icicle, a jackalope...

976
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:14,635
a knight, and a labradoodle.

977
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:16,704
- Meg, it's your turn!
- Nice work!

978
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,405
Ok, I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I hate this fucking game.

979
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:26,412
- Gin.
- Son of a bitch.

980
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:27,780
You know what?
I wanna sit in the back.

981
00:46:27,782 --> 00:46:28,981
- I'd hate me, too.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

982
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,784
- No, no switching!
- It's my turn!

983
00:46:30,786 --> 00:46:33,487
- No, no, hey, hey, no switching!
- What're you doing?

984
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:34,688
Get back in the front.

985
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,688
Just get right there.

986
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,124
Go, so I can sit here!

987
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,760
- What're you doing?
- It's my turn!

988
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,367
- Hey.
- Thank you.

989
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:49,972
They always put too much
ice in this.

990
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:54,541
Ah, what're you doing?

991
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,646
Come on. Ugh.

992
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:09,423
Oh my god. Oh my god, did you
seriously do that?

993
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:11,492
- That is disgusting.
- Oooh.

994
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,459
Oh my god. Oh my god! Open down
the window!

995
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:14,862
- Agh, dude!
- For God's sakes!

996
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:16,563
That is disgusting!

997
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,429
It smells nice.

998
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,166
It's lavender. It's great
for dry skin.

999
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:55,101
Not that you have any.

1000
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:57,137
Feels good.

1001
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:00,106
Minerals, essential vitamins,
and extracts.

1002
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,775
Also a shit ton of honey.

1003
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:04,644
It's like sticking your hand
in a beehive.

1004
00:48:04,646 --> 00:48:06,179
Careful, don't get stung.

1005
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:08,514
Oh my god.

1006
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:10,450
- What?
- It's from Meg's mom.

1007
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:11,985
I texted her to wish her
a happy birthday and...

1008
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:13,753
It's not her birthday.

1009
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,088
She sent me this photo of when
we were in high school.

1010
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,722
What photo?

1011
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:19,726
Oh my god. When is this from?

1012
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:21,561
It's, uh, prom.

1013
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:23,063
What is that on your head?

1014
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:24,932
- It's um...
- It's nothing, it's just a hat.

1015
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,999
It's a helmet. It's a protective
helmet... for her skull.

1016
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:28,836
Uh, may I see?

1017
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:31,472
Oh, yeah, my nephew had one
of those when he was three...

1018
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:33,706
and a half months old,
'cause his head was shaped...

1019
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,775
like a zucchini and they were
trying to reshape it.

1020
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,043
Was your head shaped
like a zucchini?

1021
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,512
No, I just had migraines.

1022
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:39,912
She had this really rare
condition.

1023
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:42,483
It was um, what was it?
It was complex...

1024
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,217
Complex chiari malformation.

1025
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:47,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
Malformation. It was horrible.

1026
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:49,055
The kids just called her
horrible names.

1027
00:48:49,057 --> 00:48:51,191
She wore the thing for six
months. It was terrible.

1028
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:53,860
That sucks. Man, kids can
be so mean, you know?

1029
00:48:53,862 --> 00:48:55,431
Yeah.

1030
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,202
Scrotum head.

1031
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:02,001
Reservoir tip.

1032
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:03,202
Captain Retard.

1033
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:06,173
Soft-skull Smurf...
it was horrible.

1034
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,941
I just tried to be there
for her, though.

1035
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:09,809
No matter what the kids
called her.

1036
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:11,612
Well, she's lucky to have you
as a friend.

1037
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:14,280
I actually feel really lucky
because her struggles...

1038
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:18,519
really, they inspired me to...
to teach special needs kids...

1039
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:20,987
so... so, thank you, Meg.

1040
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:22,458
Oh yeah.

1041
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:28,965
Scrotum head... that's pretty
good.

1042
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:54,854
I'm gonna run to the ladies'
room.

1043
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:56,923
You guys want something
to drink? I'm buyin'.

1044
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,126
Oh, I'm good.

1045
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,264
Oh, I'm good, too.

1046
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:09,269
Oh... hi.

1047
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,604
Hi, how are you today?

1048
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:12,738
Oh, not bad.

1049
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,911
Oh, yeah, thank you.

1050
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:20,115
Oh my god.

1051
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:25,153
Oh my god.

1052
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,260
Oh god.

1053
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,626
Occupied!

1054
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,864
Ugh.

1055
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:18,871
All right.

1056
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:28,981
Meg, is that you?

1057
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:31,217
It's Scrotum head, bitch.

1058
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:32,351
Hello?

1059
00:51:35,123 --> 00:51:39,494
Hello? There's an unsafe
level of feces in here!

1060
00:51:43,364 --> 00:51:46,099
Hey.

1061
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:50,771
Listen, Kate may be a while.
She's having an issue.

1062
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,271
Everything okay?

1063
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:55,842
Unusually heavy flow.
Don't say anything.

1064
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:58,878
I would normally never tell you,
but she'd be mortified...

1065
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,746
if everyone thought
it was the diarrhea.

1066
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,717
That's mostly cleared up.

1067
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:06,054
Ok, well, we'll just wait.

1068
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:12,325
Look what I got,
the most expensive of the two.

1069
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:13,894
Good idea.

1070
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:40,019
It's crazy, isn't it?

1071
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:43,123
We've only known each other
for a few days...

1072
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:46,059
and yet I feel like I've known
you my whole life.

1073
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:48,929
Well, you know, we've been
stopping a lot.

1074
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,496
We'll pick up the pace.

1075
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:53,766
You know... sorry, I gotta
take this. Hey, you maniac!

1076
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:55,802
Yeah, yeah man,
I'm just outside Valdosta...

1077
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:57,737
I should be getting
in about 10:00.

1078
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,505
Yeah. You guys having fun?

1079
00:53:02,077 --> 00:53:03,376
Get... fucking bumblebee!

1080
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:04,811
Jesus.

1081
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:06,378
Everyone wants a bite
of that guy.

1082
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,748
There's not really honey
in the hand cream.

1083
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,950
Hey. Yeah, uh, sorry. No.

1084
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,885
Gassed up and ready to roll.

1085
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,119
Good for you.

1086
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:14,454
Where's Kate? We should hit it.

1087
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:16,490
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

1088
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:18,758
I just thought we were trying
to make it to a wedding.

1089
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,226
That's why I've been speeding
the whole time.

1090
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:24,063
67? That's your idea
of speeding?

1091
00:53:24,065 --> 00:53:26,099
Traditionally, when someone
does you a favor...

1092
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,235
you say "thank you".

1093
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:30,070
Well, I'm a rebel.

1094
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,472
Uh, just keep me
posted. Okay, buddy.

1095
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:37,811
Ryan! Ryan, is everything okay?

1096
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:40,412
Uh, yeah, yeah.
These guys are animals.

1097
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:42,282
We'll leave it at that.

1098
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,117
Awesome.

1099
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,521
Anyway, I was thinking,
I'm not gonna have much to do.

1100
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:50,356
Kate's obsessed with looking
for shells on the beach...

1101
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:52,559
so after you finish
the wedding stuff...

1102
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,293
and maybe you wanna hook up...

1103
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:57,229
or even if you need a date,
I brought a dress.

1104
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,398
It's really more...

1105
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,435
Oh my god!

1106
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:04,871
Are you okay? What happened?

1107
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:07,474
What happened?!

1108
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:10,811
Someone locked me in the
bathroom! That's what happened!

1109
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:12,912
Why? Who would do that?

1110
00:54:12,914 --> 00:54:15,981
That homeless guy. You know
what? I smelled meth on him.

1111
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:18,284
Guys, what is taking so...
oh my god!

1112
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:20,387
Are... are you okay?

1113
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,155
Oh... you got something
on your...

1114
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:27,494
Where are we?

1115
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:29,097
I think that's poop.

1116
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:37,103
Don't touch me!

1117
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:38,875
I wasn't going to.

1118
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:44,380
Motherfucker!

1119
00:54:46,248 --> 00:54:48,217
Oh my god!

1120
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:10,403
Ugh. Oh, god.

1121
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:11,637
You okay?

1122
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:14,574
Yeah, it's just... my neck.

1123
00:55:14,576 --> 00:55:16,208
I think I tweaked it
when I fell.

1124
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,211
- Here, come here.
- Oh yeah, sure. Thank you.

1125
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:20,412
Right here?

1126
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:24,152
Yeah. Here, just...
right there.

1127
00:55:29,324 --> 00:55:33,193
Oh yeah. Mm.

1128
00:55:33,195 --> 00:55:35,961
Oh god yeah, right there...

1129
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:39,231
oh, oh my god, that is so good.

1130
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:40,536
Yeah, you got a big knot
right here.

1131
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:45,938
Oh yeah. Oh! That's awesome.

1132
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,340
Jesus, you two, get a room.

1133
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:50,010
Finally.

1134
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:51,948
Oh! Mm.

1135
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:55,514
Sorry you hurt your neck.

1136
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:57,284
Yeah, I bet you are.

1137
00:55:57,286 --> 00:56:00,253
I am. Want a sip?

1138
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,222
It might help loosen
up your neck.

1139
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:03,456
No, thank you.

1140
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:05,191
Nah, me neither.

1141
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:09,128
That's what I get for traveling
with a bunch of stiffs.

1142
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,365
What're you doing? Stop!

1143
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,233
You don't know me.

1144
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:15,570
I know you're the driver.

1145
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:25,581
I thought you were a rebel.

1146
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,318
How much do you weigh?

1147
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,420
What?

1148
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:36,055
You've been driving for a while.
Want me to tap in?

1149
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:38,425
Look, I'm on the road like six,
seven days a month.

1150
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,693
A haul like this
is nothing to me.

1151
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:43,963
Just get some sleep.
Everything's fine.

1152
00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:10,255
Are you insane?!

1153
00:57:10,257 --> 00:57:12,961
Okay! We're okay. We're
okay. What'd that sign say?

1154
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:34,450
Are you insane?

1155
00:57:39,086 --> 00:57:41,454
I'm screwed, man. I'm really
fucking screwed.

1156
00:57:41,456 --> 00:57:43,055
I'm not gonna make the wedding.

1157
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:46,092
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
bucko.

1158
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:48,094
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

1159
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:52,034
Oh. Oh, geez, I feel weird.

1160
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:55,434
Help you?

1161
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:57,137
Yeah, the uh, headlamps
are out on our car.

1162
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,704
- Is there a garage in town?
- Yeah.

1163
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:00,639
You think the guy could open up
and maybe take a look?

1164
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:02,075
Oh, no, I doubt it.

1165
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:03,342
Can we rent a car?

1166
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:05,177
- Sure.
- Now?

1167
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,347
Oh, oh, no. Not tonight.

1168
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:08,648
How long will it take us
to get a car?

1169
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,282
I ate one of those um...

1170
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:11,784
Well, it'd have to come
from the airport.

1171
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:13,586
- I think they open around 8:00.
- Uh, you know.

1172
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:15,421
Would they deliver it here?

1173
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,557
I don't know. Maybe. No.

1174
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,327
Can we borrow your car?

1175
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:22,429
No.

1176
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:23,563
And when you don't use bread...

1177
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,298
Okay, well, shit.

1178
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,068
Nothing we can do tonight.
Uh, we'll take two rooms.

1179
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,601
I think it starts with a "T".

1180
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,637
Uh, three rooms, actually.
I'd like my own room.

1181
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:33,072
Three rooms.

1182
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,340
Okay, even if we cab it
to the airport...

1183
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:36,175
we could be on the road
by maybe 9:30-10:00.

1184
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:37,811
There you go.

1185
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,679
This one's out the door,
up the stairs, to the right.

1186
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:42,115
There's a restaurant out back
towards the interstate.

1187
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:43,115
You can walk it.

1188
00:58:43,117 --> 00:58:44,150
All right.

1189
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,686
It's... open 'til 10:00.

1190
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:48,854
I'm wanna get this guy in bed.

1191
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:50,824
I'll uh, park the car later on.

1192
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:53,827
You know, for food poisoning,
this ain't bad.

1193
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:55,364
Goodnight.

1194
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,106
See ya.

1195
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:08,244
Yeah.

1196
00:59:09,577 --> 00:59:13,612
He's yours, okay? He's yours.

1197
00:59:13,614 --> 00:59:15,682
I don't want him.

1198
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:17,753
I just didn't want you
to have him.

1199
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:33,436
Oh, hey.

1200
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:37,170
Don't be so excited.

1201
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:39,304
Where's Ryan?

1202
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:43,144
On the phone, wedding stuff,
thought I'd give him some space.

1203
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:47,246
You okay?

1204
00:59:47,248 --> 00:59:48,715
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,416
Just got quite the buzz
going on.

1206
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:52,318
Thought some alcohol would add
nicely to it.

1207
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,722
Hey, can I get a shot of Turkey?
Thanks.

1208
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:01,360
I'm gonna go play some pool.

1209
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:03,429
You can sit next to me.

1210
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:05,867
You sure? I don't wanna
give you cooties.

1211
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,477
Look at that handsome guy
with that hag.

1212
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:22,617
Two smiles in one night.
I'm on my game.

1213
01:00:27,355 --> 01:00:29,956
Finally getting your ice.

1214
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,758
I hate ice, it hurts my teeth.

1215
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,529
Oh.

1216
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:37,396
Where's uh...

1217
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:40,635
She's at the bar.
She's probably waiting for you.

1218
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:42,969
Goodnight.

1219
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:44,340
Wait.

1220
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,476
What're you doing?

1221
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,681
You two were always together.

1222
01:00:54,682 --> 01:00:57,650
I'm gonna kiss your mouth now.

1223
01:00:57,652 --> 01:00:58,686
Okay.

1224
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:14,333
Wow.

1225
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:16,001
Oh, I know. It's crooked.

1226
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:17,670
Was it, like, in an accident
or something?

1227
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:19,505
No, no, just kinda born
that way.

1228
01:01:19,507 --> 01:01:21,974
I've been told that it enhances
the experience.

1229
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,876
Right.

1230
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:31,016
All right, here we go!
Here we go!

1231
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:33,418
Oh, it's good, isn't it?

1232
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,790
Mary, mother of God!

1233
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:38,423
You okay?

1234
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:41,360
Yeah, just gonna do one thing.

1235
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:43,295
Oh, shit. That's okay.

1236
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:44,429
Here, let me just try...

1237
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:46,365
Oh yeah, that's better!

1238
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,472
You okay?

1239
01:01:53,474 --> 01:01:55,675
You know, we don't have
to do this.

1240
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:56,642
Yes.

1241
01:01:56,644 --> 01:01:57,644
We.

1242
01:01:57,646 --> 01:01:58,878
Do.

1243
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,920
Oh! Here we go!

1244
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:16,996
Yes!

1245
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:20,666
Long story short, that is how
I became a jeweler.

1246
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:23,972
Screw you, Dad. Right?

1247
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,978
Okay.

1248
01:02:30,378 --> 01:02:31,480
I give up.

1249
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:35,414
What?

1250
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:39,052
You know, I carry all kinds
of gemstones in my store.

1251
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,753
Hundreds.

1252
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:44,791
Precious, semi-precious,
uncut, faceted.

1253
01:02:44,793 --> 01:02:46,726
Every time a woman walks
into my store...

1254
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:49,662
all she wants is one thing...
diamonds.

1255
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:51,530
Don't get me wrong,
I love diamonds...

1256
01:02:51,532 --> 01:02:53,800
but there are so many other
stones out there...

1257
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:56,668
with such amazing qualities.

1258
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,907
Imperial jade, the texture
of a jacinth stone...

1259
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:03,543
the way, if you add just
the smallest amount of iron...

1260
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,545
to amethyst, it produces
the truest shade of violet...

1261
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,315
you've ever seen.

1262
01:03:14,588 --> 01:03:16,988
I'm the imperial jade, in case
that wasn't clear.

1263
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:20,525
- No, I got it.
- All right, too much bourbon.

1264
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:21,963
Gotta go. 'Night.

1265
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,798
Mm.

1266
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,967
Spear of butter, a little bit
of cinnamon...

1267
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:30,503
on a King's Hawaiian
is the ultimate comfort food.

1268
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:32,438
- Hi.
- Hey.

1269
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,039
Mind if I join you?

1270
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:35,775
Shut up.

1271
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:37,776
This raisin bran is amazing,
by the way. You should get some.

1272
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:38,947
What's with you?

1273
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:41,616
Nothing.

1274
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:45,584
We have to stop. This is insane.

1275
01:03:45,586 --> 01:03:48,387
You're the most important person
in my life.

1276
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:49,921
You know that, right?

1277
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:53,592
I'm not gonna throw that away
for some doofus.

1278
01:03:53,594 --> 01:03:55,827
I mean, geez, right?

1279
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:59,664
He's cute and everything, but
there's not much more there...

1280
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:00,932
than killer abs and a bent
dick.

1281
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,702
Look into young Ryan's eyes...

1282
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:05,070
and I have serious doubt that
there's anyone home.

1283
01:04:05,072 --> 01:04:07,173
There you guys are.
I was knocking on your doors.

1284
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:09,141
- Not now, Craig.
- Ryan's gone.

1285
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:11,077
- What?
- Yeah, he stole my car.

1286
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:12,845
Are you serious?

1287
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:15,447
- What is the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?!

1288
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:16,949
You told me that
I could have him!

1289
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:18,885
That is what you said to me
and then you went and you...

1290
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,653
- slept with him anyway?!
- No, I...

1291
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:22,021
How do you know he has
a bent dick?!

1292
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:23,655
- What?!
- You slept with Ryan.

1293
01:04:23,657 --> 01:04:26,057
You are unbelievable, Meg.
I am done with you!

1294
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:27,492
I am so done...

1295
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:28,961
Wait a second, we are
not done...

1296
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:30,829
and how do you know
he has a bent dick?

1297
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:33,434
Because I spent the night
with him, Einstein!

1298
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:39,070
Whoa, whoa!
That was a kill shot!

1299
01:04:39,072 --> 01:04:40,106
What?

1300
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:41,507
I take Krav Maga at the Y!

1301
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:42,775
That was a straight up
kill shot!

1302
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:45,644
You took a fucking kill shot
at me?!

1303
01:04:45,646 --> 01:04:47,447
What the hell is wrong with you?

1304
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:48,981
I didn't mean to take a kill
shot, are you okay?

1305
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:50,619
No, I'm not okay!

1306
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:53,219
I hate you!

1307
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:53,952
Okay, maybe we should...

1308
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:55,621
I hate you!

1309
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:57,623
Will you grow up?!

1310
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:01,561
Me grow up?
I paid for this trip!

1311
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,061
- Ouch! Stop!
- I paid for everything!

1312
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:04,729
You didn't pay for this
breakfast!

1313
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:07,666
It's a continental! It's free!

1314
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:10,702
Oh god, just once I wish you
would say "I am so sorry."

1315
01:05:10,704 --> 01:05:13,840
"I am dead broke again, would
you please pay for my fro-yo?"

1316
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:15,941
For you, it's just a bunch
of heaped-on toppings!

1317
01:05:15,943 --> 01:05:17,610
I knew that that's been bugging
your ass forever!

1318
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:19,144
Why do you even bother
with the yogurt?

1319
01:05:19,146 --> 01:05:20,713
Why don't you just go
to a fucking candy store?

1320
01:05:20,715 --> 01:05:21,713
Is there anything you're not
afraid of?

1321
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:23,483
You think you are so strong.

1322
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:25,485
You quit everything that you try
or you do something stupid...

1323
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:26,985
to make sure that you fail.

1324
01:05:26,987 --> 01:05:28,119
You are the coward!

1325
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:30,625
I'm a coward? That's rich.

1326
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:39,801
Had enough?

1327
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:46,008
Oh, shit.

1328
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,916
Freeze, lesbians.

1329
01:05:58,152 --> 01:06:00,086
Okay, I've gotten statements...

1330
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:01,720
from the witnesses
and the motel owner.

1331
01:06:01,722 --> 01:06:03,523
From what I gather,
the altercation appears...

1332
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,092
to be over a man that you've
both been intimate with?

1333
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:09,061
- Not at the same time.
- I was first.

1334
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:11,030
Okay, the fella who stole your
car. What was his name?

1335
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,032
He didn't steal my car,
he left a note.

1336
01:06:13,034 --> 01:06:16,068
I overreacted when I said that.
He didn't steal my car.

1337
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,068
Okay.

1338
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,905
What was his name?

1339
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,706
Uh, Ryan... Ryan...

1340
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,041
Ryan, um...

1341
01:06:23,043 --> 01:06:24,209
You had sexual relations
with this man...

1342
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:26,045
and you don't even know
his name?

1343
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,914
I didn't have... relations...

1344
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:31,851
The desk clerk said you came in
last night with the damaged car.

1345
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,619
Officer, I have no memory of it.

1346
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,787
I'm still gonna need the other
fella's name.

1347
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:37,923
Oh, he accepted my Google Plus
request.

1348
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:39,691
I'll show you a picture
of this guy.

1349
01:06:39,693 --> 01:06:41,961
I'll show you his name,
his likes, his dislikes...

1350
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:43,862
That would have been helpful.

1351
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:45,067
Oh.

1352
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,971
Well, he's definitely going
to a wedding.

1353
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:52,237
His own.

1354
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:54,941
- He's getting married?
- Oh my god!

1355
01:06:54,943 --> 01:06:56,943
You two are having a bad day.

1356
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,614
- Officer!
- Sit down!

1357
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:03,182
There is a woman out there who's
about to give her life over...

1358
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:05,985
to a liar and a cheat and we
have the opportunity...

1359
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:08,220
to stop him and to save
her, so please...

1360
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:10,856
I appeal to you,
not as a police officer...

1361
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:13,092
but as a woman, please.

1362
01:07:13,094 --> 01:07:14,693
And we'll pay for all
the damage.

1363
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:15,630
Everything.

1364
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:19,701
Please?

1365
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:24,202
You called for a cab?

1366
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:26,104
We're going to the Fort.

1367
01:07:26,106 --> 01:07:27,340
Where?

1368
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,708
Fort Lauderdale.

1369
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,177
Seriously? That's gonna
cost you.

1370
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:32,979
Well, we're just gonna
put it on my credit card.

1371
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,014
We can split it three ways.

1372
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:36,182
No, I'll find my way home.

1373
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:37,782
Are you sure?

1374
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:39,050
You don't wanna see
how this thing ends?

1375
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:40,753
No, I really don't.

1376
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:43,356
Come on! Let's go ruin
a wedding!

1377
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,296
Let's go!

1378
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,318
Hey, ladies, we're almost there.

1379
01:08:13,086 --> 01:08:15,054
- Game face. Game face!
- Yeah.

1380
01:08:15,056 --> 01:08:16,821
- Game face.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:34,674
Excuse me, hi.

1382
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:36,308
Um, the wedding, we're a little
late, but can you tell us...

1383
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,977
where the wedding is, please?

1384
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:40,178
There's a wedding in Ballroom H,
just off the lobby.

1385
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,849
Ballroom H, thank you,
thank you.

1386
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:45,851
- There she is.
- Listen! Listen to us!

1387
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:47,687
Stop! You're making a mistake,
don't do it!

1388
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:49,120
We have to tell you something.
You're making a mistake.

1389
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:51,156
Look, I know you don't know
who we are...

1390
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:52,994
but I slept with your future
husband.

1391
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:56,262
We both did, last night...

1392
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:58,063
but we did not know that
he was getting married.

1393
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,132
He lied to us and he will
lie to you.

1394
01:09:00,134 --> 01:09:00,900
What have I been...

1395
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:02,201
Shut up, Dad!

1396
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:03,772
You deserve better.

1397
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:11,477
You're a piece of shit, Carlos!

1398
01:09:13,213 --> 01:09:14,746
Carlos?

1399
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:16,949
- I feel bad about that.
- That was bad.

1400
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:18,349
That was on us.

1401
01:09:18,351 --> 01:09:20,052
Hi.

1402
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:21,754
Would there possibly be
another wedding...

1403
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:23,354
at this hotel right now?

1404
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:31,229
Shit! We missed it!

1405
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:33,499
Son of a bitch went Asian.

1406
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:37,503
I'm not being racist,
I was just surprised.

1407
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:39,141
There he is!

1408
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:50,819
Let's go!

1409
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:53,121
Hey, Karen.

1410
01:09:56,123 --> 01:09:57,458
Sorry!

1411
01:10:09,403 --> 01:10:11,536
Hey, how're you doing?
You look beautiful.

1412
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:13,004
What're you doing here?!

1413
01:10:13,006 --> 01:10:14,272
You lying, fucking,
piece of bent dick shit!

1414
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:16,077
Shh-shh-shh!

1415
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,410
Okay, okay!

1416
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:22,080
You're pissed off, but please,
please do not screw up my...

1417
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:24,316
Hey, you guys. Thank you
so much for coming.

1418
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:26,919
It's great seeing you.

1419
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,321
You lied to us, asshole!
You took advantage of us!

1420
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:32,391
I liked you. I flew
in a hot air balloon for you!

1421
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:35,260
- I concussed myself for you!
- Hold the fuck on!

1422
01:10:35,262 --> 01:10:36,562
You two were throwing
yourselves at me...

1423
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:38,363
from the minute
I got on that plane.

1424
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:40,432
That was a game, right? I mean,
you two were trying to prove...

1425
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:42,101
I don't know what you were
trying to prove.

1426
01:10:42,103 --> 01:10:45,236
But it sure as shit
had nothing to do with me.

1427
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:47,572
So, we kinda cancel
each other out.

1428
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:49,909
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1429
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,945
Oh, that was the most beautiful
ceremony.

1430
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:54,546
Thank you so much, Meemaw.

1431
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:56,581
These are my friends,
Meg and Kate.

1432
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,084
Oh. I'm sorry to break
in like that.

1433
01:10:59,086 --> 01:11:02,420
Vernon! Would you excuse us
for just one minute?

1434
01:11:02,422 --> 01:11:06,424
Vern, tell Ryan what you said.

1435
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:09,428
Shit. Is he right?

1436
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,832
Yeah.

1437
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,567
- Wait!
- Yeah!

1438
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:15,867
Right?

1439
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,035
It was beautiful, wasn't it?

1440
01:11:17,037 --> 01:11:18,571
Sorry, excuse us
for just one minute.

1441
01:11:18,573 --> 01:11:19,807
Sorry.

1442
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:24,076
You got married
ten minutes ago...

1443
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:25,311
and you slept with two different
women last night?

1444
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:26,445
What is wrong with you?

1445
01:11:26,447 --> 01:11:28,179
I know. I'm an asshole,
I know.

1446
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:30,516
Asshole? It's like biblically
more than that.

1447
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,351
I want to punch you
in the mouth.

1448
01:11:32,353 --> 01:11:34,452
Will you just listen to me
for one second?

1449
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:36,589
I have been with Genevieve since
freshman year of college...

1450
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,057
and hopefully I'm gonna spend...

1451
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:39,959
the rest of my life
with that woman.

1452
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:41,559
But freshman year.

1453
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:43,862
And two girls like you?
You're like every guy's dream.

1454
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,430
I know you're not gonna
believe this...

1455
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:48,133
but nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

1456
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:49,401
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Yeah, okay.

1457
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:51,003
You... you lied to us.

1458
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:52,537
Why didn't you tell us
that you were the one...

1459
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:54,205
who was getting married?

1460
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:57,942
I didn't lie to you.
You never asked.

1461
01:11:57,944 --> 01:12:00,545
Please don't destroy my wedding.

1462
01:12:00,547 --> 01:12:03,382
Ryan. What're you doing?

1463
01:12:03,384 --> 01:12:04,983
Hey!

1464
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:07,318
- Aren't you wearing a watch?
- Yeah, I...

1465
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,357
Hon, I said 5:50.
Not 6:00, not 6:05.

1466
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:12,991
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

1467
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:14,895
Oh, I-I was just doing a...

1468
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,031
Seriously, Ryan?

1469
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:23,134
Hi. I'm Genevieve.
And you are...?

1470
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:25,638
Gen, this is uh, Meg and Kate.
They were on the plane with me.

1471
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,373
I told you. We uh,
drove down together.

1472
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,340
Oh, wow. You guys have been
through such an ordeal.

1473
01:12:29,342 --> 01:12:31,242
Yeah, you have no idea.

1474
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:33,211
Well, thank you for returning
him to me safely.

1475
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:36,180
I was spazzing.

1476
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:39,351
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It stretches out the material.

1477
01:12:39,353 --> 01:12:41,954
Oh, that... that'll come
right out.

1478
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:43,321
I think it's the ham coquette.

1479
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:44,623
Did you talk to your parents?

1480
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:48,192
- I'm on my way.
- No, I'll do it.

1481
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:52,097
Do you think you can make it
to the garden by yourself?

1482
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:54,266
Yeah.

1483
01:12:54,268 --> 01:12:57,568
Sorry, we were supposed to start
photos seven minutes ago.

1484
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,104
Um, are you two...

1485
01:13:00,106 --> 01:13:01,139
What?

1486
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,674
Staying?

1487
01:13:02,676 --> 01:13:07,211
No, no, I think we just-we-we
just came to um...

1488
01:13:07,213 --> 01:13:09,180
- To see your dress.
- Oh, the dress!

1489
01:13:09,182 --> 01:13:10,648
- I love it.
- Oh, yeah, no.

1490
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,483
- It's Christopher Perry.
- It's so gorgeous.

1491
01:13:12,485 --> 01:13:14,620
It was his idea, he came here
to design it.

1492
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:16,054
I hope I can do it justice.

1493
01:13:16,056 --> 01:13:17,623
Are you kidding me?

1494
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:20,558
I think that justice is very
well served, right, Meg?

1495
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,727
Absolutely.

1496
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:24,966
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1497
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:27,633
Ryan?

1498
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:28,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:32,239
Wow.

1500
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,740
Oh my god.

1501
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:37,679
- That was...
- Karma's a bitch.

1502
01:13:38,578 --> 01:13:40,247
Ryan!

1503
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:43,485
I think our work here is done.

1504
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:48,454
Well, it looks like a nice one.

1505
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:50,425
Yeah, not bad.

1506
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:55,427
We have almost four hours
'til our flight.

1507
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:57,532
You wanna go mess up
another wedding?

1508
01:13:58,599 --> 01:14:00,101
Go to the beach?

1509
01:14:01,435 --> 01:14:02,604
What do you wanna do?

1510
01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:14,713
Pardon me, I'm in the market
for a precious stone.

1511
01:14:14,715 --> 01:14:18,717
Something lesser known,
perhaps a nice zinc?

1512
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,687
Zinc's not a stone, it's an
element.

1513
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:24,223
I know it's not a stone.
I was being poetic.

1514
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:25,590
Jesus.

1515
01:14:25,592 --> 01:14:29,527
Well what, are you, stalking me
to bust my balls?

1516
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:32,630
No, I... fuck.

1517
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:34,068
Can we start again?

1518
01:14:35,735 --> 01:14:38,736
Hello, Craig, I'm an asshole.

1519
01:14:38,738 --> 01:14:41,305
You were trying to be nice
to me and I was rude...

1520
01:14:41,307 --> 01:14:45,044
and condescending and I didn't
even give you a chance.

1521
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,146
And I didn't want to walk
away from this...

1522
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:49,714
whole fucked-up trip
without telling you that.

1523
01:14:49,716 --> 01:14:52,817
Okay. Thanks.

1524
01:14:52,819 --> 01:14:54,054
Okay, bye.

1525
01:14:56,356 --> 01:14:58,624
Wait, that's it?

1526
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:02,393
That's all I had planned.
I'm trying to be responsible.

1527
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:04,530
This is new for me.

1528
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:08,403
Okay, well... take care, Meg.

1529
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:13,475
What the hell.

1530
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,208
How about this?

1531
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:27,022
Yeah, that works, too.

1532
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,123
Bye, Craig.

1533
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:38,830
Who was that?

1534
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:41,402
Well, now I'm not so sure.

1535
01:15:46,506 --> 01:15:48,107
- Hi.
- Hey.

1536
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,275
I was starting to get worried
about you.

1537
01:15:50,277 --> 01:15:51,242
Did you find him?

1538
01:15:51,244 --> 01:15:52,277
Yeah.

1539
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,879
How'd it go?

1540
01:15:53,881 --> 01:15:55,880
I did most of the talking.

1541
01:15:55,882 --> 01:15:57,382
Well, good.

1542
01:15:57,384 --> 01:15:59,319
At least you got it
all out there.

1543
01:16:01,154 --> 01:16:02,157
Almost.

1544
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,529
I don't think we can live
together anymore.

1545
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:13,132
It's me. I'm a mess.

1546
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:16,300
I need to get my shit together.

1547
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:21,173
And I can't, if I keep letting
you bail me out of everything.

1548
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:23,509
You're too good to me.

1549
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,277
I don't know why...

1550
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:28,613
'cause I can be a real asshole
to you sometimes.

1551
01:16:28,615 --> 01:16:32,784
<i>We are now
boarding flight 770 to Seattle.</i>

1552
01:16:32,786 --> 01:16:35,457
<i>Please have your boarding
passes ready.</i>

1553
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:44,362
This doesn't mean that we won't
see each other...

1554
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:45,830
No, of course not.

1555
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:47,232
You're the most important
person in my life.

1556
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:48,666
You are, too, ever since
fifth grade.

1557
01:16:48,668 --> 01:16:49,934
- We'll see each other as much...
- Probably more.

1558
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:52,370
- As we ever had.
- Yeah.

1559
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:55,576
Okay. Yeah.

1560
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:09,554
Wait. You're an amazing person,
and you always have been.

1561
01:17:09,556 --> 01:17:12,891
I've always wanted to be more
like you.

1562
01:17:12,893 --> 01:17:15,762
If anything, I rely on you
too much.

1563
01:17:26,573 --> 01:17:28,609
I always cry at transitions.

1564
01:17:46,926 --> 01:17:48,626
Miss Jeffries!

1565
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:51,830
Oh, hi, Demerius.
You're here early.

1566
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:54,732
Computer club.
I um, did the report.

1567
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:56,934
You said two pages?

1568
01:17:56,936 --> 01:17:59,804
So, is it okay that
I did it like that?

1569
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:00,906
You drew this?

1570
01:18:00,908 --> 01:18:03,342
Yeah, I finished the book.

1571
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:05,910
What they did to Piggy?
That was whack.

1572
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:08,412
Yeah, that was absolutely whack.

1573
01:18:08,414 --> 01:18:10,715
So, is it okay?

1574
01:18:10,717 --> 01:18:13,585
Yeah, it's okay.

1575
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:15,223
Miss Jeffries, hold up a second!

1576
01:18:16,756 --> 01:18:18,290
All right, I'll see you
in class.

1577
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:19,558
See you in class.

1578
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,026
Gosh, you look great.

1579
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:23,495
Will you stop it?
I'm not gonna quit my job.

1580
01:18:23,497 --> 01:18:24,729
Who asked you to quit your job?

1581
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:25,930
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

1582
01:18:25,932 --> 01:18:27,531
- Yes, you did.
- No.

1583
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:29,500
I'll check my notes,
but I'm...

1584
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:31,269
I'm pretty sure you
misunderstood me.

1585
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:34,539
No, on the contrary,
I'm here to offer you...

1586
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:37,776
the assistant volleyball
coach position.

1587
01:18:37,778 --> 01:18:40,778
Mrs. Garcia's out
on maternity leave.

1588
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:42,347
Did you know she was pregnant?

1589
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:45,349
- No.
- Neither did I.

1590
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:48,523
Uh, well, just think about it.
Get back to me, okay?

1591
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:53,424
Principle Moss!

1592
01:18:53,426 --> 01:18:54,726
I can't, I got a board...

1593
01:18:54,728 --> 01:18:57,461
No, no, come here,
I want you to see this.

1594
01:18:57,463 --> 01:18:59,563
Demerius, that kid with the
comic, he did this.

1595
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:01,833
This is amazing. Look at that.

1596
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:03,567
Hmm.

1597
01:19:03,569 --> 01:19:06,037
You know what? I was thinking
about it over break...

1598
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,873
and I wanna shift the paradigm
of the left-brained...

1599
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,540
didactic teaching structure...

1600
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:13,445
to a more right-brained,
outside-the-box learning style.

1601
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:14,812
- Do you follow?
- I...

1602
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:16,815
I'm so sorry.

1603
01:19:16,817 --> 01:19:19,050
It's such a bore when people
talk like assholes, isn't it?

1604
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:21,820
What I'm trying to say
is I want your support...

1605
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:23,321
to do more stuff like this.

1606
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:24,923
Oh, and you know what?

1607
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:27,659
I looked into cutting hair
and you are absolutely right.

1608
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:30,062
Hairdressers make a goddamn
fortune.

1609
01:19:30,064 --> 01:19:32,330
It almost sounds like you're
threatening me.

1610
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:36,968
Stanley... Stan... relax.
We are on the same team, here.

1611
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,836
I am just trying to keep...

1612
01:19:38,838 --> 01:19:41,072
your instructional scaffolding
in place.

1613
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:43,510
Especially right before testing.

1614
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,812
Oh, and you know what?

1615
01:19:46,814 --> 01:19:48,612
Yes to volleyball.

1616
01:19:48,614 --> 01:19:50,549
Sounds like an adventure.

1617
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:53,117
Go Falcons!

1618
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:58,022
Edgeworth, he brought math
to economics.

1619
01:19:58,024 --> 01:20:00,459
He wrote the essay on
application of math...

1620
01:20:00,461 --> 01:20:02,861
to moral science, 1881.

1621
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:05,930
Leon Morris... Theory of General
Competitive-

1622
01:20:05,932 --> 01:20:07,835
Hold on.

1623
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:14,438
Hello? Yes. I know, I know.
I'll be there.

1624
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,575
- Who is it?
- Sorry, it was Kate.

1625
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:19,544
Well, you know, I gotta get to
bed anyway. I'll see you later?

1626
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:21,012
Sixteen days.

1627
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:22,817
<i>Sixteen days.</i>

1628
01:20:24,585 --> 01:20:26,651
<i>Give me something to dream
about.</i>

1629
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:28,620
Oh, you scamp.

1630
01:20:28,622 --> 01:20:31,055
<i>Come on.</i>

1631
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:34,960
<i>Oh my goodness! Oh boy.
You are the mo...</i>

1632
01:20:56,617 --> 01:20:58,750
Hey.

1633
01:21:02,855 --> 01:21:05,723
I'm here. Has it started?

1634
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:08,061
<i>I don't think that Kalynn's
going any farther.</i>

1635
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,562
<i>She's cracking.</i>

1636
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:15,767
<i>This is too hard.
I don't know if I can...</i>

1637
01:21:15,769 --> 01:21:17,405
Who acts like that?

1638
01:21:24,675 --> 01:21:29,675
