1
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:41,775
His friends would say, stop whinin',
they've had enough of that

2
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:47,381
His friends would say, stop pinin',
there's other girls to look at

3
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:51,894
They've tried to set him up
with Tiffany and Indigo

4
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:57,664
But there's somethin' about Mary
that they don't know

5
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,802
Mary...

6
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,400
There's just somethin' about Mary

7
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:14,350
Well, his friends say,
look, life's no fairy tale

8
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:20,321
That he should have some fun,
he's suffered long enough

9
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:25,520
Well, they may know about domestic
and imported ale

10
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:30,430
But they don't know a thing about love

11
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:38,134
Well, his friends would say he's dreamin'
and livin' in the past

12
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:44,074
But they've never fallen in love
so his friends need not be asked

13
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:50,386
His friends would say, be reasonable,
his friends would say, let go

14
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:59,351
But there's somethin' about Mary
that they don't know

15
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,187
Mary...

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,397
There's just somethin' about Mary

17
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:22,718
<i>When I was 16 years old,</i>
<i>I fell in love.</i>

18
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,413
Hey, Renise.

19
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:27,947
Hey.

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,183
So, uh, what's up?

21
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,319
Cool.

22
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,264
So I was wondering... I don't know,

23
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:44,273
if... if maybe you
wanted to, and... or not.

24
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,775
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

25
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:49,107
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom,

26
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,476
and... or, uh

27
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,448
if you felt like that,
maybe you'd want to go

28
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:54,541
with me.

29
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:56,346
Or, I mean, whatever.

30
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,183
Lf... if you didn't.

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,191
Did you take that bio test?
'Cause that was like...

32
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,093
Look, I heard this rumor
that this guy I like was gonna ask me,

33
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,791
so I'm gonna wait
and see what happens there.

34
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:12,266
That sounds great. Yeah.

35
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,527
OK.

36
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:20,939
So, is that like a yes or a no or...

37
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,939
I thought I made it perfectly clear.

38
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,982
If everything else falls apart,

39
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:27,141
maybe.

40
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:31,016
I'm gonna hold you to that.

41
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:37,851
Hey, guys.

42
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,285
Hey, Mary!

43
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:44,792
I wonder who she's going with.

44
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,139
<i>Her name was Mary.</i>

45
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:51,970
<i>She moved to our little</i>
<i>Rhode Island town</i>

46
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:55,273
<i>from Minnesota two years earlier.</i>

47
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,070
What a fox!

48
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:02,308
I heard she's going
with some guy named Woogie.

49
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,877
Who?

50
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:06,621
Big guy. Goes to Barrington High.

51
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,488
Woogie from Bore-rington High?

52
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,192
Sounds like a loser.

53
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:15,595
Loser? Woogie's only
like all-state football,

54
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,327
and basketball,
and fucking valedictorian.

55
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,596
I heard he got a scholarship
to Princeton,

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,797
but he's going to Europe first to model.

57
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:25,865
Yeah? I was thinking of doing that.

58
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,801
Sorry.

59
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:29,602
Have you... have you

60
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,579
Have you seen my baseball?

61
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:34,742
Uh, no. Sorry, man. Haven't seen it.

62
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:39,351
Have you... have you
seen my baseball?

63
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,446
Sorry.

64
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,816
Hey, check it out.

65
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:46,991
Have you seen my baseball?

66
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,031
Hey, buddy. Come here.

67
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:52,130
I think I know where your ball is.

68
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,699
- You've seen my baseball?
- Yeah, yeah. I've seen it.

69
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,665
You see that girl over there?

70
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:00,868
That... that...

71
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,913
She has it,
except she doesn't call it a baseball.

72
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,574
She's got another name for it.

73
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:10,910
Nice muffs.

74
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,755
Have you seen my... wiener?

75
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:16,282
What?

76
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,487
Have you seen my wiener?

77
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,264
What the... what the hell
did you just say, buddy?

78
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,390
Wiener?

79
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:24,831
Hey, get your hand off my car!

80
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:26,129
What the hell did you just say to me?

81
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,261
My... my...

82
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:29,137
Wiener.

83
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:31,140
Fuckin' son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fuckin' kick your ass!

84
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,338
Get up, fat boy! Let's go!

85
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:35,309
Take it easy.

86
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,310
Keep your hands off.

87
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,405
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy's not all there, all right?

88
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,608
Fight! Fight!

89
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,049
Get out of my face.

90
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:43,449
You want the first punch?

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,544
Yeah! Fight!

92
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,145
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

93
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,987
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!

94
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,317
You OK, Warren?

95
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,624
Mary, have you seen my baseball?

96
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,062
No, I haven't seen your baseball.

97
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:56,359
What are you doing leaving the yard?

98
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,867
You know you're not supposed
to leave by yourself.

99
00:05:58,935 --> 00:05:59,867
You know him?

100
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,062
He's my brother.

101
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,468
I'm her brother.

102
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,563
Warren.

103
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,338
I didn't realize, you know?

104
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,968
You ought to tell him
to watch his mouth.

105
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,102
Jerk.

106
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:12,105
Are you OK?

107
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,843
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

108
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,175
You OK?

109
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:20,951
Thanks, Ted.

110
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:24,255
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>that she knew my name.</i>

111
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:27,262
<i>Some of my best friends</i>
<i>didn't know my name.</i>

112
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,695
I think Joe Montana

113
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,859
is, like, the most
underrated quarterback.

114
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,335
I mean, he should have been
a first-round draft pick.

115
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:36,099
Look what he did at Notre Dame.

116
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:37,935
It's so ridiculous.

117
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,032
Exactly.

118
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:42,542
I'm telling you, this year,
it's the 49ers. 49ers.

119
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:43,636
All the way.

120
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,814
Piggyback ride! Piggyback!

121
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,978
Warren, stop it. Leave Ted alone.

122
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:52,351
No, that's OK. I'll do it.

123
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:53,719
If you think he can hold me.

124
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,757
Are you kidding?

125
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:56,724
He's 230 pounds.
He can hold you.

126
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:57,725
You don't have to.

127
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,352
It's OK. I got a little disc thing,

128
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,418
but it's all right.

129
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,294
All right, here we go!
Giddyup, Warren!

130
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,855
There we go! Whoo!

131
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,329
Fun, huh, Warren?

132
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:07,927
He's a real Clydesdale, isn't he?

133
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,404
Yeah, Warren, buckin' bronco.

134
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,371
My turn now.

135
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,669
My turn.

136
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,374
OK. Well, I don't...

137
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:17,709
- Ow!
- It's OK, Ted. You don't have to.

138
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,645
Giddyup!

139
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:20,876
That's fun. Whoo!

140
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,979
That's fun, huh, Warren?

141
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,847
Whoa!

142
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,622
That was fun.

143
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:36,863
He's only 230, huh?

144
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,831
Yeah.

145
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,359
- I'm in the yard now. I'll hide.
- OK, go hide.

146
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,406
He's got a lot of energy.

147
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:47,273
Yeah. He's great.
I have a lot of fun with him.

148
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,635
Thanks for walking us back.

149
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:50,680
Yeah, no problem.

150
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:53,045
I'm, uh, I'm just gonna...

151
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,781
So, are you...
are you going to the prom?

152
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:56,876
Huh?

153
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,213
Uh, oh. Uh...

154
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,886
I... I don't... I think proms are...

155
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,390
'Cause I thought maybe we, um

156
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,790
...dumb.
- We could go together.

157
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,693
Oh, you're gonna go with, like,
a bunch of people?

158
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:09,197
You want, like, a designated driver?

159
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,426
No, no. I mean, you and me.

160
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:15,028
Like, we could go together. The two of us.

161
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,570
- You... you and me?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,707
Well, is that a yes or a no?

163
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:29,811
- Sure. All right.
- Good.

164
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:30,910
Cool.

165
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm gonna take Warren back inside.

166
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:36,089
I'll... I'll see you at school.

167
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,287
Cool. I'll catch you back at school.

168
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,223
<i>From that moment on,</i>

169
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,733
<i>the guys at school looked at me</i>
<i>in a whole new light.</i>

170
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,769
You're a fuckin' liar.

171
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,798
Do you expect us to believe

172
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:50,863
that you're going
to the prom with Mary?

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,306
What's so crazy about that?

174
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,039
Oh, yeah, dirt bud,
and I'm going with Cyndi Lauper.

175
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,603
What happened to Woogie?

176
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,842
She said she broke up with him,

177
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,680
that he was getting weird on her.

178
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,812
I got 20 bucks that says
you're full of shit.

179
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:06,947
Why not make it 100?

180
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:07,955
Rock on.

181
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,013
I'm in.

182
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,116
Me, too.

183
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,240
I've already paid him
enough money already.

184
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:37,775
I'm not paying until the job gets done.
He can kiss my ass!

185
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,583
What the hell do you want?

186
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,387
I'm Ted Stroehmann.
I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

187
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:53,459
Prom? Mary went to the prom
20 minutes ago with Woogie.

188
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:55,060
Woogie?

189
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,401
Woogie!

190
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,633
Oh.

191
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,565
I see.

192
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,540
Charlie, you are so mean!

193
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,775
This is Mary's stepfather Charlie.
I'm Sheila, her mother.

194
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,919
Ted, don't pay any attention
to anything he says.

195
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:11,885
He's a laugh a minute.

196
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,252
Very funny.

197
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,420
Well, I'm just having
a little fun with the guy.

198
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,087
It's prom night.
Woogie's got a sense of humor.

199
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,590
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

200
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,896
Listen, once he gets into that MTV,

201
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,233
he'll be there for quite a while.

202
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:32,968
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.

203
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,072
Aw, shit, look at that.
You better be careful, boy.

204
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,165
Hi, Ted.

205
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,532
Hi, Mary.

206
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,768
You look really... pretty.

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,308
Thanks. I like your colors.

208
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,606
Oh, thanks.
The guy said it was tan and taupe.

209
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,615
Poor Ted, he's been getting it both barrels
from the wisenheimer here.

210
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:16,652
Dad, you haven't been
bustin' Ted's chops, have ya?

211
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,119
I was just fucking with him.
Right, Ted?

212
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:23,753
Hey, Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

213
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,521
About 10 times.

214
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:26,361
OK.

215
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,826
Hey, Warren.
I think I found your baseball.

216
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,298
You've seen my baseball?

217
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,358
Well, if it's a big white one.

218
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,363
With, uh

219
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,838
little red stitching.

220
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:40,841
Yup. It is.

221
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,969
Then I think I saw it,

222
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:44,343
right behind your ear.

223
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:48,580
Warren! Warren!
Hold it, hold it!

224
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,881
Get up, Warren! Hey, Warren!

225
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:51,921
Warren!

226
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:54,115
Be careful, Mary! Be careful!

227
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,248
Get up, man!

228
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,688
Let go of him! Get down from there!

229
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,022
What are you doing?

230
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,027
Ted! Ted!

231
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,290
Warren, put him down!

232
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:02,854
Whoa! Ohh!

233
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:05,057
What the hell are you doing?

234
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,328
Mary, Mary.

235
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,994
This is my house here!

236
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,231
Warren, are you OK, buddy?

237
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,466
It's OK, Warren. It's OK.

238
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:12,706
Here you go.

239
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,106
What the hell's the matter with you?

240
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,668
I was just trying
to give him the baseball.

241
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,145
Baseball? What baseball?

242
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,704
I had a baseball.

243
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,108
What baseball?

244
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,310
There was... it's right...

245
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,046
There was a baseball here.

246
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,883
I swear, I brought him a baseball,

247
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,287
and I was just trying
to give him a present!

248
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,053
Are you yelling at me
in my own house?

249
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,093
No.

250
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,754
Don't make me open a can
of whup-ass on you.

251
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,196
Ted, I should have told you.
He has a thing about his ears.

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,594
You all right, Warren?

253
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,567
Oh, honey, your strap's broken.

254
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:44,768
You're right.

255
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,173
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna
go upstairs real quick.

256
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,643
I just need two minutes.
I got to fix my dress.

257
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:50,644
I'll help you, honey.

258
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:51,805
Hey, I, uh...

259
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:55,516
Can I use your bathroom?
I'm sorry. I got to...

260
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,780
- He broke the table.
- You son of a bitch.

261
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,685
I didn't do it.

262
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:01,314
It's OK, Warren. It's OK.

263
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:05,157
- I swear...
- The bathroom is that way.

264
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:08,822
Maybe I'll open up
a can of whup-ass on him.

265
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,000
Trying to do the kid a favor.

266
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,963
He's looking at you! What is he...

267
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,060
Oh, no. I...

268
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,497
No, no, I was...

269
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,507
Mom, wait!

270
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:53,833
Shit!

271
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,424
Ted, are you OK?

272
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,587
Yeah, I'm fine! Everything's OK!

273
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:13,219
OK, OK, just take your time.

274
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:14,456
It's all right.

275
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,727
He's been in there
over a half an hour.

276
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,961
Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

277
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,264
- Oh, come on!
- Mom!

278
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:22,269
Well...

279
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,600
He's not masturbating.

280
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,140
Well, he was watching you undress

281
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,073
with a silly grin on his face.

282
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:28,974
I was watching the birds!

283
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:32,071
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

284
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,878
I think he needs some male help.

285
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,679
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- Dad, just give him a minute.

286
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,451
OK, kid, listen, I'm coming in, OK?

287
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,492
No, no. Don't...

288
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:45,958
Exactly what the hell
is the situation here?

289
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:48,019
What did you do,
shit yourself or something?

290
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,462
Oh, I wish. I...

291
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,500
I got it stuck.

292
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:54,035
You got what stuck?

293
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:55,634
Lt!

294
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:56,831
Oh! Lt. Um...

295
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,805
Um, uh, well, um... listen, uh

296
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:02,777
It's not the end of the world.

297
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,870
These kind of things happen.

298
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,245
Let's have a look at it.

299
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,717
Oh, my God in heaven, save him!

300
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:12,880
Shh! Shh!

301
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,886
- Shush! Quiet!
- Sh-Sheila!

302
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,483
- No!
- Sheila, uh, honey?

303
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:19,788
Don't...

304
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,920
Sheila, honey.

305
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:24,398
Uh, you gotta come here.
You gotta see this.

306
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,991
What is it?

307
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,493
Don't! Don't!

308
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,898
Don't worry.
She's a dental hygienist.

309
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,406
She'll know exactly what to do.

310
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,875
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs Jensen. How are you?

311
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,509
- You OK?
- Yeah.

312
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,911
Holy shit!

313
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,613
Charlie, you could have warned me.

314
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,076
OK, I, um...

315
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:44,318
Mrs Jensen, I...

316
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:45,354
Right, right. OK.

317
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:46,854
I don't want her to hear, you know?

318
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,891
OK. Um, let's just relax here, OK?

319
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,186
Now, uh, uh...

320
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,088
What exactly are we, uh

321
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,720
looking at here, huh?

322
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,287
What do you mean? Look at the...

323
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,333
I mean, is it the, um...

324
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:01,494
Or the...

325
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,429
Is it the frank or the beans?

326
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,375
Oh, I, uh, I... I don't know.

327
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,570
It looks like...
I think it's a little bit of both.

328
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,943
Franks and beans!
Franks and beans!

329
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,174
Shh! No! Shh, shh!

330
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,240
Well, what's that bubble there?

331
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,081
What do you think? It's a...

332
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:19,986
Well, how the hell did you get the beans
above the frank?!

333
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,455
Shush, shush.

334
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,721
I don't know. It wasn't like
it was a well-thought-out plan.

335
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,989
There really does seem
to be an awful lot of skin

336
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,094
coming through there,

337
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,860
so I'm gonna find
some Bactine, honey.

338
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,333
Uh, no. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.

339
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:34,369
Hello there.

340
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,870
Oh, Christ.

341
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,906
What the hell's going on here?

342
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:40,374
Neighbors said they heard
a lady scream.

343
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,911
Uh, well, you're looking at him.

344
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,947
Uh, you gotta take a look at this.

345
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:45,673
Would you just...

346
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,805
Oh, Jesus!

347
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,383
Ain't it a beaut?

348
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,818
What the hell

349
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,149
were you thinking?

350
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,584
How the hell did you get the zipper
all the way to the top?

351
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,690
Let's just say the kid's limber.

352
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,955
Ow! Ow!

353
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:03,932
Christ!

354
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,898
What the...

355
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:05,991
God...

356
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,797
Somebody's gonna have to
move that station wagon

357
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,167
so I can get the truck in here.

358
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,103
Lenny, come here.

359
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,035
Take a look

360
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,100
at what this numb-nuts did.

361
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,804
Holy shit!

362
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:24,285
Mike, Eddie. Get down here quick.

363
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,581
Bring everybody. Bring a camera.
You won't believe this!

364
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,590
We got a kid down here...
what's your name?

365
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,049
No, I...

366
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,360
No, there's only
one thing to do here.

367
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,397
What? No. You know what?
I got an idea.

368
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:38,365
Look, look. I can just...
We don't have to do anything

369
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,868
'cause, look, I can just
wear this over the front.

370
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,666
Look, I can go to the prom.
We'll deal with it later.

371
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:43,432
Son, relax.

372
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,475
You already laid the tracks.
That's the hard part.

373
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,066
Now we're just gonna back it up.

374
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,203
Teddy, be brave.

375
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,646
It's just like pulling off a Band-Aid.

376
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:55,841
A one

377
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,146
and a two

378
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,082
and a...

379
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:01,487
We got a bleeder!

380
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,184
Keep pressure on it. Keep it on.

381
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,727
Everybody get out of the way!

382
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,658
Step clear, gentlemen, please.

383
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,860
He was masturbating!

384
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,867
People, please move out of the way.

385
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,402
Warren, come here.

386
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,370
He was masturbating!

387
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,872
Move out of the way.

388
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,601
None of this ever happened to Woogie!

389
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:20,699
Are you OK, Ted?

390
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:23,236
Ted!

391
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,545
He was masturbating!

392
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,073
Ted, are you all right?

393
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,083
Sure.

394
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,882
OK.

395
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:37,116
OK, Ted.

396
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,757
OK, let's roll.

397
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:52,998
So, anyway, uh

398
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,910
school ended a couple days later,

399
00:18:55,978 --> 00:19:00,312
and her father got transferred
to Florida in July.

400
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:04,752
So I worked all summer
to pay off those debts and

401
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:08,618
well, I never saw Mary again.

402
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,215
That was... what?

403
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:13,554
13 years ago.

404
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,227
That's very interesting.

405
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,757
Anyway,

406
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:21,027
I know it's not the type
of thing you'd forget,

407
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,071
but I guess I just... I kinda...

408
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,699
I must have blocked it
out of my head or something,

409
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,505
'cause I was driving down
the highway last week,

410
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:32,138
and I started thinking about Mary,

411
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:35,884
and all of a sudden
it was like I couldn't breathe.

412
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,384
I mean, I was... I was...

413
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,546
I felt like I was gonna die.

414
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:43,888
So I pulled off the road
and I just sorta stopped in this

415
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,325
I guess it was a rest area.

416
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,920
I was just kind of shaking and...

417
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,400
You know,
rest areas are homosexual hangouts.

418
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,601
Highway rest areas.

419
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:00,373
They're the bathhouses of the '90s

420
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:03,173
for many, many, many gay men.

421
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,751
So what... what are you...

422
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,386
What are you saying?

423
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,221
Oop. Time, she's up.

424
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,625
We'll, uh, delve into that next week.

425
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,159
<i>Well, you know, you are a writer,</i>

426
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,868
and writers are artists.

427
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,871
And most artists
are a little foofy, you know.

428
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:33,999
A little foofy.
Thanks for the support.

429
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:38,376
Hey, you guys, I thought
you might like these with your beers.

430
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,381
Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.

431
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,314
I don't think I'll have one.

432
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,544
- You don't want one?
- No.

433
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,746
You want something else?

434
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,254
Come on.
You want something to eat?

435
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:48,950
Not hungry, thank you.

436
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,389
You want a cookie, something like that?

437
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,721
Honey, we got cookies?

438
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:54,354
Uh, no, we don't,
but I could bake some.

439
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,829
No, no, no. Don't bake any.

440
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,889
No, that's a good idea.
Why don't you bake some?

441
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,365
Bake some tollhouses.

442
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:00,834
Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.

443
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:03,838
- Uh, chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.

444
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:05,840
- OK. Good.
- Really, you don't...

445
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,375
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

446
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,377
She loves this kind of thing.

447
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,173
Really?

448
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,873
See, that's great.

449
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,049
That's what I want,

450
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,282
a family,

451
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:19,148
and somebody to, you know...

452
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:25,221
It must be wonderful
having all this, huh?

453
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:27,922
Each day is better than the next.

454
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,258
How about you?

455
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:32,763
The big "L." Hmm?

456
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:35,064
- Ever been?
- What?

457
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:36,829
In <i>lurve.</i>

458
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:37,930
Well,

459
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,164
once.

460
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:42,175
Mary.

461
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:45,111
Oh, God. Not Mary again.

462
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,411
Look, I know it was brief,

463
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,780
but it was

464
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,216
it was definitely love, Dom.

465
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,051
I mean,
crushes don't last for 13 years, right?

466
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,387
What ever happened to Mary?

467
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,292
- She moved with her family to Miami.
- So why don't you look her up?

468
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:01,753
I did

469
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:02,828
once.

470
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,331
I called. She wasn't listed.

471
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,301
So that's it? You get one little bump
in the road and give up?

472
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,303
It's probably for the best.

473
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,531
After 13 years,

474
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:12,130
she's probably gonna think
I'm a stalker or something.

475
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,336
You know what you should do
is hire a private investigator.

476
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:18,141
You know, to find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

477
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,774
No way! That's way too creepy.

478
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:24,343
Besides, she's probably married
with a couple of kids by now.

479
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,981
Girls like Mary...
they don't stay single.

480
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,920
Hey, I've got an idea.

481
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:33,918
There's this guy down in my office.
His name's Healy.

482
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,487
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.

483
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,625
He goes to Miami every couple of weeks.
He can help you out.

484
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:43,103
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.

485
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,500
So.

486
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:52,272
Dom says you're looking for some
lady friend you knew back at school.

487
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:55,146
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:56,684
That's cute.

489
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,777
I don't buy it, but it's cute.

490
00:22:58,854 --> 00:23:00,947
You're not buying what?

491
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:06,421
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.

492
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:10,661
I want you to level with me.

493
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,765
Come on, let's talk.

494
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,003
Did you knock this skirt up? Huh?

495
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,397
No.

496
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,476
She's blackmailing you, right?

497
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:24,068
Blackmailing me?

498
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,477
No.

499
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,515
You want her dead, don't you?

500
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,607
Dead?

501
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,475
Were you...

502
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,183
You're not serious, are you?

503
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:35,712
You expect me to believe
this is a straight stalker case? Come on!

504
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,954
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?

505
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:41,223
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh, sure she is!

506
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:43,891
That explains why she's got
an unlisted number,

507
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,400
and you haven't heard squat
from her in 13 years.

508
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,129
Yeah. A real chum.

509
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,898
You're good, Ted.

510
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,769
Real piece of work.

511
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,731
You know what? Forget it.

512
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:54,833
Just forget the whole thing.

513
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,144
OK, I'll do it.

514
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,908
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag,

515
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,847
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.

516
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:04,919
All right.

517
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,902
Healy, you dog.

518
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,598
Sully!

519
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,432
Look at you.

520
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,840
You hot shit, you look fucking pisser.

521
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:32,813
Hey. Hey, good fella.

522
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:34,871
Does he bite?

523
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,974
A little bit.

524
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,075
Get in.

525
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,547
Here's the info you asked for.

526
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:43,648
Thanks.

527
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:45,651
Yeah, you should thank me.

528
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,559
That girl was not easy to find.

529
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,894
What, she scam you out
of some insurance dough?

530
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,957
Nah. Some guy gave me a couple bucks

531
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,503
to track down his high school girlfriend.

532
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:56,833
Stalker, huh?

533
00:24:57,906 --> 00:24:59,168
Yep. Big time.

534
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,096
Looks like we found your Mary, Ted.

535
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,509
Husband... negative.

536
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,474
Children and a labrador,

537
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:38,672
negative.

538
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:41,005
Tight little package,

539
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,550
affirmative.

540
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,754
Good morning, Magda.

541
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:55,626
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.

542
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,534
So you been out here all night again?

543
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,501
You bet your ass I have.

544
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,266
This is an importantjob,
Neighborhood Watch is.

545
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:07,331
Ah. Neighborhood Watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

546
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:10,909
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

547
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,238
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half a mile radius.

548
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:16,341
Meaning?

549
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,183
Meaning these are the people
you live amongst.

550
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:20,983
You got a right to know
if they're creeps.

551
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,523
For instance, you know the guy

552
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:27,153
in the green house down the street?
Cheating on his wife.

553
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,564
And I am not surprised.

554
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,792
I am not surprised at all.

555
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:35,499
Because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

556
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:38,699
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

557
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:39,798
OK.

558
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,340
Listen, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls,

559
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:46,176
and hook up with Warren,
so... try to get some sleep.

560
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:47,946
OK.

561
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,540
- Bye, doll.
- Bye.

562
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:51,519
Hello.

563
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:52,611
Hi, Mary.

564
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:01,823
Hey, Herb. How's it going?

565
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:02,989
Apple for you today.

566
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,089
Thanks, Mary.

567
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,568
Have a good day. See you later.

568
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:07,858
Lookin' good, honey.

569
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,400
Hi, Mary.

570
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,060
Hey, Mrs Bailey. How you doing?

571
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:43,627
Looks like we got ajock on our hands.

572
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,979
Hey, you want the sports page?

573
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,514
Sure. Thank you.

574
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,742
Take care now.

575
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,943
Bye, you guys. See ya.

576
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:21,499
Yeah. Can I have two, Mary?

577
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:24,910
Yeah, you can have two halves,
just like everybody else.

578
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,874
Mmm.

579
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:26,915
Yeah, it's good.

580
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,111
Will you marry me, Mary?

581
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,016
Oh, I would love to, Jimmy,

582
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,555
but, um, I'm already engaged to Freddie.

583
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:37,222
Who's Freddie? Me?

584
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah, that's you.

585
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,994
Will you marry me?

586
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:44,192
What about Dolores?

587
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,999
You gonna marry us both?

588
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,660
I'm gonna kiss you.

589
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:49,727
I think you're making out
pretty well there.

590
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:50,863
OK.

591
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:52,805
Thanks, Mary.

592
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:54,808
You're welcome, Zack.

593
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,370
- No onions.
- No onions.

594
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:57,677
No onions.

595
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,770
No onions. How you doing?

596
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,451
Listen to this one:

597
00:29:03,518 --> 00:29:06,112
"Seeking sensitive WASP doctor

598
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:07,815
to share candlelit dinners,

599
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:09,914
long walks in Coconut Grove,

600
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:10,959
marriage."

601
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:12,459
Is she looking for a corpse?

602
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,085
You have to be specific
when you write those.

603
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:18,496
You have to say,
"seeking deaf mute with", you know,

604
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,694
"3-pound cock and trust fund."

605
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,636
I want a guy who can play 36 holes

606
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,140
and still have enough energy

607
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,938
to take me and Warren to a ball game

608
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:30,342
and eat hot dogs.

609
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,277
I'm talking sausage hot dogs, beer.

610
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:35,111
Not light beer, but beer.
That's my ad. Print it up.

611
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:39,243
Fatty who likes beer and golf.

612
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:43,116
Jeez, Mary, where you gonna find
a gem like that?

613
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,561
OK, well, here's the catch.

614
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:48,994
He has to be self-employed.

615
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:51,062
Like a drug dealer?

616
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,499
No, I was thinking
along the lines, maybe,

617
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:56,127
of somebody like

618
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:57,728
an architect or something.

619
00:29:57,806 --> 00:30:01,071
But I want somebody with freedom
in theirjob, you know?

620
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:02,938
Somebody who can do it anywhere

621
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,571
and just leave at a drop of a hat.

622
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,445
And where would you
and your beer-bellied architect be going to?

623
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,679
Super Bowl?

624
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,250
That's good.

625
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,220
I don't know.
Maybe a few months in Nepal.

626
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:20,285
And you'd probably dump the poor guy
halfway to Katmandu.

627
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,296
What's that supposed to mean?

628
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,423
It means you change
your mind too much.

629
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:25,523
No, I don't.

630
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,726
Oh, come off it, Mary.

631
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:29,600
Remember that gorgeous
corn-fed white-boy honey

632
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:32,105
that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage?

633
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,835
What was his name? Pack man.

634
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,271
OK. We had fun for a while.

635
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,038
Mary, cut the crap.

636
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:41,844
What really happened with Brett?

637
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:44,283
Yeah. Brett seemed so sweet.

638
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,848
You know what Tucker said Brett told him?

639
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,559
He said that if Warren wasn't in my life,

640
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:54,424
that he would have
popped the question a long time ago.

641
00:30:54,496 --> 00:30:56,327
- Oh.
- What a schmuck.

642
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,301
To hell with Brett, you know?

643
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,400
I've got a vibrator.

644
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:08,098
Shh!

645
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,026
<i>Those are the plays of the month.</i>

646
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,584
<i>Thank you for joining us.</i>

647
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,061
<i>Look forward to seeing you next Sunday</i>

648
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:30,689
<i>on the Sports Machine.</i>

649
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,631
<i>Have a good week, everybody.</i>

650
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,639
Oh, ho-ho, yeah.

651
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:46,171
Ho ho.

652
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,878
Here comes the money shot.

653
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:56,754
Aah!

654
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:00,789
First chink in the armor, Ted.

655
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:05,058
Ohh.

656
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:06,901
Shit.

657
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:10,695
Ohh, yeah.

658
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,716
Pop, you wanna get me a whisky sour
when you get a sec?

659
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,076
Whisky sour coming up.

660
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,052
Got some excellent news
for you, my friend.

661
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,520
Oh, yeah? Excellent?

662
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,022
I think your life's about to change.

663
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,022
Really?

664
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:31,683
So... so you found her?

665
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,784
Oh, yeah.

666
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:36,495
And you were right, man.
She really is something else.

667
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:37,622
My God.

668
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,157
Really?

669
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:41,226
So... so she hasn't

670
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,168
she hasn't changed at all, huh?

671
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,570
Well, that I couldn't say.

672
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:47,834
Let me ask you something.

673
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:52,109
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

674
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:54,375
Big-boned? No, no. Not at all. No.

675
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,781
I guess she packed on
a few pounds over the years.

676
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:02,119
Oh, yeah. So she's a little...
she's a little chubby?

677
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,522
Oh, I'd say about a deuce,
deuce and a half. Not bad.

678
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:07,653
Oh, my. A deuce and a half.

679
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:12,563
You shit out a bunch of kids,
and you're bound to put on a few pounds.

680
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,261
Oh, so she's, um

681
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,159
she's married?

682
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:18,866
No, no. She's never been.
That's the good news.

683
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,964
Huh?

684
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:24,043
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.

685
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,570
Hyperactive little fuckers, too.

686
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:29,048
Tough to keep up with
in a wheelchair, I bet.

687
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,109
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

688
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:35,588
I thought that was part of your kick.

689
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,591
Excuse me, I ordered a whisky sour.

690
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:38,990
Whatever.

691
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,756
Are you sure it's the same Mary?

692
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,628
Oh, yeah. It's Mary all right.
The brother Warren?

693
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:48,294
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.
It's been a long time.

694
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,101
I bet you've changed a lot
the last 13 years.

695
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,437
What, do you think
your shit don't stink?

696
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,137
No, I don't think...
I... I mean, yes, it doe...

697
00:33:57,212 --> 00:34:00,113
OK, I got all
the information you need.

698
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:02,240
I got it off her bookie. Nice guy.

699
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,114
You really should look her up, Ted.

700
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,619
I mean, she's a real spark plug, this one.

701
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:09,418
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.

702
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:11,049
Uh, Ted,

703
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:16,393
don't you want the name
of the housing project?

704
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:17,689
What?

705
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:19,998
<i>... for 1,995.</i>

706
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:23,003
<i>See the Sarone boys on Route 1</i>
<i>in South Brattleboro, and right here</i>

707
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:26,632
<i>on Jefferson Boulevard in Warwick...</i>

708
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,651
Well, it hurts from the bottom

709
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:46,019
And it hurts down to your soul

710
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:47,760
That's because

711
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,694
True love is not nice

712
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:55,300
And it brings up hurt

713
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:58,932
From when you were five years old

714
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:01,003
That's because

715
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:02,941
True love is not nice

716
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,103
No

717
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:09,316
Oh, pain, pain, pain

718
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,979
Ain't thatjust love's name?

719
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:15,489
Love can bring up hurt

720
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:17,115
From way down low

721
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,920
It now be emphasized

722
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:26,096
True love is just not civilized

723
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:29,400
True love is not nice

724
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:30,895
No, no

725
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:40,146
Where are you goin'?

726
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:41,273
Huh?

727
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:43,013
Oh, I resigned.

728
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,277
Good luck in Miami, Pat.

729
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:46,911
Miami?

730
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:50,023
What... what are you doing in Miami?

731
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:52,355
Uh, I took a, uh, job offer.

732
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,385
With who?

733
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,288
With, uh...

734
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:58,364
Rice-a-roni.

735
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:01,768
Isn't that the San Francisco treat?

736
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:02,894
It was.

737
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:06,039
They're changing their image.

738
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,871
Yeah, well, listen,
I've been thinking about what you said.

739
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:09,841
Good, good.

740
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:12,903
And, uh, I still want to look her up.

741
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:14,439
Who?

742
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:15,640
Roller pig?

743
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,343
Are you nuts?

744
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:20,246
I thought you said she was
a real spark plug.

745
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:22,812
Hmm? No, no. I said butt plug.

746
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:24,322
She's heinous.

747
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:29,024
You know what?

748
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,857
All the same, I think I wanna call her.

749
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:32,729
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,

750
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:35,201
but, you know... I don't know.
Maybe I can help her out.

751
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,737
I just... I feel bad, you know?

752
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:39,365
The poor thing, she's in a wheelchair,
for God sakes.

753
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:41,705
It's... it's a bunion. It'll heal.

754
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,336
Bunion? You... what... I thought...

755
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:47,347
You know what? That's not even it.
The point is, I just...

756
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,641
I know this doesn't make sense to you,

757
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:53,152
but I can'tjust turn it off that fast.

758
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:57,820
I guess I still have feelings for her.

759
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,625
This girl really means
something to you, huh?

760
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:07,792
All right.

761
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,503
Tell you what...
I'll get you her number,

762
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,542
just as soon as she
gets back from Japan.

763
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,600
Thank you. I'd apprec...

764
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:19,579
Japan? What is...
what's happening in Japan?

765
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:21,137
Why is she going to Japan?

766
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:24,549
Oh, uh, you've heard
of mail-order brides, haven't you?

767
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,211
Well, they go that way, too.

768
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,311
Mary's a...

769
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:29,557
What... what, are they desperate?

770
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,591
She's a whale!

771
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:32,956
Don't forget. It's a sumo culture.

772
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:34,688
They pay by the pound there.

773
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,993
It's sorta like, uh, sorta like tuna.

774
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,831
Well, what happened to... You said
she was single. Remember? No rock.

775
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:46,101
You had your window, Ted.
You blew it.

776
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,035
I had my window?

777
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,010
I'm sorry, buddy. It's just...

778
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:58,978
You're taking this all wrong.
I mean, you're liberated.

779
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:04,184
I mean, you think you blew it with
the greatest girl ever, and it turns out

780
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:09,629
getting your dick stuck in your zipper
was the best thing that ever happened to you.

781
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:11,164
You wanna say it a little louder?

782
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,097
I'm sorry, but it was.

783
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,235
I never told you that.

784
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:20,503
Well, I was only four towns away.

785
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:21,841
Excuse me.

786
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,207
Oh, sure, sweetheart.

787
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:24,643
Oh, man, I gotta go.

788
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:26,612
I gotta get up at 6 a.m. Tomorrow

789
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,478
and help my boss' brother move.

790
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,916
Your boss' brother? Who's that?

791
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:33,010
I don't even know. I never met him.

792
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:36,523
Ted, you gotta finish that novel
so you can quit that stupid magazine.

793
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:37,922
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

794
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:44,857
Nice swing.

795
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,870
Christ! Hit a house!

796
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,277
I haven't swung
the wrenches in a while.

797
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:07,115
Would you mind givin' me
some pointers here?

798
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:10,351
Yeah. Sure. Don't talk
in someone's backswing.

799
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,416
Oh, thanks.

800
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,791
I'm gonna go get a soda.
You want one?

801
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:16,921
No, thanks.

802
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,902
Oh, uh, look, I'm sorry
to bother you again,

803
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:25,303
but, uh... you got
change of a dollar?

804
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:26,397
No.

805
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,741
All I got are these
damn Nepalese coins.

806
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,380
You've been to Nepal?

807
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:41,254
Oh, uh, not... not in months.

808
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:44,052
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.

809
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:54,324
- Nice meeting you again.
- You, too... again.

810
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,838
So what's your name?

811
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:00,765
Pat Healy.

812
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,012
Wanna know mine?

813
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,239
I already know it, Mary.

814
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,816
How did you know that?

815
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,577
'Cause it's right there
on your golf bag.

816
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:22,423
Aw, damn!

817
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,298
Wow. Are... are those blueprints?

818
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:28,392
Oh, these?

819
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:32,404
They're just some, uh,
projects I'm working on.

820
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,499
Museum... hospital for kids.

821
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:37,908
Really? Are you an architect?

822
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,073
Just till I get my, uh, PGA tour card.

823
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:47,118
No. I mean, are they putting up
a new museum in town, or is it...

824
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,583
To tell you the truth,
I'm sort of burnt out on talkin' about it.

825
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:52,921
Oh, I'm sorry.

826
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:56,427
It's just ajob, really. You know,
something to keep me moving.

827
00:40:56,497 --> 00:41:00,957
- My real passion is my hobby.
- Really? What's that?

828
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:02,730
I work with retards.

829
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:08,136
Isn't that a little politically,
um, incorrect?

830
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:10,074
Well, the hell with that.

831
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:14,046
No one's gonna tell me who I can
and can't work with, right?

832
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:17,778
- No. I mean...
- We got this one kid... Mongo.

833
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:21,219
He's got a forehead
like a drive-in movie theater,

834
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,881
but we don't bust his chops too much.

835
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:27,223
- So one day Mongo gets out of his cage...
- What, they keep him in a cage?

836
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:29,092
Well, it's... it's just an enclosure.

837
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:30,494
No, but they keep him confined.

838
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:31,463
Right, yeah.

839
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,965
That's bullshit!

840
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,262
Well, that's what I said!

841
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:37,099
So I went out,
and I got him, um, I got him a leash.

842
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:38,103
A leash!

843
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,299
Yeah, one of those ones you can hook
onto the clothesline,

844
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,275
and he can run back and forth.

845
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,174
And, uh, there's plenty of room

846
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:47,339
for him to... to dig and, uh, play.

847
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:49,582
That kid is really, uh,

848
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,777
he's really blossomed, you know?

849
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:54,048
Now I can, uh, take him to movies.

850
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:56,689
Baseball games.

851
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,149
Fun stuff.

852
00:41:58,793 --> 00:41:59,851
Yeah.

853
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,055
Sounds cool.

854
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:03,855
Oh, yeah, it's cool for them,

855
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:05,990
but for me it's much more than that.

856
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,261
For me, it's... it's heaven.

857
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:08,359
Y'know?

858
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:11,003
Those goofy bastards are just about

859
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:14,508
the best thing I've got goin' in this

860
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:15,906
crazy world.

861
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:22,944
Hey, dipshit, be careful
with that thing, will you?

862
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:24,006
What?

863
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,177
You heard me.

864
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:28,545
You already put
a fuckin' nick in my piano.

865
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:32,286
Well, I'll try to be a little more careful.

866
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,289
What are you, fading?
You wimpin' out on me?

867
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:38,764
It's just that this is a little bit heavy,
that's all.

868
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:43,099
Heavy? What I wouldn't give to know
what heavy feels like,

869
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:44,160
you insensitive prick.

870
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:47,139
No, I didn't... I didn't mean that!

871
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,836
Yeah, yeah. I'm goin' down the street
to get some coffee.

872
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,709
Wait! Wait! I'll get you
the coffee. Just... just...

873
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,747
Hey, I'm sorry!

874
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:04,514
Tender, fascial tissue left of L7.

875
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:08,185
Hey, Bob?

876
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,627
Remember Mary?

877
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:12,990
Oh, yeah.

878
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:15,801
I remember Mary.

879
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:21,670
Hey, I saw her a few months ago
at a convention in Las Vegas.

880
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:24,006
How could you see her at a convention?

881
00:43:24,078 --> 00:43:26,478
Well, I'm a chiropractor.
She's an orthopedic surgeon.

882
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:27,775
She's a what?!

883
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29,678
She's an orthopedic surgeon.

884
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,548
And... oof... she's still a fox.

885
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:38,015
What if the families
don't want a class action?

886
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:43,120
Oh, God! That's what I've been trying
to explain to you people for the last hour!

887
00:43:43,197 --> 00:43:44,892
OK, fine. We'll go over it again.

888
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:46,092
Mary's a fox!

889
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:47,491
What?

890
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:49,796
Mary's a fox? What do you...

891
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:51,361
Hey, folks. Here, let's...

892
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:54,306
We'll break up.
We'll spitball this tomorrow. OK?

893
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,809
What the hell are you talking about?!

894
00:43:56,878 --> 00:43:58,175
Mary? My Mary?

895
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,015
She's not in Japan.
She has no rugrats running around.

896
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,108
My friend says she's a fox.

897
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,413
A surgeon fox.

898
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,114
I don't get it. I mean Healy...

899
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:11,124
Think about it! He never even
looked her up down there!

900
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:14,184
He was there closing his deal
with the Rice-a-roni people the whole time!

901
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,763
What's up with your head?

902
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:25,739
Oh. I... I get hives tap-dancing
for these idiots. I get a little stressed out.

903
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:30,607
Jeez. You know, I feel like a royal shit
because I set you up with this guy.

904
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:35,280
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.

905
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:36,873
Fuck calling her.

906
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:39,350
I'm goin' down there.

907
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,051
Yeah, yeah, OK.

908
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:43,347
ASAP.

909
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:45,482
So, who's the lucky guy?

910
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:48,359
His name's Pat.

911
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,395
I met him at the driving range.

912
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:52,227
Is he good looking?

913
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,664
He's no Steve Young.

914
00:44:55,937 --> 00:44:57,632
So, what is he like?

915
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,466
I don't know.

916
00:45:01,442 --> 00:45:02,409
Kind of a mook.

917
00:45:02,476 --> 00:45:03,500
<i>A schlep.</i>

918
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:05,778
<i>Why the hell you going out</i>
<i>with him if he's a schlep?</i>

919
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:07,847
He's not like that, Magda.

920
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,314
You know, it's...

921
00:45:09,383 --> 00:45:11,374
It's like that movie <i>Harold and Maude.</i>

922
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:13,884
I don't watch the new ones.

923
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:17,516
Well, you should, because it's probably
the greatest love story of our time.

924
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:18,923
The point is

925
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:21,953
is that love isn't about

926
00:45:22,296 --> 00:45:24,594
money or social standings

927
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:25,597
or age.

928
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,861
It's about two people connecting,

929
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,800
having something in common.

930
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,997
You know, kindred spirits.

931
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:33,802
Fuck kindred spirits.

932
00:45:33,874 --> 00:45:35,933
My little Puffy here
is going to tell you

933
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,705
everything you need
to know about that guy

934
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,507
in about two seconds flat.

935
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,606
If Puffy starts yapping, uh-uh.
He's a loser.

936
00:45:42,683 --> 00:45:47,017
<i>If he likes him,</i>
<i>then you've got yourself a keeper.</i>

937
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:13,437
Yeah.

938
00:46:14,448 --> 00:46:17,975
Pufferball likes it when I rub his belly.

939
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,587
That is amazing!

940
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:23,087
He doesn't like anybody.

941
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:25,648
He never usually likes guys.

942
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:28,362
He doesn't like bad guys.

943
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:29,657
Is that right?

944
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:32,792
I can tell that you're an animal nut.

945
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,198
You are, aren't you?

946
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:35,792
You got me pegged.

947
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:39,600
You know, in Nepal,
the villagers there called me

948
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:40,902
Kin ton ti,

949
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:42,533
which means

950
00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:49,009
"noble man who is loved by many animal,
who, in kind, he loveth, too."

951
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:53,912
Would you like a cup
of tea or something?

952
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,786
I'd love a brewski if you got one.

953
00:46:56,957 --> 00:46:58,185
We can do that.

954
00:46:58,626 --> 00:47:02,392
Hey, Magda, why don't you help me
in the kitchen?

955
00:47:02,463 --> 00:47:05,398
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Certainly. Of course.

956
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:08,492
Kin ton ti.

957
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,406
Puffer doesn't like bad guys, does he?

958
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:18,702
Puffer?

959
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:21,973
Puffer?

960
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:25,445
Puffer, come on, boy.

961
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,587
Would you like a little clam dip, doll?

962
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:28,713
Uh, no, thank you.

963
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:31,019
I'd love a bundt cake if you have one.

964
00:47:32,626 --> 00:47:33,854
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?

965
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:35,186
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

966
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:39,690
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

967
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:43,334
1, 2, 3.

968
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:45,872
Hey, Pat, do you want a, um

969
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,398
<i>a</i> Budweiser or a Heinie?

970
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:49,943
Uh, yeah, whatever.

971
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:52,512
Come on, Puffer!
Stay away from the light!

972
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,649
OK, I'll just get you a regular.

973
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:08,286
Uhh!

974
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,104
All set?

975
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:36,054
Ohh.

976
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:37,488
Oh, good pooch.

977
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,660
All we had were some Oreos.
How does that sound, honey?

978
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,188
Oh, my God.

979
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:49,859
He's got him wrapped up like a baby.

980
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,495
He was...

981
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:53,140
He was a little chilly.

982
00:48:57,278 --> 00:48:58,745
Well, here we are.

983
00:48:58,813 --> 00:48:59,802
- The museum?
- Yeah.

984
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,747
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- First, I have a surprise.

985
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:06,412
- Surprise?
- It's the architecture exhibit.

986
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:08,512
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

987
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:12,457
- I got to eat something or I get the shakes.
- Come on. We'll eat in 20 minutes.

988
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:15,859
My friend Tucker is upstairs and I want you
to meet him. He's an architect, too.

989
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:16,897
- Come on.
- Architect?

990
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:17,988
Yeah.

991
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:19,623
Tucker.

992
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,496
This is amazing.
It just blows me away.

993
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:27,163
What do you think this falls under?
Is this Art Deco, or is it Art Nouveau?

994
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:29,708
Uh...

995
00:49:29,777 --> 00:49:30,709
Deco.

996
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:32,541
- Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.

997
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,447
It's beautiful.

998
00:49:35,149 --> 00:49:36,411
Is this... OK.

999
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:38,747
Is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?

1000
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,343
What is the difference
between the two?

1001
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,480
Uh, when you're looking
at architecture,

1002
00:49:42,556 --> 00:49:44,990
try to visualize the buildings

1003
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:47,027
as a whole, you know?

1004
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:51,791
Uh, try to see them
in their natural state, in their

1005
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,657
totalitarian... ism,

1006
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,197
so to speak.

1007
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,203
Stone crab time.

1008
00:49:58,606 --> 00:50:01,074
- Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

1009
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:05,478
Mary!

1010
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:06,570
How are you?

1011
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,738
Good.

1012
00:50:07,815 --> 00:50:08,782
I'm glad we saw you.

1013
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:09,873
Uhh!

1014
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:12,348
Oh, come on, like you mean it.

1015
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:15,616
Tucker, this is my friend, Pat Healy.

1016
00:50:15,689 --> 00:50:17,520
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

1017
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:18,523
Same here.

1018
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:20,184
Pat is an architect as well.

1019
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:21,285
Oh, really?

1020
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:22,927
Where are your offices?

1021
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:25,124
Mainly, I work out of Boston.

1022
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,291
Boston, huh?

1023
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,634
Did you get your degree up there?

1024
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:29,760
You bet.

1025
00:50:31,038 --> 00:50:33,529
Really? Where did you study?

1026
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:34,631
Harvard.

1027
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:38,408
Then you must've studied under Kim Green.

1028
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:39,707
Well, among others.

1029
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,804
Huh.

1030
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:42,844
You know, Pat, um

1031
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:44,814
does projects all over the world.

1032
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:47,183
Really? Where would I
have seen your work?

1033
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,779
Well, have you been to, uh

1034
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,986
well, let me see.

1035
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:53,716
Santiago, Chile?

1036
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:56,061
Twice last year.

1037
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,291
Which building's yours?

1038
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,063
Are you familiar
with the soccer stadium?

1039
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:05,264
Did you build
the Estadio Olimpico?

1040
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:07,564
No, just down the street

1041
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:10,542
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

1042
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:14,247
It's quite a fine example, in fact.

1043
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:16,249
I recommend that next time
you're up that way

1044
00:51:16,317 --> 00:51:20,811
that you drop in and take
a ganders at it yourself.

1045
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:30,592
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

1046
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:31,824
Yeah, no problem.

1047
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:33,628
I've been driving for, like,
15 hours straight,

1048
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:35,760
so I could use the company.

1049
00:51:35,836 --> 00:51:36,803
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1050
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,428
I've been standing in the same spot

1051
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:40,598
for five and a half hours.

1052
00:51:40,674 --> 00:51:43,472
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

1053
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:44,568
Really?

1054
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,236
That must make it really tough.

1055
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:50,112
So, uh, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or...

1056
00:51:51,352 --> 00:51:52,649
Uh, no, no,

1057
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:55,378
I'm... I'm... I'm nothing.

1058
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,314
I am.

1059
00:51:58,726 --> 00:52:00,125
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

1060
00:52:00,194 --> 00:52:02,219
I'm going to start my own company.

1061
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:03,320
Really?

1062
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:04,521
You want in?

1063
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:08,259
Uh...

1064
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:09,559
I... nah.

1065
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:12,700
I'm not... I don't really
have any money or...

1066
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:15,799
You heard of this thing
the 8-minute abs?

1067
00:52:15,876 --> 00:52:18,140
Yeah, sure, 8-minute abs.
Yeah, the exercise video.

1068
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:23,348
This is going to blow that right out
of the water. Listen to this.

1069
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:27,718
7-minute abs.

1070
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:30,180
Right.

1071
00:52:30,691 --> 00:52:33,319
Yes. OK, all right,
I see where you're going.

1072
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:39,122
You walk into a video store. There's
8-minute abs and 7-minute abs beside it.

1073
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,224
Which one are you going to pick?

1074
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,565
I'm... I would go for the seven.

1075
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:45,298
Bingo, man, bingo.

1076
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:46,634
7-minute abs.

1077
00:52:46,774 --> 00:52:49,971
And we guarantee just as good a workout
as the 8-minute folk.

1078
00:52:50,044 --> 00:52:52,569
You guarantee it? That's...
How do you do that?

1079
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:56,241
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes,

1080
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:59,911
we're going to send you
the extra minute free.

1081
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:03,047
You see? That's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

1082
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,589
That's from A to B.

1083
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:07,126
That's right.
That's... that's good. That's good.

1084
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:08,786
Unless, of course,

1085
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:12,263
somebody comes up with 6-minute abs.
Then you're in trouble, huh?

1086
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:20,931
No!

1087
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:22,606
No, no, not six.

1088
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,136
I said seven.

1089
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,575
Nobody's coming up with six.

1090
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:27,113
Who works out in six minutes?

1091
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,580
You won't even get your heart going,

1092
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:30,412
not even a mouse on a wheel.

1093
00:53:30,484 --> 00:53:32,111
That... good point.

1094
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:34,211
Seven's the key number here.
Think about it.

1095
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:36,017
- 7-Elevens.
- Yeah.

1096
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,148
Seven dwarves.

1097
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:39,158
Seven, man, that's the number.

1098
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:41,922
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch,

1099
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:44,395
eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

1100
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:47,901
You know that old children's
tale from the sea.

1101
00:53:47,968 --> 00:53:50,436
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese

1102
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:53,769
when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

1103
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:56,004
Step into my office.

1104
00:53:56,376 --> 00:53:57,308
Why?

1105
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:59,641
'Cause you're fucking fired.

1106
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:02,910
Yeah. I got to pee.
I'm just going to pull over.

1107
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:05,611
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.

1108
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,678
What are these made out of? Cactus?

1109
00:54:13,093 --> 00:54:16,426
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

1110
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:24,798
Ohh!

1111
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:27,071
Hey, wait your turn.

1112
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:28,631
Hey, I didn't...

1113
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,602
Whoa.

1114
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,606
Freeze!

1115
00:54:32,846 --> 00:54:34,609
Wait a minute.

1116
00:54:36,817 --> 00:54:37,749
This is a raid!

1117
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:39,683
No. No, no, no, I was peeing.

1118
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:42,085
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

1119
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:43,145
I was peeing, too!

1120
00:54:43,223 --> 00:54:46,056
Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.
Let's go. Let's move it out.

1121
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:47,115
Let's go.

1122
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:50,096
Come on.

1123
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:54,259
Shit! Jimmy Shay, is that you?

1124
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:11,775
Oh, my God.

1125
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,144
Ted?

1126
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:19,891
<i>If you'll just let me</i>
<i>talk to you for one second</i>

1127
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,018
<i>outside of the truck</i>

1128
00:55:21,094 --> 00:55:22,994
<i>Look, I still have to pee, all right?</i>

1129
00:55:23,063 --> 00:55:24,997
<i>Get in the truck! Let's go. Let's go.</i>

1130
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:25,997
<i>Can I have a cup?</i>

1131
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:28,057
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

1132
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:30,126
<i>We'll be right back with more cops</i>

1133
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:32,729
<i>live from the heartland.</i>

1134
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:37,201
A veces pienso que aqu

1135
00:55:37,744 --> 00:55:39,371
Todo es seguridad

1136
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:43,980
Por la seca castidad

1137
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,149
Lo de antes fue algo

1138
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:52,421
Ahora es mejor

1139
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:56,485
Oh, yeah, ahora es mejor...

1140
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:02,064
- Your grandmother is really something.
- Magda? No, Magda's not my grandmother.

1141
00:56:02,135 --> 00:56:06,094
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago,

1142
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:09,802
and I don't think she likes being alone.
So, you know, she just hangs out.

1143
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:13,444
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

1144
00:56:13,513 --> 00:56:18,109
Sometimes I wish I could be like Magda
and not go home.

1145
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,622
I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.

1146
00:56:23,724 --> 00:56:26,750
I don't know why anybody
would want to bounce around,

1147
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,455
you know, if they have
their own condo in Nepal.

1148
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:31,394
I'd be there in a second.

1149
00:56:31,465 --> 00:56:32,523
I'd sell it.

1150
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:33,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1151
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:38,097
Start fresh in a new place,
give up the architect game.

1152
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:42,471
Slow things down a bit,
read more books, see more movies.

1153
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,271
Are you a movie buff?

1154
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:48,241
I try to be, but it's tough going out there
with all the crap they make today.

1155
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:51,647
I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

1156
00:56:51,752 --> 00:56:53,947
You know, classics
like <i>The Karate Kid</i>

1157
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,352
or <i>Harold and Maude.</i>

1158
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,824
<i>Harold and Maude</i>
is my all-time favorite movie.

1159
00:57:00,894 --> 00:57:02,828
Don't bust my chops.
I know it's corny, but...

1160
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:04,523
Pat, I'm not kidding.

1161
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:06,498
I think that <i>Harold and Maude</i>
is one of the greatest

1162
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:09,057
love stories of our time.

1163
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:15,070
Here I thought I was the only one.

1164
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:17,036
You're too good to be true.

1165
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,441
Come on, let's go dance.

1166
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:19,570
Ha ha ha!

1167
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:28,988
Man, they never
look like you'd expect, do they?

1168
00:57:29,056 --> 00:57:33,789
That's probably how he got his victim
to drop his guard.

1169
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,021
Where'd they find the body?

1170
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:40,123
In a big red bag
on the front passenger seat,

1171
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:41,934
all hacked up.

1172
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:44,461
Gruesome.

1173
00:57:45,806 --> 00:57:47,740
Real psycho, this one.

1174
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:52,039
Hey, you're a little worked up.
Let me do the talking.

1175
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:58,808
I'm Detective Stabler. This is Krevoy.

1176
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:02,184
Look, I didn't solicit any sex, OK?
This is a huge misunderstanding.

1177
00:58:02,255 --> 00:58:05,053
I was really going out to pee.
I'm walking in the bushes,

1178
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,150
I trip over this guy and all of a sudden
there's all these cops...

1179
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:09,161
Ted, Ted, Ted, it's OK.

1180
00:58:10,097 --> 00:58:11,428
We believe you.

1181
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:15,525
Oh.

1182
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:20,333
The problem is,

1183
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,475
we found your friend in the car.

1184
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:25,973
Oh, the hitchhiker?

1185
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:28,777
This is about the hitchhiker?

1186
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:29,873
Oh.

1187
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:31,341
Oh, great.

1188
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:33,144
Just my luck.

1189
00:58:33,854 --> 00:58:36,118
I get caught for everything.

1190
00:58:36,189 --> 00:58:37,247
So...

1191
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:39,322
You admit it?

1192
00:58:39,926 --> 00:58:42,394
Uh, yeah. Guilty as charged.

1193
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:48,133
Look, I know you guys have ajob to do
and I'm really sorry. I did it.

1194
00:58:48,201 --> 00:58:49,259
I admit it.

1195
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:55,303
You know, the guy even told me,
the hitchhiker told me it was illegal, so...

1196
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,399
Well...

1197
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:58,535
uh...

1198
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,104
Can you tell us his name?

1199
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:03,406
Uh...

1200
00:59:05,185 --> 00:59:07,085
No, I didn't catch it.

1201
00:59:07,154 --> 00:59:12,023
Can we cut to the chase?
Am I in a lot of trouble here, or...

1202
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:14,753
First, tell us why you did it.

1203
00:59:14,828 --> 00:59:16,352
Why I did it? Um...

1204
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:21,158
I don't know. Boredom.

1205
00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:26,699
The guy turns out to be a blabbermouth,
just would not shut up.

1206
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:27,967
I mean, with the... just...

1207
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,030
Ted,

1208
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:32,101
this wasn't your first time,

1209
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:33,312
was it?

1210
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:35,839
No.

1211
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:38,580
How many are we talking here?

1212
00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:39,482
Hitchhikers?

1213
00:59:41,395 --> 00:59:41,952
My whole life?

1214
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:43,053
Um...

1215
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:44,855
I don't know.

1216
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:48,060
25, 50. I mean, who keeps track?

1217
00:59:48,869 --> 00:59:52,236
Hey, I know this is the Bible belt,
but where I come from

1218
00:59:52,306 --> 00:59:54,035
this is not that big a deal.

1219
00:59:54,108 --> 00:59:56,042
You son of a bitch.

1220
00:59:56,911 --> 00:59:59,038
You're gonna fry.

1221
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:00,137
Come here!

1222
01:00:04,285 --> 01:00:05,650
Take it easy! You OK?

1223
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,085
What the hell is wrong with you?

1224
01:00:07,154 --> 01:00:08,018
You all right?

1225
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:09,386
- Punk.
- Jesus!

1226
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,941
Your friend Tucker stopped by.

1227
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:34,972
Really?

1228
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:38,183
OK. What does it look like today?

1229
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,188
<i>It's fne. A little crazy in the afternoon.</i>

1230
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:44,823
Hey, Tucker.

1231
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,427
Eh, what's up, Doc?

1232
01:00:48,996 --> 01:00:51,624
You look different.
Did you do something with your hair?

1233
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:55,133
The teeth. The teeth. I got them capped.

1234
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:57,432
Oh, yeah? Hey, they look great.

1235
01:00:57,505 --> 01:01:01,464
- You don't think they look a little big?
- No, not at all. The bigger the better.

1236
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:03,339
But they could be a little brighter.

1237
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,311
<i>There's nothing more sexy to me</i>

1238
01:01:05,379 --> 01:01:08,280
<i>than a guy with a mouthful</i>
<i>of big pearly whites.</i>

1239
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:09,247
<i>Oh, really?</i>

1240
01:01:09,316 --> 01:01:10,340
Come here.

1241
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:13,277
You ever had one
up the hatch in here.

1242
01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:14,514
Tucker, behave yourself.

1243
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:15,555
I'll say.

1244
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,184
What can I do for you today, my friend?

1245
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:24,459
<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>
<i>about your friend Patrick.</i>

1246
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:26,659
<i>- He's a nice guy, huh?</i>
<i>- That's what I'm trying to fgure out.</i>

1247
01:01:26,734 --> 01:01:29,134
How long have you known him?

1248
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:31,530
Not very long, but I like him.

1249
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,472
I know he's a little different,

1250
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:35,873
but that's what I like about him.

1251
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,673
He dresses like a complete dork.

1252
01:01:39,213 --> 01:01:41,681
He chews with his mouth open.

1253
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:44,215
He hardly ever says the right thing,

1254
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,879
<i>and he probably farts, too.</i>

1255
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,286
That's what you're looking for, is it?

1256
01:01:49,356 --> 01:01:50,380
A farter?

1257
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:52,652
No, I'm looking for a guy.

1258
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,026
Look, something struck me as strange
about him last night.

1259
01:01:57,097 --> 01:01:58,155
He...

1260
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,560
He gave me this funny vibe.

1261
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,102
Anyway, I called
some friends up north,

1262
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,970
and they've never heard of an architect
named Patrick Healy.

1263
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:09,839
<i>He's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.</i>

1264
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,400
Fuck!

1265
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,640
- That's strange.
- Yes, I thought so.

1266
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:18,240
Anyway, I hope you don't
think I'm being meddlesome.

1267
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,016
It's just that I think you should
be careful with this guy, that's all.

1268
01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:26,253
I mean, let's face it, you're beautiful, and

1269
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:29,587
and you've got money,
and you trust people.

1270
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,461
I'm just saying
there's a lot of psychos out there.

1271
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,000
<i>Just be careful.</i>

1272
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:35,035
Fucker!

1273
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:39,505
Look, Tucker, thank you.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

1274
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:42,732
OK, listen, I'll call you, OK?

1275
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:44,835
OK.

1276
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:49,840
Oh, damn.

1277
01:02:56,423 --> 01:03:02,453
- You want me to get those for you?
- No. I have to learn to do this myself.

1278
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:06,924
Damn!

1279
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:10,492
My leg.

1280
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:12,061
Could you, Mary?

1281
01:03:13,574 --> 01:03:14,632
Thank you.

1282
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:17,435
Wait. Wait.

1283
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,702
There.

1284
01:03:29,757 --> 01:03:30,883
- See?
- Yeah.

1285
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:32,322
I knew I could do it.

1286
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,655
Here, let me get the door.

1287
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,751
Thank you.

1288
01:03:35,963 --> 01:03:37,191
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

1289
01:03:37,264 --> 01:03:39,198
Jane, can you get the door for Tucker?

1290
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:41,962
Do you want me to...

1291
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:44,633
No. I've done this a thousand times.

1292
01:03:44,705 --> 01:03:45,729
OK.

1293
01:03:51,545 --> 01:03:58,417
Mr Stroehmann, on behalf of the South
Carolina Law Enforcement Community,

1294
01:03:58,485 --> 01:04:03,684
I would like to apologize to you
for any pain or temporary inconvenience

1295
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,755
that you may have been caused.

1296
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:06,884
Ohh.

1297
01:04:09,797 --> 01:04:12,027
At approximately 10.40 this morning,

1298
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,500
a man was apprehended not far
from where you were arrested.

1299
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:18,265
He was identified
as an escaped mental patient.

1300
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:21,740
Subsequently, he confessed to the murder
you're being held for.

1301
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:24,642
Lab tests confirm a fingerprint match.

1302
01:04:24,712 --> 01:04:26,646
You mean I'm free to go?

1303
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:30,339
No harm, no foul.

1304
01:04:33,053 --> 01:04:35,521
Oh, by the way,
there's someone there to see you.

1305
01:04:40,227 --> 01:04:41,251
Shut up!

1306
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:49,593
Phew!

1307
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:52,672
You are a lucky son of a bitch,
you know that?

1308
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,364
I am?

1309
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:55,832
Yeah.

1310
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,305
Didn't they tell you?

1311
01:04:57,378 --> 01:05:01,610
That hitcher was about to cut your throat
before you decided to take a piss.

1312
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:03,877
Had a fucking horseshoe
up your ass, my man.

1313
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:11,421
You got that nervous hive thing again?

1314
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:12,582
Yeah.

1315
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,021
Yeah, I do, Ted, um,
because I got some bad news.

1316
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:19,156
Are you OK?

1317
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:24,764
Ted, I'm dying.

1318
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:30,600
Oh, my...

1319
01:05:32,613 --> 01:05:35,411
Ted, I'm not dying, man. Come on!

1320
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,411
Jesus, it's just the humidity down here.

1321
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:43,857
No, the bad news I got
is about our friend Healy.

1322
01:05:43,924 --> 01:05:46,654
I sent my assistant down to his apartment
with his last pay check.

1323
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,922
The landlady said when
he came back from Miami

1324
01:05:48,996 --> 01:05:53,057
he kept talking about
falling for some doctor named Mary.

1325
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:54,191
Mary?

1326
01:05:55,669 --> 01:05:56,601
My Mary?

1327
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,694
Well...

1328
01:05:57,805 --> 01:06:01,332
Ted, here's Healy's address down there.

1329
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:06,244
And in the future, do a little research before
you send a guy like that out into the woods.

1330
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:08,907
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's creepy, OK?

1331
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:14,009
You're not seriously thinking
about going out with this guy again?

1332
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:15,953
Mary, honey, he's a psycho.

1333
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:17,820
Mary, the guy's full of shit.

1334
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,552
Jesus, this sucks.

1335
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:23,291
It's too bad this had to happen.

1336
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:25,765
He was almost perfect.

1337
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:29,261
Mary, what did you say
Pat's last name was?

1338
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:30,394
Healy.

1339
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:32,769
Come here, come here.
Come on, you got to hear this.

1340
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,864
What?

1341
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:35,441
<i>That's just the way</i>
<i>us Healys were raised.</i>

1342
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:37,409
<i>So, where the hell are you, Healy?</i>

1343
01:06:37,478 --> 01:06:41,039
<i>Ah, I got a date tonight</i>
<i>with that Mary girl I told you about.</i>

1344
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:42,605
<i>- The sawbones?</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

1345
01:06:42,683 --> 01:06:46,380
- We hit the mother lode.
- Should we be listening to this?

1346
01:06:46,453 --> 01:06:47,681
Shh, shh, shh!

1347
01:06:48,322 --> 01:06:50,415
<i>Does she still think</i>
<i>you're a fucking architect?</i>

1348
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:51,458
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1349
01:06:51,525 --> 01:06:53,186
<i>Dumb shit.</i>

1350
01:06:53,293 --> 01:06:54,385
Mr Perfect, huh?

1351
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:56,326
Hey, watch your mouth.

1352
01:06:56,396 --> 01:06:58,455
She's a great gal, Mary.

1353
01:06:58,532 --> 01:07:00,295
I'm the dumb shit for lying to her.

1354
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:03,632
<i>Why didn't you just tell her the truth?</i>

1355
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:04,671
I don't know.

1356
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:08,435
<i>It seems that women today</i>
<i>are more impressed by the almighty buck</i>

1357
01:07:08,509 --> 01:07:14,470
<i>than some schmo who's spent 17 years</i>
<i>scraping by on peace corps wages.</i>

1358
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:15,913
If she's as special as you say,

1359
01:07:15,983 --> 01:07:18,850
she's going to want to hear
about the things you did.

1360
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:23,015
You could tell her about
the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan.

1361
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,685
The orphan babies
who cried in your arms in

1362
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,749
Romania.

1363
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,557
The hope

1364
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:33,031
<i>you gave Freddy the leper in Calcutta.</i>

1365
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,193
<i>I'll be honest with you.</i>
<i>I'm a selfish prick.</i>

1366
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:38,530
I get a high from helping all God's creatures.

1367
01:07:40,607 --> 01:07:43,872
<i>An honest-to-goodness high.</i>
<i>I did all those things for myself.</i>

1368
01:07:43,944 --> 01:07:45,206
Hey, hey, hey.

1369
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:48,910
That's, uh...

1370
01:07:50,584 --> 01:07:52,848
That's, uh... that's bullshit, man.

1371
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,252
Hey. Hey, you were on the front line.

1372
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,256
<i>You remember?</i>

1373
01:07:57,324 --> 01:08:03,285
<i>The, um, malaria, the typhoon fever,</i>
<i>that vicious strain of genital herpes?</i>

1374
01:08:03,363 --> 01:08:04,387
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1375
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:05,989
Fuck!

1376
01:08:09,436 --> 01:08:13,805
<i>Yeah. I cured all sorts of horrible</i>
<i>illnesses in Third World countries.</i>

1377
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:16,365
<i>But the bottom line is, I'm not</i>
<i>going to use my philanthropy</i>

1378
01:08:16,443 --> 01:08:19,935
<i>as some kind of currency,</i>
<i>especially after what I did.</i>

1379
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:22,174
I lied to that poor girl.

1380
01:08:25,385 --> 01:08:26,409
Lied, man!

1381
01:08:26,753 --> 01:08:27,777
Well...

1382
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,782
Love will make you do fucked-up things.

1383
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:33,224
<i>You said it, mister.</i>

1384
01:08:33,293 --> 01:08:34,351
<i>I got to run.</i>

1385
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:36,822
We're dicks.

1386
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:46,098
<i>It's him! It's him!</i>

1387
01:08:48,075 --> 01:08:49,099
Mary.

1388
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,067
Hello.

1389
01:08:52,112 --> 01:08:53,807
Um, Mary, look...

1390
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:58,716
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

1391
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:00,912
I'm not the architect...

1392
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,491
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

1393
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:09,353
OK, guys, let's huddle up.

1394
01:09:09,429 --> 01:09:10,726
Come on, Jimmy!

1395
01:09:10,864 --> 01:09:12,263
Jimmy, I'm open! Hit me! Come on!

1396
01:09:12,332 --> 01:09:15,267
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

1397
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:23,671
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1398
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:24,676
Whoo!

1399
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:26,645
Exceptional, my ass.

1400
01:09:31,018 --> 01:09:31,882
Aah!

1401
01:09:31,952 --> 01:09:33,010
Huh?

1402
01:09:36,723 --> 01:09:40,090
<i>I wash my hair, and I kid myself</i>
<i>I look really sweet</i>

1403
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,754
Looks like I double jumped you
for the win.

1404
01:09:42,896 --> 01:09:44,261
Pay up, big guy.

1405
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:46,332
<i>Look over there</i>

1406
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:49,967
- Coconut.
- Yeah, very good. Coconut.

1407
01:09:50,037 --> 01:09:51,061
Coconut.

1408
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:53,299
Where's the rest of it, Warren?

1409
01:09:53,373 --> 01:09:55,170
<i>They say that looks</i>
<i>don't count for much</i>

1410
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,436
<i>So there goes your proof</i>

1411
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:04,347
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

1412
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:07,077
Look at her.

1413
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:10,117
She's more beautiful than I remember.

1414
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:11,521
She's perfect.

1415
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:15,453
Thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mar.

1416
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:17,724
Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.

1417
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,164
Don't worry about it. It was fun.

1418
01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:27,339
- Euch!
- Fuck me.

1419
01:10:28,742 --> 01:10:29,766
Whoa.

1420
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:31,669
How's my stomach taste?

1421
01:10:31,745 --> 01:10:34,612
Oh. How's my stomach taste, she says.

1422
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:37,707
Holy shit, look.
Look, there's Warren.

1423
01:10:37,784 --> 01:10:40,014
Franks and beans!

1424
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:41,054
Frank and beans!

1425
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:42,281
Warren, come on, you just ate.

1426
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:45,348
Hey, leave him alone. He's just got
a big appetite. Right, Warren?

1427
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:46,414
Huh?

1428
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,358
I said you got a big...

1429
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,488
Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren!

1430
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:53,999
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.

1431
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:59,138
You can't touch his ears
unless he trusts you. Are you OK?

1432
01:10:59,206 --> 01:11:01,140
Not to worry.

1433
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,732
So I'll see you tonight, right?

1434
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:03,833
Sure.

1435
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:08,839
Here, Warren.

1436
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:10,439
- You OK?
- He broke it.

1437
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,415
I saw.

1438
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:14,587
OK. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

1439
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:15,552
What? No.

1440
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:17,146
I don't know what to say.

1441
01:11:17,224 --> 01:11:19,488
Just tell her the truth about Healy.

1442
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:21,686
Blow the schmuck
out of the water. Come on.

1443
01:11:21,762 --> 01:11:22,786
No, I can't.

1444
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,194
I unleashed the psycho on her.
She's going to be fucking pissed.

1445
01:11:27,801 --> 01:11:28,825
Mary!

1446
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,864
Mary?

1447
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:38,734
Mary? Is that...

1448
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,938
It is you.

1449
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,212
Who is that?

1450
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:45,010
Hi. It's Ted.

1451
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,243
Ted?

1452
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:50,485
Yeah, Ted from Rhode Island. Ted.

1453
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,149
Ted? Oh, my God.

1454
01:11:52,692 --> 01:11:53,624
Ted!

1455
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:54,751
How are you?

1456
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:57,696
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1457
01:11:57,764 --> 01:11:58,822
How you been?

1458
01:11:58,899 --> 01:11:59,923
I'm...

1459
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,594
I haven't seen you since... since...

1460
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:04,637
Yeah. Since... since, um...

1461
01:12:04,704 --> 01:12:05,602
Senior prom.

1462
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:07,572
That's right... senior prom.

1463
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:10,007
I... you got a great memory.

1464
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,873
Oh, man, that was...

1465
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,405
I haven't thought about that in years.

1466
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:15,772
So, um...

1467
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:17,643
How's everything?

1468
01:12:18,885 --> 01:12:19,817
Everything, you know.

1469
01:12:19,886 --> 01:12:21,649
Oh, oh, that's fine.

1470
01:12:21,822 --> 01:12:24,552
You know, I was in and out of the hospital
in a couple of weeks.

1471
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:26,182
It was not a big deal at all.

1472
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,191
Now I'm good.

1473
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,818
Strong like bull.

1474
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:30,596
Really good.

1475
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:31,858
Hey, hi, Warren.

1476
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:32,864
Hi, Ted.

1477
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,868
- How are you?
- I'm... how are you?

1478
01:12:37,037 --> 01:12:39,528
I can't believe that he remembers you.

1479
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,595
Piggyback ride?

1480
01:12:40,674 --> 01:12:44,041
Oh, piggyback... no.
I'll take a rain check this time, OK?

1481
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:46,636
He never remembers anybody.
It's amazing.

1482
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:49,677
So, what are you doing here?

1483
01:12:49,749 --> 01:12:51,216
Do you work here?

1484
01:12:51,718 --> 01:12:53,777
This is my office. Well, it's up there.

1485
01:12:53,854 --> 01:12:57,085
I was just out
on my lunch break with Warren.

1486
01:12:57,257 --> 01:13:00,818
- It's crazy. What are you doing here?
- Well, that's a funny story.

1487
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:03,086
I was... I decided to...

1488
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,159
I got in the car with my friend, um

1489
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:10,693
and we just, uh...
we came down to Florida, right?

1490
01:13:13,673 --> 01:13:14,697
Right.

1491
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:18,771
Well, you look great.
You look really good.

1492
01:13:18,845 --> 01:13:20,403
I mean, what's the story?
Are you married?

1493
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,107
Do you have kids? What's the deal?

1494
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:23,877
No. Dodged a few bullets.

1495
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,974
Yeah?

1496
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:28,587
God, this is just so... bizarre.

1497
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,589
I mean, I'm standing
here with Mary Jensen.

1498
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,887
No, no. Now it's Mary Matthews.

1499
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:34,187
Oh. Did you...

1500
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:37,730
No, no. I haven't walked
down that plank yet, no.

1501
01:13:37,797 --> 01:13:40,789
But, uh, it was this thing in college.

1502
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:42,801
This creepy guy who...

1503
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:44,732
Anyhow, there was a restraining order,

1504
01:13:44,804 --> 01:13:48,137
got kind of ugly,
and after Princeton, I just decided

1505
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,472
be cautious. Change your name.

1506
01:13:50,544 --> 01:13:52,102
Just kind of leave that behind.

1507
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:55,615
Right. That sounds... that sounds horrible.

1508
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:56,842
It was... yeah.

1509
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:59,750
It was, but it's over, I think, so it's good.

1510
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:01,081
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

1511
01:14:01,154 --> 01:14:04,851
Do you think maybe you want to maybe,
I don't know, go out to dinner?

1512
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:06,290
Catch up on old times.

1513
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,327
Didn't we just do that?

1514
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:14,129
I'm fucking with you, Ted.

1515
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:23,975
No. Listen, I'd like to, it'd be great,
but, I sort of already have plans tonight.

1516
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:25,238
But I'm free tomorrow night.

1517
01:14:25,312 --> 01:14:26,939
Yeah, sure. Or, you know

1518
01:14:27,013 --> 01:14:30,278
or you could just blow off thatjerk
you're going out with tonight

1519
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,817
and come out with me.

1520
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,419
What hotel are you staying at?

1521
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:37,956
Uh, the Cardoza.

1522
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:42,025
Pick you up at 8.00?

1523
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:43,253
Sure.

1524
01:14:43,597 --> 01:14:44,359
- OK
- OK.

1525
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:45,523
Cool. See you.

1526
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:46,623
Bye.

1527
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,861
Look closely at this picture

1528
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,331
Ted and Mary like before

1529
01:14:52,672 --> 01:14:55,232
Can you see her as Ted sees her

1530
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:57,570
And why he couldn't wait no more?

1531
01:14:57,644 --> 01:15:00,078
And if you still think he's being silly

1532
01:15:00,146 --> 01:15:03,047
Then you've still got more to see

1533
01:15:03,216 --> 01:15:05,480
'Cause this isn'tjust a date, folks

1534
01:15:05,552 --> 01:15:07,179
This is chemistry

1535
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:08,678
And Mary

1536
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:14,352
Well, there's just somethin' about Mary

1537
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:27,771
<i>Banana!</i>
<i>We're gonna be buyin'bananas tonight!</i>

1538
01:15:29,075 --> 01:15:30,042
Ooh!

1539
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,168
Why's that?

1540
01:15:31,378 --> 01:15:33,243
'Cause back when I was your age,

1541
01:15:33,313 --> 01:15:38,182
I always used to make myself
a big banana split after sex.

1542
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:39,843
I think you're gonna need one tonight.

1543
01:15:39,919 --> 01:15:42,217
Oh. Don't get ahead of yourself, Magda.

1544
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:44,723
You'll probably be eating
a banana split before I do.

1545
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,088
Don't bet on it.

1546
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,927
Last time I had a pap smear,

1547
01:15:48,995 --> 01:15:51,793
the guy needed leather gloves
and an oyster shucker.

1548
01:15:55,235 --> 01:15:58,261
<i>I am a little psyched.</i>

1549
01:15:58,338 --> 01:16:02,832
<i>I ran into this guy I haven't</i>
<i>seen since high school.</i>

1550
01:16:02,942 --> 01:16:04,739
<i>An old flame?</i>

1551
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,938
<i>Kind of. Ted Stroehmann.</i>

1552
01:16:07,681 --> 01:16:10,241
<i>The sweetest guy in the world.</i>

1553
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:16,212
He was so cute. He was so clumsy
and he had this huge mouth full of metal.

1554
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:18,621
You know how I like braces.

1555
01:16:18,925 --> 01:16:21,189
Anyhow, we're going out tonight.

1556
01:16:21,261 --> 01:16:22,285
Oh, no!

1557
01:16:23,296 --> 01:16:26,663
Oh, God, that reminds me.
I have to cancel what's-his-face.

1558
01:16:26,733 --> 01:16:28,223
What's-his-face?

1559
01:16:32,138 --> 01:16:33,162
Who is it?

1560
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:34,331
It's Tucker.

1561
01:16:35,742 --> 01:16:36,674
Tucker.

1562
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:39,007
- Hello, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

1563
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,205
I'm fine, thank you.

1564
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,611
Oh, look who's here.

1565
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:42,648
There she is.

1566
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,378
I brought you a little thirst quencher, Mag.

1567
01:16:46,453 --> 01:16:47,784
Oh, aren't you sweet?

1568
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:49,287
No, I'm not. I

1569
01:16:49,723 --> 01:16:52,191
just want to get you drunk
so you'll pass out,

1570
01:16:52,258 --> 01:16:54,158
and I can give Mary a good rogering.

1571
01:16:55,295 --> 01:16:56,922
You want me to pour you one?

1572
01:16:56,996 --> 01:16:58,861
Uh, thanks, but I have to be going.

1573
01:16:58,932 --> 01:17:01,196
Unfortunately, this is not a social visit.

1574
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:02,859
Really? What's up?

1575
01:17:02,936 --> 01:17:05,302
Well, I've got a little more news
about your friend Healy.

1576
01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:08,834
<i>Tucker, everything's OK.</i>

1577
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:11,172
He confessed everything.
He told me he's not an architect.

1578
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,445
You were right, but right now
I'm actually running behind.

1579
01:17:14,514 --> 01:17:16,106
Mary, the man's a killer.

1580
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:17,206
What?

1581
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:21,085
<i>Yes. I have a friend</i>
<i>in the Boston police department.</i>

1582
01:17:21,154 --> 01:17:25,147
<i>He faxed me this morning.</i>
<i>I'll just give you the highlights.</i>

1583
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:28,092
After a short stint as a petty thief,

1584
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:33,565
Patrick R. Healy graduated
to armed robbery by the age of 14.

1585
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,960
At 16, he committed his first murder,

1586
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:40,267
a pretty teacher's aide
named Molly Pettygrove.

1587
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,672
He was incarcerated
until the age of 22,

1588
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,108
when despite a grim
psychological profile,

1589
01:17:45,178 --> 01:17:47,169
the state was forced to release him.

1590
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:49,909
In his mid-20s and again in his early 30s,

1591
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:53,783
he was suspected of homicides in the states
of Utah and Washington.

1592
01:17:53,853 --> 01:17:57,846
Unfortunately, the bodies
were so badly decomposed,

1593
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,654
there wasn't enough evidence to hold him.
And so on and so forth.

1594
01:18:01,861 --> 01:18:03,954
<i>You guys, what am I gonna do?</i>

1595
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:05,998
<i>I'm supposed to meet this guy in an hour.</i>

1596
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:09,967
Well, just calm down.
Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

1597
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:11,961
Tucker.

1598
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:16,131
Why you two never
hooked up is beyond me.

1599
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:19,201
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1600
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,476
Yes, well, don't get all gooey on me now.

1601
01:18:22,549 --> 01:18:23,948
You're gonna give me a big head.

1602
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:26,349
See, the important thing, Doctor,

1603
01:18:26,419 --> 01:18:28,910
is you have to distance
yourself as much as possible

1604
01:18:28,988 --> 01:18:30,819
without pissing this psycho off.

1605
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:33,416
OK.

1606
01:18:34,194 --> 01:18:37,288
I know what I got to do,
I know what I got to do.

1607
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:38,853
Where's the phone?

1608
01:18:52,078 --> 01:18:54,376
You're gonna pay, fucker.

1609
01:19:12,732 --> 01:19:14,256
I don't know, Dom.

1610
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:17,836
I don't feel good. I feel nervous.
I really feel nervous.

1611
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,563
Oh, come on, relax. Relax.

1612
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,130
Been to the cash machine?

1613
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:23,072
Yeah.

1614
01:19:23,142 --> 01:19:24,404
- Car clean?
- Uh-huh.

1615
01:19:24,477 --> 01:19:25,876
- Plenty of gas?
- Uh-huh.

1616
01:19:25,945 --> 01:19:28,573
Mmm. Breath. How's your breath?

1617
01:19:28,648 --> 01:19:31,014
It's fine. I had some Altoids.

1618
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:32,676
All right, I think you're all set.

1619
01:19:32,752 --> 01:19:35,687
So just go clean the pipes, and it's a go.

1620
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:36,813
Huh?

1621
01:19:36,923 --> 01:19:39,187
You know, clean the pipes.

1622
01:19:39,259 --> 01:19:41,989
What do you mean, clean the pipes?

1623
01:19:42,061 --> 01:19:46,361
You choke the chicken
before any big date, don't you?

1624
01:19:46,432 --> 01:19:50,562
Tell me you spank the monkey
before any big date.

1625
01:19:51,738 --> 01:19:57,267
Oh, my God. He doesn't flog the dolphin
before a big date. Are you crazy?

1626
01:19:57,343 --> 01:19:59,709
That's like going out there
with a loaded gun.

1627
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:02,475
Of course that's why you're nervous.

1628
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:05,518
Oh, my dear friend, please sit. Please.

1629
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:06,745
Uhh, look, um...

1630
01:20:07,987 --> 01:20:10,922
After you've had sex with a girl,

1631
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:12,821
and you're lying in bed with her,

1632
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,382
are you nervous?

1633
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,427
No.

1634
01:20:15,495 --> 01:20:17,258
No, you're not. Why?

1635
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:19,354
'Cause I'm tired.

1636
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:20,923
Wrong!

1637
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,397
It's 'cause you ain't got the baby batter
on the brain any more.

1638
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:27,735
Jesus, that stuff will fuck your head up.

1639
01:20:27,807 --> 01:20:28,865
Oh. Look...

1640
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,878
The most honest moment in a man's life

1641
01:20:32,946 --> 01:20:34,743
are the few minutes
after he's blown his load.

1642
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:38,341
Now, that is a medical fact
and the reason for it

1643
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:40,648
is that you're no longer
trying to get laid.

1644
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,814
You're actually thinking like a girl

1645
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,289
and girls love that.

1646
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:46,382
Holy shit.

1647
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,418
I've been going out with a loaded gun.

1648
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:51,520
Ohh.

1649
01:20:51,831 --> 01:20:53,298
People get hurt that way.

1650
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:23,486
Ohh! Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1651
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:25,121
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1652
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:29,560
Healy, how... how smashing to see you.

1653
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:31,069
You're dead! You fuckup!

1654
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,195
OK, take it easy.

1655
01:21:32,271 --> 01:21:36,332
Who the fuck do you think you are
making that shit up about me?

1656
01:21:36,409 --> 01:21:38,468
It's that stalker, Ted.

1657
01:21:38,578 --> 01:21:40,876
He got ahold of you, didn't he?

1658
01:21:40,947 --> 01:21:43,313
You're working for him,
aren't you, you little shit?

1659
01:21:43,383 --> 01:21:44,407
Who?

1660
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,127
Either you come clean,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

1661
01:21:55,194 --> 01:21:57,685
I love her, man!

1662
01:21:57,764 --> 01:21:58,822
What?

1663
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:01,226
You heard me, God damn it.

1664
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:06,238
I love Mary, man.

1665
01:22:08,908 --> 01:22:11,206
I'm a phony, just like you.

1666
01:22:13,312 --> 01:22:14,711
What do you mean?

1667
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:17,181
I mean, I'm a fucking fraud.

1668
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:21,612
I'm no architect. Don't be a putz, man.

1669
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:25,988
Who's been to Santiago, Chile,
twice in one year?

1670
01:22:26,926 --> 01:22:29,224
I've never even been in Jersey!

1671
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:31,456
OK, OK. Just take it easy.

1672
01:22:31,731 --> 01:22:34,825
Wait a minute.
You knew those people back at Harvard.

1673
01:22:34,901 --> 01:22:36,334
I knew shit, man.

1674
01:22:37,336 --> 01:22:40,635
The only thing I knew
was that you were a fake,

1675
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,470
and I made up everything else.

1676
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,305
My real name's Norm.

1677
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,338
I'm a pizza delivery boy.

1678
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:49,606
Here.

1679
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,509
Look. Here's my ID.

1680
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:00,458
Fuck me.

1681
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,071
Keep the change.

1682
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:57,807
Yeah!

1683
01:24:06,092 --> 01:24:07,116
Oh.

1684
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,632
Where the

1685
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,641
hell did it go?

1686
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:26,836
Uh, hang on.

1687
01:24:27,713 --> 01:24:28,975
Wait a second.

1688
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:48,133
Hey. Hello. How you doing?

1689
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:49,498
Good. How are you?

1690
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:50,763
- Good.
- Good.

1691
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:53,635
You are looking very beautiful.

1692
01:24:53,873 --> 01:24:54,931
Thank you.

1693
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:57,434
What is that?

1694
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:01,841
On your ear.

1695
01:25:02,215 --> 01:25:03,239
Ear?

1696
01:25:03,816 --> 01:25:05,374
No, your left ear.

1697
01:25:05,785 --> 01:25:06,809
Is that...

1698
01:25:09,822 --> 01:25:11,050
Is that hair gel?

1699
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:14,356
Yeah.

1700
01:25:14,427 --> 01:25:16,361
Great. I could use some.

1701
01:25:16,429 --> 01:25:18,761
No. You don't have to. You don't...

1702
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:20,093
I just ran out.

1703
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:25,603
How we doing over here?

1704
01:25:25,671 --> 01:25:26,365
OK.

1705
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:27,337
Little more wine?

1706
01:25:27,406 --> 01:25:28,304
Sure.

1707
01:25:29,475 --> 01:25:31,773
So... so when you say, um

1708
01:25:31,844 --> 01:25:33,038
killer, you mean...

1709
01:25:33,112 --> 01:25:34,909
He's a murderer. Yeah.

1710
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:36,641
Like an actual convicted murderer?

1711
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:39,310
He killed people. I know. It's crazy.

1712
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,444
And, uh, what?
Did he ever go to jail?

1713
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,509
Yeah. In Boston.

1714
01:25:42,588 --> 01:25:43,987
He spent I don't know how long, but...

1715
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,216
And he just got out?

1716
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:46,588
Well, it's obviously... the system sucks.

1717
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:48,251
The guy's walking the streets.

1718
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:49,191
I'm kissing him.

1719
01:25:49,262 --> 01:25:52,026
Right. But you didn't do anything

1720
01:25:52,098 --> 01:25:53,224
else, right?

1721
01:25:53,299 --> 01:25:54,323
What?

1722
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,731
I mean, you didn't...

1723
01:25:57,837 --> 01:26:01,796
No. No, no, no.
God, I couldn't live with myself.

1724
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,540
I mean, I only went out
with him a couple of times,

1725
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,874
but, you know, it's like,
just the thought of that...

1726
01:26:09,215 --> 01:26:11,445
I shouldn't be putting this all on you.

1727
01:26:11,517 --> 01:26:14,543
I'm sorry. We haven't
seen each other in so long.

1728
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:17,589
No. It's... it's just I feel really bad.

1729
01:26:17,657 --> 01:26:19,557
I'm tired of talking about stalkers.

1730
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:20,649
Let's talk about you.

1731
01:26:22,662 --> 01:26:24,129
Are you OK? Yeah?

1732
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:27,463
- Do you want some water?
- No. I'm good.

1733
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,501
Hey, Tracy, how are the twins?

1734
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:31,501
Fuck you, Norm.

1735
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:34,903
I like it when you
talk dirty to me, man.

1736
01:26:35,741 --> 01:26:37,038
Here you go, big guy.

1737
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,771
Come on. Cough it up, chompers.

1738
01:26:47,253 --> 01:26:49,778
How the hell did you meet Mary?

1739
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:52,180
It was just dumb luck, really.

1740
01:26:52,258 --> 01:26:54,192
I delivered a pie to her one night,

1741
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:57,923
and she answered the door
in her nightgown and, whoa.

1742
01:26:57,997 --> 01:26:59,555
That was it for me.

1743
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,132
I went home that night,
shaved my beard

1744
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,296
and a week later I'm laid out in her office
with a broken back.

1745
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:06,497
Broken back?

1746
01:27:07,006 --> 01:27:08,200
How'd you do that?

1747
01:27:08,274 --> 01:27:10,333
A friend. Baseball bat.

1748
01:27:10,576 --> 01:27:11,600
Ah. Touch.

1749
01:27:16,349 --> 01:27:18,214
Do you want another one?

1750
01:27:18,284 --> 01:27:19,581
Uh, sure. Yeah.

1751
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:21,777
Hey, Docky.

1752
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,414
Couple more nitrate-sicles, please.

1753
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,821
Two corn dogs coming up.

1754
01:27:25,891 --> 01:27:29,418
I don't think that they
have enough meats on sticks.

1755
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:31,122
No, seriously. If you think about it,

1756
01:27:31,197 --> 01:27:32,721
they have plenty of sweets, right?

1757
01:27:32,798 --> 01:27:34,857
They have lollipops,
they have fudgesicles.

1758
01:27:34,934 --> 01:27:36,367
They have popsicles,

1759
01:27:36,435 --> 01:27:38,665
but they don't have
any other meat on sticks.

1760
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:40,706
Yes, you don't see
that many meats on sticks.

1761
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:41,762
No, absolutely not.

1762
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,365
You know what I'd like to see?

1763
01:27:43,442 --> 01:27:46,104
I'd like to see more meats in a cone.

1764
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,941
You don't hardly ever see that.

1765
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:51,142
That's an idea I think is waiting to pop.

1766
01:27:51,217 --> 01:27:55,779
Just like a nice, big, oversized waffle cone
stuffed full of

1767
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:57,550
chopped liver.

1768
01:27:57,623 --> 01:27:58,555
Exactly.

1769
01:27:58,624 --> 01:28:01,457
It's too bad you don't live here, Ted.

1770
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:02,551
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1771
01:28:02,628 --> 01:28:04,596
We have a lot in common.

1772
01:28:05,564 --> 01:28:08,032
Well, you know, maybe, um...

1773
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:10,359
Have you ever thought about, uh

1774
01:28:10,436 --> 01:28:12,461
maybe moving back up to Rhode Island?

1775
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:16,668
I thought about it, but I got too much
of a good thing going on here.

1776
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:21,406
I got a great practice,
like the people I work with, Warren.

1777
01:28:21,814 --> 01:28:26,683
Maybe you should just, like,
move down here and marry me.

1778
01:28:30,623 --> 01:28:31,885
So you're a writer.

1779
01:28:31,957 --> 01:28:34,448
Yeah, well, I'm trying to be.

1780
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:37,192
Well, the good thing about writing

1781
01:28:37,263 --> 01:28:38,958
is you can do it anywhere.

1782
01:28:39,031 --> 01:28:40,191
That's true.

1783
01:28:42,468 --> 01:28:43,696
How about you?

1784
01:28:43,969 --> 01:28:48,167
How did you manage
to stay single all these years?

1785
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:53,906
Well, I'm bisexual, so that's hard
for a lot of guys to understand.

1786
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:56,372
Well...

1787
01:28:56,449 --> 01:28:58,314
You gonna smoke that?

1788
01:29:00,886 --> 01:29:04,322
You know, I read somewhere
that most women are

1789
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,187
if you really ask them honestly,

1790
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,725
have tendencies towards...

1791
01:29:07,793 --> 01:29:13,060
- I mean, everybody has a bit of...
- Ted, I'm fucking with you.

1792
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:14,423
Yeah.

1793
01:29:16,068 --> 01:29:18,263
Stalking motherfucker.

1794
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:21,798
I know. It sickens me.

1795
01:29:23,242 --> 01:29:25,904
Actually, I did almost get married once.

1796
01:29:29,048 --> 01:29:30,413
What happened?

1797
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,348
Well, he was a really great guy.

1798
01:29:34,487 --> 01:29:36,455
He lived up north, and, uh...

1799
01:29:36,522 --> 01:29:38,046
Come on, let's go.

1800
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:45,458
Here you go.

1801
01:30:02,047 --> 01:30:03,981
Wait. How many is this?

1802
01:30:06,152 --> 01:30:07,449
- Four.
- Four?

1803
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:11,851
That seems like an awful of lot of speed
to give one little pooch.

1804
01:30:11,924 --> 01:30:13,516
Are you sure it won't kill him?

1805
01:30:13,592 --> 01:30:15,116
I never said that.

1806
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:19,498
There's a baby.

1807
01:30:25,905 --> 01:30:27,998
Ah, good, good, good, good.

1808
01:30:28,073 --> 01:30:29,097
So...

1809
01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:32,669
Then it was over.
We really haven't spoken since.

1810
01:30:33,412 --> 01:30:37,109
Hmm. Wow. Sounds like
he was almost perfect.

1811
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:38,275
Hmm.

1812
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:39,775
Almost.

1813
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:45,714
Hey, you want to go upstairs
and watch Sportscenter?

1814
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:46,815
Uh...

1815
01:30:47,726 --> 01:30:50,752
You know, I think I'm just
gonna quit while I'm ahead.

1816
01:30:50,829 --> 01:30:53,559
You're not that far ahead, Ted.

1817
01:31:00,339 --> 01:31:01,363
Magda!

1818
01:31:03,108 --> 01:31:04,666
What are you doing?

1819
01:31:04,743 --> 01:31:07,211
Hi, hon. Just straightening up.

1820
01:31:11,984 --> 01:31:13,349
Put that down!

1821
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:14,443
Whoa.

1822
01:31:15,754 --> 01:31:16,778
Magda!

1823
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:18,883
Thanks, doll.

1824
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:19,982
Whoa!

1825
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:23,525
Magda. Magda.

1826
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:26,464
Honey, where is Puffy?

1827
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:29,561
Oh. He was being a pest,
so I put him in the bathroom.

1828
01:31:29,635 --> 01:31:30,624
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1829
01:31:32,538 --> 01:31:33,562
Ted.

1830
01:31:34,873 --> 01:31:36,397
Can you do me a favor?

1831
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:38,067
Would you mind letting
the dog out of the bathroom?

1832
01:31:38,143 --> 01:31:40,543
'Cause I think I should
have a talk with Magda here.

1833
01:31:40,613 --> 01:31:41,477
Sure, yeah.

1834
01:31:56,495 --> 01:31:57,553
Uh, Mary?

1835
01:31:57,763 --> 01:31:58,787
Huh?

1836
01:31:59,632 --> 01:32:01,623
What kind of dog is Puffy?

1837
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:06,034
- Border terrier.
- Border terrier. Like, uh, Benji.

1838
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07,094
Oh.

1839
01:32:15,481 --> 01:32:16,505
Hey.

1840
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:18,807
Hey.

1841
01:32:19,418 --> 01:32:22,182
Are you the little guy
making all that big noise?

1842
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:23,243
Huh? Hmm?

1843
01:32:26,992 --> 01:32:28,016
Ohh! Ohh!

1844
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:30,319
Oh, Ted!

1845
01:32:35,668 --> 01:32:36,134
Ohh!

1846
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:41,864
Puffy, stop it!

1847
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:42,998
No!

1848
01:32:43,676 --> 01:32:44,700
No!

1849
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:46,675
Take a little bit of this!

1850
01:32:48,614 --> 01:32:50,479
Puffy! Puffy!

1851
01:32:57,623 --> 01:32:58,647
Puffy!

1852
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:09,625
Oh, Ted!

1853
01:33:14,873 --> 01:33:15,897
Puffy.

1854
01:33:20,879 --> 01:33:21,937
- Puffy!
- Puffy!

1855
01:33:23,082 --> 01:33:24,947
Puffy, Puffy! Puffy!

1856
01:33:25,084 --> 01:33:26,312
Puffy! Puffy!

1857
01:33:26,952 --> 01:33:28,180
Puffy! Puffy!

1858
01:33:38,263 --> 01:33:39,491
You want a grape?

1859
01:33:39,565 --> 01:33:40,793
A grape? Sure.

1860
01:33:42,668 --> 01:33:43,965
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1861
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:46,301
All net. All net.

1862
01:33:46,805 --> 01:33:48,397
We make a good team.

1863
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:19,761
Oh, oh!

1864
01:34:20,005 --> 01:34:21,029
Closer?

1865
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,732
It's all right. Get in closer.

1866
01:34:22,808 --> 01:34:23,775
That's good. That's good.

1867
01:34:23,842 --> 01:34:24,740
Don't be afraid. Get right in there.

1868
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,937
A little bit more. A little bit more.

1869
01:34:27,012 --> 01:34:29,742
He'll be fine. Mary, you're overprotective.

1870
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:05,049
No, no, no. We already got it.

1871
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,788
Come on, come on.

1872
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:17,089
Pow! Pow! Pow!

1873
01:35:17,429 --> 01:35:18,487
Pow!

1874
01:35:20,432 --> 01:35:21,797
Warren. Warren!

1875
01:35:22,868 --> 01:35:23,766
Warren!

1876
01:35:23,836 --> 01:35:24,860
Warren!

1877
01:35:27,706 --> 01:35:28,764
Warren!

1878
01:35:32,578 --> 01:35:32,839
Warren!

1879
01:35:32,911 --> 01:35:34,606
Warren! Come here! Stop!

1880
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:39,278
I'm OK! I'm OK!

1881
01:35:40,519 --> 01:35:41,577
Hey! Hey!

1882
01:35:43,288 --> 01:35:46,519
It's his fault.
He hit me with that stuff.

1883
01:35:46,592 --> 01:35:48,526
Whoo! Warren! Warren!

1884
01:35:48,727 --> 01:35:49,659
Stop!

1885
01:36:13,652 --> 01:36:14,619
Oh, God.

1886
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:16,381
I didn't do it.

1887
01:36:16,455 --> 01:36:17,854
He got in the way.

1888
01:36:17,923 --> 01:36:19,083
I know, I know, I know.

1889
01:36:19,157 --> 01:36:20,647
Does anybody have any pliers?

1890
01:36:20,726 --> 01:36:22,887
Needle-nose otherwise?

1891
01:36:23,028 --> 01:36:24,495
Anything?

1892
01:36:32,938 --> 01:36:33,962
Hey.

1893
01:36:35,674 --> 01:36:38,165
Flowers are for you.
Ball is for Warren.

1894
01:36:38,243 --> 01:36:40,905
Had a friend Fed-Ex it from Boston.

1895
01:36:40,979 --> 01:36:43,709
Signed by Tony... Conigliaro.

1896
01:36:43,982 --> 01:36:46,917
Did you hire Pat Healy to spy on me?

1897
01:36:49,688 --> 01:36:50,586
What?

1898
01:36:52,324 --> 01:36:54,724
What are you talking about?

1899
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,558
I got an anonymous letter.

1900
01:36:58,997 --> 01:37:00,760
It's not true, right, Ted?

1901
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:06,037
Well, it's... it's...

1902
01:37:06,104 --> 01:37:08,538
It's an interesting thing that happened.

1903
01:37:08,607 --> 01:37:09,665
I, um...

1904
01:37:11,343 --> 01:37:13,675
Yeah, it's true, but it's... it's not...

1905
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,270
OK. Get out.

1906
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:18,048
Mary, wait. First of all,

1907
01:37:18,116 --> 01:37:20,016
I didn't know that this guy was...

1908
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:21,746
What? That he was a murderer?

1909
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,085
Uh, that, yeah,
and in addition to many other things.

1910
01:37:25,157 --> 01:37:26,624
I didn't know anything about the guy.

1911
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:27,624
I hardly know him.

1912
01:37:27,693 --> 01:37:29,160
How could you do that, Ted?

1913
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:31,627
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

1914
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:36,297
What were you trying to do?

1915
01:37:38,003 --> 01:37:41,439
Trick me into feeling something for you?

1916
01:37:44,142 --> 01:37:45,439
No. I didn't...

1917
01:37:46,545 --> 01:37:48,308
I didn't want to trick you.

1918
01:37:49,982 --> 01:37:51,006
Just leave.

1919
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:52,982
OK?

1920
01:37:54,386 --> 01:37:55,410
Mary...

1921
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:57,119
Go.

1922
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:11,728
I did it because I never
stopped thinking about you.

1923
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,772
And if I didn't find you,
I knew that my life

1924
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,967
would never, ever be good again.

1925
01:39:00,819 --> 01:39:01,808
Hey.

1926
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:04,884
Healy! You in there?

1927
01:39:10,729 --> 01:39:11,787
Hello?

1928
01:39:21,273 --> 01:39:22,297
Eww.

1929
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:30,409
And it was going along just fine
until you showed up.

1930
01:39:34,419 --> 01:39:35,443
Holy shit!

1931
01:39:37,289 --> 01:39:39,689
This is a pretty nice place.

1932
01:39:40,258 --> 01:39:41,190
Heh.

1933
01:39:41,259 --> 01:39:43,955
Sully, what the fuck happened?

1934
01:39:44,362 --> 01:39:45,351
Hey, surprise!

1935
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:47,660
Whoa, whoa! Hey, peace, man.

1936
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:48,631
You fucked me, man!

1937
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:49,826
Wait! Hey, come on!

1938
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:50,993
Look... look, man...

1939
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,661
Look, don't do anything
rash now, buddy, hmm?

1940
01:39:52,738 --> 01:39:54,296
Who the fuck is this guy?!

1941
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,870
Uh, that's Norm. He's a pizza boy.

1942
01:39:57,943 --> 01:39:59,570
He's in love with Mary, too.

1943
01:39:59,644 --> 01:40:01,305
Look, come on, man.

1944
01:40:01,513 --> 01:40:05,643
All right... look, I think everybody
could use a drink right now, hmm?

1945
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:07,207
I don't want a drink!

1946
01:40:07,285 --> 01:40:08,274
Fuck you!

1947
01:40:08,353 --> 01:40:10,446
Whoa, hey, hey, look...

1948
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:13,853
You asked me to follow
around your girl and I did.

1949
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:18,089
And then the truth is,
I... I started to like her.

1950
01:40:19,531 --> 01:40:23,865
And that's when I realized I couldn't
in good conscience bring myself to do it.

1951
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:26,297
Do what?

1952
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:29,738
Turn her over to a violent... stalker.

1953
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:31,306
Oh, I'm a stalker.

1954
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:33,475
You're calling me a violent stalker?

1955
01:40:33,545 --> 01:40:34,671
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1956
01:40:34,746 --> 01:40:36,373
You're a sick fuck.

1957
01:40:38,383 --> 01:40:39,350
Hey, fuck you.

1958
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:40,475
Fuck you!

1959
01:40:40,552 --> 01:40:42,520
You just can't take the fact
that it was my turn!

1960
01:40:42,587 --> 01:40:43,611
Your turn?

1961
01:40:43,688 --> 01:40:45,713
Yeah, that's right. My turn.

1962
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:48,919
Why can't I ever get a girl like Mary?

1963
01:40:49,761 --> 01:40:51,160
Yeah, well, just 'cause
you didn't get her,

1964
01:40:51,229 --> 01:40:53,527
you didn't have to blow
us both out of the water.

1965
01:40:53,598 --> 01:40:55,498
What are you talkin' about?

1966
01:40:55,567 --> 01:40:58,434
You're gonna tell me
you didn't write her an anonymous letter

1967
01:40:58,503 --> 01:41:01,233
telling her about our whole deal together?

1968
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:02,398
What letter?

1969
01:41:04,509 --> 01:41:05,533
Come on.

1970
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,770
It was you.

1971
01:41:12,117 --> 01:41:13,846
You sent the letter.

1972
01:41:14,519 --> 01:41:15,543
It was you!

1973
01:41:16,555 --> 01:41:18,819
We had a deal.
You said you wouldn't fuck me

1974
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:20,517
and I wouldn't fuck you until

1975
01:41:20,592 --> 01:41:23,993
we got this fuck outta
the fuckin' picture.

1976
01:41:24,062 --> 01:41:26,087
You crossed the line, man!

1977
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:27,153
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

1978
01:41:27,232 --> 01:41:29,200
You're gettin' crazy, now.

1979
01:41:29,267 --> 01:41:30,894
Why would I cross the line?

1980
01:41:30,969 --> 01:41:33,733
Y-you probably did it yourself,
you piece of shit.

1981
01:41:34,472 --> 01:41:36,167
Oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1982
01:41:36,241 --> 01:41:37,970
Why would I rat myself out?

1983
01:41:38,043 --> 01:41:40,568
Like I'm gonna try
to figure out some guy

1984
01:41:40,645 --> 01:41:43,808
whose idea of courtin'
is blowin' farts in her face.

1985
01:41:43,882 --> 01:41:46,350
- You were followin' us.
- Don't flatter yourself.

1986
01:41:46,418 --> 01:41:48,579
I-I-I was following her!

1987
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:52,013
I always do.

1988
01:41:53,558 --> 01:41:56,823
How the hell do you think I got
rid of the last guy... Brett?

1989
01:41:56,895 --> 01:41:58,556
Br... wait. Brett?

1990
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:03,324
Are you sayin' that Brett didn't
say those things about Warren?

1991
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:05,164
Are you shittin' me?

1992
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:07,600
Mr Goody Two-Shoes?

1993
01:42:08,273 --> 01:42:11,208
He was like an eagle scout!

1994
01:42:11,276 --> 01:42:12,504
Wait a minute!

1995
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:15,179
You two should be kissin'
my fuckin' hairy beanbag,

1996
01:42:15,247 --> 01:42:18,648
'cause if it wasn't for me,
she might have married that schmuck!

1997
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,177
I feel sick.

1998
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:25,189
Both of you are just...

1999
01:42:26,424 --> 01:42:27,721
I'm outta here.

2000
01:42:48,713 --> 01:42:49,737
Woogie?

2001
01:42:50,048 --> 01:42:52,016
Who the hell is Woogie?

2002
01:42:55,854 --> 01:42:56,878
Hello.

2003
01:42:58,857 --> 01:43:00,848
What are... what are you doing here?

2004
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:03,224
Did you get my letter, Mar?

2005
01:43:04,162 --> 01:43:05,356
The one about Ted?

2006
01:43:07,232 --> 01:43:08,460
Y-you sent that?

2007
01:43:08,533 --> 01:43:09,557
Mm-hmm.

2008
01:43:11,503 --> 01:43:13,562
I was worried about you.

2009
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:19,070
Woogie, you know you're not supposed
to be within 400 yards of me.

2010
01:43:19,144 --> 01:43:20,577
Oh, I know. I do, in fact.

2011
01:43:20,645 --> 01:43:23,910
That's... that's what I really
wanted to talk to you about.

2012
01:43:23,982 --> 01:43:27,645
You know that I have
actually been through

2013
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:32,918
nine years of intensive psychotherapy
and you know something?

2014
01:43:32,991 --> 01:43:34,458
You were absolutely right.

2015
01:43:34,526 --> 01:43:35,390
I needed help.

2016
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:36,984
That's great, Woogie.

2017
01:43:37,062 --> 01:43:40,259
I mean, I'm glad you're doing better.

2018
01:43:40,365 --> 01:43:42,060
You... you look...

2019
01:43:42,534 --> 01:43:43,762
You look good.

2020
01:43:44,336 --> 01:43:45,360
Thank you.

2021
01:43:45,503 --> 01:43:48,870
Except for the rash thing's
still there, right?

2022
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,908
Yes. You noticed, huh?

2023
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,603
These are called love blisters.

2024
01:43:53,678 --> 01:43:55,942
They went away for a little while,

2025
01:43:56,014 --> 01:43:59,211
but then you came back
in my life, milady, huh?

2026
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:04,615
Woogie... I did not come
back into your life, OK?

2027
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:07,481
I don't even know
how you found me.

2028
01:44:07,559 --> 01:44:11,461
Let's not forget here,
you put me through a lot of bullshit, OK?

2029
01:44:11,529 --> 01:44:14,623
I had to change my name.
I had to go to court.

2030
01:44:14,699 --> 01:44:15,631
I moved!

2031
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:18,362
I mean, you stole all of my shoes!

2032
01:44:18,436 --> 01:44:19,368
What?!

2033
01:44:19,437 --> 01:44:21,962
What are you talking about?!

2034
01:44:22,374 --> 01:44:24,706
Woogie, I caught you red-handed!

2035
01:44:24,776 --> 01:44:27,711
I was in a weird place then, Mary.

2036
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:30,338
Come on.

2037
01:44:30,715 --> 01:44:34,549
OK? Come on. Gimme...
gimme a break here, OK?

2038
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:36,946
I was a little... a little nuts, a little...

2039
01:44:37,022 --> 01:44:39,115
But I'm fine.

2040
01:44:39,391 --> 01:44:40,415
Woogie,

2041
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:43,989
you're starting to make
me a little nervous.

2042
01:44:44,062 --> 01:44:46,656
Ooh! I'm making you feel nervous.

2043
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:48,164
Nervous... what's that?

2044
01:44:48,233 --> 01:44:51,293
I don't know anything
about nervous. Ehhh! Jeez.

2045
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:54,532
You ever had a whitehead
on your eyeball, Mary? Hmm?

2046
01:44:54,606 --> 01:44:57,404
Woogie, I'm asking you to leave.

2047
01:44:57,575 --> 01:44:58,371
No, Mary...

2048
01:44:59,077 --> 01:45:01,136
No, Mary, you got this all wrong.

2049
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:04,010
I'm not going anywhere. Mm-mmm.

2050
01:45:05,283 --> 01:45:08,377
Until I get something
to remember you by.

2051
01:45:17,128 --> 01:45:18,891
Stop it! Stop!

2052
01:45:19,297 --> 01:45:23,131
Just one pair! You owe me that,
you heartless bitch!

2053
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:25,567
Huh? Whoa! What the... hey!

2054
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:31,399
Oh...

2055
01:45:32,377 --> 01:45:33,366
Dom?

2056
01:45:33,445 --> 01:45:35,003
You're pathetic.

2057
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,646
Tucker... what happened to your crutches?

2058
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,776
Uh, well, uh, yeah...

2059
01:45:42,854 --> 01:45:45,049
That's a very good query, Mary. Well done.

2060
01:45:45,123 --> 01:45:47,648
Come on! Tell her the truth, pizza boy.

2061
01:45:51,396 --> 01:45:53,557
Name's Norm.

2062
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:56,930
I live with my folks up in Pompano. Hey.

2063
01:45:58,937 --> 01:46:02,839
Oh, man! This is like
group therapy or somethin'!

2064
01:46:02,907 --> 01:46:04,898
Dom! What are you doin' here?

2065
01:46:05,009 --> 01:46:08,706
You stole her from me
and now I want her back.

2066
01:46:08,847 --> 01:46:11,839
I stole her from you? What are you...
what are you talkin' about?

2067
01:46:11,916 --> 01:46:13,008
Mm-hmm.

2068
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:15,983
Woogie! How many times
did I tell you this at Princeton?

2069
01:46:16,054 --> 01:46:17,078
Woogie?

2070
01:46:17,322 --> 01:46:19,222
Ted and I had one date.

2071
01:46:19,824 --> 01:46:21,382
You and I were already broken up!

2072
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:22,448
You're Woogie?

2073
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:24,461
Dom Wooganowski.

2074
01:46:27,165 --> 01:46:28,826
But... you're married.

2075
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,925
You have a wife, beautiful kids.

2076
01:46:31,035 --> 01:46:34,766
Ted, if you love 'em so much,
please, be my guest.

2077
01:46:34,839 --> 01:46:37,205
All right, what the hell
is going on in here?

2078
01:46:37,275 --> 01:46:39,436
Can someone explain it to me?

2079
01:46:39,511 --> 01:46:43,538
Um, look, we're...
we're all in love with Mary.

2080
01:46:44,115 --> 01:46:45,139
Oh, God.

2081
01:46:46,684 --> 01:46:48,948
If I may, I have a proposal.

2082
01:46:50,555 --> 01:46:53,547
I say none of us leaves this room

2083
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:57,325
till our young Mary here
stops jerkin' us around

2084
01:46:57,395 --> 01:46:59,829
and decides, once and for all,

2085
01:46:59,898 --> 01:47:01,456
who she really wants.

2086
01:47:03,568 --> 01:47:06,503
Now, Mary, I know this is tough

2087
01:47:07,071 --> 01:47:10,404
but you really will be doing them all
a great favor

2088
01:47:10,475 --> 01:47:12,340
to tell them the truth about us.

2089
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:13,536
Are you crazy?

2090
01:47:13,611 --> 01:47:15,806
What makes you think
I would pick you, anyhow?

2091
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:16,938
You're a murderer!

2092
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:19,407
Uh...

2093
01:47:20,485 --> 01:47:23,113
Well, I, uh, I may have been blowin'

2094
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:26,885
a little smoke up your ass
there, Mary. Sorry.

2095
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:27,925
Whoa! Whoa-ho!

2096
01:47:29,594 --> 01:47:30,720
Whoa-ho-ho!

2097
01:47:31,296 --> 01:47:32,320
Touchdown!

2098
01:47:32,764 --> 01:47:33,788
Hi, Mary.

2099
01:47:34,232 --> 01:47:35,164
Brett?

2100
01:47:35,233 --> 01:47:38,168
What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

2101
01:47:38,236 --> 01:47:40,466
I'm in town to play
the Dolphins, you dumbass.

2102
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:42,130
Yeah, I called him, Mary.

2103
01:47:42,207 --> 01:47:44,505
I told him to pick up Warren
and get down here.

2104
01:47:44,642 --> 01:47:46,974
See, your friend Tucker was lying
about a couple of other things.

2105
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:51,180
Brett never said those
bad things about Warren.

2106
01:47:51,249 --> 01:47:52,716
He loves Warren.

2107
01:47:52,784 --> 01:47:55,446
And from what he told me
on the phone just now,

2108
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,249
he loves you, too.

2109
01:47:57,755 --> 01:47:59,188
He's the guy you should be with.

2110
01:47:59,257 --> 01:48:00,519
God.

2111
01:48:03,828 --> 01:48:05,295
That's right, Mary.

2112
01:48:05,363 --> 01:48:07,388
You know I'll always be true to you.

2113
01:48:07,465 --> 01:48:10,400
Oh, shit! This isn't fair. Jesus!

2114
01:48:11,236 --> 01:48:13,796
You know, I feel like an idiot.

2115
01:48:14,005 --> 01:48:16,940
See, I realized somethin' today.

2116
01:48:17,275 --> 01:48:19,368
I'm no better than any of these guys.

2117
01:48:19,444 --> 01:48:22,641
I mean, none of them love you, really.

2118
01:48:23,348 --> 01:48:25,282
They're just... they're just

2119
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,113
fixated on you, because of how

2120
01:48:27,185 --> 01:48:28,584
you make them feel about themselves.

2121
01:48:28,653 --> 01:48:30,553
I mean, that's not real love.

2122
01:48:30,622 --> 01:48:32,283
That's...

2123
01:48:32,657 --> 01:48:34,215
I don't know what that is.

2124
01:48:35,226 --> 01:48:38,218
Please! Mary, don't listen to him!

2125
01:48:38,663 --> 01:48:41,962
This is just another one
of his stupid little ploys.

2126
01:48:42,033 --> 01:48:44,433
You know, Stroehmann,
you are so full of shit!

2127
01:48:44,502 --> 01:48:46,561
Yeah, you're the biggest
stalker of us all, man!

2128
01:48:46,638 --> 01:48:48,299
You're gonna stand here and tell me

2129
01:48:48,373 --> 01:48:49,863
that you're not nuts
about this girl?

2130
01:48:51,209 --> 01:48:53,200
Yeah, that's what I'm tellin' you.

2131
01:48:53,278 --> 01:48:54,302
Oh!

2132
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:58,415
Hey, good luck, Brett.

2133
01:48:58,716 --> 01:48:59,944
Yeah. Thank you.

2134
01:49:00,018 --> 01:49:03,010
She's a great gal. Take care of her.

2135
01:49:03,521 --> 01:49:05,386
I'll, uh, see you, Mary.

2136
01:49:06,991 --> 01:49:08,015
Bye, Ted.

2137
01:49:11,262 --> 01:49:13,526
Hey, Warren, see ya later.

2138
01:49:13,665 --> 01:49:15,223
OK. Goodbye, Ted.

2139
01:49:17,268 --> 01:49:18,895
Goodbye.

2140
01:49:20,038 --> 01:49:22,438
God. Mary, I've missed you.

2141
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,834
Hey, uh, Brett.

2142
01:49:23,908 --> 01:49:25,102
What are the chances I could get you

2143
01:49:25,209 --> 01:49:27,234
to give me a little autograph
on this pump here, huh?

2144
01:49:27,312 --> 01:49:28,870
Somethin' nice
for the wife and kids.

2145
01:49:28,946 --> 01:49:29,878
What?!

2146
01:49:29,947 --> 01:49:31,847
Ah, shut up. Cock tease.

2147
01:49:58,309 --> 01:50:01,836
Well, she's back
with her old boyfriend

2148
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,939
He don't challenge her

2149
01:50:05,316 --> 01:50:07,284
He don't contend with her

2150
01:50:07,352 --> 01:50:10,753
And she don't answer
the cards you send

2151
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:14,120
And you're jealous of the time

2152
01:50:14,192 --> 01:50:15,853
That he spend with her

2153
01:50:15,927 --> 01:50:18,862
Just let her go into the darkness

2154
01:50:20,732 --> 01:50:23,929
Let her live for all the things there

2155
01:50:25,303 --> 01:50:27,771
Let her go into the darkness

2156
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:32,505
Let her go, let her go, let her go

2157
01:50:57,235 --> 01:50:58,293
Ted!

2158
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:01,762
Mary?

2159
01:51:04,342 --> 01:51:05,366
Ted!

2160
01:51:06,844 --> 01:51:07,902
Mary!

2161
01:51:10,982 --> 01:51:12,006
Ted!

2162
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:18,150
You forgot your keys.

2163
01:51:31,469 --> 01:51:34,063
Did you really mean
what you said up there?

2164
01:51:35,273 --> 01:51:36,331
Uh-huh.

2165
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:40,039
I just want you to be happy, Mary.

2166
01:51:44,015 --> 01:51:46,279
But I'd be happiest with you.

2167
01:51:50,288 --> 01:51:52,381
You're fuckin' with me, right?

2168
01:51:54,592 --> 01:51:55,456
What...

2169
01:51:56,794 --> 01:51:58,022
What about...

2170
01:51:58,763 --> 01:52:00,424
Brett Fav... re?

2171
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:06,493
What did I tell you
the first time we met?

2172
01:52:06,571 --> 01:52:08,471
I'm a niners fan.

2173
01:52:09,907 --> 01:52:10,965
Heh.

2174
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:24,053
His friends would say stop whinin'

2175
01:52:24,121 --> 01:52:26,521
They've had enough of that

2176
01:52:26,691 --> 01:52:29,558
His friends would say stop pinin'

2177
01:52:29,627 --> 01:52:32,061
There's other girls to look at

2178
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:34,529
They've tried to set him up

2179
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:37,360
With Tiffany and Indigo

2180
01:52:37,435 --> 01:52:40,427
But there's somethin' about Mary

2181
01:52:40,905 --> 01:52:42,930
That they don't know...

2182
01:52:43,007 --> 01:52:44,668
What are you doing?

2183
01:52:44,809 --> 01:52:46,538
That's my girl he's kissin'.

2184
01:52:46,611 --> 01:52:48,340
But you just slept with me!

2185
01:52:48,412 --> 01:52:50,903
I was only bonin' you to get to Mary.

2186
01:53:02,593 --> 01:53:04,060
And a one... 2, 3, 4

2187
01:53:04,128 --> 01:53:05,152
5, 6, 7, 8!
