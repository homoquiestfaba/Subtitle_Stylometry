Wakey, wakey,Joel.

That hurts, doesn´t it ?

826
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:01,017
I´ve heard that flashing
lights and migraines don´t
go together at all.

- Oh, no, Polly. No, no,
I´m not gonna kill him.

We need each other.
We define each other.

Sit down.

I´ll sit here and listen
to you talk all night.
Just take your hands off her.

845

Come on, put the fucking
gun down. We both know
you´re notgonna do it.

And why do we know that ?

847
01:25:49,759 --> 01:25:52,353
Because you can
only kill her once.

Only instead
of bringing us together,

you move to Chicago.

857
01:26:34,478 --> 01:26:36,878
The guilt must
have been unbearable.

Is that what
you want me to say ?

I feel guilty
a woman is dead because
I made a terrible mistake.

No.

No, no.
That wasn´t the mistake.

863
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:59,898
The mistake was turning
back instead of pouring
all you had into us.

What do I want you to say ?
I want you to say thankyou.
