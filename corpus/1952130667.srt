1
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,936
Mr. Gustafson!

2
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:45,115
I have to talk to you!

3
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:51,951
Mr. Gustafson, will you answer
the door, please?!

4
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:53,523
I know you're in there!

5
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:59,794
<i>It's</i> no use pretending this <i>isn't</i>
happening, Mr. Gustafson!

6
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:01,956
I <i>can't</i> keep coming...

7
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:05,194
...back here every couple of days!

8
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:07,965
You have to talk to me!

9
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:13,403
Mr. Gustafson, <i>I'm</i> just trying
to help you!

10
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,803
Come on and open the door!

11
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,141
I'll just keep knocking!

12
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:21,551
I'll come back, so you might
as well answer the door!

13
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:26,552
I know you're in there!

14
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:31,156
Think of the neighbors,
Mr. Gustafson!

15
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,730
<i>There's</i> a letter for you,
Mr. Gustafson!

16
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,999
I suggest you read it!

17
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:45,236
- Morning, dickhead.
- Hello, moron.

18
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:47,002
What are you?

19
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,735
Never mind. Just forget it.

20
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,346
<i>Who's</i> the guy yakking?

21
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,073
Mind your own business.

22
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,243
Mind your own business. Tie your shoe.
You'll fall on your stupid head.

23
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:57,752
Shut up!

24
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,521
We're having a heat wave.

25
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:05,254
<i>''W e're having a heat wave
A tropical heat <i>wave''</i>

26
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,102
Somebody moving into
the old Clickner place.

27
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:18,471
- You picked up on that, Sherlock.
- Excuse me!

28
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,874
I wonder if you could tell me...

29
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,606
...where I could find Mr. Gustafson?

30
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,773
Gustafson? Sorry.

31
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,713
- Mr. John Gustafson?
- <i>That's</i> right.

32
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:36,788
You mean the low-life, ass-wipe,
egg-sucker John Gustafson?

33
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:38,789
Have you seen him?

34
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,395
That <i>man's</i> crazy. Loco.

35
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:45,002
Always hanging around
those kinky strip bars...

36
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:48,004
...where men take their clothes off.

37
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,405
If <i>he's</i> taken his medication.

38
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,236
Medication?

39
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:57,745
Without it, he could be anywhere.
Wandering around talking to trees.

40
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,751
Believe me, <i>he's</i> a menace.
Always drinking, fighting. Am I right?

41
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,421
But have you seen him?

42
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:07,583
Sorry.

43
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:10,089
I think, perhaps...

44
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,333
If you see him...

45
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,166
...give him this and
tell him to contact...

46
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,431
...Mr. Snyder immediately.

47
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:23,266
Schneider?

48
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,669
Snyder.

49
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>That's</i> me.

50
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,544
<i>It's</i> important.

51
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,177
Important? We'll tell him...

52
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,044
...when we see him.

53
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:41,052
Watch out for that ice.

54
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,451
Very slippery.

55
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:43,855
Right.

56
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,464
Holy moly!

57
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,195
Jesus!

58
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:06,646
A <i>men's</i> strip joint?

59
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:11,653
Idiot.

60
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,511
Thirty days.

61
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,419
This is great.

62
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,450
You should have seen Mrs. <i>Carlson's</i>
face when he said ''lt's a <i>keeper.''</i>

63
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,151
Oh, cold enough for you?

64
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,730
Shut up, fat-ass!

65
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:31,225
<i>It's</i> not yet Thanksgiving and we're
enjoying our lovely fall weather.

66
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,735
Six inches of snow...

67
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:37,238
...with <i>travelers'</i> advisories
in our area tonight.

68
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,470
<i>You'd</i> be advised to stay inside
and have yourself a warm...

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,669
...home-cooked meal.

70
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:46,980
<i>Here's what's</i> coming up this week.

71
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:50,177
<i>It's</i> snow, snow, and more snow.

72
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,689
We've got snow coming into
our area all week long.

73
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,191
Sunday afternoon, another cold front...

74
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,923
...will move into our area,
and you know what that means.

75
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,460
What the hell?!

76
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,405
Holy... moly!

77
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,349
Oh, my God!

78
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:59,045
You're still using that beat-up
piece of firewood?

79
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:04,111
The Green <i>Hornet's</i> caught more fish
than you've lied about, Gustafson.

80
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:07,951
You see her?

81
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:10,822
Drives pretty fast on that snowmobile.

82
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:13,396
Pretty damn fast.

83
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,457
Did you hear about Eddie Hicks?

84
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,625
<i>Hypothermia's</i> a bitch.

85
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,828
Not quick like a stroke.

86
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,402
A stroke is no good.
You could end up like a vegetable.

87
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,737
Give me a cardiac any day.

88
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,576
You know what Jacob said?

89
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:33,239
Jacob said that Billy Hinshel
was killed in a car crash.

90
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,846
Head-on collision with a truck.

91
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,922
Cleared his car straight over the bridge
into the Mississippi.

92
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:40,488
Lucky bastard.

93
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,254
You bet.

94
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:44,592
How is he anyway?

95
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:46,085
<i>He's</i> dead!

96
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,356
Died on impact!

97
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,591
Jacob...

98
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:49,926
...moron. Jacob!

99
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,099
Oh, <i>he's</i> fine.

100
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,363
Doing real good. Busy.

101
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,599
He promised to come for Thanksgiving.

102
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,274
Is he really running for mayor?

103
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,669
Make a damn fine mayor, too.

104
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,440
<i>It's</i> good he looks like his mother
or <i>he'd</i> never get on the ballot.

105
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,777
Eat my shorts.

106
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,612
Hello, Mrs. Truax.

107
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,277
Holy moly!

108
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,042
Jesus Quincy Adams.

109
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:50,927
I hit the cans again.

110
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,657
I heard.

111
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,491
How is the Grinch today?

112
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,500
<i>Ain't</i> got a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.

113
00:10:58,736 --> 00:10:59,998
Can I get you something?

114
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,571
A six-pack of Schmidt and some bait.

115
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,832
Shiners or wax worms?

116
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:06,568
I <i>can't</i> afford shiners, get me worms.

117
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,234
The worms are 75 cents.

118
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,705
75 cents? Crime-in-Italy!

119
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:13,250
Chuck, we're talking about
worms not caviar.

120
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:16,078
You go through that every time.

121
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:21,089
Where are you going to get worms this
time of year? <i>It's</i> supply and demand.

122
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,252
You could retire from selling me worms.
Throw the beef jerky in too.

123
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,091
Five dollars for the beer
and the worms.

124
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,757
Your old gut <i>can't</i> handle jerky.

125
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,700
Goddamn!

126
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:35,369
Is Pop out there at the shanty?

127
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,371
Always.

128
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,206
And the moron?

129
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:41,777
Lots of ice out there, Gustafson.

130
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,107
Should be room enough for both of you.

131
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,048
Lots of ice out there, Gustafson.

132
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,308
Hi, Dad!

133
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:22,145
Any luck today?

134
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,517
How the hell should I know?
I just got here.

135
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,519
Mel, she came by the other day and...

136
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,924
...said <i>you'd</i> been snapping.

137
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,756
Like a catfish.

138
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,330
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

139
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,160
I'll tell you <i>what's</i> on my mind.

140
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:41,601
<i>It's</i> butt-cold out here
and <i>I'm</i> fresh out of beer.

141
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,270
Someone moved into the Clickner place.
A woman.

142
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:46,774
A woman?

143
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,941
Did you mount her?

144
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,272
Oh, Dad!

145
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,939
Does she have big thighs?

146
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,684
Then <i>what's</i> the problem?

147
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,949
If I was a young fellow like you,
<i>I'd</i> be mounting...

148
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,117
...every woman in Wabasha.

149
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,854
Keep the change.

150
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,068
Hi, Punky.

151
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:14,635
Hi, John!

152
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,667
The Green Hornet strikes again!

153
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,502
Caught my limit!

154
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:29,509
You only snagged one.

155
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,080
Two fish are on there, you bonehead.

156
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,912
I throw back what <i>I'm</i> not going to eat.

157
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:38,852
Yeah, like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about.

158
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,856
<i>It's</i> a shame nobody ever sees you
with these monsters.

159
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:52,266
You'll love it, Goldman.

160
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,098
Go to work.

161
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,283
What is it?

162
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,790
Oh, my God, they've come for me.

163
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,086
Oh, my God! I...

164
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,759
You see, I was...

165
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:55,261
Excuse me, but I saw your light on
and I was wondering...

166
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,991
...if I might use your bathroom.

167
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,166
What?

168
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,769
Your toilet is broken?

169
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,341
No, thank goodness.

170
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:11,107
I <i>don't</i> know, the house seemed so empty
tonight. I do so love bathrooms.

171
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:14,513
You can tell a lot about a person
from his bathroom.

172
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,118
I <i>didn't</i> know that.

173
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,949
There it is. I <i>can't</i> wait
to see <i>what's</i> in there.

174
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,614
- Wait a minute.
- Much better than palm-reading.

175
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:24,961
Give me 30 seconds
in a <i>person's</i> bathroom...

176
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,360
...and I'll give you a complete
and accurate profile.

177
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,458
<i>There's</i> a guest bathroom.

178
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,034
Only be a minute.

179
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:07,726
So?

180
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:09,833
Fascinating.

181
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,004
<i>Shouldn't</i> you introduce yourself?

182
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:17,872
John Gustafson, right?

183
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:24,086
I took some of your mail yesterday
to find out who you were.

184
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:26,587
But you <i>don't</i> get much and...

185
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,588
...it <i>doesn't</i> paint a picture.

186
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,590
Taking mail is a federal offense.

187
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:31,921
I know.

188
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,093
Sometimes you must go a long distance
out of the way in order to...

189
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,030
...return a short distance correctly.

190
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:39,191
<i>Don't</i> you find that?

191
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,928
I love that line.

192
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:45,371
<i>It's</i> not mine. <i>It's</i> from
<i>''T he Zoo Story''</i> by Edward Albee.

193
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:48,876
I teach American literature at
Winona State University.

194
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,208
I started yesterday.

195
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,713
Oh, I love the classics, <i>don't</i> you?

196
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:55,374
Well, I also read ''Field and <i>Stream.''</i>

197
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:56,542
Indeed?

198
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,622
You have a whole library
up there from what I saw.

199
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,727
<i>There's</i> something really rugged
and virile about the outdoors.

200
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,965
My manners! <i>I'm</i> sorry.

201
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,624
<i>I'm</i> Ariel Truax.

202
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:14,293
How do you do? <i>I'm</i> John Gustafson.

203
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,064
Yes, I know.

204
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,475
When did you move into the Clickner's?

205
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,305
<i>I'm</i> sure you know that.

206
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,073
Since I got here you and Max Goldman...

207
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:29,151
...have been against the windows
watching me like two Garfield cats.

208
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,982
Like people stick to their car windows.

209
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:34,750
The little suction cups they have...

210
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,256
Squirrels.

211
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:40,329
Been watching squirrels. <i>One's</i> been
making a nest under your eaves.

212
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:41,829
Sure, John.

213
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,330
<i>Here's</i> your mail.

214
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,265
<i>There's</i> nothing addressed
to a Mrs. Gustafson.

215
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,270
By the state of your bathroom
I presume you're a bachelor.

216
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:51,835
Gay or straight?

217
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:55,473
Heterosexual or homosexual?

218
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:58,275
Jeez Louise...

219
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,280
<i>It's</i> a legitimate question.

220
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,113
Maybe in California
but not here in Minnesota.

221
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,519
Have I upset you?

222
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:12,458
<i>It's</i> the middle of the night
and I <i>don't</i> know what...

223
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,458
Do you want me to leave?

224
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,463
No... yes.

225
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,134
It was very nice meeting you,
John Gustafson.

226
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:25,366
And now that we know each other,
<i>don't</i> be a stranger.

227
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,975
Oh, and John...

228
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,712
<i>...king's</i> rook to <i>queen's</i> bishop three.

229
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:05,909
<i>Don't</i> ring that up yet.

230
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,018
I need something for my lumbago.
<i>It's</i> killing me.

231
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:13,418
<i>It's</i> killing you my ass. He <i>wouldn't</i>
know the meaning of the word ''pain.''

232
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:17,524
I got a pinched sciatica make
your lumbago look like eyestrain.

233
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:20,360
Pain. He wants to talk about pain.

234
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,931
I had a gallstone big as a baseball.

235
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,367
Gallstones are for pussies.

236
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:30,769
When I had shingles did you see me
complain to Phil?

237
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,205
- Did you?
- Shingles schmingles.

238
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:34,776
When I had my ulcers...

239
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:36,276
...I was...

240
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:39,107
...farting razor blades.

241
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,616
Oh, you must be Max Goldman.

242
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,224
<i>I'm</i> your new neighbor.

243
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:49,623
Pleasure.

244
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,118
<i>Isn't</i> it a peach of a day?

245
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:54,796
<i>Here's</i> something for you.

246
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,297
It was left at my house by accident.

247

Some of your mail.

248
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,404
Sorry.

249
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:05,906
Have my herbal therapy oils arrived yet?

250
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,475
This morning.

251
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,237
Special delivery from...

252
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:10,744

253
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:12,638
Wonderful!

254
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:16,082
Ah, yes, <i>there's</i> nothing

Holy moly!

262
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,679
Now wait. You got all
four wheels on the track?

263
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,840
All right. Careful, fellas.

264
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:50,651
Be careful. <i>That's</i> over 100 years old.

265
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:52,186
Thing might collapse.

266
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,118
Hi, sweetheart.

267
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,689
How are you?

268
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:58,025
- <i>Granddaddy's</i> little girl.
- <i>What's</i> going on?

269
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,959
<i>I'm</i> getting rid of that.
<i>It's</i> just firewood.

270
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:01,961
Why?

271
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:05,693
I <i>don't</i> know. I <i>don't</i> play it much.
It sits around collecting dust.

272
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,962
You love that piano.

273
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:10,470
<i>Granddaddy's</i> got a surprise
for you in the house, pumpkin.

274
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:15,201
A little C-A-N-D-Y. It <i>won't</i> kill her.

275
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,038
Which one?

276
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,310
Which hand? This one?

277
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,877
<i>That's</i> the one.

278
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:27,815
There you are, sweetpea.

279
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:29,721
- How 'bout that? Here.
- Dad.

280
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,155
Is something wrong?

281
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:34,729
No, no. <i>Nothing's</i> wrong at all.

282
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:36,824
With me, uh...

283
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,570
How do I?

284
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:49,178
- People are asking about you.
- I know.

285
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:52,348
Yeah, I keep telling them
that you and Mike are...

286
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:55,917
...doing just fine.
<i>It's</i> just a lot of gum-flapping.

287
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,915
Mike and I <i>aren't</i> fine.

288
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:01,256
<i>That's</i> what I thought.

289
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:06,519
We're separating for a while.

290
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,926
Honey, marriage <i>isn't</i> easy.
You have to work at it.

291
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,100
<i>It's</i> hard to work at it
when <i>he's</i> never there.

292
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,208
Sounds familiar. Mother wondered
where I was for 20 years.

293
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:23,437
You really think I wanted two jobs?
I <i>didn't</i> do that for me. I was...

294
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,548
...doing it for you, Brian and Mother.

295
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,708
Dad, this <i>isn't</i> about you.
<i>It's</i> about me and Mike.

296
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,120
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I keep...

297
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,225
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I love you so much.

298
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:43,727
Well, whatever you
and Mike decide is...

299
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,961
I never liked him anyway.

300
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:02,475
Who is that?

301
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,417
I <i>don't</i> know.

302
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,584
She seems to know you.

303
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:12,922
Well...

304
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,165
Does she always do that?

305
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:18,494
I <i>don't</i> know.

306
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,100
This is great!

Out of the way.

312
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:56,204
Come on, baby.
I've got to win a million bucks.

313
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,983
Jacob, you got my vote! <i>That's</i> great.

<i>Lasagna's</i> heating up now.

315

No time. I had to give you this
for the yard.

316
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,233
I have to deliver a lot.

317
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:28,667
Just have one drink.

318
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:30,906
I can't. Sorry. I'll call you.

319
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,066
No, close the door. Come in.

320
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:35,507
Wait a minute. Give me a minute.

321

$6.4 million is our estimated jackpot.

322
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,518
You could be a millionaire.

323
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:58,266
To win the jackpot, correctly match
five white balls and the red powerball.

324
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,426
Our first number is a...

325
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,702
<i>What's</i> going on?

326
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,610
Number four. Remember, to win
the jackpot, match five white balls...

00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,219
...and the red powerball.

328

Goldman. <i>It's</i> Goldman.

<i>Don't</i> tell me. It <i>isn't</i> me.

336
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,750
Oh, it never is.

00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:53,151
John started every fight since 1940.

- Come here!
- <i>I'm</i> not apologizing to anybody!

342
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:06,499
You're letting the cold air in.

Take that, you criminal.

344
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:36,364
I <i>don't</i> believe it.

345
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,693
That old trick?

346
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:42,532
This is between me and your father.
<i>There's</i> no need for you to get involved.

347
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:46,533
I <i>don't</i> say anything on one condition.

Have fun, Johnny.

352
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:19,334
Hey, dickhead, you win the Lottery?

353
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,509
Enjoy your shower, smart ass?

354
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:47,092
Got to use hot water, you schmuck.

355
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:48,863
You'll never get me.

356
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,604
See you later.

357
00:29:05,122 --> 00:29:07,215
Up yours, Gustafson!

358
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,391
What the hell is that smell?

359
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:40,422
Watch it, bonehead.

360
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,593
Mrs. Cusack said she came in here
yesterday to buy some...

361
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:56,432
...candles and incense.

362
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,435
<i>She's</i> probably a member
of one of them religious cults.

363
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,009
You say <i>she's</i> all alone?

364
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,443
What I heard. <i>She's</i> available...

365
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:06,844
...and hot to trot.

366
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:12,780
Moron.

367
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:13,854
Putz.

368
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:18,625
We were talking about
your new neighbor.

369
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:19,454
What?

370
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,694
My new neighbor? Oh, yes, new neighbor.
She came over to see me last night.

371
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:25,527
What?

372
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,199
About 1:30 in the morning.

373
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:31,138
Why would a woman come over
at 1:30 to see you?

374
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:34,300
Why do you think?
I'll have a six-pack.

375
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:35,977
Women...

376
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:40,377
...and fish, you <i>can't</i> catch
either one of them, Gustafson.

377
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,542
I've laid more pipe in this town
than Wabasha Plumbing.

378
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:46,382
You're going to go after her?

379
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:50,822
Oh, jeez. God no. <i>She's</i> too...
<i>she's</i> too disturbed for me.

380
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:55,324
- For you, maybe.
- I <i>won't</i> have anything to do with her.

381
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,990
Women fall too hard for me.

382
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,227
They get obsessed with me.

383
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:03,339
<i>It's</i> like one of them
<i>''Fatal Attraction''</i> things...

384
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:06,499
...that they show on
the Donahue Show, you know.

385
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:10,907
You guys are the biggest
bullshitters in this...

386
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,845
...entire frozen nation!

387
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,685
You're just plain chicken.

388
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:18,684
Both of you.

389
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:22,086
A beautiful woman just sitting there...

390
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,422
...20 feet from your front yards,
and you're trying...

391
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,086
...to tell me <i>you'd</i> rather park...

392
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,596
...your wrinkly butts...

393
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:34,703
...on a frozen piece of ice, kissing up
to buckets of fish bait! Ha!

394
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,370
Gee, listen to Casanova.

395
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,101
Yeah, <i>he's</i> a regular Don Juan.

396
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:43,542
No wonder women ''don <i>juan''</i>
anything to do with you.

397
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,609
- <i>That's</i> it.
- That did it. 'Bye.

398
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:47,716
<i>I'm</i> out. I am out.

399
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:50,216
Hey, Max, say hello to Jake for me.

400
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:53,117
Why <i>don't</i> you come over
and have some turkey with us?

401
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,054
<i>There's</i> always plenty of bird
with just Jacob and me.

402
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:58,717
You can spend next week
in bed with ptomaine.

403
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:01,625
Come over to my place,
Melanie cooks up a feast.

404
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:02,560
Thanks.

405
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:07,396
But you know those old boys at the
V.F.W. Expect me every Thanksgiving.

406
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:09,901
Forget it. 'Bye, Chuck.

407
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:11,062
Moron.

408
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,401
Putz.

409
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,469
Tell me something.

410
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:17,738
Do I stink?

411
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:19,814
Not you, smart ass.

412
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:21,245
<i>Didn't</i> ask you!

413
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,419
I could smell it in the car.

414
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,080
This stink!

415
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:29,584
Is it me?

416
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:36,990
Damn!

417
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:54,139
What the hell is that?

418
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:56,714
For <i>Christ's</i> sake.

419
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,237
Gustafson.

420
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,411
You schmuck!

421
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:49,033
Disgrace the way they coach that team.

422
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,048
Stay there.

423
00:34:07,223 --> 00:34:09,123
Stay there, you bastard.

424
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:29,139
- How are you, Punky?
- Hey, buttercup.

425
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:33,612
Give me two packs of Camels and a cup
of your special coffee, love-muffin.

426
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:38,247
You should smoke filter cigarettes.

427
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:40,912
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> 94 years old.

428
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,321
What the hell do I care?

429
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:45,590
Thank you, dear.

430
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:00,667
Max is here.

431
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,447
Come on, love-muffin.

432
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:20,618
Thanks.

433
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:24,292
You're always there to save me.

434
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,456
Yeah, right.

435
00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:28,035
When Billy Gerber locked me
in the tree house...

436
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:29,865
...you were my knight in shining armor.

437
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,201
And I got a black eye for my effort.

438
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:33,464
There you go.

439
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,041
I always knew, you know.

440
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:37,304
Knew what?

441
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:40,305
That you liked me since sixth grade.

442
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,208
You watched me with
your <i>dad's</i> binoculars.

443
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:44,717
What?

444
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:50,152
You never wondered why my curtains
were open just enough?

445
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,156
I thought I was lucky.

446
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:55,493
I just did it to torture you.

447
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:58,898
Well you succeeded wonderfully.

448
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,563
How come you never asked me out?

449
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:06,505
Hey, Mel! Hi, Jakie!

450
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:09,008
Mel, is the turkey supposed
to be smoking?

451
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:11,403
Oh, I better run.

452
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,415
Happy Thanksgiving!

453
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:17,016
How are you?

454
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:18,176
Good.

455
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:20,079
They're getting a divorce.

456
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:24,918
Mel and Mike are divorcing. They
call it a separation but <i>it's</i> a divorce.

457
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,188
<i>I'm</i> sorry to hear that.

458
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:31,091
So, are you seeing anyone special?

459
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:35,194
No, I guess not. Nobody serious.

460
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,531
What do you know?

461
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,699
We got a new neighbor, you hear?

462
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:43,205
Everyone in town is talking about her.

463
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,771
She <i>hasn't</i> been out since 11:20.

464
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,378
What, are you clocking her?

465
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:51,383
She keeps odd hours.

466
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,784
Very interesting woman.

467
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,221
Sounds like a wacko to me.

468
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:00,623
I <i>haven't</i> had sex for 15 years.

469
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:10,564
Could I have some?

470
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:15,906
That was plenty.

471
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,639
Give Jakie some leftovers to take home.

472
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:19,907
He'll have his own.

473
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,917
That pre-cooked stuff his old man gets?
That tastes like cardboard.

474
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:27,981
Why <i>don't</i> you go and talk to her?

475
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:29,652
Talk to who?

476
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:33,153
You spent half the meal
staring out the window.

477
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:34,318
Squirrels.

478
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:37,430
The squirrels on her roof.
<i>That's</i> what I was staring at.

479
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,503
You're a handsome guy with a nice house,
a good pension. You got a lot to offer.

480
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:44,936
Well, I got something to offer her.

481
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:50,272
I got zip to offer her.

482
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:53,511
I <i>can't</i> tell if this is done!

483
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:59,119
Do you know how many minutes
this needs to cook?

484
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,017
Getting hungry.

485
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,954
Sure be nice to have some turkey.

486
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:12,194
Remember the turkey
your mother used to make?

487
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,697
Damn, she was a good cook.

488
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:17,863
You remember the stuffing?

489
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,133
The best.

490
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:22,142
How about those potato latkes?

491
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:26,214
You said Chuck was at the V.F.W.

492
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:27,474
He is.

493
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,708
I <i>don't</i> think so.

494
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,216
What are you talking about?

495
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:32,650
Looks like <i>he's</i> making a house call.

496
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,045
What?

497
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,548
What the...

498
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:39,319
Hell is he doing there?

499
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,665
<i>He's</i> going to do it.

500
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,492
So?

501
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,656
What?

502
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:48,670
What is he doing in that crazy...

503
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:51,398
- Son of a...
- Jealous?

504
00:38:58,348 --> 00:38:59,178
<i>He's</i> in.

505
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,180
<i>He's</i> in. <i>He's</i> in.

506
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:06,010
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i> taking old one-eye
to the optometrist.

507
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:08,180
Oh, Jeez, Dad. What?

508
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:43,719
Chuck, where are you?

509
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:46,123
Hello, fellas.

510
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:50,396
Some game last night! Double overtime.

511
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:54,058
- Blackhawks were killers, <i>weren't</i> they?
- Did you catch the game?

512
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,800
Oh, sure. You were with
the guys at the V.F.W.

513
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:05,480
Yeah, how was the turkey at the V.F.W.
This year, Chuckie?

514
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,141
The turkey this year...

515
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,810
...was delicious.

516
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,082
Come on!

517
00:40:15,258 --> 00:40:16,486
We saw you!

518
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:17,648
<i>What'd</i> you do?

519
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:20,091
- <i>What's</i> it like in there?
- <i>What'd</i> she say?

520
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,920
Fellas!

521
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:24,825
Some experiences in life are too rich...

522
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,668
...and too beautiful to put into words.

523
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:30,669
What does that mean exactly?

524
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,777
Could have been either of you
if you just had the guts to ask.

525
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:40,449
- You and she?
- <i>I'm</i> not talking about sex, dummies.

526
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,111
Of course not.

527
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,354
Oh, I get it.

528
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:50,851
Your old pal failed you, Chuck?

529
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:53,689
<i>Couldn't</i> rise to the occasion?

530
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,294
Yes, the spirit was willing...

531
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:57,797
But the flesh was...

532
00:40:57,967 --> 00:40:58,956
Weak.

533
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,366
If it <i>wasn't</i> sex, what was it?

534
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,209
It was an awakening.

535
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:13,038
Ariel reminded me that I was alive.

536
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,653
That I was a man full of energy,
love and passion.

537
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,482
It was like being young again.

538
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:22,886
If only for a moment.

539
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,221
<i>Couldn't</i> get it up, huh?

540
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,662
Get out of here, both of you.

541
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,501
Yeah, I'll see you.

542
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:43,504
So long.

543
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,008
Hey, boys.

544
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,082
<i>That's</i> not just a woman
living across your street.

545
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:52,687
<i>She's</i> an angel.

546
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:54,512
Angel, right.

547
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,089
Take it easy.

548
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:00,027
See you.

549
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:19,607
Holy moly!

550
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:21,834
Look at all the crap you...

551
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:23,945
Excuse me. The stuff you got here.

552
00:43:24,113 --> 00:43:25,512
Well, <i>it's</i> my inspiration.

553
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:26,670
You did?

554
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:28,180
You're an artist?

555
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:29,943
I try.

556
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,613
I used to teach courses
in Expressionism at Berkeley.

557
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,953
But now <i>I'm</i> back to
the classics of literature.

558
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:40,693
Berkeley, that explains it.

559
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,362
Oh, my God!

560
00:43:42,965 --> 00:43:44,023
What?!

561
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:46,625
Your TV. <i>It's</i> got no guts.

562
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:48,531
I took them out.

563
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:52,037
How could you do that
to a '54 Super Zenith?

564
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,466
This TV is a classic.

565
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:57,869
I could fix it for you
if you wanted me to.

566
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:00,982
<i>That's</i> what I used to do.
I was a TV repairman.

567
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,812
<i>That's</i> so sweet, Max, but...

568
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:06,644
...I think it works quite well...

569
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:08,551
...just the way it is.

570
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,154
How the hell does she see any shows?

571
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:21,734
Holy moly!

572
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:27,731
You met Ernest.

573
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,000
Who?

574
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,170
The model was my husband.

575
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:35,574
He sure <i>wasn't</i> pleased about
modeling in the nude.

576
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:38,743
Took quite a bit of prompting.
I must say.

577
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,253
He's?

578
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:43,357
Passed on.

579
00:44:43,526 --> 00:44:45,016
Five years ago.

580
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:49,262
Would you like some coffee?

581
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:51,765
Cream and sugar?

582
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:08,944
You moved around a lot
the last few years.

583
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:13,712
Yes, I think <i>it's</i> exciting
to experience new things...

584
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:16,881
...new places, and meet new people.

585
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:18,219
Like you.

586
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:23,558
Do you paint?

587
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,133
Paint? Me?

588
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:27,391
Sure do.

589
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,902
I paint the shed every spring.

590
00:45:30,906 --> 00:45:32,897
- You get it?
- I get it.

591
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:35,568
I mean, you know...

592
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:37,301
...pictures, paintings.

593
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:39,478
What for?

594
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,249
Everyone needs some form of...

595
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:45,417
...release.

596
00:45:46,922 --> 00:45:48,321
I fish.

597
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:50,247
Fish?

598
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:52,485
Fish?

599
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,922
Oh. Yeah. Fish.
I can see the beauty in that.

600
00:45:58,334 --> 00:45:59,323
You can?

601
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:04,997
Miss Truax...

602
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:09,942
...would you honor me by accompanying
me to my ice shanty tomorrow?

603
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,283
<i>I'd</i> be honored.

604
00:46:23,626 --> 00:46:24,786
See you tomorrow.

605
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,190
Yeah, <i>I'm</i> looking forward to it.

606
00:46:28,964 --> 00:46:30,522
Be careful!

607
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:35,129
<i>''W e're having a heat wave
A tropical heat wave

608
00:46:35,304 --> 00:46:37,636
<i>''W e're having a heat wave''</i>

609
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:43,376
- I <i>can't</i> hold it!
- Reel him in!

610
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:46,070
- I <i>can't</i> hold him, Max.
- Work him!

611
00:46:46,882 --> 00:46:50,818
- I am trying! I <i>can't</i> hold it!
- Reel it in!

612
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,648
- <i>I'm</i> trying but I can't!
- Okay, give me the pole.

613
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:56,314
Hold on! Not on your life!

614
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:03,722
Pull it! You got to pull it!
No, <i>don't</i> pull too hard! <i>That's</i> it.

615
00:47:06,102 --> 00:47:07,592
Morning, John.

616
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:10,830
Morning, Punky.

617
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:15,170
I almost lost him.

618
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:17,908
Oh, Max, <i>he's</i> just magnificent.

619
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:20,412
<i>He's</i> a record breaker!
About three feet!

620
00:47:22,418 --> 00:47:24,682
I can see the beauty in this now.

621
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:28,017
- Can you see it?
- Yes, the lure. No, the fight.

622
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,919
Wait till I show the guys.

623
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:31,184
The catch!

624
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:33,252
And then the release.

625
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:36,194
What? <i>There's</i> no release.

626
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:37,923
Ah, yes, <i>it's</i> beautiful.

627
00:47:38,134 --> 00:47:41,535
No, <i>what's</i> beautiful is this monster
on my wall stuffed!

628
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:43,763
There can be no stuffing.

629
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:45,634
This is a live creature.

630
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,640
Full of courage and life.

631
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:50,942
Nobody'll believe me. I need a camera.

632
00:47:51,147 --> 00:47:55,277
- I hear the water calling it back.
- Where is it?

633
00:47:55,651 --> 00:47:57,448
- Here we go!
- Wait!

634
00:47:57,653 --> 00:47:58,711
Calling!

635
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:00,446
Here! Hold it!

636
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:20,965
Hey! Just finishing breakfast.

637
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:22,800
So I see.

638
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:26,975
Colder than a <i>witch's</i> titty out there.

639
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:29,808
Where did you get this?

640
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:32,982
I snagged it about an hour ago.

641
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:35,316
The only damn thing I caught all day.

642
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,592
Chuck, guess what Pop found?!

643
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:58,939
Chuck, you forgot to unlock
the back door, you dummy.

644
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:20,735
<i>Isn't</i> it wonderful to have
a little adventure every day?

645
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,134
You're one hell of a fisherman, Ariel.

646
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:25,739
I learned from the best.

647
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,366
Hope you <i>didn't</i> mind putting them back.

648
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:31,479
<i>That's</i> okay.
Gustafson does the same thing.

649
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,378
He just keeps the ones he eats.
<i>That's</i> what he says.

650
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:37,809
I think he never catches them.

651
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:42,319
I think we're going to be great friends.

652
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:46,658
Oh, friends. Friends is good.

653
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,888
<i>That's</i> good, <i>isn't</i> it?

654
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:52,834
How about some supper tonight?
After your class, I mean.

655
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:57,405
Oh, thank you so much, but I already
have made plans. <i>I'm</i> sorry.

656
00:49:58,574 --> 00:49:59,768
I'll take a rain check.

657
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:00,898
<i>That's</i> a deal.

658
00:50:03,012 --> 00:50:05,173
Until we meet again, my dear Ariel.

659
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:08,577
Good-bye.

660
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,351
Watch out! <i>Don't</i> slip!

661
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:27,362
Well, Gustafson, looks like
the best man won.

662
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:32,706
Yeah, you always were a lousy loser.

663
00:50:34,443 --> 00:50:35,432
<i>He's</i> dead.

664
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:38,372
What? Who?

665
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:39,206
Chuck!

666
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:41,880
Chuck? How?

667
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,943
Last night in his sleep.

668
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:46,944
His sleep.

669
00:50:48,223 --> 00:50:49,815
Lucky bastard.

670
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:53,227
You might have known if you <i>hadn't</i>
been out with that minx.

671
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:56,889
Hey, it <i>ain't</i> my fault.
Chuck was my friend too!

672
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,957
You call yourself a friend, bastard!

673
00:51:00,135 --> 00:51:02,330
Watch your mouth, you dumb Swede.

674
00:51:02,538 --> 00:51:03,903
<i>Don't</i> tell me what to do!

675
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:06,907
Big man with the axe in your hand.

676
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:09,909
Axe? You want to clock me?
You think you can take me?

677
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:10,841
Come on!

678
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,744
All right. 1937 at Todd Field...

679
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:18,853
...I kicked your ass after football
practice when you stole my liniment.

680
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:22,480
- I kicked your ass and I'll do it again!
- Bullshit!

681
00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:24,649
Give it your best shot, shrimp.

682
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:28,852
<i>It's</i> not worth it.

683
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:33,096
Get out of there!

684
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:42,366
Damn!

685
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:46,679
He has the intelligence quotient
of a newt.

686
00:52:00,963 --> 00:52:03,625
Shrimp thinks he can get funny with me.

687
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,399
Left hook...

688
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:08,793
...right cross...

689
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,471
...and dump him.

690
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:22,541
<i>I'm</i> going to kill him.

691
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,980
Goddamn you, Goldman, you...

692
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:31,985

<i>I'm</i> asking you to come to my office.

694
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:03,511
I was wondering where you were.

I was... I had a little business.

696
00:54:08,757 --> 00:54:10,588
I hope it went all right.

697
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:14,094
What are you doing?!

698
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,022
Cooking.

699
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,264
Wait, I <i>can't</i> have anything spicy.

700
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:26,839
If <i>it's</i> too exciting, <i>I'm</i> up all night.

701
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:28,536
Good.

<i>I'm</i> making Szechuan.

703
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:41,288
From the moment I saw you, I could feel
that we had the same kind of aura.

704
00:54:41,456 --> 00:54:43,117
That we shared something special.

705
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,281
Teaching.

706
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:47,690
Thirty-nine years, I taught
American History at Wabasha High.

707
00:54:48,297 --> 00:54:50,288
History, <i>it's</i> so romantic.

708
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,195
Great dental plan.

709
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:00,701
The ideas you gave those young minds.

710
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:03,310
Kids think they know it all, right?

711
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:06,571
Once in a while you reach one.
You touch them somehow.

712
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:07,804
I did that once.

713
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:08,972
Really?

714
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:13,986
It was my New Deal lecture. I touched
a kid on his head while he was snoring.

715
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:15,579
You're so bad.

716
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,659
You know...

717
00:55:23,098 --> 00:55:25,328
...Chuck, he...

718
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:29,226
I know.

719
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:35,502
We can be thankful that we had
the privilege of knowing him...

720
00:55:35,677 --> 00:55:37,110
...while he was here.

721
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:46,847
To Chuck.

722
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:50,249
Yes, to Chuck.

723
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:01,862
Thank you, John.

724
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:03,365
It was a wonderful evening.

725
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:05,130
Thank you, Ariel.

726
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:23,890
Pop?

727
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:25,890
- What?
- You think I should call her?

728
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:28,058
- What?
- The woman.

729
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,290
Well, let me tell you something, John.

730
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:34,228
The first 90 years, or so...

731
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:37,231
...go by pretty fast.

732
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:38,671
What?

733
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:40,900
The first 90 years go by fast.

734
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:42,475
How would you know?

735
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:44,168
You're just a damn kid.

736
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:46,178
I <i>didn't</i> say it, you did.

737
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:49,182
Well, they do. They do go fast.

738
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,309
Then one day you wake up.

739
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:53,249
And you realize...

740
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:56,315
...that you're not 81 anymore.

741
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:59,324
You begin to count the minutes
rather than the days...

742
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:03,260
...and you realize that pretty soon
you'll be gone.

743
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:06,924
And that all you have, see,
is the experiences.

744
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:08,592
<i>That's</i> all there is.

745
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,330
Everything! The experiences!

746
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:18,940
You mount the woman, son.

747
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,714
Or else...

748
00:57:22,117 --> 00:57:24,210
...send her out to me.

749
00:58:05,894 --> 00:58:09,830
I happened to come by these two tickets
for the Gopher game and...

750
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:15,834
Ever play much ice hockey?

751
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,402
We had an appointment!

752
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,517
There she is. Wabasha.

753
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:42,193
It is just beautiful.

754
00:58:43,198 --> 00:58:46,861
Yeah, from up here... I used to
camp up here when I was a kid.

755
00:58:50,305 --> 00:58:51,533
What are you thinking?

756
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:53,938
Oh, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

757
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,209
The snow...

758
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:01,042
...reminds me of the last Christmas
with my husband.

759
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:07,381
Are you all right?

760
00:59:08,056 --> 00:59:09,614
Yes, an angel.

761
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:10,484
What?

762
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,115
<i>I'm</i> making a snow angel.

763
00:59:14,896 --> 00:59:16,227
I remember.

764
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:31,476
Do you believe in angels?

765
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:35,741
They're all around us.

766
00:59:37,352 --> 00:59:39,343
You've got to look hard, but...

767
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:40,853
...they're there...

768
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:44,849
...whenever anything good
happens to us.

769
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,584
I think I see one.

770
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:48,314
I'll have you mated in three moves.

771
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:52,056
<i>Shouldn't</i> we get to know each other
a little better first?

772
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,222
You have a wonderful smile.
You should wear it more often.

773
01:01:00,435 --> 01:01:03,666
I bring it out on special occasions.

774
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:08,441
Tell me <i>who's</i> this?

775
01:01:08,944 --> 01:01:10,502
- What?
- Over here.

776
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:12,738
<i>That's</i> my dad. <i>That's</i> Pop.

777
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:15,944
This handsome guy, you know him, right?

778
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:19,520
My daughter Melanie and her mother,
and Melanie and her husband, Mike.

779
01:01:19,688 --> 01:01:21,087
<i>She's</i> beautiful.

780
01:01:21,256 --> 01:01:23,087
Who are these people here?

781
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:26,352
Ah, that little girl is Alexandra,
my granddaughter.

782
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:28,689
And my son, Brian.

783
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,588
<i>He's</i> so handsome.

784
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:32,255
Lost him in Vietnam.

785
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:35,197
- <i>I'm</i> so sorry.
- <i>It's</i> all right. <i>It's</i> okay.

786
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:38,261
These little guys.

787
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:40,602
<i>That's</i> me and the moron.

788
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:43,700
Of course <i>it's</i> Max. <i>He's</i> ugly <i>isn't</i> he?

789
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:45,975
You mean you were friends?

790
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:48,105
I was 10, and <i>didn't</i> know any better.

791
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:52,987
What makes two men spend
most of their lives fighting?

792
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:54,383
Guess.

793
01:01:54,556 --> 01:01:55,614
A woman.

794
01:01:56,725 --> 01:01:58,124
How romantic.

795
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:00,989
No, it <i>wasn't</i> romantic at all.

796
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:02,118
Well...

797
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:05,893
What did I know? I was just a kid.

798
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:09,001
Which I am not anymore.

799
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:25,142
I think <i>it's</i> kind of late.

800
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:31,752
<i>It's</i> time for bed.

801
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:38,925
God, you are dumb, dumb, dumb.

802
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:46,532
Ariel, <i>I'm</i> sorry that...

803
01:02:50,779 --> 01:02:52,269
I thought you said...

804
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:54,605
I said <i>it's</i> time for bed.

805
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:58,051
Well, wait, what about...

806
01:02:58,186 --> 01:03:00,848
- What?
- Well, you've been seeing...

807
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:02,045
Max?

808
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:04,184
<i>He's</i> just my friend.

809
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:10,194
The last man I slept with
was my husband.

810
01:03:14,202 --> 01:03:15,294
Wait a minute!

811
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,062
Wait a minute!

812
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:22,801
<i>I'm</i> not prepared.

813
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:27,638
These days they say
you have to do safe sex.

814
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,482
When was the last time you made love?

815
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:36,079
October... fourth...

816
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:40,589
...1978.

817
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:45,493
Oh, I think we're safe.

818
01:04:18,366 --> 01:04:19,697
Good morning.

819
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,525
Are those for me?

820
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:26,134
Oh, they're just beautiful. Thank you.

821
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:29,376
They're for you. I got them for you.

822
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:31,944
Thank you. How sweet!

823
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,711
That's...

824
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,940
Got them for you.

825
01:04:43,191 --> 01:04:45,182
Snake in the grass!

826
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,729
Burn, baby, burn.

827
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:18,276
Holy shit! Max!

828
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,844
Stop the car, you idiot!

829
01:07:23,117 --> 01:07:24,015
Look out!

830
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:25,178
Look out!

831
01:07:28,189 --> 01:07:29,781
Max, you've really lost it!

832
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,289
Dirty little bastard!

833
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:03,216
He belongs in a rubber room.

834
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:12,722
I fixed your fishing pole!

835
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,334
Who cares about a damn fishing pole?

836
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:17,494
You can shove that pole!

837
01:08:17,672 --> 01:08:21,073
You think a lousy old pole
is going to replace her?

838
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:25,911
Are you crazy?

839
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,741
<i>Don't</i> egg him on!

840
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,248
Leave him alone.

841
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:33,580
We'll settle this thing.

842
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:35,354
Cut it out!

843
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:43,092
Shrimp, you're not going anywhere!

844
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:46,598
Come on!

845
01:08:57,445 --> 01:08:59,276
You broke my nose, schmuck.

846
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:00,539
I did not.

847
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,714
Look at that! What the hell
has gotten into you?

848
01:09:05,887 --> 01:09:06,876
You stole her!

849
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:07,714
What?

850
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:08,787
<i>She's</i> mine.

851
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:11,057
- Says who?
- Says me.

852
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:12,953
She came to me!

853
01:09:13,127 --> 01:09:16,290
You're stealing her away, just like May.

854
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:19,627
Could I remind you, Einstein,
May was no prize.

855
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:21,063
She was to me.

856
01:09:21,235 --> 01:09:23,635
I was married to the woman 20 years.
She was no prize!

857
01:09:23,805 --> 01:09:25,397
She was to me!

858
01:09:25,573 --> 01:09:26,562
Moron!

859
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:30,404
If <i>you'd</i> ended up with May, you <i>wouldn't</i>
have had Amy, who was a good woman.

860
01:09:30,578 --> 01:09:33,809
- She was the best.
- And more loyal than May ever was!

861
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:34,640
So!

862
01:09:34,816 --> 01:09:36,306
So what?

863
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,327
Well, did you?

864
01:09:54,168 --> 01:09:55,328
You know!

865
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:57,596
<i>That's</i> a private matter.

866
01:09:57,772 --> 01:09:59,763
Private, my foot. Did you?

867
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:01,772
- I <i>can't</i> say.
- Tell me.

868
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,605
Okay, we did the horizontal mambo!
We danced it.

869
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:07,680
It was the greatest sex I ever had
in my life. Are you happy?

870
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,178
I'll kill you!

871
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:12,679
Dirty rat!

872
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:24,024
Drop that fish!

873
01:10:27,468 --> 01:10:30,301
<i>Don't</i> make me have
to separate you two again!

874
01:10:32,473 --> 01:10:34,202
Now go to your shanties, all of you!

875
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:37,033
You're scaring the fish away!

876
01:10:37,879 --> 01:10:39,141
Damn kids!

877
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:46,712
Kids! You <i>can't</i> live with them,
<i>can't</i> shoot them. Now go on!

878
01:10:48,389 --> 01:10:51,324
How you going to take care
of her, Gustafson?

879
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:55,488
How are you going to support her...

880
01:10:55,663 --> 01:10:57,494
...when the I.R.S. Takes your house?

881
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:05,228
I <i>can't</i> wait around for another Amy.
I <i>ain't</i> got time.

882
01:11:58,726 --> 01:12:00,455
This time you win.

883
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,321
If you <i>won't</i> keep our date,
I'll bring the date to you.

884
01:12:31,092 --> 01:12:34,584
You promised to come over and
give me the New Deal lecture...

885
01:12:34,762 --> 01:12:36,992
- So like a good student...
- <i>What's</i> that?

886
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:38,921
A gift.

887
01:12:43,504 --> 01:12:45,165
You inspired it.

888
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:51,342
I <i>can't</i> accept it.

889
01:12:52,847 --> 01:12:54,109
Why not?

890
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:03,352
It might be a good idea if
we <i>didn't</i> see each other.

891
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:09,629
For a while. And, well, give each of us
a chance to be alone and...

892
01:13:10,131 --> 01:13:11,621
But I thought...

893
01:13:12,466 --> 01:13:16,368
Goddamn it. In the first place,
<i>I'm</i> too old for you. Okay?

894
01:13:16,804 --> 01:13:18,203
I <i>don't</i> like...

895
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:20,465
...you coming over here.

896
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:23,804
I <i>don't</i> like you hanging around
here all day long!

897
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:27,544
<i>I'm</i> not afraid to be alone like you.

898
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:31,651
I am not afraid to be alone!
I just prefer...

899
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:33,218
...to experience things...

900
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:36,879
...and not watch them on television
or out the windows like you do.

901
01:13:37,058 --> 01:13:39,720
<i>Don't</i> you understand?
I like being alone!

902
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:41,555
I understand.

903
01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:43,321
I understand completely.

904
01:13:43,497 --> 01:13:44,987
You know nothing about me.

905
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:46,997
I do too!

906
01:13:47,168 --> 01:13:52,071
I know the only things in life that
you regret are the risks you <i>don't</i> take.

907
01:13:52,406 --> 01:13:54,340
But you <i>wouldn't</i> understand that.

908
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:56,499
Because you're too pig-headed.

909
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:54,464
Merry Christmas.

910
01:14:54,635 --> 01:14:56,296
Congratulations on the election.

911
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,132
<i>That's</i> old news. Where've you been?

912
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:03,572
I had all this stuff that
I had to get taken care of.

913
01:15:03,744 --> 01:15:06,907
Melanie said <i>she's</i> going
to come by tonight.

914
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:08,742
For Christmas Eve. Around 9:00.

915
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:11,407
Why <i>don't</i> you drop over?

916
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:13,248
I'll do that.

917
01:15:28,335 --> 01:15:33,102
This neighborhood will be a lot safer
without that snowmobile around.

918
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:35,435
- Hi, Jacob.
- Hello, putz.

919
01:15:37,611 --> 01:15:39,272
Merry Christmas, John.

920
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:47,116
Your cat crapped on my steps again.

921
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:50,112
Who says you <i>can't</i> train a cat?

922
01:15:50,524 --> 01:15:54,517
<i>It's</i> a warning. If it happens again
I'll punch you in the nose.

923
01:15:55,696 --> 01:15:57,357
He started it.

924
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,814
<i>Where's Santa's</i> favorite little girl?

925
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:20,385
Merry Christmas, Dad.

926
01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:27,657
What, no twinkle lights?

927
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:32,727
I forgot about them this year.

928
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:36,058
Be polite.

929
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:40,506
Merry Christmas.

930
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:45,007
Can I put Allie in your bed?

931
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:46,407
Sure.

932
01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:50,077
Come on, bedtime.
Say good night to grandpa.

933
01:16:53,854 --> 01:16:55,583
How've you been?

934
01:16:55,756 --> 01:16:58,520
Lousy. Thought you two
were getting a divorce.

935
01:17:00,928 --> 01:17:03,419
Actually, <i>it's</i> only a separation.

936
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:08,032
I had to work some things out
for myself before we could work on us.

937
01:17:08,936 --> 01:17:10,767
Did you get it worked out?

938
01:17:16,377 --> 01:17:17,935
As far as I can tell.

939
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,941
<i>That's</i> great, Mike.

940
01:17:23,217 --> 01:17:26,380
Maybe the rest of us should put
our lives on hold for the next...

941
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:31,457
...two weeks while you fill up with
enough booze to make up your mind.

942
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:39,396
You know...

943
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:41,796
...I need a beer.

944
01:17:42,136 --> 01:17:44,400
Grab a beer. <i>It's</i> in the fridge.

945
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:49,465
- <i>What's</i> wrong?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

946
01:17:49,643 --> 01:17:51,577
Grab me one too!

947
01:17:51,745 --> 01:17:53,975
Dad, try and understand...

948
01:17:54,148 --> 01:17:56,810
...he says <i>he's</i> all straightened out.

949
01:17:57,084 --> 01:18:01,987
What do I know? <i>I'm</i> 68 years old!
I got no house, no wife, no pension!

950
01:18:02,156 --> 01:18:03,316
What are you saying?

951
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:06,584
I <i>don't</i> know one damn thing,
but I know this:

952
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,595
The only thing in this life that you
regret are the risks you <i>didn't</i> take.

953
01:18:11,765 --> 01:18:13,756
If you see a chance to be happy...

954
01:18:13,934 --> 01:18:18,166
...grab it with both hands and
to hell with the consequences.

955
01:18:26,347 --> 01:18:28,781
I <i>can't</i> find a bottle opener.

956
01:18:31,452 --> 01:18:34,615
Sweetheart, <i>I'm</i> going to walk down
to Slippery's.

957
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:38,347
What?

958
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:46,632
Hey, Jakey. Merry Christmas.

959
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,358
Merry Christmas.

960
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,460
Is this a bad time?

961
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:56,542
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I <i>don't</i> know <i>what's</i> wrong
with him. He just exploded.

962
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:58,541
You want me to go after him?

963
01:18:59,813 --> 01:19:02,976
He'll cool off down at Slippery's.
Come on in.

964
01:19:04,985 --> 01:19:06,213
<i>What's</i> that?

965
01:19:06,987 --> 01:19:09,046
This is broccoli.

966
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:10,815
Pop <i>didn't</i> have mistletoe.

967
01:19:17,731 --> 01:19:20,325
Hey, Mike. You're next big guy.

968
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:22,226
Hi, stinky.

969
01:19:24,338 --> 01:19:27,739
I just came by to wish you all
a Merry Christmas.

970
01:19:27,908 --> 01:19:30,843
That was sweet, Jacob.
<i>Wasn't</i> that sweet, Mike?

971
01:19:31,578 --> 01:19:33,671
Sweet... and short.

972
01:19:41,355 --> 01:19:42,845
Good to see you, Mike!

973
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:48,919
Could I ask you a favor?

974
01:19:49,096 --> 01:19:50,085
Sure.

975
01:19:50,264 --> 01:19:52,596
Could you have a word with your dad?

976
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:55,030
See if they <i>can't</i> make up for Christmas.

977
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:00,037
Sure. Absolutely.

978
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:01,697
That would be great.

979
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:05,542
Merry Christmas.

980
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:06,941
Merry Christmas.

981
01:20:14,955 --> 01:20:16,946
Over to Gustafson's?

982
01:20:20,561 --> 01:20:22,222
Melanie there?

983
01:20:25,132 --> 01:20:27,293
She look good?

984
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:31,298
Very. She also looks
to still be married.

985
01:20:31,472 --> 01:20:32,131
What?

986
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,637
<i>Mike's</i> back?!

987
01:20:33,807 --> 01:20:35,297
Looks that way.

988
01:20:36,243 --> 01:20:37,733
Melanie said that John...

989
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:40,243
...just exploded and walked out.

990
01:20:41,315 --> 01:20:42,304
So?

991
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,240
So <i>what's</i> going on?

992
01:20:44,418 --> 01:20:47,251
Nothing that <i>shouldn't</i>
have happened years ago.

993
01:20:53,494 --> 01:20:57,260
He tried to steal her
away from me, but I won.

994
01:20:58,098 --> 01:21:00,328
Could you at least talk to him?

995
01:21:03,337 --> 01:21:06,773
My door is open.
He knows where to find me.

996
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:10,266
He started it.

997
01:21:11,578 --> 01:21:14,513
I <i>don't</i> care who started it,
you're going to end it.

998
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:17,013
I <i>don't</i> like him! I never liked him!

999
01:21:17,518 --> 01:21:19,110
<i>It's</i> Christmas, Pop.

1000
01:21:19,286 --> 01:21:22,778
You could go down to <i>Slippery's</i>
and make peace with the man.

1001
01:21:24,024 --> 01:21:26,959
<i>I'd</i> rather kiss a dead <i>moose's</i> butt.

1002
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:34,791
This 1500-pound moose
is the real thing, folks.

1003
01:21:35,035 --> 01:21:39,199
Reared by local volunteer firefighter,
Peter Carlson, of Wabasha.

1004
01:21:39,373 --> 01:21:42,638
He found it injured while hunting,
brought it home...

1005
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,869
...and raised it in his home.

1006
01:21:45,045 --> 01:21:46,535
Merry Christmas.

1007
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:06,496
Moron.

1008
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,062
Putz.

1009
01:22:12,906 --> 01:22:16,069
Jacob says Mike and Melanie
are getting back together.

1010
01:22:17,511 --> 01:22:22,346
He <i>doesn't</i> know his ass from a hole
in the ground. They're divorcing.

1011
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,686
I got some things I wanted to tell you.

1012
01:22:30,257 --> 01:22:33,192
The reason I came down here tonight is...

1013
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:34,922
I wanted to tell...

1014
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:37,029
Hurry! I <i>haven't</i> got all night.

1015
01:22:37,197 --> 01:22:38,858
- <i>Don't</i> shout!
- <i>I'm</i> not.

1016
01:22:39,032 --> 01:22:43,935
Bust my tuchus to come here and
thank you and all you do is shout at me.

1017
01:22:45,272 --> 01:22:46,933
To thank me?

1018
01:22:47,374 --> 01:22:50,434
All right, I take it back.
I <i>don't</i> thank you.

1019
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:53,202
Jesus, <i>it's</i> impossible!

1020
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:02,444
Look, Goldman...

1021
01:23:04,391 --> 01:23:06,291
I want to ask you something.

1022
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,463
Well, what? I <i>ain't</i> got all night
either. <i>I'm</i> just as busy as you are.

1023
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:13,899
Do you love her?

1024
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,900
Do I love her? What does that
have to do with anything?

1025
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:19,732
It would make the whole thing
worthwhile.

1026
01:23:19,973 --> 01:23:24,910
You know something, I think you've
lost whatever marbles you ever had.

1027
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,304
Do you think you walked
on coals for me?

1028
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:31,815
Gave me back my fishing pole
and I said, ''T hank <i>you.''</i>

1029
01:23:31,985 --> 01:23:33,418
Fishing pole?

1030
01:23:35,322 --> 01:23:38,587
Pisses me off you broke it
but, schmuck that you are...

1031
01:23:38,759 --> 01:23:40,659
...I got to be realistic.

1032
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:45,093
- <i>What's</i> so funny?
- You think this is about that pole?

1033
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:47,427
- <i>What's</i> it about?
- Forget it.

1034
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:49,762
What do you mean forget it?

1035
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:50,835
I want to know.

1036
01:23:51,271 --> 01:23:52,431
You really want to know?

1037
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:03,838
What about her?

1038
01:24:05,852 --> 01:24:08,013
You made me feel sorry for you.

1039
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:11,848
She chose me!

1040
01:24:12,626 --> 01:24:13,957
She did!

1041
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:17,187
And if anyone says otherwise
they're a damn liar!

1042
01:24:17,364 --> 01:24:20,128
<i>What's</i> the difference?
You got her anyway.

1043
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:28,635
What are you looking at?

1044
01:24:42,055 --> 01:24:43,386
Stupid moron!

1045
01:24:44,324 --> 01:24:46,155
Stupid idiot!

1046
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:15,748
It makes a difference, damn it!

1047
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:42,772
Dirty rat. Little turd.

1048
01:25:51,558 --> 01:25:52,957
Oh, my God!

1049
01:25:58,732 --> 01:25:59,892
Are you dead?

1050
01:26:01,635 --> 01:26:06,470
Not yet. But I <i>don't</i> want to die
looking at your ugly face.

1051
01:26:07,074 --> 01:26:08,405
Stay there!

1052
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:09,564
Stay there!

1053
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:13,243
Wait a minute. I'll be right back!

1054
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:19,817
Help!

1055
01:26:20,153 --> 01:26:21,142
We need a...

1056
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:22,583
<i>It's</i> an emergency!

1057
01:26:22,756 --> 01:26:26,988
Emergency! We need an ambulance!
Somebody dial ''911.''

1058
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:33,591
Could you tell me...

1059
01:26:36,002 --> 01:26:37,936
Oh, nurse... nurse.

1060
01:26:38,772 --> 01:26:43,106
Nurse, could you tell me where
Mr. John Gustafson is?

1061
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:44,937
Are you friend or family?

1062
01:26:46,346 --> 01:26:47,108
What?

1063
01:26:48,448 --> 01:26:50,507
Are you friend or family, sir?

1064
01:27:00,627 --> 01:27:01,685
Friend.

1065
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:38,322
Merry Christmas, John.

1066
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:44,559
You putz.

1067
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:05,858
Well, <i>you'd</i> better have a good reason
for standing me up this morning.

1068
01:28:09,262 --> 01:28:10,524
<i>What's</i> wrong?

1069
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,431
Can I come in?

1070
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:17,094
Sure.

1071
01:28:31,885 --> 01:28:35,787
I know you wanted to get rid of me,
but <i>isn't</i> this a little drastic?

1072
01:28:44,631 --> 01:28:47,293
My husband passed away at Easter.

1073
01:28:47,734 --> 01:28:52,637
If you leave me at Christmas, I <i>won't</i>
have any holidays to look forward to.

1074
01:28:53,473 --> 01:28:54,462
Except maybe...

1075
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,233
...Thanksgiving, and...

1076
01:28:56,743 --> 01:28:57,732
...I really...

1077
01:28:57,911 --> 01:28:59,970
<i>...I'm</i> not crazy about turkey.

1078
01:29:02,649 --> 01:29:04,310
So, what do you say?

1079
01:29:05,752 --> 01:29:06,980
<i>Let's</i> go.

1080
01:29:07,153 --> 01:29:08,484
All right.

1081
01:29:18,999 --> 01:29:20,762
Okay, I can wait.

1082
01:29:28,675 --> 01:29:30,939
He could be dead tomorrow!

1083
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:33,511
<i>I'm</i> sorry your friend is sick...

1084
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:37,116
...but the court order is in
and my hands are tied.

1085
01:29:37,284 --> 01:29:39,775
Check the bedroom. File the paperwork.

1086
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:44,515
<i>He's</i> straight as a <i>grizzly's</i> dick!
<i>He'd</i> never cheat on his taxes!

1087
01:29:44,691 --> 01:29:46,454
<i>It's</i> not a matter of cheating!

1088
01:29:46,626 --> 01:29:49,026
<i>It's</i> a matter of miscalculation.

1089
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:54,299
He got health benefits for 20 years
while claiming as a married man.

1090
01:29:54,868 --> 01:29:57,632
However, he omitted to inform us that...

1091
01:29:57,804 --> 01:30:01,205
...his ex-wife had a part-time job
for 11 of those 20 years.

1092
01:30:01,374 --> 01:30:03,865
Had he done so,
<i>we'd</i> have informed him...

1093
01:30:04,044 --> 01:30:06,308
...that, because of her income...

1094
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:11,143
...a larger portion of those benefits
were subject to federal taxes.

1095
01:30:11,318 --> 01:30:13,218
About $13,000.

1096
01:30:14,554 --> 01:30:16,385
He can raise that.

1097
01:30:16,556 --> 01:30:17,648
However...

1098
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:21,224
...that amount when combined with...

1099
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:26,665
...11 years worth of interest,
late charges, and penalties...

1100
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:32,228
...comes out at about $57,000.
Ballpark.

1101
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:36,838
<i>He'd</i> never find that.

1102
01:30:38,845 --> 01:30:41,336
He will when we sell his house.

1103
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,873
The furniture goes to the auction house.

1104
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:14,279
Any paperwork,
put in the back of my car, okay?

1105
01:31:15,615 --> 01:31:16,604
Beautiful day.

1106
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:23,282
Do the world a favor and pull your lip
over your head and swallow.

1107
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,549
Asshole!

1108
01:31:30,897 --> 01:31:32,296
Bloodsuckers!

1109
01:31:33,566 --> 01:31:35,397
Max <i>what's</i> going on?

1110
01:31:37,737 --> 01:31:38,795
Anyone looking?

1111
01:31:39,806 --> 01:31:40,795
No, why?

1112
01:31:47,914 --> 01:31:49,245
We got a problem.

1113
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:52,578
- What is it?
- <i>Somebody's</i> barricaded the doors.

1114
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:54,809
Wait a minute.

1115
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:56,921
What?

1116
01:31:57,157 --> 01:31:59,148
Break in the door!

1117
01:31:59,325 --> 01:32:00,758
Watch this.

1118
01:32:01,161 --> 01:32:02,753
We'll see about this.

1119
01:32:09,102 --> 01:32:12,162
This <i>isn't</i> going to stop me,
Mr. Goldman.

1120
01:32:13,106 --> 01:32:15,097
I got him right where I want him.

1121
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,178
Got it, just like you said.

1122
01:32:29,522 --> 01:32:30,853
You <i>don't</i> understand.

1123
01:32:31,024 --> 01:32:32,286
I can handle it.

1124
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,020
<i>I'm</i> Jacob Goldman, mayor of Wabasha.

1125
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:43,368
I have a 30-day cease-and-desist order.
You <i>can't</i> touch this house.

1126
01:32:54,481 --> 01:32:55,709
Very well.

1127
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:47,864
You look great.

1128
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:49,592
Thanks, so do you.

1129
01:33:50,036 --> 01:33:54,939
I mean it. People always try to be nice
by saying you look great but...

1130
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:56,698
...you really do look great.

1131
01:33:57,043 --> 01:33:58,442
I feel good.

1132
01:33:58,611 --> 01:34:00,044
How are you?

1133
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,211
<i>I'm</i> good, Jacob.

1134
01:34:04,284 --> 01:34:07,048
Listen, <i>I'm</i> sorry about the...

1135
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:09,221
Divorce. Thanks.

1136
01:34:09,389 --> 01:34:12,222
<i>I'm</i> just glad <i>it's</i> over and done with.

1137
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,388
You must be.

1138
01:34:18,398 --> 01:34:19,729
Ready for this?

1139
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:21,457
No, not really.

1140
01:34:24,904 --> 01:34:28,237
Listen, if you need someone
to talk to tonight...

1141
01:34:28,408 --> 01:34:30,137
<i>...I'm</i> staying at Pop's.

1142
01:34:31,077 --> 01:34:32,635
Thanks, Jacob.

1143
01:34:32,812 --> 01:34:34,143
<i>I'd</i> like that.

01:34:34,314 --> 01:34:35,804
Hey, you two!

1145
01:34:36,316 --> 01:34:38,580
Get your asses in here!

1146
01:34:40,486 --> 01:34:42,249
I guess <i>it's</i> time.

1147
01:34:49,929 --> 01:34:51,328
Where have you been?

1148
01:34:51,497 --> 01:34:53,089
Relax. You nervous?

1149
01:34:53,266 --> 01:34:54,824
The groom is nervous.

1150
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:57,834
- <i>I'm</i> not nervous, schmuck.
- <i>Don't</i> call me schmuck, putz.

1151
01:34:58,004 --> 01:34:59,665
You're in a church!

1152
01:35:40,713 --> 01:35:41,702
Wait!

1153
01:35:41,881 --> 01:35:44,645
<i>Ain't</i> you forgetting something?!

1154
01:35:48,988 --> 01:35:50,046
That'll do it.

1155
01:35:50,323 --> 01:35:53,815
That'll do it, Dad!
I think that'll do it!

1156
01:35:53,993 --> 01:35:55,324
Okay, here we go!

1157
01:35:58,998 --> 01:36:00,727
You're the greatest.

1158
01:36:05,071 --> 01:36:07,164
- I love you.
- Good-bye, pumpkin.

1159
01:36:10,076 --> 01:36:11,566
<i>Here's</i> the house.

1160
01:36:12,011 --> 01:36:15,845
Jacob paid the penalties and interest.
I paid the 13 grand.

1161
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:19,241
Wipe the smile off your face,
<i>it's</i> just a loan.

1162
01:36:22,855 --> 01:36:26,188
I'll lay eight-to-five you <i>can't</i>
get it up the entire honeymoon.

1163
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,420
You're on.

1164
01:36:28,594 --> 01:36:30,255
A sure winner.

1165
01:36:48,948 --> 01:36:50,381
You smell something?

1166
01:36:51,617 --> 01:36:53,209
What is that?

1167
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,452
That dirty son of a...

1168
01:37:10,236 --> 01:37:11,794
What a putz!

1169
01:37:18,077 --> 01:37:21,069
What do you feel like tonight,
Leno or Letterman?

1170
01:37:21,247 --> 01:37:23,738
Tell me about it in the morning.

1171
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:25,315
Where are you going?

1172
01:37:25,918 --> 01:37:30,821
The Daughters of the American Revolution
are having a dance at the V.F.W.

1173
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:32,916
Maybe I'll get lucky.

1174
01:37:33,092 --> 01:37:34,650
<i>Don't</i> wait up for me.

1175
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:41,883
What have you got there?

1176
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:43,050
Broccoli.

1177
01:38:43,396 --> 01:38:45,159
Holy moly!

1178
01:38:52,672 --> 01:38:55,004
<i>He's</i> in. <i>He's</i> in!

1179
01:38:55,908 --> 01:38:59,241
Looks like <i>he's</i> going to enter
the holy of holies.

1180
01:38:59,412 --> 01:39:02,074
Coitus uninterruptus.

1181
01:39:04,684 --> 01:39:06,845
I throw back what <i>I'm</i> not going to eat.

1182
01:39:07,019 --> 01:39:10,250
Like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about?

1183
01:39:10,523 --> 01:39:12,514
<i>It's</i> a shame that...

1184
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:17,423
...that your uncle has a fish market
on 23rd Street and 14th Avenue.

1185
01:39:17,597 --> 01:39:18,859
Twenty-sixth.

1186
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:21,022
Twenty-sixth Street, you dummy!

1187
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,428
You schmuck!

1188
01:39:23,769 --> 01:39:28,206
Yeah. It looks like <i>Chuck's</i>
slipping her the old salami.

1189
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:30,102
Oh, Jesus, Dad!

1190
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:39,782
<i>I'm</i> Ronald Reagan. I used to be
President of the United States.

1191
01:39:39,952 --> 01:39:42,614
- I live across the street.
- Yes, come in.

1192
01:39:42,788 --> 01:39:46,952
I was also in the movies.
I was a lousy actor.

1193
01:39:48,728 --> 01:39:52,789
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i> going to put
the hot dog in the bun.

1194
01:39:52,965 --> 01:39:55,229
Oh, jeez, Dad!

1195
01:39:56,469 --> 01:39:57,800
<i>That's</i> why I came down.

1196
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:00,302
- Spit it out!
- <i>Don't</i> shout at me!

1197
01:40:00,473 --> 01:40:01,633
<i>I'm</i> not!

1198
01:40:01,807 --> 01:40:04,469
Bust my tuchus to get
here on New <i>Year's</i> Eve...

1199
01:40:04,977 --> 01:40:07,741
...or on Christmas, or whatever the...

1200
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,547
Looks like Chuck's...

1201
01:40:12,718 --> 01:40:14,743
...a tomcat on the prowl.

1202
01:40:16,756 --> 01:40:20,590
My pinched sciatica would make
your lumbago look like eyestrain.

1203
01:40:22,428 --> 01:40:25,591
Is it? Does he? Would he? Is he...

1204
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:27,255
Yes, he is.

1205
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:32,164
Looks like Chuck is taking
the old log to the beaver.

1206
01:40:33,272 --> 01:40:36,173
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i>
going to bury his boner.

1207
01:40:36,342 --> 01:40:38,435
<i>That's</i> right, you're a moron!

1208
01:40:38,678 --> 01:40:40,009
If you <i>hadn't</i> had Amy...

1209
01:40:51,357 --> 01:40:55,521
It looks like Chuck is taking
the skin boat to tuna town.

1210
01:40:56,796 --> 01:41:01,290
Looks like Chuck is taking the ride
on the wild baloney pony.

1211
01:41:12,812 --> 01:41:14,211
Who left?

1212
01:43:12,264 --> 01:43:16,758
If I knew there was a nude scene,
<i>I'd</i> have asked for another million.
