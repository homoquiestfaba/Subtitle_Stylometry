1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,520
- Here is a special

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,339
and urgent message for you.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,819
This is WKRG bringing you important news

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,499
from civil defense.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,409
A state of emergency has been
issued across Essex County

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,489
by the National Weather Service,

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,139
with governor Wayne urging
citizens to stay in their homes,

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,109
lock the doors, relieve
use of electric appliances,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,170
and most importantly

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,171
do not get caught in the winds.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,499
Those individuals tainted by the storm

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,929
are reported to behave
erratic and violently.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,969
Be wary of those around you.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,483
They may be a danger to your wellbeing.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,119
Latest disclosure indicates that the wind

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,879
started around 5:15 PM.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,546
Protected law enforcement officers

18
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,649
are being mobilized to control the streets

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,839
of distressed homeless
and sick individuals

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,892
as reports of looting
and unlawful break ins

21
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:09,059
have grown significantly
over the last several hours.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,739
Cooperate with civil defense workers

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,469
and they will help you.

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,359
We will remain on the
air to update listeners

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,582
as we monitor the phenomena.

26
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,549
Until then, this has been 97.8 WKRG

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,373
bringing you the news and
tunes of the countryside.

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,010

00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,703
Don't shoot.
- Who are you?

33
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:19,737
- My name is Jacob.

34
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,569
My name is Jacob Thompson.

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,769
- How did you get into my house?

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,533
- Your cellar hatch was unlocked.

37
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,890
- God damn it.

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,719
- Look, I had no other choice.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,267
The dust clouds came in and...

40
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,334
- You didn't caught in those winds, did you?
- No, no, no.

41
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,787
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

42
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,388
I made it in here before it got to me.

43
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,729
- Where you live around here?

44
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,769
You're not one of them
rabid, fucking homeless?

45
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,803
- No, no, no.

46
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,859
36 Elmund Road, off the river.

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,839
I barkeep The Weary
Traveler on weeknights.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,963
You ever been?

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
- Yeah.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,820
Yeah, I'm been.

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,319
- Look, I am...

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,909
I didn't break anything.

53
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,913
I promise that.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,743
- You broke into my house.

55
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:14,740
- Well...

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
- All right.

57
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,380
Come upstairs, get yourself cleaned up.

58
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,450
You can stay until this blows through.

59
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,120
I don't need your safety on my conscience.

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,963
Name's Arnold, Arnold Cunningham.

61
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,489
- Thank you, Mr. Cunningham.

62
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,002
- Some locals
believe the cause to be

63
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,439
that of a foreign attack.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
But these claims...

65
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:45,907
- Say, where were
you headed when it came?

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,389
- I was just trying to make my way home.

67
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,190
Wasn't safe to stay in the truck so,

68
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,681
I had to test my look on foot.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,723
Test my luck, I sure did.

70
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,279
- Unlike
anything seen in this century.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,323
The sun has disappeared
and the befouled winds

72
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,699
have come.

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,469
Pastor Miller of Saint Sebastian parish

74
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,629
says judgment is upon us.

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,663
We have met the end of the day.

76
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,229
- That's enough of that.

77
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,112
The world falls apart.

78
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:23,623
These people run to scare you to death.

79
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,723
Teach you how to live.

80
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,853
- So sir,

81
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,799
you live here alone?

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
- Didn't used to.

83
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,699
- Have you any...

84
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,853
Have you any idea what it is out there?

85
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,863
- You read the Bible?

86
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,220
- Not since a church school as a boy, no.

87
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,293
- "I sent a plague among
you in the manner of Egypt.

88
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,149
I slew your young men by the sword

89
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,933
along with their captured horses.

90
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,623
I made the stench of your
camp rise up in your nostrils.

91
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,103
Yet you have not returned
to me" Amos, 4:10.

92
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,313
So whatever's going on out there,

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,793
maybe we deserve it.

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,793
- You think this is God's work?

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,840
- Not the God I thought I knew.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Hey kid.

97
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,263
You barkeep with The Weary Traveler, huh?

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,661
- Part time.

99
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,975
- Uncontrolled hysteria.

100
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,343
- Hey kid?

101
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,949
I hope it was all right
that I used your restroom

102
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,950
While you were out.

103
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,360
You sure can handle your
whiskey, Mr. Cunningham.

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,979
Everything all right?

105
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,389
- Let's have a seat.

106
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,390
- Yeah.

107
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,300
Something happened while I was gone?

108
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,570
- I got a postulation

109
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,030
burrowing in my head.

110
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,439
When and where did you leave your truck

111
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
before you got to my house?

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,939
- Uh, uh, I don't really know.

113
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,050
It got kind of hard to see

114
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,483
once the dust clouds rolled in.

115
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,393
Like, six.

116
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,899
- You didn't get caught
in those winds, huh?

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
- No.

118
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:36,517
- Takes me about five, 10 minutes

119
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,653
to get to The Weary Traveler by foot.

120
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,240
Radio tells me the wind
started blowing by 5:15.

121
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,223
You tell me you entered my
home before the winds hit,

122
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,699
but you would have come upon my home

123
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,673
much earlier than 7:30,

124
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,960
if you were coming by way
of The Weary Traveler.

125
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,979
And I sure know that somebody
trying to catch shelter

126
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,560
from the eyes of a cataclysmic storm

127
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,523
wouldn't take nearly two hours to do so.

128
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,320
Especially if the nearest residence

129
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,789
was only five, 10 minutes away

130
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,747
from where you're coming by foot

131
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,703
So I'm gonna ask you to again.

132
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,579
You lying lightweight son of a bitch,

133
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,413
did you get caught in the winds?

134
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,763
- I don't know what you're trying to say.

135
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,931
- Show me you're arm!

136
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,691
You take me for an idiot?

137
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,725
Roll up your bandage!

138
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:06,489
I outta throw you out
in those winds myself.

139
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,987
- You best stop pointing
that shotgun at me!

140
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,470
- What's the matter?

141
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,593
Feeling a little ill?

142
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,370
- Okay, okay.

143
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,087
I didn't know.

144
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,188
- Get out of my house.

145
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,539
I let you in,

146
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,189
now I'm telling you to get out.

147
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,625
- Wait a minute.

148
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,659
You can't just,

149
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,099
you can't just throw me out there.

150
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
- Now!

151
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,664
♪ He's the man with the big old cape ♪

152
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:59,377

153
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:56,975
- The Howling Wind storm

154
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,729
continues to ravish the
greater northwest region

155
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,839
leaving panic and chaos in its path.

156
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,319
The National Weather
Service would like to remind

157
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,539
citizens of Essex County,
stay in your homes.

158
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,829
Lock the doors.

159
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,059
Relieve use of electric appliances,

160
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,513
and most importantly, don't
get caught in the wind.
