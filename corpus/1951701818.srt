00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:31,997
Ash, put the fucking gun down

00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,192
Put it the fuck down!

00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,738

00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,972
<i>... considered armed 
and dangerous.</i>

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,036
<i>All units, all units stand...</i>

7
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,689
She's dumb, too

8
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,598
Shut up

9
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,530
Hey, Taylor

Yeah, we had stuff to do

14
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,907
So, what
are you doing tomorrow?

15
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,973

00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,650
He's a friend

00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,622
Yeah

20
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,252
Ow! Knock it off, Ashley
You jerk!

21
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,922
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine

22
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,431
I hate your friend I don't know
why you hang outwith him

23
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:44,992
I gotta go

24
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,504
Are you gonna be
in school tomorrow?

25
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,904
I don't know Maybe

26
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,305
Hope so

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,535
See ya

28
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,617
You know she's going
to that other school next year

29
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,983
Who cares?

30
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,319
No matter what happens,
we're best friends forever

The guy might
be on to something,

69
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,960
lizards notwithstanding

70
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,962
What are you talkin' about?

71
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,019
The lizards

72
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,394
The shape-shifters

73
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,454
The alien?

74
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,898
You're not fucking
listening to me, are you?

75
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
No, I'm not listening

76
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,266
Well, if you're not interested,
just fucking say so

77
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,704
I'm not going to bat
for the lizard people

78
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,207
I just think it's kinda odd

79
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,334
that 38 out of the 45 presidents

80
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,936
have all been related by blood

81
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,072
Yeah, it's odd

82
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,379
What about this?

83
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,180
What do I look like,
a hairdresser?

84
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,721
It's good
It's discreet, uh...

85
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,586
- It's gay
- You're gay

86
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,353
No, we need something
tough, with balls

87
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,588
Like this

88
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,828
Yeah, the OJ escape vehicle

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,405
"The Beef State"

90
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,969
The Beef State it is

91
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,764
So, uh

92
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,962
Why Connecticut?
Why here?

93
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,164
'Cause Dickson said so

94
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,706
Said the air is plum

95
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,071
Since when
do we take his advice?

96
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,609
Since now

97
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,010
He says he wants us
to meet some jewel guy

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,604
Fast Bobby

99
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,411
Fast Bobby?

100
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,510
That's so cliché "Fast Bobby"

101
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,426
You ever think about the kind
of people that live in these places?

102
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,193
Heck yes

103
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,790
This is Fairfield County,

104
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,961
one of the richest communities
in America

105
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,596
Guyworks so fuckin' hard
to get a house like this

106
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,105
Big fuckin' house

107
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,699
Beautiful wife, kids

108
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,039
Pool Car

109
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,840
Guyworks so fuckin' hard,

110
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,881
the poor bastard
never gets to see his family

111
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,245
Theyjust end up resenting him

112
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,113
That's the American Dream, man

113
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,712
Heck yeah Exactly

114
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,790
Shit Just got an idea

115
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,353
So, let me get this straight...

116
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,490
I pick one of them up,

117
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,431
go to her place in her car,

118
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,490
you follow in the truck...

119
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,797
You unlock the door,

120
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,895
I sneak in while
you're hittin' it upstairs...

121
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,961
Oh, wait, hold on

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,166
How do you know
there's an upstairs?

123
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,766
I doubt she lives
in a split-level ranch

124
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,833
So, you let me in...

125
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:26,901
No, no

126
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,207
You wait outside,

127
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,579
I'll case the joint,
see what's portable,

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,311

129
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,716
Well, what am I supposed to do?

130
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,050
I don't know
Read a book

131
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,057
Think Oedipus

132
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,728
Think you could do it?

133
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,772
Yeah, be like bangin' your mother

134
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,869
I don't know

135
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,846
What do you think?

136
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,007
I think they're sauced

137
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,710
Agreed

138
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,045
No, well, listen,

144
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,931
Joy, Constance,

145

Blend in

00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,894
Parks

00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,955

00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,827
I'm here with a friend
She has two

00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,024

Karen

198
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,766
Hey, Taylor

199
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,032
Nice to meet you

200
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,574
I haven't seen you
around here before

201
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,338
Yeah, no, I'm just
visiting my uncle

202
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,539
I'm, uh
I'm a hockey fan

203
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,842
Oh

204
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,376
Well, what's so funny?

205
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,579
It's... it's cold in here

206
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,116
Yeah, it's an ice rink

207
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,284
Yeah, I know, it's just colder
in here than it is outside

208
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,754
It's so funny howtwo strangers

209
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,127
manage to talk
about the weather,

210
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,756
even when they're indoors

211
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,425
It's absurd, isn't it?

212
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,696
No, it's not absurd

213
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,135
It's just typical

214
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,267
Do you want to grab
a cup of coffee?

215
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,902
Yeah

216
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,484
Whoa, easy there, chief

217
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,718
Sorry

218
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,817
Nice stick you got here

220
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,831
Smart-ass

221
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,134
Coach Bradley
doesn't like itwhen we're late

222
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,934
Coach Bradley, huh?

223
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,339
Please can I get my stick?

224
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,398
Here you go

225
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,445
Get out of here

226
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,072
What are you doing here?

227
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,242

228
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,377

00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,084
Who?

232
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,753
I don't know
Whoever you're playing against

233
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,489
You got skills, don't ya?

234
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,123
Well, Coach Bradley
doesn't think so

235
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,860
Coach Bradley's an idiot

236
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,834
Look, how old are you?

237
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,837

239
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,971
So, if Coach Bradley
really knowss dick about hockey,

240
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,907
what's he doing coaching
a bunch of 10-year-olds?

241
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,235
I don't know

242
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,678
Does he ever
put you in the games?

243
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,841
Never

244
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,011
And who does he
put in every single game?

245
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,816

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,356

You're not some kind
of child molester, are you?

278
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,643
If I was a child molester,
would I tell you about it?

279
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,950
Good point

280
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,815

Started getting into all these
fights at the hockey rink

309
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,653
Well, can't you fight in hockey?

They're kids

311
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,263
Kids don't have to learn
howto fight?

00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,791

I just

343
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,658
You know

344
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,721
Jerry

345
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,789
Mmm

346
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,926
I mean, Jerry

347
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,991
Jerry

348
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,463
He can be...

349
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,733
A prick?

350
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,502
Actually, I was
going to say "detached"

351
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,304
Oh, yeah
There's that

352
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,743
Oh, God

353
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,371
What am I defending him for?

354
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,472
It's his fault

355
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,847
Well, I say enjoy it

356
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,185
And I

357
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,453
I justwanted to feel something,
you know, anything

358
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,824
Jesus, Karen, when's
the last time you had sex?

359
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,988
Emma, everything with you
has to go back to sex

360
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,053
Well

361
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,327
I wanted to feel
close to someone

362
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,389
A month?

363
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,697
Two months?

364
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,998
Emma

365
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,437
Look, I'm not rationalizing this

366
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,168
It's cheating,
and I feel awful about it

367
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,539
I do

368
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,514
Oh, my God, have I
become that desperate?

369
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,879
Six months?

370
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,181
- Maybe more
- Oh, my God

371
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,017
And I'm sure it hasn't been
that long for Jerry, though

372
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,556
No, I'm sure it hasn't

373
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,650
So, tell me

374
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,388
When, how, where?

375
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,987
Welll told him

376
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,396
That I would
leave the light on for him

377
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,832
- The light?
- You know

378
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,767
To let him know
that Jerry's away and

379
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,372
And he can come in

380
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,205
All right, if you could live
anywhere in the world,

381
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,437
where would it be?

382
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,775
Paris You?

383
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,508
Tijuana

384
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,517
Cheap booze

385
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,251
If you could only eat one kind of food,
whatwould it be?

386
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,313
Uh...

387
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,622
Like Italian,
Japanese, Chinese...

388
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,683
Burgers

389
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,753
- American?
- Yeah

390
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,730
- Huh, interesting
- You?

391
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,391
Japanese

392
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,096
I don't like that

393
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,296
Rawfish?

394
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,931
I mean, fish is meant to be cooked

395
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,780
I think I'm getting nicely drunk

396
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,828
I think after we leave here

397
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,866
we should, like, go to the beach
or something, you know?

398
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,664
Go jet-skiing
and paragliding and

399
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,830
you know,
shrimp cocktails and stuff

400
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,204
Ta-da!

401
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,640
What do you think?

402
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,178
Don'twe look special!

403
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,907
Thank you

404
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,514
Think we can do
some actual work tonight?

405
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,777
We?

406
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,322
Uh, yeah, okay

407
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,315
Don't forget to hit that shit

408
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,431
Hey, boy

409
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,403
So how's your uncle?

410
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,800
He's good

411
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,544
Where did you say he lived again?

412
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,912
Uh

413
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:25,972
I didn't

414
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,643
Ah

415
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,314
But, uhhe lives close

416
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,553
And is your friend staying with you?

417
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,684
My friend?

418
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,592
From the other day at the ice rink

419
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,687
Yeah, Ashley

420
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,753
Ashley, right

421
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,855
Yep

422
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,024
Hmm

423
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,795
So, uh

424
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,003
Where's your husband?

425
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,735
He's away on business

426
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,470
Right

427
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,307
What's he do?

428
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,104
He's an investment banker

429
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,013
Wow Cool

430
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,542
Mm-hmm I guess

431
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,883
Any kids?

432
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,150
Just one

433
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,954
Mm, mm, mm

434
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,674
Taylor?

435
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,774
Yeah?

436
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,649
Yeah, I'm just going
to get some water

437
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,655
Would you get me some, too?

438
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,664
What the fuck
are you doin' here, man?

439
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,139
Gettin' somethin' to eat

440
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,505
This is crazy Come on

441
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,100
How'd it go?

442
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,307
This is dog shit

443
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,612
I got it out of the bottom
of her jewelry box

444
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,777
It's stuff she wouldn't miss right away

445
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,879
Where's the Winston,
the Yurman, the Bulgari?

446
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,753
That's Ripka

447
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,349
This is Ripka, too

448
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,793
It's the Armani Exchange
of Armani

449
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,222
At least she got some real pearls

450
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,793
Although those synthetics
they make nowadays are almost exact

451
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,168
Did you know
that pearls dissolve in wine?

452
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,537
That's wine, Hamlet

453
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,873
It's cold

454
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,004
I was in the middle
of an anecdote

455
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,548
Yeah You always are

456
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,451
You two seem to be doing
just fine for yourselves

457
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,991
We certainly are

458
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,186
Yeah, this town
was ready to get tapped

459
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,229
- Yeah

460
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,026
- You told us
- I told you

461
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,864
Taylor even got a girlfriend
out of the whole deal

462
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,370
Oh, fuck you

463
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,771
No, he's fuckin' crazy about this bitch

464
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,831
For real

465
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,308
It's all part of the scam

466
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,277
- Yeah, right
- Oh, yeah

467
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,644

00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,957
Whoa, nice place, Dicky!

472
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,654
- I know
- All right, so, uh

473
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,993

with unloading this shit?

474
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,693

It's all gonna be okay

481
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,511
Pass the bottle

482
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,118
Jesus Christ

483
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,170
Hey, Dickson

484
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,178

Wait a minute
You're Fast Bobby?

487
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,944
Whatwere you expecting?

Pfft, I don't know
Something with a dick

00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,592
Sorry, don't listen to him

490
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,925
Uh, just not somebody
as attractive as yourself

491
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,861
It's an honor to meet you

492
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,957
Likewise

493
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,229
Let's just get on with it

494
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,033
I know about your scam

495
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,129
lmpressive

496
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,731
Dangerous

497
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,505
And so boring

498
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,605
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's not as easy as it sounds

499
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,813
Hockey moms are toughbaby

500
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,821
What did you call me?

501
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,084
Baby

00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,594
Fuck this Take it to a pawn shop
and get your usual ten percent

503
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,151

00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,805
Well, fuck this shit

508
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,603
We're not amateurs,
we're professional thieves

509
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,371
Sit down Just listen

00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,844

Yeah, can we just,

512
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,881
Let's have a look

513
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,222
This is it?

514
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,820
This is shit

515
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,128
What the fuck is it
with bitches and jewelry?

516
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,903
Baby

517
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,804
What'd she say to me?

518
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,205
It's not good

519
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,037
Way to go

520
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,843
Fucked this up, too

521
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,247
Good for you for looking out
for yourself for once

522
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,414
I know, it's just

523
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,018
I'm not

524
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,787
Like me?

525
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,055
That's not fair

526
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,597
What's not fair?

527
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,327
I don't care It's fine

528
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,959
It's just sex

529
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,297
For me, maybe not for you

530
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,671
Give me one of those

531
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,038
What? You quit

532
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,374
Emma, Jesus Christ, it's the least
of my problems right now

533
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,606
Okay

534
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,622
So what about his friend
from the hockey rink?

535
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,419
What's his name?

536
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,123
Emma!

537
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,855
What?

538
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,490
What, you have the monopoly
on being lonely, now, Karen?

539
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,261
What's his name?

540
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,229
Ashley

541
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,703
Ashley?

542
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,707
Sounds, uh, artistic

543
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,368
Apparently, he hangs out
downtown at the café

544
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,879
- Really?
- Mm-hmm

545
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,348
What? What's wrong?

546
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,319
I don't know how long
I can keep this up

547
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,256
So leave the light off

548
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,760
Hmm

549
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,568
Just a couple more minutes, man

550
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,108
What the fuck for?

551
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,441
She's not gonna turn on
your precious little light

552
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,107
Probably fucked
some sense into her

553
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,513
Fine, go

554
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,174
- What?
- Go!

555
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,989
Oh, really? All right

556
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,686
Go party by myself

557
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,160
Have fun walking home

558
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,565
Nice Lap dances?

559
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,266

00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,482
Now, when I first met you,
I know I came off as, like, a jerk

565
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,888
It's just that you're so beautiful

566
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,755
I guess I was intimidated

567
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,317

568
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,195

00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,637
I'm sure it hasn't changed much

580
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,676

Where were you?

627

With Fast Bobby?

629
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:39,442
No, with your, uh, old lady's friend
from the hockey rink

630
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,950
Think that's a good idea?

631
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,509
Who cares?

632
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,255

00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,918
That sounds fancy

745
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,725
If you like guards and dogs
and bars and stuff

746
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,033
We were on the polo team

747
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,297
Devonwood was a reform school

748
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,169
So, are... are you two like brothers?

749
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,503
Yeah, more like lovers

750
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,803
Fuck you

751
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:54,766
Fuck you!

752
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,176
No, fuck you

753
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,442
We've got a Jacuzzi in our room

754
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,006
Back the hell up

00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,615
Hey, get out of here!

756
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,847

What's goin' on here?

758
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,853

Aw, jeez I guess we gotta find
someone else to press play, don'twe?

768
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,775

Yo, what's fuckin' wrong, bro?

You're what's wrong!

816
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,503
What are you talking about, man?

817
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,909
That motherfucker started this...

818
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,575
It's not him!
It's everywhere we fucking go!

819
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,883
Yo, you're fuckin' trippin', bro

820
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:53,389
- What's you fuckin' problem?
- I'm fuckin' tired of this!

821
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,220
It's everywhere, it's everything,

822
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,284
and every time, I get caught
in the fucking middle

823
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,160
It's like you against
the whole fucking world, right?

824
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,522
Nah

825
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,034
It's us against the whole fucking world

826
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,676
Come on, man

827
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,111
You're just trippin', dude

It's cool

829
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,747
Fuck it

830
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:52,604
Dickson!

831
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,985
What the fuck is going on?

832
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,490
Where's your head?

833
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,423
You're smarter than this

834
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,928
You see what they did
to my DJ?

835
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,022
Enough with this dog and pig show

836
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,326
Pony

837
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,270
It's "dog and pony show"

838
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,402
<i>Just fix this</i>

839
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,714
Look, consequences, okay?

840
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,944
That's all I'm saying

841
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,578
Aw, just because I
fucked up some punk-ass DJ?

842
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:31,951
It's notjust that, okay

843
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,820
I mean, you can't be running red lights
when you're robbing banks

844
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,826
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

845
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,195
Look, I asked you guys to come east,

846
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,028
make a little money, okay,
maybe even eventually go legit

847
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,660
Okay, butwhat do you do?
You fuck it up and throw it back in my face

848
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,431
- Bullshit
- No, it's not bullshit, okay

849
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,369
You're reckless

850
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,428
You're damn straight

851
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,379
Hey, Mom

852
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,946

853
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,219
Can I borrowthe car?

854
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,227
Where are you going?

855
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,126
Just out for coffee

856
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,854
Would you like some company?

857
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,862
Well, I'm

858
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,234
kinda meeting someone

859
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,165
A boy?

860
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,778
Yeah

861
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,077
So when do we get to meet him?

862
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,084
We're not quite

863
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,554

864
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,152

<i>Hi.</i>

878
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,266
Who is this?

879
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,381
<i>Oh, I think you knowwho it is.</i>

880
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,449
Your timing's a bit off
Mama Bear's not in right now

881
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,049
<i>I wasn't calling for her.</i>

882
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,117
<i>I was calling for you.</i>

883
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,226
What do you want?

884
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,868
<i>Not sure, but uh...</i>

885
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,595
<i>I think I want to see you.</i>

886
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,069
Why?

887
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,845
<i>I don't know. Why not?</i>

888
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,415
Wow, that's a wonderful argument

889
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,521
Uh, I'll think about it

890
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,832
Mmm

891
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,168
Shit

892
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,639
I took those right out of her fuckin' ears

893
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,041
Mmm

894
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,820
Look what the cat dragged in

895
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,788
Where's your partner?

896
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,158
He's, uh

897
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,285
He's not here

898
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,295
I can see

899
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,560
I thought you were a team

900
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,364
We are

901
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,030
Maybe someone needs
to start looking for a new partner

902
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,938
I think someone needs
to mind their own fucking business

903
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,206
What do you have for me?

904
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,179
Now I'm happy

905
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,156
Very happy

906
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,292
I'll be happy too once I get paid

907
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:14,595
I'm thinking9,000 for all of it

Oh, hell yeah!

914
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,191
So

00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,697
What are we doing?

916
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,360
Takin' a walk

917
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,596
Yeah?

918
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,442

You gonna tell her?

921
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:04,117
Tell her what?
I mean there's nothing to tell

922
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,677
<i>What are you gonna tell her?</i>

923
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,591
Nothing for me to tell anymore either

924
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,828
Oh

925
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,738
So

926
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,208
What do you do?

927
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,837
I uh

928
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,403
I steal stuff

929
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,250
- And that's it?
- Yeah

930
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,719
That and get busted for it

931
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,585
Pretty cool, huh?

932
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,318
Oh, yeah

933
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,727
I stole something once

934
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,490
Got busted for it

935
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,031
ll've been here before

936
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,731
I knowthat bridge

937
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,032
Yeah, it's pretty old

938
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:02,909
I think itwas built in, like, 1911
by an architect from, uh, Prague

939
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:07,348
Yeah, I saw a picture once
from when theywere just building it,

940
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,645
you know, and

941
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,753
everything around it looked so

942
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,021
justwild anduntouched

943
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,857
ltwas kind of haunting, really

944
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,000
Nothing looks like that anymore,
you know

945
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,126
It's all developed

946
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,763
Not everywhere

947
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,676
Yeah, I guess

948
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,413
So where'd you grow up?

949
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,005
All over the place

950
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,276
Hmm

951
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,486
I've never been there

952
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,046
You should go

953
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,048
Yeah

954
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,222
Maybe I'll stop by

955
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,174
<i>No!</i>

956
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,842
<i>Up there...</i>

957
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,415
Got a little surprise for you

958
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,184
Ready?

959
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,286
He's cute

960
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,832
Taylor

961
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,332
This is Candice

962
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,762
Hmm All right

963
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,307
I doubt that's her real name

964
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,069
Huh, bro?

965
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,805
Just like old times

966
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,009
That's the Jacuzzi I told you about

967
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,016
Hot!

968
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,881
What do you say, dog?

969
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,847
So

970
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,586
We gonna party?

971
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,659
Taylor?

972
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:04,722
What's up, bro?

973
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,132
We gonna party?

974
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:10,236
Shut the fuck up

975
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,568
You knowwhat?
Here

976
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,042
Take this fucking money

977
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,100
Pssh!

978
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,475
Yeah, you guys have fun together

979
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,407
Go! Fucking

980
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,450
Dude, what's wrong with you?

981
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,688
Yeah, you'd rather
watch fucking cartoons, dude?

982
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,692
This fucking

983
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,366
moody shit's getting a little old

984
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,701
That cunt's clouding your judgment

985
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,342
How's it going, man?

986
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,745
Hey

987
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,017
Nice barn

988
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,649
What are you doing here?

989
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,585
What are you doing here?

990
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,493
I'm workin'

991
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,788
Working?

992
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,562
Workin' on what?

993
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,234
Your golf swing?

994
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,769
No, I, uh

995
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:53,900
met Karen's daughter

996
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,376
She's got some rich friends

997
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,972
I thoughtwe could hit them,
too, you know?

998
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,074
I like the way you think

999
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,552
Regular entrepreneur

1000
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,518
Taylor?

1001
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:15,221
Ashley But I'm sure my esteemed
colleague has told you all about me

1002
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,528
He's told me all about you

1003
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,437
Well, I better run

1004
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,043
You two lovebirds have a swell time

1005
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,978
Been a pleasure meeting you, April

1006
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,648
You certainly are
a lovely young woman

1007
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,119
Who was that?

1008
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,791
Just an old friend

1009
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,624
Nobody

1010
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,672
Yeah

1011
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,951
Wow

1012
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,388
This is cool

1013
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:23,899
Yeah
It's my favorite spot

1014
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,769
What's so funny?

1015
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,770
Nothing

1016
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:02,729
So, uh

1017
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,871
What do we do now?

1018
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:09,107
I haven't really
thought that far ahead

1019
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,908
Which is funny,
'cause usually that's all I do

1020
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,006
Think ahead

1021
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,051
I try not to think at all

1022
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,022
Well, look where it got me

1023
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,616
In the barn,
with my mother's "lovah"

1024
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,702
I guess I'm just starting to feel

1025
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,703
Stuck, you know?

1026
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,607
Why? This

1027
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,413
This is great

1028
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,876
Look around you

1029
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,754
I mean, seriously,
look at everyone

1030
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:01,319
They're slaving away
for houses, cars, stock options

1031
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:04,230
They're completely
dying inside, and for what?

1032
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,562
In 30, 40 years,
what's the sun gonna set on?

1033
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,770
This

1034
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,549
It's... it's like a mundane lockdown

1035
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,751
You're startin' to sound like my friend

1036
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,052
I don't think I'm
too keen on your friend

1037
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,864
Yeah

1038
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:40,460
I don't blame you
I don't really like him sometimes, either

1039
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,604
So why you with him?

1040
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,377
He's all I got

1041
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:04,651
That's sad

1042
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,217
You're sad

1043
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,501
So what happened to you?

1044
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,504
What happened to me

1045
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,233
Let's see

1046
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,468
Well, I never knew my dad

1047
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,170
Didn't really know my mom

1048
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,234
She was a hippie

1049
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,543
They fucked, they had me,
and they never gave a shit about me

1050
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,179
And she dropped me on my head
when I was six months old

1051
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,778
I know, fuckin' ridiculous

1052
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,254
I got a dent, right here

1053
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:35,620
It's flat Feel it

1054
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,191
And I'm a thief
And I fuck people over

1055
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,372
How's thatworkin' out for ya?

1056
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,813
Pretty good, I guess

1057
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,013
Yeah?

1058
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,852
Brought you here?

1059
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,391
For what?

1060
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,256
Just tryin' to get by

1061
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,650
When can I see you again?

1062
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,829
I'm sure you'll find me

1063
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,146
I don't think she liked me

1064
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,308
No, I don't think
she liked you, either

1065
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,743
You're gonna fuckin'
blowthis for us, man

1066
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,222
What are you...
what are you talkin' about?

1067
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,384
Fuckin' show in there

1068
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,622
Big fuckin' deal
We gotta get outta here anyway, man

1069
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,425
People are gettin' suspicious

1070
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,659
This town is fuckin' bullshit

1071
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:58,995
Just drive

1072
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,796
Calm down, pal

1073
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,907
Let's go up to Westchester County

1074
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,377
There's fuckin' rich people
out the ass up there

1075
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,376
Or Miami

1076
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,680
Whatever, man
Just, can we go?

1077
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:17,912
Jesus Christ

1078
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:25,022
<i>So what's
the deal with Ashley?</i>

1079
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,862
He's my best friend We

1080
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,631
We grew up together
Went into foster care

1081
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,862
People we knew
from the neighborhood

1082
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,265
Whatwas that like?

1083
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,769
Let's see, eight kids
in a one-bedroom apartment

1084
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,310
fighting over scraps

1085
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,508
I mean, we lived off
of leftover Greek food

1086
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,516
from this diner they owned

1087
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,417
That's extraordinarily fucked up

1088
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,321
Yeah, that's, uh
that's not the half of it

1089
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,356
What's the other half?

1090
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:05,858
Ashley's dad gave him this
German shepherd when he was alive

1091
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:11,303
After his dad died, they let us
keep the dog at the foster home

1092
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,375
That dog was so cool
and so smart

1093
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:22,482
He sensed that our new
ma and pop, Frank and Sally,

1094
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,781
you know, they
weren't stand-up people

1095
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,346
So, after years of the dog

1096
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,155
hating them, growling at 'em,
and trying to bite them,

1097
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,991
they said enough was enough

1098
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:38,194
So one night at dinner,
good old Frank says, "Hey, Ashley!

1099
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,462
What do you think of the stew?"

1100
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:44,028
Ashley said,
"For a chef, it tastes like shit"

1101
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:51,570
Frank said, "Well, it should,
'cause it's dog meat"

1102
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:59,377
Then he threw
the dog collar at Ashley

1103
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,118
We beat his ass that night

1104
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,461
Put him in the hospital for a month

1105
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,689
Ashley crippled his hands

1106
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,195
He used the door as a vise

1107
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:18,171
He wanted it to be a constant reminder

1108
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,108
Every time he looked at those hands
he would remember what he did

1109

It's all right

01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,450
You got it out of your system

1161
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,509
Mm, no

1162
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,348

Hey, you did the best you could

1171
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,891
You were always so strong

1172
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,339
I feel like I'm losing you

1173
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,474

01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,386
Taylor's friend

1229
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,228

Uhwhat's up?

1231
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,729
Apparently, your stepdad

1232
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,702
what's going on
with Taylor and your mom and

1233
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,398

01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,572
We're supposed to meet Taylor
at this diner

1237
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,440
He's tying up some loose ends

1238
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,740
Butwe gotta hurry

1239
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,542
Uh, yeah

1240
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,246
Oh, okay, let me just stop by home first
I'll see you there

1241
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,311
Taylor didn't think that
was a good idea

1242
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,782
Uh

1243
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:36,881
Do you mind driving?

1244
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,395
Uhyeah o-okay

1245
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,794
Come on, we gotta hurry

1246
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:44,721
April!

1247
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,357
April!

1248
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,203
Excuse me, can I help you?

1249
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,366
Yeah, where is she?

1250
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,909
Honey, do you knowthis kid?

1251
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,376
Is he a friend of April's?

1252
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,538
I-I guess he must be

1253
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,603
Is she here?

1254
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,308
No, she's not here right now

1255
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,257
What the fuck was that?

1256
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:14,317
I have no idea

1257
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,763
He's gone now

1258
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,292
You should really eat something

1259
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,099
You're too skinny

1260
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:31,070
Not all guys want to date
15-year-old anorexic models

1261
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,613
It's kinda gross

1262
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,613
So where's Taylor,
'cause you did say he was here

1263
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,554

01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,651

1273
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,756
You can't smoke in here

1274
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,654
You wanna take that to go?

1275
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,991

1280
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,235
Thank you Huh?

1281
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,001

Not even socially?

1285
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,391
Not even for me?

1286
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:00,394
My dad died of cancer

1287
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,454
Bummer

1288
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:05,864

You fuckin' think you love him?

1290
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,104
You fuckin' love him?

1291
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,012
You shouldn't play games with people

1292
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:05,990
I haven't

1293
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,295
You gave him hope

1294
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,234
I have hope

1295
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,000
Well, it must be nice

1296
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,045
You're his soul mate

1297
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,815
You're soul mates, is that it?

1298
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,190
What's your soul look like, April?

1299
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,089
Is it like your name?

1300
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,460
All spring and flowers?

1301
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,503
I don't know

1302
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,614
What's yours look like, Ash?

1303
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,788
What does it look like?

1304
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,690
He loved you

1305
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,289
I know

1306
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,674
At least you fuckin' had him!

1307
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,087
Taylor!

1308
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,895
What the fuck's going on?

1309
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:53,264
You tell me
what the fuck's going on here!

1310
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:54,768
What the fuck is going on here?

1311
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:55,996
Did he touch you?

1312
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,800
Did you fucking touch her?

1313
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,703
- Is it?
- Put it down!

1314
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:00,763
Is thatwhat?

1315
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,169
What the fuck's going on here?

1316
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,734
- What happened?
- He's just

1317
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,973
II

1318
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,410
Put the gun down
What's going on here?

1319
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,119
Do you remember

1320
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,655
when I picked you up
when you got out?

1321
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,824
And we got in that car

1322
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,102
Let's go
Let's get the fuck outta here

1323
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,700
I can't

1324
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,905
Let's get the fuck outta here

1325
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,709
I can't!

1326
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,373
I can't

1327
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,013
Ash, put the fucking gun down

1328
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,113
They're coming

1329
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,860
I didn't call them
Oh, shit

1330
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,692
It hurts too fucking much,

1331
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,256
and I can't fucking take it anymore

1332
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,733
Ash, put the fucking gun down

1333
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,099
Put the gun down!

1334
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,833
No! No! This is
how I fucking want it!

1335
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,169
I love you!

1336
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,766
I loveyou

1337
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,646
Get in the car! Ash!

1338
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:20,176
Ash!
