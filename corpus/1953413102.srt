00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,400
ALL RIGHT NOW GENTLEMAN, BRING
ME UP TO SPEED ON YOUR MEETING

2
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,170
WITH HALLSWELL'S
PEOPLE THIS MORNING.

3
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,130
SENATOR, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
MOVE FAST TO GATHER THE SUPPORT

4
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
WE NEED.

5
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,570
SENATOR HALLSWELL IS DETERMINED
TO REIGN ALL THOSE REGIONS IN

6
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,070
THE MIDEAST.

7
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,740
IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING IN THE
PAST 50 YEARS, IT IS THAT EVERY

8
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,980
GUN, LOCKET AND TANK WE SELL
WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED AGAINST

9
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,910
US.

10
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,520
SCREW HALLSWELL.

11
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,880
WE HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET BY
HIM AND THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS

12
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,050
BEEN MAKING CALLS.

13
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,250
THAT IS WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

14
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,530
SON, YOU FORGOT MY GLASS.

15
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,460
EXCUSE ME.

16
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
LISTEN RICHARD, YOU CAN THINK
WHATEVER YOU WANT OF THIS GUY.

17
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,600
BUT JUST REMEMBER HE'S GOT A
LOT OF FRIENDS IN THIS TOWN.

18
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,270
YEAH, AND MOST OF
THEM DEMOCRATS.

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,870
THAT'S FUNNY.

20
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,550
DID YOU HEAR THEY'RE MAKING A
MOVIE ABOUT DAN QUAIL'S MILITARY

21
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,950
CAREER?

22
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,780
IT'S CALLED FULL DINNER JACKET.

23
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,270
SENATOR?

24
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,570
JUST A HOT FLASH.

25
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,710
ARE YOU OKAY?

26
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,340
SENATOR!

27
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,380
JESUS HE IS HAVING A SEIZURE.

28
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,650
CALL THE PARAMEDICS!

29
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
I KNOW CPR.

30
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,350
AMAZING, IT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

31
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,080
AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT ALRED.

32
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,820
YOU SHALL HAVE IT.

33
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,330
 WELL, FOR THE DOG DAYS,
IT'S ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY

34
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,530
IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

35
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,160
IT'S HOT.

36
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,200
AND WE'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED
THAT POLICE HAVE COMPLETELY SHUT

37
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,470
DOWN ALL LANES ON THE WHITEHURST
FREEWAY BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA AND

38
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,040
THE 3RD STREET EXIT.

39
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,170
WE ARE TOLD THAT IT IS
SOME SORT OF BOMB SCARE.

40
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,910
EMERGENCY VEHICLES ARE ON THE
SCENE AND AS YOU MAY IMAGINE,

41
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,810
TRAFFIC IS ALREADY BACKED
UP ALL THE WAY TO VIRGINIA.

42
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,420
THIS IS WNLC AND I'M
TERRY IN THE MORNING.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,980
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED FOR
ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

44
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,650
AM I GOING TO?

45
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,160
DIE?

46
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,520
YES.

47
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,130
I MEAN TODAY.

48
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,760
WE'VE GOT ONE ECCENTRIC HUSBAND.

49
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,570
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

50
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,170
HAVE ONE LITTLE AFFAIR..

51
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,370
AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES.

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,470
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

53
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,550
YOUR HUSBAND CERTAINLY
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,180
WHICH COLOR DO YOU PREFER?

55
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,950
RED OR GREEN?

56
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,250
WHAT?

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,860
RED OR GREEN.

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,090
GREEN.

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

60
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,330
RED.

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,470
TOO LATE IT'S GREEN.

62
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,970
OH GOD...

63
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
GIMME YOUR GUM QUICK.

64
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,180
YOUR GUM!

65
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,860
I GOT AN IDEA.

66
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,820
YOU'RE CHEATING ON YOUR HUSBAND.

67
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,630
PUT ON SOME UNDERWEAR.

68
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,570
¶.

69
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,440
NICE JOB EDDIE.

70
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,280
WAY TO DO DAN.

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,820
WHAT YOU THOUGHT MY BECOMING
A FED WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING?

72
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,720
I WAS HOPING.

73
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,060
WHAT'S THAT?

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,760
YOU EVER SEEN THIS?

75
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,460
WHAT'S THIS YOUR LUCKY CHARM?

76
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,860
NO...

77
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,500
I JUST LIKE TAPING
PICTURES TO MY CHEST.

78
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,930
ARE YOU DANNY O'NEIL?

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,470
THAT'S RIGHT, WHY?

80
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,170
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO
DO WITH THE EDWARDS MCMAHON

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,140
SWEEPSTAKES OR SOMETHING?

82
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,780
IT'S A RESTRAINING ORDER TO
KEEP YOU AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE.

83
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,880
HAVE A NICE DAY.

84
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,290
THIS IS A SECURED AREA.

85
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,350
NO ONE!

86
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,720
NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE.

87
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,030
SORRY ABOUT THIS DAN.

88
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
THERE WAS A DETONATION AT
A RESTAURANT ON DELAWARE.

89
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,470
THEY SENT IN A COPTER FOR YOU.

90
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,640
OH MAN, LOVE MONDAYS.

TO LAND OVER THERE, OVER?

94
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,480

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,960

HAVE FUN IN THERE DANNY.

101
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,940
FIDELITY
INSURANCE STRIKES AGAIN.

102
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,210
WELL DANNY O'NEILL.

103
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,880
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE
PAYING OUT BIG TIME ON THIS ONE.

104
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,880
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

105
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,790
FOUR DEATHS AND 15 INJURIES.

106
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,620
MAYBE IS WAS A GAS LEAK?

107
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,190
WELL IF IT WAS A GAS LEAK,
SOMEBODY HAS SERIOUS GAS

108
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,660
PROBLEMS.

109
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,200
DID YOU REALLY TRY AND THROW
TRAVERES OFF THE BALCONY AT YOUR

110
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,460
HOUSE.

111
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,370
I COULDN'T GET HIS
FAT ASS OVER THE RAIL.

112
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,170
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW
SORRY I AM ABOUT YOU AND YOUR

113
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,010
WIFE.

114
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,010
HOW COME EVERYBODY
KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,110
I MEAN WAS THIS ON
CNN OR SOMETHING?

116
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,480
I KNOW EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON
IN THIS TOWN DANNY, YOU KNOW

117
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,350
THAT.

118
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,380
REALLY?

119
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,780
WHAT ABOUT SENATOR WILKINS?

120
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,550
THE PINK PANTIES IN THE DESK.

121
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,650
SEE YA.

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,490
YOU'RE BAD.

123
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,330
SHANE!

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,170
WILL YOU GET THIS HORNY
CAN OF TUNA AWAY FROM ME?

125
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,200
WHAT CAN I SAY DAN?

126
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,040
MADONNA WANTS YOU.

127
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,940
GO!

128
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,280
I'M NOT DOING IT DAN, I SWEAR.

129
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,140
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE
REACTS TO YOU THAT WAY?

130
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,110
WELL YOU MUST NOT BE
TREATING HER RIGHT.

131
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,020
PICK YOURSELF UP A CAN OF
WD40 AND GO TO TOWN WITH IT.

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,490
JAMES IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

133
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,450
WHERE IS HE?

134
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,250
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

135
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,550
JAMES, JAMES.

136
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,060
TERRORIST ATTACK
IT LOOKS LIKE HUH?

137
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,330
WHERE'S THE DEVICE?

138
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,330
CAN'T FIND IT.

139
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,860
EXCUSE ME?

140
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,200
THEY SAY THAT SENATOR VICTOR
HAD A SEIZURE AND THEN BOOM.

141
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,770
BOOM?

142
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,530
YOU MEAN HE
SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED?

143
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,470
YOU TELL ME.

144
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,040
OKAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW GUYS?

145
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,640
NOTHING.

146
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,240
NO METAL, PLASTIC
OR CHEMICAL RESIDUE.

147
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,280
C'MON WHAT IS THIS GUYS YOUR
FIRST DAY ON THE JOB, KEEP

148
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,250
DIGGING.

149
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,750
PEOPLE DON'T JUST EXPLODE.

150
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,980
I MEAN IF THEY DID, I WOULD HAVE
HEARD ABOUT IT A LONG TIME AGO.

151
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,950
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

152
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,090
JESUS.

153
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,230
SHANE, LOOK AT THIS.

154
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,200
LOOKS LIKE THE FINGERS
HAVE BEEN BLOWN RIGHT OFF.

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,500
EITHER THAT OR HE
SHOULD FIRE IS MANICURIST.

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,180
TERRY, WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT I SUPPORT YOU.

157
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,420
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

158
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,520
AND WITH DAN, UNTIL
RECENTLY YOU WERE SO UNHAPPY.

159
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,620
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

160
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,460
I KNOW.

161
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,630
I THINK SENATOR
TRAVERES IS GOOD FOR YOU.

162
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,400
YOU JUST SEEM HAPPIER WITH HIM.

163
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,830
MOM...

164
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,570
FRANK AND I ARE FRIENDS.

165
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,370
HI HONEY, I'M HOME.

166
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,210
TERRY, I'LL CALL THE POLICE IF YOU WANT.
- NO, MOM

167
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,650
HI MOM.

168
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,920
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

169
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,450
LISTEN, YOU'RE STILL MY WIFE
AND THIS IS STILL MY HOUSE.

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,260
COURT ORDERS HMMM?

171
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,090
AND THIS IS STILL
MY GARBAGE PAIL.

172
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,100
DANNY, I'VE BEEN THOUGH THIS TOO
MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I'M SICK

173
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,600
OF GETTING HURT.

174
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,470
I'M ALWAYS THE
ONE WHO GETS HURT.

175
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,870
LISTEN, HOW ABOUT THE ONE
THAT IS SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?

176
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,610
FRANK TRAVERES IS NOT
THE PROBLEM WITH US.

177
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,780
I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C WOULD DISAGREE

178
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,980
WITH THAT.

179
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,050
MOM, COULD YOU DO SOMETHING?

180
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,320
THANKS MOM.

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,990

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

209
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,150
JUST KIDDING.

PATIENCE DR BERNARD, PATIENCE.

211
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,130
YES, BUT YOU ARE NOT PATIENT
WHEN YOU WANTED THE FORMULA.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

213
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,570
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL
GIVE YOU A CHECK RIGHT NOW.

214
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640

216
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,410
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY SOON.

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,250
YES!

218
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,390
THAT FOOL WAS RIGHT, IT IS
COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE.

219
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,790
WITH THE POWER THIS FORMULA CAN
GIVE US, NOTHING WILL STAND IN

220
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,860
OUR WAY, NOTHING.

221
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,170
SOMETIMES I WONDER.

222
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,840
WHAT IS IT ALL FOR?

223
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,940
REALLY?

224
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,790
NO...

225
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,660
HMMM...

226
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,430
AND WE'LL SET THE PRESS
CONFERENCE FOR FIRST THING

227
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,530

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,760
YEAH, I WANT SOMETHING PREPARED.

229
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,570
SOMETHING UM,
SOMETHING EMOTIONAL.

230
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,100
SENATOR VICTOR WAS A FRIEND.

231
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,800
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED.

232
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,740
REMEMBER EMOTION, FEELING.

233
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,580
YEAH.

234
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,950
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
JUST HOW SERIOUS I AM NOW.

235
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,590
UH, SENATOR VICTOR'S WIFE, JUST
LET ME TAKE THIS IN PRIVATE.

236
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,460
YOU GOT BALLS CALLING ME HERE.

237
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,600
AND YOU DISPLAYED YOURS WHEN
YOU CUT ME OUT OF 10 MILLION

238
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,230
DOLLARS.

239
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,930
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,700
WELL LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

241
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,740
THE ARMS SALE.

242
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,580
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

243
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,810
DO YOU KNOW THAT'S
WHAT VICTOR SAID.

244
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,820
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

245
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,650
VICTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
CUTTING YOU OUT OF THE DEAL.

246
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,190
YOU GOT YOU'RE RETRIBUTION.

247
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,960
YES, BUT YOU CAN'T BUY
ITALIAN VILLAS WITH RETRIBUTION.

248
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,030
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

249
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,360
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS
STOPPING ME GOING PUBLIC?

250
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,830
MANNERS.

251
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,340
I CAN MAKE SURE THAT
YOU NEVER GET TO ME.

252
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,440
NOBODY WILL BELIEVE
ANYTHING THAT YOU SAY ANYWAY.

253
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,840
I CAN SEE THAT YOU
HANG FOR KILLING VICTOR.

254
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,310
NO DAMN IT, I'M WARNING YOU.

255
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,450
NO MATTER WHO YOU PUT AROUND
YOU, OR HOW MANY PRECAUTIONS YOU

256
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,790
TAKE, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

257
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,770
I COULD GET TO YOU
WHEREVER AND WHENEVER I WANT.

258
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,570
AND I SHALL ENJOY DOING IT.

259
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,020
OKAY, NOW.

260
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,720
WHAT DOES R2D2 THINK?

261
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
STONE RAT.

262
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,800
DISHES.

263
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,440
GREAT, OKAY SO
HOW DID THEY DO IT?

264
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
I BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 10 YEARS DAN.

265
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,840
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING BUT
WE CANNOT FIND ANYTHING MAN, I

266
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,480
DON'T KNOW, WHAT THE HELL.

267
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,910
VICTOR WAS HERE, HAD A
SEIZURE FELL THIS WAY.

268
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,720
THEN WHATEVER IT WAS EXPLODED
UNDER HIM OR AROUND HIM.

269
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,650
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

270
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,990
IT DOES IF HE HAD A
PACEMAKER MADE OF PLASTIQUE.

271
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,560
GENTLEMAN WHAT YOU GOT?

272
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,790
WELL UH, MADONNA AND I HAVE
ANALYZED THREE QUARTERS OF THIS

273
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,160
MATERIAL AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO TRACE OF ANY KIND OF

274
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,900
EXPLOSIVE OR FRAGMENTS FROM A
DETONATING DEVICE, NOTHING.

275
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,770
WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF HEADWAY.

276
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,900
DANNY, I WANT TO TALK WITH
YOU OUTSIDE JUST FOR A MINUTE

277
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,570
PLEASE.

278
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,040
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
DIFFUSING EXPLOSIVES FOR METRO

279
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,640
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW
THAT DON'T YOU?

280
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,210
KEEPS ME IN PRACTICE.

281
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,350
SOME PEOPLE PLAY GOLF,
SOME PEOPLE PLAY TENNIS.

282
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,950
I DIFFUSE HIGH EXPLOSIVES.

283
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME NOW DANNY
AND WE DON'T DO THE DIRTY WORK

284
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,550
WE LEAVE THAT FOR METRO.

285
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,260
I'M NOT AN AFTER
THE FACT KIND OF GUY.

286
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,790
C'MON, YOU'VE PAID YOUR DUES.

287
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,930
FBI IS A PROMOTION.

288
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,560
IT MAY NOT FEEL
LIKE IT BUT IT IS ONE.

289
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,130
SO I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE ANYMORE UNNECESSARY

290
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,700
CHANCES.

291
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,200
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

292
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,770
I KNOW THAT.

293
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,640
BUT I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT
YOU DAN WITH MANDY AND NOW WITH

294
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,410

JESUS...

296
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,580
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY TOO BAD
MORE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY

297
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,820
MARITAL PROBLEMS.

298
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,620
THIS IS ME TALKING TO YOU.

299
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,220
IT'S COMING FROM ME.

300
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,990
I'M FINE.

301
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,560
IN EVERY WAY I'M FINE.

302
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,230
I'M NOT LOSING IT.

303
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,470
JUST LET METRO DO THEIR WORK.

SPEAKING OF WHICH I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT IN HIS OFFICE.

WAY TO GO STU.

320
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,360
MAN'S NOT DEAD A DAY AND THEY'RE
ALREADY MOVING SOMEONE ELSE INTO

321
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,400
HIS OFFICE.

322
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,200
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

323
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,370
HE WAS DEAD A DAY.

324
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,640
THEY SHOULD USE THE VULTURE.

325
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,840
HI JAMES.

326
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,580

I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
OTHER DAY, I DIDN'T THINK.

332
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,270
I'M SORRY.

333

SORRY I'M LATE, SORRY.

341
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,620
I HOPE IT IS BECAUSE MADONNA HAS
COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW.

342
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,990
NO, NO SHE'S RECHARGING.

343
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,390
WE'RE STILL PICKING UP PIECES OF
THE SENATOR.

344
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,690
THE GUYS HAVE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

345
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,530
WE'RE TALKING
PIECES, PIECES THIS SMALL.

346
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,500
I MEAN WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HIS YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,810
MR. O'NEILL.

352
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,680
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

353
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,050
I FOUND OUT THIS MORNING BUT
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD COME.

354
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,620
I WOULD HAVE COME
WITH A BLOWTORCH.

355
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,500
SENATOR TRAVERES IS
HEADING UP THIS INVESTIGATION.

356
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,460
THAT'S RIGHT.

357
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,170

THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN UP ON

358
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,170
THE HILL ABOUT THIS.

359
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,100
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SCARED.

360
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,400
THERE ARE LOTS OF RUMORS.

361
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,140
YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF RUMORS.

362
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,810
HAVE YOU READ THE
REPORT SENATOR?

363
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,410
YES, I HAVE READ THE REPORT
EXCEPT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

364
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,210
HELL IT MEANS.

365
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,010
I MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF A

366
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,480
DETONATING DEVICE.

367
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,420
WELL...

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,690
NO, NO, LET ME FIELD THIS ONE.

369
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,000
LOOK MR. O'NEILL I KNOW YOU
HAVE A PERSONAL PROBLEM WITH ME.

370
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,430
YOU AND MY WIFE?

371
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,330
THAT'S NOT A PERSONAL PROBLEM.

372
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
EVERYBODY IN THE GOD
DAMN CITY KNOWS ABOUT IT.

373
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,400
IT'S A VERY PUBLIC PROBLEM.

374
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,670
LOOK, I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR
DELIVERING ANSWERS TO CONGRESS.

375
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,870
UNTIL I HAVE THEM, I AM GOING TO
BE WATCHING EVERY STEP OF THIS

376
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,010
INVESTIGATION VERY CAREFULLY.

377
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,150
WELL THEN WATCH VERY CAREFULLY
AS I STEP OUT THE DOOR.

378
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,550
O'NEILL THIS IS BUSINESS.

379
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,250
NOW YOU BETTER LEARN TO SEPARATE
IT FROM THE OTHER PROBLEMS IN

380
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,460
YOUR LIFE.

381
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,690
YOU TOUCH MY WIFE AGAIN, I'LL
SEPARATE YOU FROM THE REST OF

382
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,700
YOUR LIFE.

383
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,570
YOU UNDERSTAND?

384
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,180
IF MR. O'NEILL IS THE BEST
EXPLOSIVE EXPERT WE HAVE

385
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,140
THE FBI IS IN PRETTY SAD SHAPE.

386
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,480
DAN IS THE BEST.

387
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,710
AND SHANE IS A TOP
MATERIAL ANALYST.

388
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,590
AND I'M NOT MARRIED SO I'VE
GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, SIR.

389
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,650
WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THAT SITE
AGAIN AND WE'LL KEEP ON GOING

390
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,090
OVER IT UNTIL WE
FIGURE THIS OUT.

391
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,060
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU VERY SOON.

392
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,040
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

393
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,920
I THINK TAKING VACATION
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.

394
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,350
YOU'RE RIGHT.

395
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,920
GETTING AWAY WOULD BE GOOD.

396
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,560
WHO'S DRIVING?

397
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,690

HE WORKS FOR YOU
AND HE WAS CAUGHT.

452
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,140
YOU DON'T KNOW MY MEN.

453
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,410
THEY HAVE A CODE OF SILENCE.

454
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY LOYAL.

455
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,280
OH THAT'S TOUCHING.

456
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,320

459
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,760
KILL HIM.

460
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,150
LET ME GUESS, YOU
COULDN'T FIND A DEVICE.

461
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,960
THIS IS GETTING PRETTY HAIRY.

462
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,000
YOU ARE HERE FOR THE ARRAIGNMENT
THE ALLEGED BOMBER WHO KILLED

WHAT AM I FEELING?

465
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,870
I FEEL RELIEF THAT
JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.

466
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,340
ARE YOU STILL
PLANNING ON OPENING THE D.C.

467
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,840
KIDS CENTER ON SATURDAY?

468
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,010
ABSOLUTELY, THAT IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,140
THERE ARE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
KIDS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

470
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,580
WE'VE RAISED $1000 OF DOLLARS.

471
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,980
I WOULDN'T DISAPPOINT THEM.

472
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,710
AREN'T YOU SCARED?

473
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,710
NO, I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO BE SCARED.

474
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,330
O'NEILL.

475
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,460
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

476
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,260

478
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,800
FOR FRIENDS.

479
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,800
THE DRIVER IS STILL NOT TALKING.

480
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,300
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT FRANK.

481
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,440
THAT STILL DOESN'T TELL US WHAT
HE USED OR WHO IS BEHIND IT.

482
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,710
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS LIKE
CONSPIRACY THEORIES BUT IT IS

483
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,480
POSSIBLE HE ACTED
ALONE ISN'T IT?

484
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,850
UNLIKELY.

485
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,010
ESPECIALLY IF HE'S NOT TALKING.

486
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,780
THAT MEANS HE'S SCARED.

487
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,320
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

488
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,990
I'M THINKING I

489
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,650
YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

490
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,890
NO.

491
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,820
THAT'S GOOD.

492
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,900

I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,950
THERE WAS NOTHING.

525
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,580
NO DEVICE.

526
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,980
SHE WAS THE DEVICE.

527
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,360
SHE TOOK A DRINK OF
WATER, STARTED TO SPEAK.

528
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,590
STOOD UP AND THEN
STARTED CONVULSING.

529
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,060
THAT'S IT?

530
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,660

531
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,260

00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,680
DO YOU THINK IT
COULD BE THE WATER?

538
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,620
WHOA.

539
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,390
OR IT WASN'T THE WATER AT ALL.

540
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,860

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,470

548
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,710
THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COME

549
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,480
JUST A WEEK BEFORE THE
REVOTE AN THE ANTIARMS BILL.

550
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,650
THE SECRET SERVICE WILL
KEEP EXTRA SECURITY AROUND THE

551
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,320
PRESIDENT UNTIL THEY FIND OUT
WHO IS ACTUALLY BEHIND THESE

552
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,660
BOMBINGS.

553
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,130
SUZY BRYANT CHANNEL 7 NEWS.

554
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,260

555
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,960
AND I PUT THE
WINGS AND GO WHONG.

556
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,770
WE'RE HERE AT THE FEDERAL
COURT HOUSE WHERE A MYSTERIOUS

557
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,970
EXPLOSION HAS LEFT 3
PEOPLE DEAD AND 10 WOUNDED.

558
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,070
 WHO IS IT?

559
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,280
IT'S ME.

560
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,220
YOU REALIZE OF COURSE YOU'RE
DEFYING YOUR OWN COURT ORDER.

561
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,990
I HEARD WHAT
HAPPENED, ARE YOU OKAY?

562
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,630
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

563

YOU WANT TO COME IN?

564
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,170
I PROMISE I WON'T TURN YOU IN.

565
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,650
SOME OF THE SENATORS HAVE
HIRED THEIR OWN BODY GUARDS.

566
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
THE NATIONAL GUARD IS ON ALERT.

567
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,890
OPINION POLLS ARE RUNNING 3:1
IN FAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.

568
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.

569
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,000
THERE IS A CHART IN USA TODAY.

570
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,500
YOU WANT A DRINK?

571
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,270
NO, THANKS.

572
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,480
NICE PLACE HUH?

573
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,990
THERE IS A CHAIR
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE.

574
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,020
I'M SORRY IT'S A MESS.

575
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,460
IT'S THE MAID'S YEAR OFF.

576
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,100
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FIRST.

577
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,340
OH GOD, SHE LOOKED LIKE YOU.

578
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,550
TESS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

579
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,820
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

580
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,560
TESS YOU'RE MY WIFE.

581
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,100
I NEED YOU

582
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,500
I NEED TO HOLD YOU.

583
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,570
I ACHE FOR YOU.

584
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,940
WHY DID YOU COME?

585
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,910
WHAT IS IT?

586
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,470
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FEELING?

587
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,370
WE BOTH HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE SAME PAIN.

588
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,640
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

589
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,280
TERRY...

590
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,120
I'M NOT AS GOOD AT
THIS AS YOU ARE.

591
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,760
WELL YOU CAN SIT HERE, GET DRUNK
AND FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF,

592
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,660
THAT'S FINE.

593
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,300
NO ONE BUT YOU IS BLAMING YOU.

594
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,180
GAME!

595
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,650
REMATCH NEXT WEEK?

596
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,850
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

597
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,000
GOOD GAME FRANK.

598
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,300
HOW THE HELL DID
YOU GET IN HERE?

599
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,570
I WALKED.

600
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,570
NOW THERE IS A MATTER OF
MY 10 MILLION DOLLARS.

601
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,480
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

602
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,380
WHAT MONEY?

603
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,150
MUST THIS BORING GAME GO ON?

604
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,250
FIRST, VICTOR, THEN
THYME, AND NOW YOU.

605
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,690
THEY SAY DEATH
ALWAYS COMES IN THREES.

606
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,830
ARE YOU FAMILIAR FRANK
WITH THE ROAD TO HELL.

607
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,870
AND PLEASE DON'T THINK ABOUT
GOING PUBLIC BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE

608
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,500
A SLIGHT DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING
A 50 MILLION DOLLAR PROFIT

609
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,400
STEMMING FROM AND ANTIARMS DEAL
THAT YOU AND THE OTHERS PUSHED

610
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,370
THROUGH CONGRESS.

611
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,010
I DON'T THINK YOU'D GIVE UP YOUR
SEAT IN THE SENATE FOR 40 YEARS

612
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,010
IN PRISON.

613
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

614
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,380
I SIGNED ON BECAUSE IT
WAS A HIGH PROFILE BILL.

615
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,590
I DIDN'T INTEND TO GET
INVOLVED WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF.

616
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,430
SOMEONE HAS GOT MY MONEY
FRANK, AND YOU'D BETTER FIND IT.

617
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,730
OTHERWISE, I'M GOING
TO BLOW YOU WIDE OPEN.

618
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,870
QUITE LITERALLY.

619
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,820
THANKS.

620
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,850
EXCUSE ME.

621
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,130
GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMAN.

622
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,160
WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

623
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,000
WELL, I SHOULD HAVE TEST
RESULTS BY THE END OF THE DAY.

624
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,540
YOU KNOW IF IT IS SOME KIND OF
FACSIMILE OF WATER THEN THEY CAN

625
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,910
PUT IT ANYWHERE.

626
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,940
WHAT DID YOU GET FROM YOUR...

627
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,980
SHANE PLEASE, WILL YOU
TURN OFF YOUR ROBOT.

628
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,420
I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN LOST IN SPACE.

629
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,190
WHAT DID YOU GET
FROM YOUR BRIEFING.

630
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,160
WELL IT'S REALLY VERY
INTERESTING BOTH SENATOR THYME

631
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,690
AND SENATOR VICTOR SPONSORED THE
MIDEAST ANTIARMS BILL WHICH IS

632
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,130
COMING UP FOR A REVOTE.

633
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,030
WHAT?

634
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,400
TRYING TO SCARE THE
SENATE INTO A VETO?

635
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,630
MAYBE.

636
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,440
BUT HERE I THINK IS
THE INTERESTING PART.

637
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,740
THERE IS ONE SENATOR LEFT WHO
SPONSORED THAT BILL WITH THEM.

638
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,610
WHO'S THAT?

639
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,860
GOD MN IT.

640
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,190
DAN...

641
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,490
DAN...

642
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,090
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

643
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,030
LOOK IT THEY'RE PISSED BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY

644
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,000
ANSWERS.

645
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,460
HE IS YOUR ANSWER.

646
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,130
TELL TRAVERES TO
STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

647
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,460
SO WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?

648
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,500
YOU GOING TO COME?

649
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,600
YOU SAID YOU WOULD.

650
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,400
I'D LIKE YOU TO.

651
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,240
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.

652
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,340
WHY, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

653
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,980
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M FEELING HERE.

654
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,510
NICE SECURITY PAL.

655
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,020
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

656
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,420
NO, NO, NO IT'S NOT OKAY.

657
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,020
YOU'RE A TARGET.

658
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,430
LISTEN YOU PRICK.

659
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,330
LISTEN TO ME, ANYONE WITH HALF A
BRAIN AND A GUN COULD WALK RIGHT

660
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,130
STOP IT.

661
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,430
COME HOME WITH ME.

662
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,140
I DON'T NEED YOU TELLING
ME WHO I AM SAFE WITH.

663
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,110
TERRY, PLEASE,
COME HOME WITH ME.

664
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,980
TERRY!

665
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,710
O'NEILL YOU ARE ALREADY IN
THIS DEEP ENOUGH, C'MON.

666
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,050
GENTLEMAN, WHY DON'T YOU
ESCORT MR. O'NEILL OUT.

667
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,620
I DUG AS MUCH AS I COULD, IF I
HADN'T BEEN SO BUSY, I WOULD

668
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,590
HAVE GOTTEN THIS TO YOU SOONER.

669
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,290
FRANK TRAVERES IS A
REGULAR BOY SCOUT.

670
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,490
HIS TAX RETURNS ARE IN ORDER.

671
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,730
HE OWES FAVORS TO A FEW
PEOPLE, BUT THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL.

672
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,830
YOU SURE THERE IS
NOTHING IN HERE.

673
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,170
NOTHING THAT I COULD FIND.

674
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,640
WHERE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN
WHEN YOU NEED ONE HUH?

675
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,980
FEEL FREE TO PERUSE THE GOODS.

676
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,320
IT SAYS HE IS ONLY
CLAIMING 122,000 A YEAR.

677
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,190
WELL THAT'S ALL HE MAKES ON
SALARY PLUS A FEW SPEAKING FEES.

678
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,690
THE MAN HAS A CAMPAIGN
HE IS STILL PAYING OFF.

679
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,860
HOW'S HE PAYING FOR THAT HOUSE.

680
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,130
HE DIDN'T PAY THAT MUCH
FOR IT, IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

681
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,660
HE GOT A GOOD DEAL.

682
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,900
WHAT ABOUT THE INSIDE.

683
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,230
I MEAN THERE IS A LOT
OF FROO-FROO THERE.

684
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,670
WELL THERE WERE
SOME REPAIR WORK.

685
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,070
NO, NO I'M TALKING ABOUT
MARBLE COLUMNS, HARDWOOD FLOORS.

686
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,940
HE'S STILL PAYING
A FEW THINGS OFF.

687
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,810
MARION.

688
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,580
ANY GUY WHO MAKES $130,000 A
YEAR DOESN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

689
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,610
WHAT YOU THINK THIS GUY IS
STUPID ENOUGH TO FLAUNT HIS

690
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,720
MONEY?

691
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,720
HE IS FROM MIAMI.

692
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,290
YOU'RE RIGHT, LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

693
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,520
BIG DATE?

694
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,060
BIG I DON'T KNOW YET, I JUST
FIGURED I COULDN'T WAIT AROUND

00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,960
FOR YOUR FOREVER.

696
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,500
YOU'RE CRUSHING ME,
YOU'RE CRUSHING ME.

697
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,870
YOU'RE THE BEST.

698
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,540
I KNOW.

699
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,840
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

700
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,010
GOOD LUCK SHERLOCK.

701
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,060

702
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,630

SECURITY OKAY SO I DON'T GET

THANKS BYE.

710
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,670
WATCH THIS.

711
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,680
ALL RIGHT.

712
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,790
C'MON, C'MON IT
ONLY TAKES 30 SECONDS.

713
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,020
SO WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

714
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,550
IT'S UH, A WEIRD HYBRID COMBO OF
LIQUID EXPLOSIVES THAT HAVE BEEN

715
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,790
PUT THROUGH A PROCESS I
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

716
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,060
ACTIVATED, IT'S LIKE A
COMBINATION OF NITRO, NAPALM,

717
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,230
HYDROGEN.

718
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,430
IT'S COMPLICATED.

719
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,330
IT IS...

720
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

721
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,440
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACTIVATED, HOW?

722
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,510
WHEN YOU DRINK IT, IT'S
LIVE RIGHT WHAT THE HELL.

723
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,950
BUT IN THE STOMACH
IT BECOMES A DEVICE.

724
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,350
THEN IT HIT ME.

725
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,480
IT'S ACID.

726
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,050
STOMACH ACID.

727
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,250
YEAH, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS
STOMACH ACID BUT I DIDN'T HAVE

728
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,850
ANY.

729
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,460
SO WHAT YOU GOT IN THERE?

730
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,130
ORANGE JUICE.

731
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,630
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT.

732
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,730
AND IT WORKS WITH
BORIC ACID AS WELL.

733
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,930
WELL HOW DO WE DIFFUSE THIS?

734
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,800
ROLAIDS?

735
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,770
THAT'S NOT THAT FAR FROM RIGHT.

736
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:09,000
A CRATER OF ANTACIDS,
ALKA-SELTZER, ANYTHING ALKALINE

737
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,370
WILL NEUTRALIZE THE ACID.

738
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,080
NO ONE IS SAFE.

739
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,350
TRAVERES, HE IS OPENING
THE KIDS CENTER TODAY.

740
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,450
I SAW TERRY GET IN HIS LIMO.

741
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,250
 HI, WELCOME TO THE
OPENING OF THE DC KID'S CENTER.

742
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,480
THE DC KID'S CENTER IS A
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.

743
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,150
IT WAS FOUNDED TO ASSIST IN
THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING...

744
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,920
HI.

745
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,920
HELLO.

746
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,560
 WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR
CENTER AND WE'RE VERY GLAD TO

00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,000
WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY...

748
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,000
 WE WERE ESTABLISHED IN
1983 TO HELP EASE THE PLIGHT OF

749
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,170
UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

750
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,910
WE ARE FUNDED SOLELY THROUGH THE
GENEROUS SUPPORT OF INDIVIDUALS

751
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,110
ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF?

752
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,580
 SUCH AS SENATOR TRAVERES.

753
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:24,380
YES, BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE
INTRODUCING ME TO PEOPLE LIKE

754
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,950
WE'RE A COUPLE.

755
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,950
WISHFUL THINKING.

756
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,520
LOOK FRANK, I.

757
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,350
WHAT?

758
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,990
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

759
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,620
WE JUST NEED TO TALK.

760
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,830
OKAY LET'S TALK, I LOVE TO TALK.

761
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,360
THAT'S WHY I GOT INTO POLITICS.

762
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,030
EXCUSE ME SENATOR,
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

763
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,060
OH, OKAY, BACK IN A MOMENT.

764
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO THE MAN WHO MADE THIS ALL

765
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,800
POSSIBLE, SENATOR
FRANK TRAVERES.

766
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,340
I THANK YOU, THANK YOU
ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

767
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,010
GET ON YOUR RADIO
OFFICER, WE HAVE A BOMB THREAT.

768
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,280
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CLEAR THE AREA.

769
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,280
IT'S DANGEROUS, GIMME YOUR ID.

770
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,190
STEP AWAY FROM THE COOLER, IT'S
OKAY.

771
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,430
DO NOT LET ANYBODY
DRINK FROM THESE COOLERS.

772
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,230
HE SAYS THERE IS A BOMB.

773
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,130
A BOMB?

774
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,600
OH MY GOD!

775
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,770
WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM
SENATOR, WE GOT TO GET YOU OUT

776
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,440
OF HERE.

777
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,880
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN
THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC.

778
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,140
WE ARE HAVING A
SECURITY PROBLEM.

779
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,310
YOU ARE IN ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER.

780
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,950
PLEASE REMAIN CALM AND EVACUATE
THE PREMISES IN AN ORDERLY

781
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,120
FASHION.

782
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,090
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN
THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC.

783
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,190
I REPEAT THERE IS
NO REASON TO PANIC.

00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,830
THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC.

785
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,700
TERRY, TERRY!

786
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,430
DON'T DRINK THE WATER!

787
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,900
DON'T DRINK THAT!

788
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,470
DID YOU DRINK THAT?

789
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,640
NO, WHY.

790
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,340
THE EXPLOSIVES
WERE IN THE WATER.

791
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,780
WE FOUND OUT THIS MORNING.

792
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,480
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

793
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,920
DANNY NO.

794
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,580
WE ANALYZED IT.

795
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,150
IT'S JUST WATER.

796
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,120
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU CAUSED
THIS WHOLE GOD DAMN THING AND

797
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,990
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG HERE.

798
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,060
MIKAIL!

799
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,960
IT'S TOO LATE.

800
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,530
NO, WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER.

801
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,200
HE'LL GET THE MESSAGE.

802
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,470
I'LL KILL THEM ALL..

803
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,420
YOU BASTARD. I WILL SHOW
YOU, YOU BASTARD

804
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,290
- GET BACK!
YOU WILL SEE. YOU ARE DEAD.

805
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,800
SHANE IT'S IN THE FOUNTAIN, THIS
GUY IS GOING TO BLOW!

806
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,830
I GOT YOU DAN, I'M COMING.

807
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
WE'VE GOT 10 SECONDS.

808
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,310
WHAT!

809
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,010
WE'VE GOT TO GET
HIM OUT OF HERE!

810
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:58,320
LET ME ASK YOU THIS
BEFORE I CUT YOUR BALLS OFF.

811
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,560
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

812
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,960
HEY, IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

813
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:06,460
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

814
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,000
IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH YOU
SHOULD EVEN BRING THAT UP.

815
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,170
LOOK, I DID EVERYTHING
I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

816
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,440
I GOT YOU THE VIP PASS.

817
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,810
I GOT ALRED THAT JOB.

818
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:22,210
I CAN'T HELP IT THAT
O'NEILL SHOWED UP.

819
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,550
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LESS
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE.

820
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,890
I KNOW I'M LESS
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

821
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,700
LOOK...

822
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,270
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE
OF WHAT YOU OFFERED ME.

823
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,270
I AM NOT HERE TO DIE.

824
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,860
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY.

825
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,860
OH JESUS.

826
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,710
I WAS THERE TO TELL FRANK I
WOULDN'T SEE HIM ANYMORE.

827
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,410
WHY?

828
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,850
BECAUSE I'M YOU'RE
WIFE, WHY DO YOU THINK?

829
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,570
TERRY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO WAIT OUTSIDE.

830
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,700
I'LL BE DOWN IN 10 MINUTES.

831
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,740
JUST LET US KNOW IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING.

832
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,080
GUESS WHO.

833
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,590
LOOK, I'VE ALERTED MY SECURITY.

834
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,450
I ALSO HAVE A MAN IN THE HOUSE.

835
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,460
YOUR SEXUAL
PREFERENCES DON'T INTEREST ME.

836
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,230
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE KILLED
100S OF INNOCENT PEOPLE TODAY.

837
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,560
WELL ONLY BECAUSE
THEY MATTER TO YOU.

838
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,630
NOW, I'M NOT IN THE
MOOD TO WAIT ANY LONGER.

839
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,800
I HAVE A LIFE YOU KNOW.

840
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,570
YOU KNOW IF YOU KILL ME,
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

841
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,670
NOT TRUE.

842
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,970
I GET TO KILL YOU.

843
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,310
YOU WON'T GET YOUR 10 MILLION.

844
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:58,060
I'M SORRY THE SENATOR CAN'T TALK
RIGHT NOW, HE'S GOT A GUN TO HIS

845
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,590
HEAD.

846
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,760
WELL YOU SHOULD KNOW WHOEVER
YOU ARE THAT THE SENATOR MEANS

847
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,230
NOTHING TO ME.

848
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,300
HMM, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

849
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,900
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE CHILDREN'S CENTER.

850
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,210
DANNY O'NEILL.

851
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:20,580
AND SPEAKING OF YOUR WIFE, SHE
SHOULD BE THERE ANY MINUTE NOW.

852
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,520
SHE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF FRANK'S
CALLS, SO I DID HIM A FAVOR.

853
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,820
ISN'T IT IRONIC?

854
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,220
I ONLY DID IT
BECAUSE I LIKE HIM.

855
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,830
I'M THAT KIND OF GUY.

856
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:45,940
NOW.

857
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,170
ANYMORE GUNS IN THE HOUSE?

858
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,810
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER GUN?

859
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,950
HELLO TERRY, GWEN,
GWEN PUT TERRY ON.

860
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,190
GO ON CAPTAIN GO PLAY.

861
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,290
GWEN PUT TERRY ON GOD DAMN IT.

862
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,100
WHO WAS THAT?

863
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:15,130
JUST SOMEONE TAKING A POLL.

864
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:23,240
THEY WORK FAST,
THEIR LINE IS DEAD.

865
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,350
DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT TERRY?

866
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:26,510
YOU'VE GOT
SECURITY OUTSIDE RIGHT?

867
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,250
YES, I DO.

868
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,180
OKAY.

869
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,180
I WAS JUST GETTING...

870
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,020
SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THINGS WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT?

871
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,860
MOM, IT WASN'T JUST HIM.

872
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,130
NOW YOU BLAME YOURSELF.

873
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,570
DON'T LET HIM DO THAT TO YOU.

874
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,340
YOU NEVER GIVE UP DO YOU?

875
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,780
GOOD EVENING.

876
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,410
BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

877
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,510
MR. TRAVERES ASKED ME
TO COME AND GET YOU.

878
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,120
HE REALLY NEEDS TO SEE YOU.

879
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,680
I DON'T THINK SO, TELL..

880
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,450
IF HE WANTS TO SEE
YOU, YOU SHOULD GO.

881
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,720
LIGHTS.

882
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:55,230
JESUS CHRIST,
THEY'VE HAD YOU STAKED.

883
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,470
YOU'LL NEVER LIVE THROUGH THIS.

884
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,800
YOUR SUCH A PESSIMIST.

885
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,510
IT'S MY UPBRINGING.

886
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,640
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO DRIVE
ALL THE WAY UP HERE BUT JUST

887
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:02,780
TELL HIM...

888
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,910
I'M NOT ASKING TERRY.

889
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,850
LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER!

890
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,620
DON'T SCREAM OR I USE IT.

891
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,170
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

892
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,270
JUST LOOKING THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

893
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:07,770
WHO PAID YOU TO PUSH
THE ARMS DEAL THROUGH?

894
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,310
THE MONEY CAME FROM AN ARMS
SALES TO THE COUNTRIES WE CUT

895
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,680
OFF WITH THE BILL.

896
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,710
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON YOU KNOW.

897
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,650
IT'S AN AMERICAN TRADITION.

898
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,380
VICTOR AND THYMES SET IT UP.

899
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,690
I JUST SIGNED ON AS A CO-SPONSOR
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD RAISE

900
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,360
MY VISIBILITY IN THE
SENATE THAT'S ALL.

901
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,630
YEAH, SURE AND YOU PAID FOR
THIS ENTIRE HOUSE WITH CASH.

902
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,200
NO RECEIPTS.

903
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,570
I SUPPOSE THAT IS AN AMERICAN
TRADITION TOO, HUH FRANK?

904
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,070
YOU'RE NOT DOING WHAT I
THINK YOU'RE DOING ARE YOU?

905
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,210
YOU'RE INSURED RIGHT?

906
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,480
NO, I'M NOT.

907
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,010
C'MON.

908
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,690
 THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ONLY ALL NIGHT TALK SHOW.

909
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,160
IT'S 4:45 AM PEOPLE.

910
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,870
THE SUN WILL BE UP IN ABOUT 20
MINUTES SO IF YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP

911
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,300
YET, YOU MIGHT AS
WELL JUST STAY AWAKE.

912
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,200
LET'S GO BACK TO THE PHONES.

913
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,440

914

SO THIS IS WHERE IT
ALL HAPPENS, HUH FRANK?

923
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,390
ANY CONGRESSIONAL
PAGE BOYS UNDER THE BED?

924
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,760
VASELINE.

925
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,830
OKAY, MOVE.

930
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,440

GO.

934
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,150
I WAS GOING TO GO OUTSIDE AND
HAVE A CIGARETTE, THAT'S ALL.

935
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,630
YOU KNOW THIS HOUSE, I DON'T.

936
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,430
I CAN'T BE TOO HELPFUL
BEING HANDCUFFED HERE.

937
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,880
PLANNING A PARTY?

938
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,010

939
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,550

EVERYONE'S AFFECTION.

01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,960
GO UPSTAIRS AND
HELP ALRED'S MEN.

943
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,670
NO WAY.

944
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,770
YOU PAID ME TO KEEP
AN EYE ON TRAVERES.

945
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,280
THIS IS YOUR FIGHT.

946
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:50,020

LET'S GO FIND THE TWO
MEN IN YOUR LIFE, HUH?

954
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,280

955
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,190
SLOW DOWN.

956
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,530
YOU WANT TO JUMP?

957
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,100
CMERE, CMERE, CMERE.

MONEY INTO THIS HOUSE DIDN'T YOU

961
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,720
HUH?

962

01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,210
YEAH, I'M ABOUT TO
EARN ANOTHER MERIT BADGE.

01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,660
THE POLICE ARE DOWNSTAIRS.

976
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:24,860
THERE IS NO WAY OUT.

977
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,400

WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN I NEEDED YOU?

HONESTLY, PROGRAMMING MADONNA

995
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,920
OH GREAT.

996
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,350

997
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,710
WHY DID YOU GUYS CALL ME HUH?

998
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:50,010
I MEAN YOU KNOW I
DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

1003
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,140
MY BOYFRIEND DID THIS.
