<i>The Academy of Television</i>

00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,357
<i>It's too complicated</i>

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,093
<i>Matt, will you</i>
<i>get in here for God's sake!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,029
<i>Look, Ma, how can I show up?</i>

5
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,632
How can I show up tonight when my
union is boycotting the Emmys?

6
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:39,935
Look, I have to hang up. It's on!
Right now! Right this second!

7
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:41,002
Come on or you're
gonna miss it!

8
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,970
You're gonna miss it!
You're gonna miss it!

9
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:45,092
All right, I gotta go watch.

10
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,407

<i>Powers Boothe.</i>

20
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,630
Oh, my! Damn it!

21
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,832
Damn it! Damn it!

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,404
Oh, look, he even showed up.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,206
What an act of courage.

24
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,175
Yeah, he was really
good in that role.

25
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,242
You make me crazy!

26
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:32,976
If you played someone insane

27
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,411
who killed someone by poisoning
a popular soft drink,

28
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,312
you would have won, too!

29
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,449
Yeah, I wonder if they send you
something for just being nominated.

30
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,983
Of all the pathetic questions!

31
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:47,653
Why are you so damn foul
all of a sudden?

32
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,592
Beth, what?

33
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,895
<i>...and I believe</i>
<i>in the Academy.</i>

34
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,742
We've been going back and forth on
where we've been heading for so long,

35
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:19,414
I was hoping that if you won tonight,
it might mean something for us.

36
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,282
Marriage?

37
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:22,583
Yes.

38
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,132
Look, Beth, the only thing...

39
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,934
Please go fast. I can't take
your dragging this out.

40
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:46,972
The only thing that I have
against our getting married

41
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,507
is that it might not be fair,

42
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:53,177
because you... See, I love acting.
I love it so much.

43
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:57,781
And I'm just gonna stay with
it forever, no matter what.

44
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:02,252
And, you know, it's okay for me
to put up with the ups and downs,

45
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,921
and the money and all of that,

46
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:07,456
but it might not
be fair to you.

47
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:12,060
I'm going to tell you something
that I've never told you before.

48
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:13,661
Your feelings towards your work

49
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:17,297
are one of the things
I love most about you.

50
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,632
Really?

51
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,837
Well, then we have
no problem here.

52
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,637
Marry me.

53
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,115
I was just worried whether
I could make you happy.

54
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,471
Could you get her, honey? I've
got that big reading tomorrow.

55
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:07,972
No.

56
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,107
I have a busy day
tomorrow, too.

57
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,641
I have to borrow
on our Christmas club.

58
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,477
I have to cut out the coupons
from the damn newspaper

59
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,878
so I can go to the store.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,650
Beth. Beth. I don't want you
to worry about money anymore.

61
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,185
Now, I didn't want
to tell you this because

62
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:28,322
it may sound strange
when I say it out loud,

63
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:33,360
but you know me,
I'm not that cocky,

64
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,230
but I'm gonna get
<i>Kiss of the Spider Woman.</i>

65
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:41,734
I mean, it is
between me or Raul,

66
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:45,070
and I've never been so sure.

67
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,071
It's weird.

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,673
I just know it.

69
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:51,941
I do. Huh.

70
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,543
Boy, am I reassured.

71
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,711
What good news.
Isn't that a load off?

72
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:01,480
I've got a baby girl in there
sleeping in a used crib

73
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:06,117
who couldn't care less what a
director named Hector Babenco thinks.

74
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,586
Beth, I'm gonna get this part.

75
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:11,888
Oh, I can't stand this anymore.

76
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:43,818
Hello? <i> Matt, this is Beth.</i>

77
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,553
Oh, Beth, I'm glad you
finally returned my call.

78
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,889
<i>Don't sound so self-righteous
about not returning calls.</i>

79
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,457
What are you so mad about?

80
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,057
<i>I'm talking about you!</i>

81
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,993
<i>Taking your share of the responsibility...
</i> You know, Beth...

82
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,128
Beth, you're not the only
one that can scream!

83
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,531
You know, I can
scream too, you know!

84
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:04,034
You know what? <i> What?</i>

85
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:06,669
I'm being sort of
a gutless wonder here.

86
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,171
I'm arguing back with you
because I'm embarrassed.

87
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,907
I won't be able to take
the kid when I said.

88
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,043
Beth, now listen. Wait a second.
Listen to me.

89
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:17,745
<i>You're taking her.</i>
<i>You're taking her.</i>

90
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,580
<i>You're taking her.</i>
<i>Do you know how long...</i>

91
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:21,081
Beth, I know exactly
how long it's been,

92
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,451
and I feel strange as hell at not
seeing her, but this isn't a choice.

93
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,187
I'm broke. It's a dry
spell in my life.

94
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>That's not my problem.</i>

95
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,789
I know that's not your problem,

96
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,091
but it's no place
for a six-year-old.

97
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:32,891
What can I do?

98
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,393
The only full-time job
I seem to have right now

99
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,661
is not showing how scared I am.

100
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,896
<i>Is that something you're trying
to say particularly well?</i>

101
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:43,633
No, that's not something I tried
to say particularly well.

102
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:46,435
<i>Well, it was very well put.</i>
Well, thanks.

103
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:48,603
<i>But you're still</i>
<i>taking your daughter!</i>

104
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:49,937
<i>And there's no way...</i>

105
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,404
Beth! Hey!

106
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,639
<i>Look, let me tell you what you are.
</i> Beth! Hey, hey!

107
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,476
Never mind! I'll take her!
Bye! <i> What kind of...</i>

108
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:00,746
I must get work.
I will take anything.

109
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:01,546
I must get work!

110
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,850
I must not be embarrassed
by these pep talks to myself!

111
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,952
Popcorn Pictures.

112
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:11,622
The truck is ridiculous.
Get the Lexus. Get the Lexus.

113
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:12,789
It's nuts here today.

114
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,792
Cathy, Matt Hobbs on one.

115
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,228
Hi, this is Cathy.

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,329
Sure I remember you. Sure.

117
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,465
Um, just a minute.
I have another call.

118
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,668
Hey. Hello. How are you?

119
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,436
Hi. Do you know a...

120
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:30,903
Hey, Shannon!

121
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:34,640
Don't ever refer to me or any
of us again as "D" people.

122
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,042
We are Development Executives.

123
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:38,243
There's an easy way
to remember that.

124
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,144
We're what you want to be.
Sorry.

125
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,179
What? Do you know a Matt Hobbs?

126
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:43,647
Matt Hobbs? Matt Hobbs?

127
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,715
It does ring a dull
something or other, uh...

128
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,349
He's the guy Redford
played in <i> The Natural.</i>

129
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,484
No, no, no, that's Roy Hobbs.

130
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,184
There is a Matt Hobbs.

131
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:55,322
If I were you, I would be cautiously
enthusiastic until I figured out who that was.

132
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:59,092
Hi. Sorry. I was just finishing
a script evaluation, Matt.

133
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:02,295
So, um, is everything okay?

134
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:05,531
Good, good.
I haven't seen you since...

135
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,966
The last time we saw...

136
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:11,402
The one time we saw each other.

137
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:15,639
Oh! The night
at the acting school.

138
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:18,108
Sure. Matt, hi.

139
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:22,345
Actually, uh, I do
know of something

140
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:24,447
that's starting in a hurry.

141
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,916
Um, they're auditioning
here today.

142
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,851
I can get you in.

143
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:30,452
No, no. No problem.

144
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:31,886
Um, yeah. I'll see you later.

145
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:35,556
No, no, don't thank me.
You didn't interrupt anything.

146
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,225
This script is beyond awful.

147
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,859
Bye.

148
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,035
Even the title, <i> Little Dick,</i>
means so many things.

149
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,505
Story, story, story, story.

150
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,707
This one you loved, right?

151
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,009
I had some problems.

152
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,309
Like what?

153
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,377
What? It is a little garbagey.

154
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,845
So? It has to be cast right.

155
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:06,281
If Cathy doesn't like it,
we know it's a smash.

156
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,615
Hey.

157
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,085
- Popcorn Pictures.
- Please hold.

158
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,786
It's not like
I didn't recommend it.

159
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,789
No, I'm sorry.
He's not available.

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,225
No, I understand, but I
can't interrupt. Really.

161
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,295
If he checks with me, I'll have
him call you as soon as I can.

162
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,929
What did you say
your number was?

163
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:30,134
You know, I wasn't sure you would
remember me, let alone help.

164
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,768
Stop! You're good.

165
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,804
I am doing them a favor
by getting you in.

166
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,406
Well, that's a fresh slant.

167
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:45,745
No, no, you're at the top
of the list. I promise you.

168
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,080
Claire, this is Matt Hobbs.

169
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:50,449
How you doing, Claire?
It's good to meet you.

170
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:52,451
Same here.

171
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:55,520
Please.

172
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:59,223
Hi, I'm George LaForest. I'm
here for the part of Harry.

173
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,191
Okay. Have a seat next to him.

174
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,458
Thanks.

175
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,906
Hey.

176
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,179
Um, this is Matt Hobbs.

177
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:27,714
This is John Earl McAlpine,
our director.

178
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:28,548
Good to meet you.

179
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,417
Burke Adler, our producer.

180
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,651
Okay, fine.

181
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:38,221
So, what have you
been doing with yourself

182
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,321
in the last few years?

183
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:43,091
Look, if you don't mind,
I'm really bad at interviews,

184
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,626
and I'd really prefer
just to read first.

185
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,127
That's the way
you'd like to do it?

186
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes. I see.

187
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,662
Okay, I'll tell you what,
why read at all?

188
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,730
Why don't we just give you the role?
Okay?

189
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:54,566
You want the part?
We don't have to read.

190
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:59,636
No, no, I'm serious. Really.

191
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:02,605
Ah! Very good
in the mini-series.

192
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,640
Yeah, he got an Emmy
nomination for it.

193
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,608
You know,
there are all different ways.

194
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,842
Did you know Bertolucci
never reads actors?

195
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:11,345
Just looks at them, feels around a
little bit and then he decides.

196
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:14,081
Doesn't read a word.
Well, I also have a way.

197
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,449
I like to interview first,
then I like to read.

198
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,517
Maybe come back the next
day, do it all over again.

199
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
I'll call people up
the actor's worked with.

200
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,453
I'll check him out
if he's famous,

201
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,154
I'll do an opinion survey
to see if people like him.

202
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:23,455
If he's not famous,
I'll put him on tape,

203
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,924
grab anybody I can find
and show them the tape.

204
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,158
That's the way I like to do it.

205
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,692
I believe in screen tests.

206
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:30,593
I believe in cutting people
out if the dailies are bad.

207
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,995
I believe in replacing people
if the previews aren't there.

208
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:39,034
Because I don't make movies for theaters
that serve cappuccino in the lobby.

209
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:39,968
I make popcorn movies.

210
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,704
You want to know what I like, come
to my house, look at my lamps.

211
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,773
That's what I like. But you're
not gonna find it in my movies.

212
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,375
In my movies,
you'll see what I know,

213
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:49,075
and what I know is detail.

214
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:51,444
And what I don't know, I discover.
I'll tell you something.

215
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,813
Yesterday we were mixing this
last scene in a movie, right?

216
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:57,449
Huge field of windmills. Big windmills.
Now, they blow up.

217
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,350
The propellers come loose.
They slice through the air.

218
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,553
One of them hits this
four-story tank of propane gas.

219
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,688
There's this
humongous explosion.

220
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,356
Now, I'm sitting there
going, "Louder!

221
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,224
"It's gotta be louder,
louder, louder, louder!"

222
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:12,561
They're saying to me, "We can't make it louder.
There's too much distortion."

223
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:13,161
We went louder.

224
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:16,030
See, they discovered a thing, a filter.
I don't know what they did.

225
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,431
But the fact is, we did it.

226
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,167
I don't question. I just do it.

227
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,369
So if you're asking me
can you do it differently,

228
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:25,505
you don't want to talk, you
just want to read, I say...

229
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,174
Ask him, he's the director.

230
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:31,242
Whatever.

231
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:35,212
Okay. Good. Let's go.
Any questions?

232
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,282
They only gave me two pages.

233
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,250
And I really want to
give this my best shot,

234
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:44,219
so if I could read the script
and then come back.

235
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,454
The part works tomorrow.

236
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,624
Okay.

237
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:51,891
Who will I read with?

238
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,259
Right here.

239
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:55,994
I'll play Wendy.

240
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,634
Over there, okay?

241
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:09,672
What? What is it? What are you holding?
What does it say?

242
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,374
They need John for the physical.
They won't wait.

243
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,777
Time for my buns
to have visitors.

244
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,149
All right. Go ahead.

245
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:26,052
Go ahead?
The director just left.

246
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,621
So? He trusts me.

247
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:32,724
Anyway, we're just
doing the first page.

248
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,701
Let's start with "I've
been so..." Just...

249
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,946
You know...

250
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,382
God, I've been so messed up.

251
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:05,552
Maybe all the bad stuff
was in my mind?

252
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:06,619
Right?

253
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,520
"Okay, darling Harry,
here it is.

254
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,421
"If someone were
breaking up with me,

255
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:15,092
"I'd like it short and sweet.
What about you?"

256
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,196
"Incredibly drawn out."

257
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:25,567
"I can't take care of you right now.
What am I, your mother?"

258
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,268
"What am I, your duck?

259
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,636
"You know, we've been
together for two years

260
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,772
"and you act like you're
blowing away some feathers,

261
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:32,839
"so what I'm asking you..."

262
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:34,473
You didn't do the quack.

263
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:34,773
Huh?

264
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:38,676
Stage direction says for him to quack.
You didn't do it.

265
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,711
Over there.

266
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,247
Oh, yeah. But, you know,

267
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:49,585
why would he quack when somebody
is breaking up with him?

268
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:54,021
Well, hopefully
because it's funny.

269
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,522
But this isn't a comedy.

270
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,290
Then we're in a lot of trouble,

271
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,292
'cause they're already
fall-down laughing

272
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:03,796
at the teaser trailer
in 5,235 theaters!

273
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:05,964
Yes, it's a comedy.

274
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,664
Comedy.

275
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,034
I think I need to make
an adjustment here.

276
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,904
No. You know what?
You're not right for this.

277
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,005
But, Martin, I like him.

278
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,207
I want to bring him back
for something else. Okay?

279
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,908
Okay.

280
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,342
Sure.

281
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:25,611
- Thank you.
- Bye.

282
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,213
It was very touching.

283
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,682
Burke wants everybody starting
for the preview. Cathy!

284
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,385
You know, I got all the way to the
car, and I forgot to thank you.

285
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:38,488
Oh, sure, um, how'd it go?

286
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,323
Well, I didn't get it.

287
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:41,623
Strange man.

288
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,258
He did say something about
wanting me back, though.

289
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,694
Well, good. His saver is
he means what he says.

290
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,530
Well, I just wanted
to say thanks.

291
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,065
Let's go. He wants everybody
at the preview early.

292
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,733
I'm coming, I'm coming.

293
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,568
Don't be sad.

294
00:15:58,672 --> 00:15:59,904
No.

295
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,538
No.

296
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,438
So long, Matt.

297
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,641
Oh, that's Matt.
How do you know him?

298
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:06,942
Oh, uh, well,

299
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:10,011
I was, uh, auditing
this acting class and...

300
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:12,179
He filled in
teaching one night.

301
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,015
He did a scene himself,
and he was awesome.

302
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,251
For some reason
he just can't get arrested.

303
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,219
Listen. Just listen to me.

304
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:26,524
<i>It is very important that you
get here exactly on time.</i>

305
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,791
Oh, Beth.

306
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:28,792
<i>Very important, Matt.</i>

307
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:31,394
I'm gonna tell you,
it just makes more sense

308
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:34,096
if you put her on a plane in Georgia.
Hey, you, actor! You!

309
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:36,198
And I'll be right here
to pick her up.

310
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,132
<i>Absolutely not.</i>
You know what I mean?

311
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,334
I'm so lucky to run into somebody I know.
What's your name again?

312
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,303
Excuse me, I'm on the phone. <i> Matt,
don't have two conversations at once.</i>

313
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,072
Hang up, hang up. Excuse me.
I'm on the phone, please.

314
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,040
<i>Matt, listen to me.</i>
I'm sorry, Beth.

315
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,008
Where's my driver? Why do you think?
If I pick her up,

316
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,610
it's going to end up costing
an extra $480. Hang up.

317
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,612
It's senseless. Please, please.
Hang up.

318
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,780
<i>I said no.</i>
Why are you so upset?

319
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,448
You know, it doesn't
have to be like this.

320
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,849
Please. <i> Oh, yes, it does.</i>

321
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,118
Okay, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

322
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,153
Is Jeannie there?

323
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,088
<i>Just be here on time, okay?</i>

324
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,055
Is Jeannie there?

325
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,990
<i>Just be here on time.</i>

326
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,257
Tell her I said hi.

327
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,425
<i>I will. Okay.</i>
All right, so long.

328
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:13,493
What... I got a crisis!

329
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,928
This kid who's supposed to
drive me is 30 minutes late.

330
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,596
Everybody from my office
is gone.

331
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,531
Now, I have a very big
movie opening.

332
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,666
There's a test screening
in the valley in 45 minutes.

333
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,434
Do you have any idea
how important this is?

334
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:24,268
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

335
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,070
Is that what this is all about?
You need a lift?

336
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:28,905
Yes, yes.

337
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:32,475
Okay, I got my car
right over here.

338
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,043
Wait up.

339
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:37,912
This is your car?

340
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,779
Yeah.

341
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:47,919
How late are you?
How late are you?

342
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Were you surfing?
Not just today.

343
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,722
There's no way you're
ever going to make it.

344
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:53,289
You are going to fail!

345
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,057
Listen, listen, I know about this.
You're gonna be a failure!

346
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,860
Look, a guy got shot on the freeway.
Traffic was all tied up.

347
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:02,363
You should leave time
for that kind of thing!

348
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,965
Let's go. You said
you'd give me a lift.

349
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,266
What the hell
are you talking about?

350
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,268
Not in your car. I got my own.

351
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,203
I'll give you $120 to take me.

352
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:13,406
And don't worry.
It'll still be a favor.

353
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,613
What do you need me for?
Don't you drive?

354
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:22,247
Yeah, I drive.

355
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:25,782
I don't like
to look for parking.

356
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:42,798
Keep driving.

357
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,633
She runs the test screenings.
Very smart, very...

358
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:49,237
She's got a real case on me. So far
I've been keeping it in the bank.

359
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,084
Hello. Welcome.

360
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:09,420
The name of the picture you'll
be seeing is <i> Ground Zero.</i>

361
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:13,824
There may be some scratches.
Some of the colors may be off.

362
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:14,958
There are no titles,

363
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,961
and it has not been
finally mixed for sound.

364
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:19,729
And the music is temp.

365
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,130
That means temporary.

366
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,966
So thank you all for coming
and enjoy the show.

367
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:30,905
Come on. Here we go.

368
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,941
Nothing good
that happens tonight

369
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,510
will make feeling the way
I do right now worth it.

370
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,511
Nothing.

371
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:42,415
Please, God, let tonight
give him peace.

372
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,584
Nan, shh! No prayers.

373
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,352
Forgive my manners. I'm Nan.

374
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,320
Have you two met? Yeah.

375
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,362
Good.

376
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,556
- Turn it down!
- Ow!

377
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,092
Lower it! That hurt!

378
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,626
Yeah, I'm divorced, too.

379
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:01,460
Hmm.

380
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,128
Yeah, my daughter's six.

381
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,129
Mine's 11.

382
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:06,164
Oh, 11, yeah.

383
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,866
She's coming out here.
I'm gonna go pick her up.

384
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,666
Oh, good.

385
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,067
I remember how it was for us

386
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,469
when my daughter and I moved
out here from Washington.

387
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,238
Well, she's only gonna
be here for three weeks.

388
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,539
Oh.

389
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:20,341
Washington. Washington?

390
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,976
Boy, that must have been
a big adjustment.

391
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,310
It wasn't that bad.

392
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:27,346
Both places have
a lot in common.

393
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,981
Over-privileged people,

394
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,985
crazed by their fear
of losing their privileges.

395
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,520
Alcoholism.

396
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,454
Addiction.

397
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:39,721
Betrayal.

398
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:45,560
The near total degradation of
what once were grand motives.

399
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,963
The same spiritual
bloodletting.

400
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:53,033
I kind of do miss
the seasons though.

401
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,302
What?

402
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,470
What?

403
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:03,641
So how long has it been since
you've seen your daughter?

404
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:06,710
Oh, a little over two years.

405
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:08,445
Two years?

406
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:13,416
Well, my ex-wife insisted
on moving back to Georgia,

407
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:16,385
and I was in the Philippines
on a mini-series...

408
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:16,918
Oh, please!

409
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,486
It's one thing to be
a son of a bitch.

410
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,921
You don't have to be
a stupid son of a bitch.

411
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:23,423
People move heaven and
earth to see their kids.

412
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:26,259
I don't care if she moved to Pluto.
It's abandonment.

413
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,961
Hey, wait a minute.
We just met.

414
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,863
Oh. I'm sorry.

415
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:59,319
<i>Sorry to bust your chops.</i>

416
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,222
Faster, people. Faster, please!

417
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:06,458
Very good. Who else? Yeah, yeah.

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,826
All right.

419
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,228
All right, we're running behind on Hispanics.
Let's go, people.

420
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,997
Women over 25. Women under 25.
Past 40.

421
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,432
Males under 25. Males over 25.

422
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,267
I just never thought
it would do that well.

423
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:21,868
There were so many holes.

424
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,870
I told everybody it
wasn't gonna do business.

425
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:27,373
Why am I so public
with my opinions?

426
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,440
You might just be right.

427
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:30,875
Not with that score.

428
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,912
Here, here.

429
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:40,582
I got it.

430
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,650
You know,

431
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,920
maybe tonight's the night
I'm losing my entire mind,

432
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:49,515
but weren't you in <i> Platoon?</i>

433
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:52,990
That's incredible.

434
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,758
You know, I was only
in there for a minute.

435
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,729
In the rape scene, moving past Charlie
Sheen when I left the Quonset hut.

436
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,432
I had a great scene,
but it was cut out.

437
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,735
But there was that one long
close-up where you seemed,

438
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:08,970
um, ashamed of yourself,

439
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,738
but still arrogant?

440
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,072
No?

441
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,142
That's exactly
what I was going for.

442
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,344
It was? Yeah.

443
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:23,715
Yeah.

444
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,149
I'll take my...

445
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:26,549
Ooh!

446
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:30,051
Thanks.

447
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,353
You read all those scripts?

448
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:34,321
Beast of burden.

449
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,988
Okay.

450
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:47,198
So what are you?
Totally wonderful or what?

451
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,399
I...

452
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,305
Oh, good night.

453
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:11,086
So how come you haven't said anything?
This is great, right?

454
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,620
No.

455
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:13,554
What no?

456
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:17,157
The definite recommends are way
off for a score this high.

457
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,161
And even for action-adventure,
it's just too low for women.

458
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:22,962
But it was such a good score.

459
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:24,463
I know.

460
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,530
I'm sorry.

461
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,367
And, unfortunately, yesterday's
tracking wasn't...

462
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,970
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:39,141
They just don't seem in the mood
for action-adventure right now.

464
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,342
Whoa.

465
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,813
I think it's so wonderful

466
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:50,083
that you don't worry about
even trying to act strong.

467
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:52,884
Thanks.

468
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,320
Hey, um,

469
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:59,256
you wanna eat
something sometime?

470
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,591
I'm, uh...

471
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:07,862
I'm blushing from head to foot.

472
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,596
Good.

473
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:11,530
I'll call you.

474
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:14,031
Maybe I'll come by
the office tomorrow.

475
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:16,566
Ten, 15 and 20.

476
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,000
Thank you. Yep.

477
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:20,202
You know, I was gonna
offer you this regularly,

478
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:23,138
but I thought
it would humiliate you.

479
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,473
I don't mind
an occasional odd job.

480
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:28,709
But I can't work tomorrow.
I gotta get my kid.

481
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:31,151
All right. Let's go.

482
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:38,250
I gotta look at the cards.
I'll ride back here.

483
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:57,066
I shouldn't be long.

484
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,802
Okay. We'll make your plane.

485
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:27,995
Hi, are you Matt? Uh-huh.

486
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:31,331
I didn't know if we
could wait much longer.

487
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:37,002
She's a real nut on smoking
anywhere near the kid.

488
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:39,270
Just... One...

489
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:42,840
Come on in.

490
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,090
You wait here.

491
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:10,065
Hello.

492
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:12,366
Hi.

493
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:14,301
Did you two meet?

494
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,535
No, not really.

495
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,537
Is she ready?
I have a taxi waiting.

496
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,438
I just have to say
goodbye to her.

497
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,774
You have no idea
how difficult that is.

498
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,611
It's three weeks.

499
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,946
It's not three weeks.

500
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:31,947
Yes, it is.

501
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:33,415
No, it's not.

502
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,749
Yes, it is.

503
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,450
He doesn't know?

504
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:44,457
You're not taking her
for a visit.

505
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,159
You're taking her for a while.

506
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:51,997
Just because you want to go off
with him, doesn't mean I have to...

507
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,898
You're getting the wrong idea.
Oh, I don't think so.

508
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,600
No matter how you put
this, I don't think so!

509
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:57,834
Hey, look, I'm
a United States marshal.

510
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:02,705
I'm here because she didn't show up
yesterday to start serving her time.

511
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,712
I don't have a choice.

512
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:14,047
You don't have a choice.

513
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:19,784
What did she do?

514
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,619
I loved, helped and supported,
in every way possible,

515
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,621
a businessman who committed
the terrible crime

516
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:29,125
of being financially imaginative
with a pension fund.

517
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:35,197
Jeannie, come over here.
I want to talk to you.

518
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,099
Okay, there.

519
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,601
Now listen carefully. Be still.

520
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:45,271
What's the most important
thing in life to know?

521
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,874
No one will ever love me
as much as you do.

522
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:49,541
Good.

523
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,743
Now concentrate
with all your muscles

524
00:28:51,745 --> 00:28:55,246
and remember everything
I'm about to say to you.

525
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:58,582
Don't talk to strangers.
They may be monsters.

526
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:03,119
Take your vitamins so the poison
in the food can't hurt you.

527
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,954
What else now? Teeth.

528
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:06,855
Right! Thank you.

529
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,423
Brush right after you eat

530
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:12,193
or your gums will start to bleed
in your sleep and choke you.

531
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:13,928
Beth, Beth, Beth! Mrs. Hobbs...

532
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,930
What? I'm giving
Jeannie her reminders.

533
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:19,400
Her reminders? You can't say
things like that to a little girl.

534
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:21,635
No, don't. Don't dare.

535
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,236
Don't criticize
the way I mother her

536
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:26,005
or I think I'll start to
scream and never stop!

537
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,006
Mrs. Hobbs. Yes?

538
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:30,376
You know, I've been involved with
this sort of thing for a long time.

539
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:32,845
You're not gonna
criticize me, are you?

540
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:33,478
Not in front of him.

541
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,515
Because all he's done is send
Jeannie these long, stupid letters.

542
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,683
He doesn't even realize
she can't read.

543
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:42,952
He sends letters to
somebody who can't read.

544
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,320
It's almost funny.

545
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:46,855
I thought you'd
read them to her.

546
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:51,358
Oh.

547
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,625
The meter's running. All right.

548
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:55,060
Can I just have
another minute with her?

549
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:58,630
Jeannie, Jeannie,
come here. Come here.

550
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,901
That's a very good outfit
you just picked out.

551
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,069
Mrs. Hobbs.

552
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,683
Hi. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

553
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,559
What have you been telling her?

554
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,699
Okay, love, Mommy's going to help
others who need her for a few years,

555
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,935
and you're going with Daddy,
as I explained.

556
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,639
Look at me. Don't step
in the street alone.

557
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:49,241
You don't want to lose a foot.
Remember the story I told you.

558
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,843
Now if someone ever comes up
and offers you candy,

559
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:54,011
you scream for
the police immediately.

560
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:57,848
Stranger, danger, Jeannie.
Stranger, danger.

561
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:02,786
Beginning now, you
must give less value

562
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:05,221
to your own happiness
and well-being.

563
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:07,223
Then, hopefully,
you will reach a point

564
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:10,559
where you give that
no value whatsoever.

565
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,127
Give her everything.

566
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:14,996
There's no such thing
as spoiling a child.

567
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,031
Even if you have
to steal to do it?

568
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:20,067
You don't really want to
mess with me, do you?

569
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:20,600
No.

570
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:22,702
Come on, Jeannie.
We've got to go.

571
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:23,936
I want to go with you.

572
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,672
Can't, pretty heart. I'm sorry.

573
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:28,674
Not even a compromise?

574
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:32,978
Okay, the compromise will be that
you don't have to ride in back.

575
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,848
What? You can ride up front
with the driver, okay?

576
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,650
Now, remember, Jeannie,
don't talk to strangers.

577
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:42,219
Don't forget to say
your prayers at night.

578
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:44,955
Remember God. He made you.

579
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,288
Can we go, please?

580
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,157
Yeah. To the airport? Yes.

581
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:00,267
Goodbye, sweetness.

582
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:02,902
You think of me!

583
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,240
<i>Tonight, Atlanta's own
Attman's Theater for the Arts</i>

584
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:12,577
<i>presents kids' comedy theater on
Saturday from 1:00 to 5:00...</i>

585
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:23,654
It'll be okay.

586
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,055
I'm your dad, you know,

587
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,524
so it'll be okay.

588
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,227
You and I will make it okay.

589
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:34,862
You ever ridden
in a plane before?

590
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,129
Yes.

591
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:59,685
Don't stare at me.

592
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:04,489
Sorry.

593
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:10,060
I want to put on
my yellow dress.

594
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:15,998
We can't get the yellow dress
'cause it's underneath the plane.

595
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,767
Why don't you run under
there and get it?

596
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,303
It's underneath the plane,
so we can't get it.

597
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,238
I want my yellow dress.

598
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,872
Please! I want my yellow dress!

599
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:27,640
Jeannie, it's impossible.
It's impossible. Please!

600
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,542
Please, I want it! It's underneath the plane.
We can't get it.

601
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,277
I want my yellow dress!

602
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,047
Please, I want my yellow dress!
Jeannie, please.

603
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,815
Please, give it to me!

604
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,283
All right, all right, Jeannie.

605
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,451
Jeannie, listen to me. Give
it to me, give it to me,

606
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,252
give it to me, give it to me!
Jeannie, Jeannie.

607
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,220
Jeannie, it's impossible.
It's underneath the plane.

608
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:47,890
Don't, don't kick the seat.

609
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,359
I want to put on
my yellow dress!

610
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,894
Jeannie. Give me a compromise!

611
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,995
All right, you want
a compromise?

612
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:56,998
As soon as we land,
that's the compromise.

613
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:58,599
Don't hit her!

614
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,969
I didn't hit her.
She hit herself.

615
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,404
Let go, let go, let go!
Jeannie!

616
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:06,406
Let go, let go!

617
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,340
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

618
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,942
<i>the captain has turned on</i>
<i>the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

619
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:12,443
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

620
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:14,778
Jeannie. Jeannie.

621
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,945
Jeannie! Jeannie...

622
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:17,112
Sir, the seat belt sign is on!

623
00:34:17,114 --> 00:34:20,582
Jeannie, please, we have to sit down.
Sir, please.

624
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,084
Jeannie...

625
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:26,620
I want my dress!

626
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:31,691
I have no idea what to do.

627
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,094
God.

628
00:34:50,776 --> 00:34:53,343
Okay, partner.

629
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:55,945
Okay. All right. What?

630
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,581
Where you going now?

631
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:03,784
All right. I'll have you
in bed in a second.

632
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,192
It's cheerier in the daytime.

633
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:23,234
Can you read the sign?

634
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:26,036
The Jeannie part.

635
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,271
Oh, yeah. All right.

636
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:52,024
Where do I sleep?

637
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:55,527
I have a sleeping bag...

638
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,762
Or a bed.

639
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,097
Which do you want?

640
00:36:05,837 --> 00:36:07,303
That.

641
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,304
Okay.

642
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:30,324
Socks off? Okay, in bed.

643
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:44,637
Hug?

644
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,971
Hug?

645
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,916
Let go.

646
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,352
Let go.

647
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,731
<i>Uh, Mr. Adler, I've given</i>
<i>Mr. Vincent another note.</i>

648
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,066
<i>He knows you're holding.</i>

649
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,354
<i>Uh, Mr. Adler,</i>
<i>he's running late,</i>

650
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:44,889
<i>and he asked me</i>
<i>to read you this.</i>

651
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:46,624
<i>"I've gone over</i>
<i>the</i> Ground Zero <i> test scores.</i>

652
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:49,526
<i>"And I think we must..."</i>
<i>He underlines must.</i>

653
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:53,229
<i>"Delay the release of the film until we
see the results of the next preview.</i>

654
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:56,699
<i>"I'm also concerned that the
running time is now 78 minutes.</i>

655
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,901
<i>"I'll speak to you</i>
<i>after the next test."</i>

656
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,470
<i>Sorry. The "sorry" was mine.</i>

657
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,197
Monica?

658
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:24,424
Yeah, is Leslie up yet?

659
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:29,829
Oh, good. I didn't want you to get worried
when you realized I wasn't there.

660
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:31,997
I'm, um...

661
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:34,499
I'm still with that man.

662
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:37,200
Well, I'll tell you
about it later.

663
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:41,170
But it sure is nice
to have wobbly legs again.

664
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:44,773
Yeah, look, today is recycling
day for Leslie at school,

665
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:47,642
so give her some empty cans.

666
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,478
Well, then dump some soda out.

667
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:54,048
Yeah, well, thank you.

668
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:57,517
Yeah. Well, take good care.

669
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:25,276
Oh, I thought you took off
in the middle of the night.

670
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:28,345
No, no, I just
had to call home.

671
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,914
Is that why you're upset?

672
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:32,415
No.

673
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:47,662
How you doing?

674
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:49,463
I'm from next door.

675
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:50,297
Right across the hall.

676
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:53,300
And I've seen you in the
laundry room with your kids.

677
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:55,568
Hello. So... Hello.

678
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,171
Who are you?

679
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,107
I'm Lucy Grizada.

680
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,042
What's your name?

681
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,077
Say "Jeannie."

682
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,714
I need somebody to help me
and her on short notice.

683
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:15,149
You know, I have seen you in
the building with your kids,

684
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,485
and I was hoping you knew someone
that I could leave her with.

685
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:22,155
I've got a new job that starts now.
Do you know anyone?

686
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:24,056
Well, I'm always here.

687
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:26,425
Um, maybe I could do it myself.

688
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:27,826
Great! Great!

689
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,861
We'll work out
a full-time schedule.

690
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,229
Wait!

691
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:41,905
Why don't you go in and
meet Ricky and Essa. Okay?

692
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:44,440
We're gonna make fruit bars.

693
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,844
Why don't you leave her for a
while and then we'll talk?

694
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,646
Sort of a test?

695
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:55,882
No. Just to see
how it works out.

696
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,551
Uh-huh.

697
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:06,057
Birdie.

698
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,958
Please behave.

699
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,362
I don't know what we'll do
if this doesn't work out.

700
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:14,697
So behave, sweetheart.

701
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:16,131
Behave.

702
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:21,635
All right. Thank you.
She'll be fine.

703
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,367
Shoot.

704
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:16,826
I'm sorry I bothered you.

705
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:19,387
Come on, Jeannie. Let's go.

706
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:21,122
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

707
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,824
Oh, wait. Can I have her
just a little while longer?

708
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:27,194
My little boy just fell, and she's
the only one he lets hold him.

709
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:32,199
Your little boy fell. He's
the one that's screaming.

710
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:35,502
Yes, she can stay.

711
00:42:35,504 --> 00:42:37,537
All right, Jeannie.

712
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:38,137
Jeannie.

713
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,306
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay.

714
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,177
Women over 25, under 25.
Count! So go ahead.

715
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,414
So they moved her
up to first class.

716
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:54,283
Don't worry.

717
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:59,687
My daughter used to have fits in
supermarkets when we first moved here.

718
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:01,221
It's all so perfectly normal.

719
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:04,390
Plus, I know a great
psychiatric children's group.

720
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:05,991
No, no, no, no.

721
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:10,428
What breaks your heart
about Jeannie is that...

722
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:14,598
She... She doesn't think
anything can help.

723
00:43:16,134 --> 00:43:17,600
She's...

724
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,471
She's lucky she has a daddy
who cares, believe me.

725
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:26,107
I don't know
if lucky's the word.

726
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:27,474
You know,

727
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:29,809
I'm hoping that she's
asleep when I get home

728
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:32,645
so I don't have
to deal with her.

729
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:36,848
I'm actually afraid
of my own kid.

730
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:40,718
My God.

731
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,254
I've had exactly that feeling
and never said it aloud.

732
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:46,522
Excuse me, Nan. Here are the cards.
Uh, you could...

733
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,423
Oh, never mind.
I'll do it. Thanks.

734
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,591
Very good? Fair?

735
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:55,195
I felt terrible, the way that I blew
up at you when I first met you.

736
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,631
It was really rude. No, please.
No, no, no.

737
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,267
Quickly! Come on! Let's count!

738
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:10,107
I began taking antidepressants when
we moved here from Washington.

739
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:11,708
I had some side effects.

740
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,710
Sleeping 14 hours, no libido,

741
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:16,446
I gained 17 pounds in nine
days, that sort of thing.

742
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,514
So they gave me pills to
deal with the side effects,

743
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:22,417
then pills to deal with the side effects
I was getting from those pills.

744
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:26,521
All this besides the stuff the
nutritionist was giving me.

745
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:29,924
The combination formed
some sort of...

746
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:31,024
Potion.

747
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,926
So I keep telling the truth.
I don't have a choice.

748
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:37,095
That's why I was
so rude to you.

749
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:40,497
It's true.

750
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:42,398
Thanks.

751
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,032
Your doctor says this?

752
00:44:44,034 --> 00:44:46,567
Oh, yes. He's excited.

753
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,101
He's monitoring me
for a while longer

754
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,869
before writing it up
for a medical journal.

755
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,871
Burke's going crazy
waiting for the score.

756
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:55,007
Okay. All right.
Thanks. Coming!

757
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:01,845
So, how are you anyway?

758
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:04,546
Oh, I'm...

759
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:07,347
It's a tough one, huh?

760
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:08,648
Me, too.

761
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:11,950
Hey, Cathy! Come on!

762
00:45:11,952 --> 00:45:14,953
Nan, I didn't say... I can barely hear you.
You're getting fuzzy.

763
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:17,956
We're right here at the office anyway.
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

764
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,525
Stop right here
so I can hear her, please.

765
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:21,192
Nan, you're breaking up.

766
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:23,928
Look, my daughter's home with a baby-sitter
for the first time. I gotta go.

767
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,396
Would you wait
one second, please?

768
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:27,297
I can't hear you.
Back up an inch.

769
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,365
- Keep talking, Nan.
<i>- I said that...</i>

770
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:33,035
I can't hear you. Go forward two inches.
Keep talking, please.

771
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:34,903
Stop right there!
Go back again.

772
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:38,406
Nan, you're fading. There! Right there.
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

773
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:41,008
You checked over
every card yourself?

774
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,209
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

775
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,109
Did we do well
with any group at all?

776
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:47,580
<i>Eleven-year-old boys, but there were
only three of them in the audience.</i>

777
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:49,114
Just three 11-year-olds?

778
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:52,884
<i>Honey, I know</i>
<i>you'll feel better soon.</i>

779
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:54,318
<i>It's only a movie.</i>

780
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,852
Yeah, right. See you.

781
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,920
<i>And I love...</i>

782
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,755
I'm all alone.

783
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,456
At least there's that.

784
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:06,292
I don't wanna go!

785
00:46:06,294 --> 00:46:08,527
Everybody is tired!
You can come back tomorrow.

786
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:12,964
I want to live with them! I
want to live with those people!

787
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:15,032
God, let me live there!

788
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:17,467
Jeannie. Jeannie.

789
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,437
Please, Lucy, don't make me go!

790
00:46:22,972 --> 00:46:24,271
Maybe if she just
stayed tonight.

791
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:27,240
I love it here so much that...

792
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:31,777
Daddy says I can stay.

793
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:39,283
I think it's terrible to
give her what she pleases,

794
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:41,852
especially when
she acts like that.

795
00:46:41,854 --> 00:46:43,119
Terrible! I know, I know.

796
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:46,155
She's gonna think that she
can do whatever she wants.

797
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:47,890
I know.

798
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:54,029
All right, you will see Lucy in the morning.
We're going home.

799
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:55,430
No, I'm not! Stop!

800
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:57,064
What is wrong with you?

801
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:59,699
What's wrong with you?

802
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:02,567
Don't talk back!
Don't talk fresh!

803
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,968
You promised! You promised!

804
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,669
You're on a time-out!

805
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,070
What's that?

806
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:11,607
That is where you stay by
yourself and you be quiet!

807
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,910
Could I please
just say one word?

808
00:47:15,912 --> 00:47:17,011
No!

809
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:18,345
One word!

810
00:47:18,347 --> 00:47:19,713
No!

811
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:30,623
Goodbye, bunny rabbits.

812
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,326
Goodbye, Georgia.

813
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:37,595
Goodbye, new training wheels.

814
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:40,130
Bye-bye, stuffed animals,

815
00:47:40,132 --> 00:47:42,799
especially Doris.

816
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,567
Goodbye, Ronnie's puppy.

817
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,401
And...

818
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:52,639
What's the matter? Are you sad?

819
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:55,308
I don't like that word, please.

820
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,143
Which? Which word?

821
00:47:58,446 --> 00:47:59,745
Sad.

822
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:05,150
You know, you're in here

823
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:07,952
because you made a choice
by the way that you acted.

824
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:10,921
So if you don't like the
way that this worked out,

825
00:48:10,923 --> 00:48:14,357
then next time that
you have to make a choice,

826
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,792
you just think of this.

827
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,160
I don't understand.

828
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,530
Well, I don't either.
I just read it.

829
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,867
All right.

830
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:31,004
Um... Okay.

831
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:37,009
I don't feel like being
alone right now, do you?

832
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:40,945
No.

833
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,347
Okay, let's do this time-out

834
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:46,148
together.

835
00:48:48,152 --> 00:48:49,918
Okay. Okay.

836
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:59,026
What is the sin that we've committed
that we have to eat take-out Thai

837
00:48:59,028 --> 00:48:59,860
every day of our lives?

838
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:03,029
Did you bring chopsticks?

839
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:04,095
Here.

840
00:49:04,097 --> 00:49:05,329
Chopstick.

841
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:07,564
Popcorn Pictures.

842
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,699
Hey. Hey.

843
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:11,767
How you doing? Good.

844
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:12,769
You want some? It's perk.

845
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,602
No, thanks. I brought my own.

846
00:49:13,604 --> 00:49:16,237
Uh, I'm almost finished with this,
if you'd just give me a minute.

847
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,974
No, no, that's fine.
I'll sit over there.

848
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:22,475
You want a script to read?

849
00:49:22,477 --> 00:49:23,108
No. No, thank you.

850
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,977
Will somebody take a minute
to look over my casting list

851
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,012
before Burke gets here?

852
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:34,818
Popcorn Pictures. Please hold.

853
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:43,892
This list isn't
so great, Millie.

854
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:47,562
Well, I wanted to put people on
there we had a shot at getting.

855
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,797
"Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris,

856
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:51,431
"F. Murray Abraham,
Willem Dafoe,

857
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:54,434
"Tommy Lee Jones, John
Malkovich." For an action lead?

858
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:56,068
Does Academy Award stuff
mean anything here?

859
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,104
I mean, could you just take my list
and go down it one name at a time

860
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:01,606
instead of this general lack of...
Okay, okay.

861
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:04,241
Let's play State the Obvious.

862
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:06,076
"Ed Harris." Losing his hair.

863
00:50:06,078 --> 00:50:10,447
"F. Murray Abraham." Has a nose
as long as an Aspen ski-line.

864
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,315
"Jeff Daniels." Beanpole.

865
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:16,686
"Bob Hoskins." Looks fur-bearing
when he takes off his shirt.

866
00:50:16,688 --> 00:50:19,822
"Tommy Lee Jones."
Very unfortunate skin.

867
00:50:19,824 --> 00:50:23,091
"John Malkovich"? What
dermatologist gave you this list?

868
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:24,759
Hey.

869
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:29,096
"James Spader."
Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla.

870
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:32,132
"Christopher Walken."
Weird hair.

871
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:33,466
Where do you put the garbage?

872
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:35,134
"Willem Dafoe." Teeth.

873
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:37,736
"Gary Busey." Teeth again.

874
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:38,436
Teeth again.

875
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:41,572
"James Woods."
Small head, pointy face.

876
00:50:41,574 --> 00:50:44,107
"Raul Julia." Bug eyes.

877
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:45,208
"John Goodman."

878
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,876
Bombed on the big screen.

879
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,777
Bombed on the big screen.

880
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,113
Where do they find
these people?

881
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,682
Did you say something?

882
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,920
Yes. Where did they find you?

883
00:50:59,088 --> 00:50:59,886
What?

884
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:03,322
Yes. You know, I always thought

885
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:07,159
that people in your job had
to have some qualifications.

886
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:10,295
I mean, forget common
decency for a minute. Okay?

887
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:13,498
You don't even know that these
people that you're talking about

888
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,099
are some of
the best guys alive!

889
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:16,533
I don't think all the
yelling is necessary.

890
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:20,904
Yes, it is. And I'm not talking
to you, and I don't like you.

891
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:25,641
You know, I...

892
00:51:25,643 --> 00:51:29,077
You know, I always had
a firm idea about acting.

893
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:30,244
That you just shut up and act.

894
00:51:30,246 --> 00:51:36,783
And I always believed that you forget about
all the crap that you can't control.

895
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:37,950
But, you know...

896
00:51:37,952 --> 00:51:38,884
My God, man!

897
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:42,020
I mean, where did
they find you?

898
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:42,419
I...

899
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:46,389
Okay, okay, okay. All
right, you know, I know.

900
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,290
It's a business.

901
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,959
And nobody ever put
a gun to anybody's head.

902
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:54,361
You know, nobody put it
up there and said,

903
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:56,129
"Okay now, you've gotta act."

904
00:51:56,131 --> 00:52:00,500
But, you know, doesn't somebody in
your job still have to have at least

905
00:52:00,502 --> 00:52:07,773
some dull feeling of respect for people
who really do know what they're doing?

906
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,776
I mean, don't you have
to know something besides

907
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:16,213
how to pose for this picture
of you that nobody's snapping?

908
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:17,781
Hey, why don't you just
mind your own business?

909
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:22,352
Well, because, man, because
you're minding my business!

910
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:24,487
And that's the problem!

911
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:34,195
The hell with this.
I'm really sorry.

912
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:38,199
No, no, no.
Take my seat, please.

913
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:42,135
Don't hit me.

914
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:44,437
I'm not gonna hit you.

915
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:46,672
It's not your fault,

916
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:48,940
this stupidity of yours.

917
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:53,411
You're just a scared little shit
that gets to say he's making movies.

918
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:56,814
And the only thing that
they ever taught you

919
00:52:56,816 --> 00:53:00,584
is that what you really
like doesn't matter.

920
00:53:03,822 --> 00:53:04,654
I didn't mean you.

921
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:07,857
If you didn't,
you sure should have.

922
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,792
I'll take that.

923
00:53:09,794 --> 00:53:11,660
Oh, thank you.

924
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:23,237
What? What is it?

925
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:25,471
I've been...

926
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,709
I just got this feeling,

927
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:33,378
seeing myself talking
to you and...

928
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,981
Like this is the most
important moment of...

929
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:38,215
Ever.

930
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:41,651
Okay, good. What is it?

931
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,988
I've been watching
this company make movies

932
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,257
that cost tens of
millions of dollars.

933
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:52,024
And all the while, I have known

934
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:54,760
about this wonderful script,
which we somehow own,

935
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:56,394
and we could make
for about 14 million.

936
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:59,597
Three million if you can live
without stars or a name director.

937
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,265
That's it?
Send me the coverage.

938
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:05,168
I have sent you coverage
on it nine times!

939
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:08,270
I'm sorry.

940
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:14,108
I swear to you, Burke,
it'll work.

941
00:54:15,478 --> 00:54:18,212
You have never
heard me say that.

942
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:19,346
Oh, really?

943
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:20,547
How about last night's preview?

944
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:24,450
I don't know anything
about action-adventure!

945
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:30,422
Uh, I have no idea
where that came from.

946
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,098
Look, I know that everyone thinks that
I don't have any commercial sense

947
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,101
because of what I said at that
<i>Gremlins</i> preview and all.

948
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:48,038
And you think that I can't
put myself on the line.

949
00:54:49,341 --> 00:54:52,041
Well, if this picture
doesn't work,

950
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:53,608
fire me.

951
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,111
Have me killed if it
doesn't get good reviews.

952
00:54:57,113 --> 00:55:02,316
If this picture doesn't get a 70% definite
recommend from women 49 and under,

953
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,752
I promise to be your sex slave
until they drop ticket prices

954
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:08,821
back to five bucks and start
enforcing the "R" rating.

955
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:10,589
You're selling very excellent.

956
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,824
Very excellent presentation.

957
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,127
You

958
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:19,263
gotta do this for me.

959
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:22,899
I think this movie
could save me.

960
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:25,200
Oh, please.

961
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,869
What's the script?

962
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:33,106
<i>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town.</i>

963
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:34,674
A remake.

964
00:55:35,176 --> 00:55:36,875
Yeah.

965
00:55:37,744 --> 00:55:40,978
I would like
you to look at this.

966
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,446
You're being poopie.

967
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:43,580
Jeannie!

968
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:45,114
Thanks, Lucy.

969
00:55:45,116 --> 00:55:46,882
Say goodbye.

970
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:48,482
Say goodbye.

971
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:50,550
Jeannie, say goodbye.

972
00:55:50,552 --> 00:55:53,686
Why wouldn't you look at
the way I dressed Ricky?

973
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:54,753
I had a real rough day.

974
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:58,957
So I don't want to talk about it.
Just let it sit there.

975
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,762
<i>You have no messages</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

976
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:07,564
What was so rough?

977
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:09,432
Tell me.

978
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,334
Compromise.

979
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,738
Are you sad?

980
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,039
Yes.

981
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:22,207
Now I really need to be quiet.

982
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:30,214
You!

983
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:34,151
I know what will cheer you up.

984
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,781
¶ You are the best.

985
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,816
¶ You can do everything.

986
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:10,820
¶ You can be everything
you want to be.

987
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:13,655
¶ You are a smile.

988
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:15,590
¶ You are a rainbow.

989
00:57:15,592 --> 00:57:19,961
¶ You were created so perfectly.

990
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:22,462
¶ Sometimes we laugh.

991
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:23,996
¶ Sometimes we cry.

992
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:28,800
¶ Sometimes we hurt inside
and don't understand why.

993
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:31,169
¶ We're only human.

994
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:32,570
¶ We make mistakes.

995
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:39,009
¶ Sometimes it seems like only
other people get the breaks.

996
00:57:40,278 --> 00:57:41,677
¶ Hey.

997
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:44,045
¶ You're the best.

998
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:46,180
¶ Don't you worry.

999
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:48,949
¶ You're not your friends,
you're not your mother.

1000
00:57:48,951 --> 00:57:51,518
¶ You're not your father
and you're not your brother.

1001
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,686
¶ Don't let sadness
get you down, just...

1002
00:57:53,688 --> 00:57:55,688
<i>¶ ...and that's the best</i>
<i>anybody can do</i>

1003
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,757
<i>¶ Don't let sadness</i>
<i>get you down ¶</i>

1004
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,459
I'm stupid!

1005
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:03,093
I can't even
remember the words!

1006
00:58:03,095 --> 00:58:07,831
No, no, no, listen to me.
You're not stupid.

1007
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:10,300
I am stupid.

1008
00:58:10,302 --> 00:58:14,170
I can't even remember
the words to some baby song.

1009
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:19,006
Hello?

1010
00:58:19,008 --> 00:58:23,076
Matt, they may let me finally
make a movie I love!

1011
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,944
And I think you're
perfect for it, too.

1012
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:27,845
Who is it?

1013
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:29,713
Me? Well, uh...

1014
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,080
Is it Lucy?

1015
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:32,782
Well, this is great. Okay. I'll come
right over and pick up the script.

1016
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:35,184
<i>No, I'll get</i>
<i>your address from Claire.</i>

1017
00:58:35,186 --> 00:58:36,084
Okay.

1018
00:58:36,086 --> 00:58:37,251
Can I just talk?

1019
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:39,186
If you like,
bring it right on over.

1020
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:40,620
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

1021
00:58:40,622 --> 00:58:42,788
Let me talk!

1022
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,330
We might make it yet, kid.

1023
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:09,212
I let you wear your cape and crown.
Now, come on!

1024
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:12,014
Why can't I stay
just a little while?

1025
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:14,916
Because this is a very
special friend of Daddy's

1026
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,517
and I need the privacy.

1027
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,819
Now, be fair!

1028
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,448
I let you wear that dress!

1029
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,625
Hi, come in.

1030
00:59:26,627 --> 00:59:29,394
I want you to meet my
daughter, Queen Elizabeth.

1031
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:30,128
Boo!

1032
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,395
Jeannie, this is Cathy.

1033
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:33,630
Hi. What a pretty dress.

1034
00:59:33,632 --> 00:59:34,864
Thank you.

1035
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:37,399
Thank you. That's nice.

1036
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:39,768
Are you going to a party?

1037
00:59:41,371 --> 00:59:45,339
Hey, Dad, am I
going to a party?

1038
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:48,208
No, you're going next door.

1039
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:51,411
Jeannie!

1040
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:58,250
Do you remember our compromise?

1041
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:02,354
You're gonna go next door to
Lucy's, and you're gonna play.

1042
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:04,989
And you're gonna
show them this dress.

1043
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,358
And then I'm gonna come
by and get you later,

1044
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,763
and we'll go out and we'll buy you
anything you want for under $17.

1045
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,338
I remember.

1046
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,823
Goodbye.

1047
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,325
I love you very much.

1048
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:48,829
Well, thank you!

1049
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:52,898
Say thank you. Say thanks!

1050
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,332
Thanks.

1051
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:57,568
Now say, "Thanks, Jeannie."

1052
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,037
Thanks, Jeannie.

1053
01:01:04,442 --> 01:01:06,341
Go on inside.

1054
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:14,749
What a little winner, huh?

1055
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:19,987
Thanks.

1056
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:23,456
This is my favorite project.

1057
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:23,722
Good.

1058
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:25,724
And it looks like we're
going ahead with it.

1059
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:30,095
<i>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town,</i> huh?
Oh, it's a remake.

1060
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:32,097
Well, come on.
Well, it's original.

1061
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:34,032
This is a wonderful rewrite.

1062
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:36,067
It's funnier.

1063
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:38,902
And there's a part in it for...

1064
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,537
Yes. Burke says I can
test whoever I want.

1065
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,072
He wasn't even surprised
when I mentioned you.

1066
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,606
So if you could read this now,

1067
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:48,508
and if you like it,
we can make a test deal.

1068
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,110
Okay. Which part?

1069
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:53,979
Longfellow Deeds.

1070
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,283
Mr. Deeds?

1071
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:01,718
Who goes to town, yeah!

1072
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,955
I just can't wait to hear
what you think of it.

1073
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,990
I mean, who are we kidding?

1074
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,992
I'm even having trouble
getting short parts.

1075
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:14,495
I'm gonna say that I love this no
matter what you've done to it.

1076
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,364
Stop being so creepy honest.

1077
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:23,135
I really have an instinct

1078
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:25,436
about you for this.

1079
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:28,871
I'm going home.

1080
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:37,845
Call me when you finish
reading it, or...

1081
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:41,014
You know, just come on over.

1082
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:44,950
For luck.

1083
01:02:44,952 --> 01:02:46,418
For luck.

1084
01:03:46,211 --> 01:03:47,610
Oh!

1085
01:03:48,879 --> 01:03:50,211
I mistimed it.

1086
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:53,714
I wanted you to catch
me fully frontal.

1087
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:02,922
So, the script?

1088
01:04:03,658 --> 01:04:04,390
It's really good.

1089
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:07,459
I get a little nervous thinking
about the opportunity.

1090
01:04:07,461 --> 01:04:09,427
Well, I want to
hear everything.

1091
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,630
Should we go through
it page by page?

1092
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:15,365
Okay.

1093
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,806
If it's okay...

1094
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:27,007
I kind of...

1095
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:30,210
I kind of work on
these things in private.

1096
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:33,779
It's just that it's
a little better for me

1097
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:36,648
if I don't... If I don't...

1098
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:38,682
Okay.

1099
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,396
No, it's okay.
It won't kill me.

1100
01:04:53,398 --> 01:04:57,066
No, no, really, please.
I do understand.

1101
01:04:57,068 --> 01:04:58,600
I'm just not that fragile.

1102
01:04:58,602 --> 01:05:00,668
No, no, no, no.

1103
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:09,042
Let's go. Yeah.

1104
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,657
You look so serious.

1105
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:31,828
I am so serious.

1106
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:36,532
Good.

1107
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:47,509
I get a lot of calls.
I'm a phone person.

1108
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:54,148
<i>Cathy, you were supposed to be
here an hour and five minutes ago.</i>

1109
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,051
<i>Maybe you think a one-month
anniversary is silly. Goodbye.</i>

1110
01:05:58,053 --> 01:06:02,021
<i>You know something? Maybe we
should start seeing other people.</i>

1111
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:03,688
Oh!

1112
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,661
<i>Hey, Cath, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Great news.</i>

1113
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:12,762
<i>Oliver Stone's movie</i>
<i>just fell apart.</i>

1114
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:16,966
<i>He's going crazy. Perfect
timing to send him</i> Deeds. <i> Bye.</i>

1115
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:19,368
<i>Oh, guess who's gay?</i>
<i>Call me, bye.</i>

1116
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,771
Is this the kind of crap
you listen to all day?

1117
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:24,873
Please, we're making love here.

1118
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,113
<i>Daddy?</i>

1119
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:37,884
<i>Daddy? Where is he?</i>
<i>Lucy, you dialed wrong.</i>

1120
01:06:38,253 --> 01:06:41,120
<i>Matt, you left this number.
Are you there?</i>

1121
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,454
<i>Jeannie misses you and is upset</i>

1122
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,088
<i>because you're not here to
watch TV like you promised.</i>

1123
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:48,559
<i>I think all daddies should keep
their promises, Matt. Bye.</i>

1124
01:06:53,698 --> 01:06:55,030
I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:58,132
It's all right.

1126
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:07,140
Is there a name
for what we just had?

1127
01:07:10,845 --> 01:07:12,144
No.

1128
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:21,753
Just tell me what made you rush
over and pick me up at my office

1129
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:24,122
and bring me here at 6:00.

1130
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:29,560
We seem to have this
unspoken agreement,

1131
01:07:29,562 --> 01:07:32,729
not to talk about why we're
together when we're together.

1132
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:37,967
And I don't think it's good to let
that become a pattern for us.

1133
01:07:43,274 --> 01:07:44,806
Come on.

1134
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:48,909
Why did I rush over to see you?

1135
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:51,177
Uh, well...

1136
01:07:52,046 --> 01:07:53,445
Um...

1137
01:07:53,447 --> 01:07:56,815
Well, I had the urge to

1138
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,419
be with someone.

1139
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:03,787
You were the closest.

1140
01:08:07,058 --> 01:08:08,724
What's wrong?

1141
01:08:08,726 --> 01:08:13,161
You're not at all aware that
you've just said something

1142
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:16,230
unattractive?

1143
01:08:16,332 --> 01:08:18,231
I'm sorry if it came
out the wrong way.

1144
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:20,199
I'm not looking for an apology.

1145
01:08:20,201 --> 01:08:20,532
"Closest."

1146
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:23,101
One of the things I'm not
great at is expressing...

1147
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,535
Let's not make this
about your shortcomings.

1148
01:08:24,537 --> 01:08:29,039
I'm sure you've had enough of those
conversations to last you a lifetime.

1149
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:32,008
What I'm trying...
No, I haven't.

1150
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:33,108
No, you haven't what?

1151
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,744
Had conversations
about shortcomings.

1152
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,279
No woman has ever told you

1153
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,216
that you have an almost
barbaric insensitivity?

1154
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:46,486
That you seem to have lapsed
into some final cynicism

1155
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:50,623
where you actually believe that not only
does everyone think the way you do,

1156
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:54,293
but only you have
the courage to express it.

1157
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,999
That you seem horribly certain

1158
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:06,537
that everyone else is sort of
pretending when they talk about love.

1159
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:11,275
Or seem to care for anything
outside their own anus.

1160
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:15,479
No one's ever said that
sort of thing to you?

1161
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:16,713
Yeah, I heard that.

1162
01:09:16,715 --> 01:09:20,717
But I didn't know that's what
you meant by shortcomings.

1163
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,921
If you think this way,
what are you doing here?

1164
01:09:26,257 --> 01:09:28,357
I'm here for the same reason

1165
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:33,528
that 86% of older women
love <i> Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1166
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,864
I would like to believe
that underneath the creature,

1167
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:40,567
there's a sweet, caring guy.

1168
01:09:41,403 --> 01:09:44,003
I sure hope you're wrong.

1169
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,472
No. I'm kidding.

1170
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,740
Come on.
I have to pick up Leslie.

1171
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:51,875
Oh, come on. No.

1172
01:09:51,877 --> 01:09:53,409
Come on!

1173
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:55,910
Stop making me feel bad.

1174
01:09:56,379 --> 01:09:57,911
Okay.

1175
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:18,663
You know, this is awkward,
me driving you around

1176
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:21,799
and then going in to
test for you tomorrow.

1177
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,533
Not really.

1178
01:10:22,535 --> 01:10:26,103
Well, I can't drive you to work
tomorrow and then go right in and test.

1179
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:27,938
It's okay.
I'm coming in late tomorrow.

1180
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,307
I'll get one of the kids
to drive me.

1181
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:32,174
Thank you.

1182
01:10:33,177 --> 01:10:35,977
And, look, if I get
the lead in this movie?

1183
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:36,711
Yeah?

1184
01:10:36,713 --> 01:10:41,115
You have to go back to sitting up
front with me when I drive you.

1185
01:10:51,092 --> 01:10:53,092
Very good!

1186
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:04,269
Hey, Kenny? Yeah, baby.

1187
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:06,004
Did you hear I was in
the hospital last week?

1188
01:11:06,006 --> 01:11:08,306
Matt, should we run lines? Yeah.

1189
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:09,340
For food poisoning.

1190
01:11:09,342 --> 01:11:10,274
Food poisoning?

1191
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:12,743
I thought that I would die.
"What's wrong?"

1192
01:11:12,745 --> 01:11:14,010
Guys, they're ready for you.

1193
01:11:14,012 --> 01:11:16,112
Okay, so, Matt, they're ready.
I went to the hospital.

1194
01:11:16,114 --> 01:11:17,947
Lily, ready for you.

1195
01:11:21,418 --> 01:11:22,283
Is he fabulous?

1196
01:11:22,285 --> 01:11:24,251
Do you always wear your hair...

1197
01:11:24,253 --> 01:11:25,719
Is he out there? Yeah.

1198
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:28,121
They couldn't pump my stomach.

1199
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:30,489
You can't keep... Underneath?

1200
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:32,090
You want more powder
under there?

1201
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,759
If that will be good for
you, it's good for me.

1202
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:37,128
How's that? Good?

1203
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,929
Yeah. Yes.

1204
01:11:38,931 --> 01:11:39,896
Where's Jeannie?

1205
01:11:39,898 --> 01:11:43,132
Jeannie's fine. I'll
never eat there again.

1206
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:44,199
Well, I hope not.

1207
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:46,034
They're all ready for you.
All right.

1208
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:48,169
How many men are testing today?

1209
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,070
You're the only one.

1210
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,174
Well, well, all right.

1211
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:56,942
In that case, tell
them I need more time.

1212
01:11:56,944 --> 01:11:57,776
No, actually, I'm finished.

1213
01:11:57,778 --> 01:12:02,614
No, I mean for me. I want
to focus a little more.

1214
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:03,781
Oh, okay.

1215
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:05,349
Matt? Yeah?

1216
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:10,187
The thing they're
looking for most is sexy.

1217
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:16,058
You know who she was involved
with for a minute or so?

1218
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:16,324
Who?

1219
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:19,060
Hey, hey, hey, uh,
you guys, you know, uh...

1220
01:12:19,062 --> 01:12:20,895
I really need to
be alone right now.

1221
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:24,131
'Cause I need to focus a
little, so if you don't mind.

1222
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:25,031
Is that all right?

1223
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:27,800
- That's fine.
- Thank you.

1224
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:29,668
Focus a little.

1225
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:30,268
Ken.

1226
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,838
Have you seen the pastry truck?
Has that guy been by?

1227
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,039
No, he's always late.

1228
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,274
Let's focus on a Danish.

1229
01:12:40,512 --> 01:12:44,614
I can't remember. You're too pretty.
You're...

1230
01:12:44,616 --> 01:12:46,782
I can't remember.
You're too pretty.

1231
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:50,218
Oh, I told them
I could be a chairman.

1232
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,187
No, that's a lie.
Oh, I tell them...

1233
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:55,088
I told them I'd
tell her the truth.

1234
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:57,857
I told her I'd keep
on being chairman.

1235
01:12:57,859 --> 01:13:02,461
Uh, oh, I told them
I'd keep on being chairman.

1236
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,562
Oh, I told them I'd keep...

1237
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:06,097
I told them that I'd
keep on being chairman.

1238
01:13:06,099 --> 01:13:07,898
You know, you know...

1239
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,701
You know I am chairman.

1240
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:15,003
Sexy, sexy.

1241
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:19,941
Sexy. I am chairman, you know.

1242
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:21,242
Oh.

1243
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,799
- I'm so nervous, Mom.
- It'll be okay.

1244
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:49,001
I forgot everything.

1245
01:13:50,738 --> 01:13:53,105
Get out of my way!

1246
01:13:53,173 --> 01:13:55,239
Don't say it like that!

1247
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:57,274
How should I say it?

1248
01:13:57,643 --> 01:13:59,776
Get out of my way.

1249
01:13:59,778 --> 01:14:02,845
Or, get out of my way!

1250
01:14:02,847 --> 01:14:05,914
Or, get out of my way.

1251
01:14:08,184 --> 01:14:09,583
Wow.

1252
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:18,291
No, I'm doing my name.

1253
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,792
J-E...

1254
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:22,593
Hey, hey!

1255
01:14:22,661 --> 01:14:24,494
Hey, it felt great!

1256
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:25,795
Tell me!

1257
01:14:25,797 --> 01:14:27,062
Great!

1258
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:28,496
Let him finish. God!

1259
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,530
I want to tell him!

1260
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,698
If you wait one minute,
I'll let you.

1261
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,499
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him.

1262
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:37,503
Anyway, the girl I did it with?
She's really good!

1263
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:40,772
And the director, the crew,
we all felt we nailed it.

1264
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:43,708
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him.

1265
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,711
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him ¶

1266
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:47,111
Now?

1267
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:49,413
Uh-huh. Wait'll you
hear this one.

1268
01:14:49,415 --> 01:14:50,247
Yeah.

1269
01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:51,214
Who's next?

1270
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:53,516
Tell them you liked the script.

1271
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:54,783
Excuse me.

1272
01:14:54,785 --> 01:14:58,186
Just be yourself,
honey, but remember to smile.

1273
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:04,792
Some lady asked me to go in a
room and you know make-believe,

1274
01:15:04,794 --> 01:15:07,494
and say stuff like
we were playing a game,

1275
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:08,361
and everybody went "Yeah!"

1276
01:15:08,363 --> 01:15:12,465
And they said they wanted
me to be on television!

1277
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,467
¶ And give me money.

1278
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,635
¶ And have a teacher there.

1279
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,969
¶ And a person to braid my hair.

1280
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:22,139
¶ And color my face
and give me clothes ¶

1281
01:15:22,641 --> 01:15:25,675
They said that they
want you on television?

1282
01:15:25,677 --> 01:15:27,109
Yeah.

1283
01:15:27,111 --> 01:15:27,843
Come here.

1284
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:31,713
Uh, just sit right here
for one second, okay?

1285
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:33,681
¶ And give me money.

1286
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:35,949
¶ And have a teacher there.

1287
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:37,283
Excuse me.

1288
01:15:37,285 --> 01:15:39,652
She auditioned for a TV show?

1289
01:15:39,654 --> 01:15:40,819
Yeah.

1290
01:15:40,821 --> 01:15:41,519
Come here.

1291
01:15:41,521 --> 01:15:43,487
¶ And give me money.

1292
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:44,721
¶ And have a teacher there.

1293
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:48,157
¶ And a person to braid my hair and
color my face and give me... ¶

1294
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,061
Do you actually think you can have my kid
audition for a show without asking me?

1295
01:15:53,063 --> 01:15:53,461
I didn't!

1296
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:57,631
She went for water, and by the time she
got back, they had offered her the part.

1297
01:15:57,633 --> 01:16:00,266
Blame Burke. He was there.

1298
01:16:06,741 --> 01:16:08,874
What's the part, anyway?

1299
01:16:09,877 --> 01:16:10,408
It's, um...

1300
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:15,913
A white kid in a multiracial foster home
with all these kids of varying ages.

1301
01:16:15,915 --> 01:16:17,948
It's not a bad show.

1302
01:16:18,317 --> 01:16:19,949
I can't wait to see the test.

1303
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,450
How did they test her so fast?

1304
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:26,121
No, they offered it to her off the reading.
I meant your test.

1305
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:28,189
Oh.

1306
01:16:32,128 --> 01:16:34,828
Offered off the reading.

1307
01:16:41,436 --> 01:16:43,169
Child actor.

1308
01:16:45,072 --> 01:16:49,040
Just what any kid with problems
needs to straighten out.

1309
01:16:49,108 --> 01:16:51,408
A series of her own.

1310
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:01,951
You'll let me know as
soon as they see my test?

1311
01:17:01,953 --> 01:17:03,419
Right away.

1312
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:05,554
You've got my vote.

1313
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:14,629
- I'm not changing my mind.
- I've thought about this.

1314
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:16,730
I'm doing it.

1315
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,298
Uh-uh.

1316
01:17:21,636 --> 01:17:23,636
Back up a bit.

1317
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:34,379
Do I have to learn to read
to be on television?

1318
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:38,049
You have to learn
to listen to me.

1319
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:42,385
I'm doing it.

1320
01:17:42,387 --> 01:17:44,286
Not if I don't let you.

1321
01:17:45,088 --> 01:17:46,921
That's the law.

1322
01:17:47,957 --> 01:17:49,890
Police law.

1323
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:57,263
All right, just listen to me.

1324
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:58,964
I don't like listening to you!

1325
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:02,300
You talk too much!
Why? Why do you?

1326
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,168
Because I know about this.

1327
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,603
I have worked with kid actors,

1328
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:09,138
and they don't have
that much fun.

1329
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,006
You know,
they're inside all day.

1330
01:18:11,008 --> 01:18:13,475
They don't get to go
to regular schools.

1331
01:18:13,477 --> 01:18:18,580
And they don't play with regular
friends like Ricky and Essa.

1332
01:18:19,015 --> 01:18:19,513
And their parents.

1333
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:24,518
Do you think that I am going to be one
of those parents that sits around

1334
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,919
in one of those little rooms...

1335
01:18:25,921 --> 01:18:27,487
You're cuckoo anyway!

1336
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:29,589
I won't do it!
And I don't care!

1337
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:34,427
Because I'd be
stupid at it anyway!

1338
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,835
Pick it up, Jeannie.

1339
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,937
We don't throw things here.

1340
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:57,915
Take it out of the trash.

1341
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,754
Take it out of the trash.

1342
01:19:10,394 --> 01:19:12,026
Come here.

1343
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,170
Let's work on it.

1344
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:29,809
So when you play a part,
the character is you.

1345
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,945
So anything you think
or feel will be right.

1346
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:35,547
You can't make a mistake.

1347
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:41,785
And once you get that, then you can relax.
You really feel...

1348
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:46,122
I'm really thrilling you
with this, aren't I?

1349
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:50,325
Come on. Let's get off the bed.

1350
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,261
Let's do the scene where
they say "I love you."

1351
01:19:54,063 --> 01:19:56,096
Get off the bed.
Come on over here.

1352
01:19:56,098 --> 01:19:59,165
I don't want to do
that "I love you" again.

1353
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:02,168
Why don't you do that
with poopie Cathy?

1354
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,638
Look. My hair's so pretty.

1355
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:09,708
My hair's so pretty.

1356
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,743
Look, I'm pretty.

1357
01:20:11,745 --> 01:20:12,944
Barbie.

1358
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:19,382
<i>Come on, Deeds.</i>
<i>Tell me about the meeting.</i>

1359
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:23,185
<i>I can't remember.</i>
<i>You're too pretty.</i>

1360
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,819
<i>Oh, all right, darling.</i>

1361
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:29,089
<i>I told them that I would
keep on being chairman.</i>

1362
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:31,091
<i>I know.</i>

1363
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:35,161
<i>Do you always wear your
hair back like this?</i>

1364
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,607
<i>Cut.</i> He's so good!

1365
01:20:50,476 --> 01:20:51,141
Beautiful!

1366
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,810
<i>Great, very good.</i>

1367
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:56,813
<i>Gee, are you good. Oh, thanks.</i>

1368
01:20:57,081 --> 01:20:59,548
Okay, let's have our
creative meeting right here.

1369
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:02,284
Well, I'd sure go to bed with her.
Very fuckable.

1370
01:21:02,286 --> 01:21:03,618
I'd bone her.

1371
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,151
What about him?

1372
01:21:04,153 --> 01:21:07,120
I think he's a very good
to excellent actor.

1373
01:21:07,122 --> 01:21:08,254
Mmm-hmm.

1374
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:09,321
But there's something...

1375
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,389
You wouldn't go
to bed with him.

1376
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:13,290
Well, six years ago, maybe.

1377
01:21:13,292 --> 01:21:15,025
Everything
doesn't boil down to...

1378
01:21:15,027 --> 01:21:17,961
I like that shy thing
he was going for.

1379
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:19,762
He's talented and attractive.

1380
01:21:19,764 --> 01:21:21,965
So you'd go to bed with him?

1381
01:21:21,966 --> 01:21:22,931
He, um,

1382
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:26,701
might be a little
light in that area.

1383
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,874
The man is talented.

1384
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:37,777
Let me stop you before
you embarrass yourself!

1385
01:21:38,179 --> 01:21:42,614
We all can do our little lectures
about what things boil down to.

1386
01:21:42,616 --> 01:21:45,083
Everybody else here was
professional enough to say,

1387
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:48,719
"I'd go to bed with him, I
wouldn't go to bed with him."

1388
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:49,586
You're ducking it.

1389
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:53,990
So let's cut out the acting stuff
and focus on what's important.

1390
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:59,128
You know, we do have some kind of
responsibility to the audience.

1391
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,497
So, you've just seen
the screen test, okay?

1392
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:06,368
Your job aside, would you,
yourself, go to bed with him?

1393
01:22:07,237 --> 01:22:09,370
Would you, Cathy?

1394
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,306
I'm being real now.

1395
01:22:23,084 --> 01:22:24,416
No.

1396
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:29,053
Okay, then we keep looking.

1397
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:35,558
Well, that's
standing up to him.

1398
01:22:49,574 --> 01:22:51,373
I'm fine.

1399
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,541
I'm right outside my office.

1400
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:57,544
Good, give the phone to him.

1401
01:22:57,546 --> 01:22:59,312
Hello, Matt.

1402
01:22:59,981 --> 01:23:01,947
Oh, okay, sure.

1403
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:04,682
Matt?

1404
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:06,683
Matt.

1405
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:07,850
Matt!

1406
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:11,320
Maybe it would be easier
if I just said hi to her?

1407
01:23:11,322 --> 01:23:13,889
Okay, here she is.

1408
01:23:15,192 --> 01:23:16,591
Hi. <i> Hi.</i>

1409
01:23:16,593 --> 01:23:20,394
Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?

1410
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,696
No. No, no, he's right, honey.

1411
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,732
They get somebody
to read it to you.

1412
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,134
Can you put your dad on?

1413
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:32,602
Yes. It's important.

1414
01:23:32,604 --> 01:23:35,738
No, put your dad on first.

1415
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,039
Damn it!

1416
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,306
Rude.

1417
01:23:38,308 --> 01:23:39,607
Hello?

1418
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:42,676
Hi, Matt. Uh-huh.

1419
01:23:42,678 --> 01:23:44,878
A few hours ago.

1420
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,579
They all, uh...

1421
01:23:46,581 --> 01:23:49,615
Everyone liked
your work, but...

1422
01:23:50,517 --> 01:23:55,119
<i>You know, I think they'll</i>
<i>go for a name or something.</i>

1423
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:06,595
You know, I... I could do...

1424
01:24:06,597 --> 01:24:07,929
I can do it with
more humor, if...

1425
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:11,699
<i>No, it's not a matter</i>
<i>of doing it differently.</i>

1426
01:24:11,701 --> 01:24:16,136
<i>They liked what</i>
<i>you did a lot, and...</i>

1427
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:20,973
It's not you.

1428
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:23,575
It's them.

1429
01:24:23,843 --> 01:24:27,744
<i>I want you to know that I
really hung in there for you.</i>

1430
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:28,845
<i>Really. I fought hard.</i>

1431
01:24:28,847 --> 01:24:33,716
Well, gee, Cath, I want to thank you
for giving me a shot, you know?

1432
01:24:33,718 --> 01:24:36,518
<i>No, don't thank me.</i>

1433
01:24:39,089 --> 01:24:42,857
<i>If you feel like getting</i>
<i>together later, or anytime.</i>

1434
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:44,158
Yeah.

1435
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,560
Give me a call, okay?

1436
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:50,596
It sounds like you have
your hands full right now.

1437
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:53,131
Bye.

1438
01:25:11,251 --> 01:25:12,650
Daddy?

1439
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:19,855
Daddy?

1440
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:34,569
Everything's okay.

1441
01:25:34,938 --> 01:25:39,106
I'm sorry. I forgot to put
you back on with Cathy.

1442
01:25:43,712 --> 01:25:45,344
You didn't cry because of that.

1443
01:25:45,346 --> 01:25:48,580
I didn't even want
to talk to her.

1444
01:25:56,957 --> 01:26:00,558
Dad, can I say one thing?

1445
01:26:04,597 --> 01:26:05,896
Yeah.

1446
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:09,065
You've got to make me supper.

1447
01:26:34,725 --> 01:26:39,094
Okay, here we go, kids.
On the set, please.

1448
01:26:39,096 --> 01:26:39,561
Set?

1449
01:26:39,563 --> 01:26:42,530
That pretend living
room right over there.

1450
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:43,665
Set. Bye-bye.

1451
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,365
Wait, wait, Jeannie,
Jeannie, Jeannie.

1452
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,100
Let Daddy give you a big kiss.

1453
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:49,168
No, I have to go to work.

1454
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,169
Is this the set?
That's the set.

1455
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:52,938
Thanks for trusting me.

1456
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,207
I love you, I love you. You're
the world's greatest mom.

1457
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:57,641
I owe you everything.

1458
01:26:57,643 --> 01:26:59,175
Bye, honey.

1459
01:27:00,912 --> 01:27:02,578
You just told me she was sad.

1460
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,614
No, I never said
for you to look sad.

1461
01:27:05,616 --> 01:27:06,915
Okay, okay, wait. No, come on.

1462
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:09,918
Let me figure out how
to tell you what I want.

1463
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,386
I know what you want. What?

1464
01:27:12,388 --> 01:27:14,721
You want that Jackee thing.
Oh, no.

1465
01:27:14,723 --> 01:27:15,988
That very colored thing.

1466
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,989
No, way over the top.

1467
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:18,290
Cop to it. Yes, you do.

1468
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:19,958
A little would be fun.

1469
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,926
Dad!

1470
01:27:22,328 --> 01:27:23,760
Daddy!

1471
01:27:25,663 --> 01:27:28,030
What? What? Come on.

1472
01:27:29,233 --> 01:27:31,166
There's this trouble.

1473
01:27:31,168 --> 01:27:32,934
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1474
01:27:32,936 --> 01:27:34,635
Look, she's just very worried

1475
01:27:34,637 --> 01:27:37,838
about being able to pretend
cry when she has to,

1476
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,408
and she doesn't get it
about memorizing,

1477
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:42,609
but that's all.

1478
01:27:42,611 --> 01:27:44,911
That's all?

1479
01:27:45,413 --> 01:27:46,211
Come here.

1480
01:27:46,213 --> 01:27:48,413
This isn't going to be good.
I can't do it.

1481
01:27:48,415 --> 01:27:50,448
Yeah, well, not
with that attitude.

1482
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:53,584
It's just that... Did they
tell you what an audience is?

1483
01:27:53,586 --> 01:27:56,153
Can you help me to cry?

1484
01:27:56,455 --> 01:27:57,987
Yes.

1485
01:27:57,989 --> 01:27:59,555
Yes, I can.

1486
01:27:59,557 --> 01:28:02,291
I can help make it okay.

1487
01:28:03,894 --> 01:28:05,360
Trust me.

1488
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:14,969
Now I can't even
understand what you're saying!

1489
01:28:14,971 --> 01:28:17,004
Do you know what trust means?

1490
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:18,472
Not very.

1491
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:22,542
It means that if something
is hard to believe,

1492
01:28:22,544 --> 01:28:24,176
you believe someone you trust

1493
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:28,079
because you know he wouldn't
say it unless it were true.

1494
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:29,814
You don't make sense!

1495
01:28:29,816 --> 01:28:32,149
I don't understand you.

1496
01:28:37,589 --> 01:28:39,488
I think you do.

1497
01:28:39,756 --> 01:28:44,492
Just know that I'm gonna be here
for you whenever you need me.

1498
01:28:44,494 --> 01:28:46,961
I will always... Okay!

1499
01:28:57,139 --> 01:28:59,105
I think you do.

1500
01:29:07,982 --> 01:29:09,581
We look like jerks
eating here at this hour.

1501
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:14,786
Everybody's gonna think we couldn't get
a reservation during the hot hours.

1502
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:17,755
Hey, great to see you!

1503
01:29:18,524 --> 01:29:21,024
Can't remember her name.

1504
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,660
Why do you do this to yourself?

1505
01:29:24,662 --> 01:29:24,926
What?

1506
01:29:24,928 --> 01:29:26,994
Why do you insist on
eating dinner in a restaurant

1507
01:29:26,996 --> 01:29:30,597
where you're bound to see all
the people you're afraid of?

1508
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32,665
I'm not afraid of them.

1509
01:29:32,933 --> 01:29:36,467
What do you call it when you think that
what a group of people thinks of you

1510
01:29:36,469 --> 01:29:41,205
can confirm or destroy any decent
idea you have of yourself?

1511
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:43,407
Normal.

1512
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,909
How did little
Jeannie do today?

1513
01:29:45,911 --> 01:29:49,979
Isn't it something? They've got
you testing my new TV show.

1514
01:29:50,514 --> 01:29:53,181
What I asked was
how did Jeannie do?

1515
01:29:53,183 --> 01:29:55,016
What are you talking about?

1516
01:29:55,018 --> 01:29:56,951
Somebody else.

1517
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,286
Jeannie.

1518
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:01,187
How did she do?

1519
01:30:02,957 --> 01:30:05,324
Don't talk to me like this.

1520
01:30:05,959 --> 01:30:11,195
I want to be treated as if I'm
really saying words to you,

1521
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,964
which you engage
and respond to.

1522
01:30:13,966 --> 01:30:17,400
I like Matt. I'd like to
know how his daughter did.

1523
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:21,637
So before you start working
this room desperately,

1524
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:26,174
and I end up feeling
so sorry for you I could die,

1525
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,410
I would like you to answer my question.
How did Jeannie do?

1526
01:30:29,412 --> 01:30:32,079
She did okay! All
right, that's all.

1527
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:33,480
No, no.

1528
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:38,551
It's heating up.

1529
01:30:38,619 --> 01:30:41,086
Don't go. Don't worry.

1530
01:30:41,088 --> 01:30:43,154
I'm not that mad.

1531
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:45,689
I gotta go do this.

1532
01:30:54,633 --> 01:30:57,767
That son of a bitch.

1533
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,613
How are you? Nice to see you.

1534
01:31:11,615 --> 01:31:12,780
Lovely wife. Yes.

1535
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:14,615
The smartest guy in town.

1536
01:31:14,617 --> 01:31:15,983
This is my wife.

1537
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:17,651
You, too.

1538
01:31:17,653 --> 01:31:20,253
How are you? See you later.

1539
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,694
The world's funniest man.
Bye-bye.

1540
01:31:29,696 --> 01:31:31,095
My hand.

1541
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:37,267
Where you going?

1542
01:31:37,269 --> 01:31:39,135
What's the matter with you?
Where you going?

1543
01:31:39,137 --> 01:31:41,604
Hi, Victor, how are you?

1544
01:31:41,606 --> 01:31:43,172
Jack. This is Nan.

1545
01:31:43,174 --> 01:31:46,375
Jack and of course,
his lovely wife, uh...

1546
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:48,043
Elisabeth. Elisabeth.

1547
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:48,943
And of course...

1548
01:31:48,945 --> 01:31:52,012
Oh, you know, come up
with the great carpets.

1549
01:31:52,014 --> 01:31:53,513
Stacy. Stacy!

1550
01:31:53,515 --> 01:31:54,413
This is Nan.

1551
01:31:54,415 --> 01:31:55,847
Victor, I called
you yesterday...

1552
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:58,149
I'm sorry I can't talk now.

1553
01:31:58,151 --> 01:32:00,384
I'm very upset about
what's happening to Burke,

1554
01:32:00,386 --> 01:32:04,788
so I just made up my mind that I
can't be witness to it anymore

1555
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:05,421
if I love him.

1556
01:32:05,423 --> 01:32:07,656
And I certainly shouldn't
be here if I don't,

1557
01:32:07,658 --> 01:32:09,157
so I was just
in the process of leaving

1558
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:13,027
when he stopped me
and you folks walked in.

1559
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:16,597
I'm sure you've had something
like this happen to you sometime,

1560
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:21,602
some horrible thing in your
personal life happening in public?

1561
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:24,171
Thank you for understanding.

1562
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,039
Goodbye.

1563
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,674
I wish only
good things for you,

1564
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:34,312
even though I feel I've been very
damaged by this relationship.

1565
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:36,613
Uh, I...

1566
01:32:36,915 --> 01:32:38,347
Wasn't that spectacular?

1567
01:32:38,349 --> 01:32:41,316
I've never seen
anybody that secure.

1568
01:32:41,584 --> 01:32:43,083
Fantastic.

1569
01:32:49,757 --> 01:32:52,224
- Hello?
<i>- Nan.</i>

1570
01:32:52,226 --> 01:32:53,024
Yeah?

1571
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:55,793
<i>I hope I'm not</i>
<i>calling too late.</i>

1572
01:32:56,996 --> 01:32:58,395
I'd like another chance.

1573
01:32:58,397 --> 01:33:03,133
You only think you feel that way
because you're on the verge of failure

1574
01:33:03,135 --> 01:33:05,268
and you're without a core.

1575
01:33:05,336 --> 01:33:07,803
See? No one else gets me!

1576
01:33:09,772 --> 01:33:11,071
Um...

1577
01:33:11,073 --> 01:33:14,507
Do you wanna have
a little sex, huh?

1578
01:33:16,577 --> 01:33:21,112
You know, I've never hung
up on anybody in my life.

1579
01:33:21,114 --> 01:33:24,648
Because what if the next thing
they said solved everything?

1580
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,450
But I must end
this conversation.

1581
01:33:27,452 --> 01:33:29,118
That's no?

1582
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,687
Hello? Nan?

1583
01:33:53,744 --> 01:33:55,877
I'm so nervous, Mommy.

1584
01:33:55,879 --> 01:33:57,879
You'll be fine.

1585
01:34:00,016 --> 01:34:00,714
Are you gonna need me?

1586
01:34:00,716 --> 01:34:04,184
The kids are rehearsing upstairs, and
I'd like to go up and take a look.

1587
01:34:04,186 --> 01:34:05,318
Yeah, sure.

1588
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,553
I have to stay inside
during lunch hours now anyway.

1589
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:12,457
That's when everybody returns my calls
'cause they're trying to miss me.

1590
01:34:12,459 --> 01:34:14,325
Is that true?

1591
01:34:14,927 --> 01:34:16,359
Yeah.

1592
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:18,394
Thanks for the support.

1593
01:34:24,535 --> 01:34:28,737
What's the most important thing
you do when you're acting?

1594
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,272
You listen.

1595
01:34:31,274 --> 01:34:33,140
Listening. Right.

1596
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:38,545
You're really worried about being able
to cry when you're supposed to, right?

1597
01:34:39,314 --> 01:34:40,846
Right. Okay.

1598
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:46,318
Well, you know, there are only two
ways to do a thing like that.

1599
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,055
One is to think of something
that really makes you sad.

1600
01:34:50,057 --> 01:34:55,393
Or two, forget you're you, and really
forget that you're pretending.

1601
01:35:02,701 --> 01:35:04,901
How do you do that?

1602
01:35:04,903 --> 01:35:07,603
Okay, you, uh...

1603
01:35:09,206 --> 01:35:12,140
I could eat you for lunch
when I was your age

1604
01:35:12,142 --> 01:35:14,008
and I'm a hell of
a lot bigger now!

1605
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,209
That's it. That's it!

1606
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:17,978
Do you see how it scared
you and you reacted?

1607
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:21,481
Now in acting, that's called
action, reaction. See?

1608
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:23,082
Don't do that again.

1609
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,651
All right.

1610
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:28,453
Jeannie, they need you, honey.

1611
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,556
Come on.

1612
01:35:31,891 --> 01:35:33,457
Hurry up. Let's go.

1613
01:35:33,459 --> 01:35:34,858
You're welcome!

1614
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,559
Come on, baby.

1615
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:38,594
You're welcome.

1616
01:35:39,563 --> 01:35:41,229
You're welcome.

1617
01:35:50,906 --> 01:35:53,239
What's wrong? Well...

1618
01:35:55,443 --> 01:35:56,875
To heck with it.

1619
01:35:56,877 --> 01:36:01,880
I'm a free man. Let's go to your house
and break the answering machine.

1620
01:36:02,282 --> 01:36:05,149
You know, I could
get away right now.

1621
01:36:05,151 --> 01:36:08,652
No. I've got a big
meeting later. Uh...

1622
01:36:08,787 --> 01:36:11,053
We'd better take two cars.

1623
01:36:17,427 --> 01:36:18,459
I hope it's you.

1624
01:36:18,461 --> 01:36:20,661
You're a little nutty
in the afternoon.

1625
01:36:20,663 --> 01:36:23,664
<i>So this is how the big</i>
<i>ones make out, huh?</i>

1626
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:24,164
So what's new?

1627
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:28,601
You know, this is the biggest bonus I
ever got out of a busted screen test.

1628
01:36:28,603 --> 01:36:31,971
<i>Someday you'll have</i>
<i>to show it to me.</i>

1629
01:36:31,973 --> 01:36:33,038
Sure.

1630
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,139
No, no, I don't want to see it.

1631
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:40,011
I'm just trying to figure out how to get
it out from under my skin. Forget it.

1632
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:44,180
Matt, will you take me
off the speaker?

1633
01:36:44,615 --> 01:36:46,114
Sure.

1634
01:36:46,983 --> 01:36:48,015
What's the matter?

1635
01:36:48,017 --> 01:36:52,319
<i>Better talk fast. This is where
my phone always kicks out.</i>

1636
01:36:52,921 --> 01:36:55,922
<i>Matt, before someone</i>
<i>else tells you,</i>

1637
01:36:55,924 --> 01:36:58,758
<i>I'd better confess something.</i>

1638
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,092
When we did your screen test...

1639
01:37:01,094 --> 01:37:03,060
Can you hear me?

1640
01:37:03,062 --> 01:37:04,194
Yes.

1641
01:37:04,196 --> 01:37:07,463
I sort of folded
on you at the end.

1642
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:12,567
<i>Matt?</i>

1643
01:37:12,769 --> 01:37:14,535
You didn't like what I did?

1644
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,737
No, I did, truly,

1645
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:19,539
but the discussion
got sort of dumb.

1646
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:22,174
It was a question of sexiness.

1647
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,042
Oh, oh.

1648
01:37:24,611 --> 01:37:27,645
You folded on whether
or not I'm sexy.

1649
01:37:27,647 --> 01:37:29,780
You don't think I'm sexy?

1650
01:37:29,782 --> 01:37:31,548
And you expressed that to...

1651
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:35,184
Well, I tell you, I certainly
must think so pretty much

1652
01:37:35,186 --> 01:37:39,488
because I feel great about
where we're going now.

1653
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:41,456
Oh.

1654
01:37:44,794 --> 01:37:45,392
You very mad at me?

1655
01:37:45,394 --> 01:37:50,730
Oh, no, no, it's just that, you
know, I know that you were...

1656
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:53,031
Oh, God!

1657
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,332
Oh, I'm... Yeah.

1658
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:57,668
Yeah, I am, damn it.
Damn it, I am.

1659
01:37:57,670 --> 01:37:59,202
<i>Matt!</i>

1660
01:38:00,138 --> 01:38:01,338
Matt!

1661
01:38:09,312 --> 01:38:11,578
- I know.
- Come on!

1662
01:38:15,684 --> 01:38:18,551
I don't know if I've been bad,

1663
01:38:18,553 --> 01:38:21,620
but I know somebody's been bad.

1664
01:38:21,622 --> 01:38:23,488
I'm a good kid.

1665
01:38:26,258 --> 01:38:29,325
Comb your hair.
Learn your lines.

1666
01:38:29,327 --> 01:38:31,493
I don't know if I've been bad,

1667
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:33,928
but I know somebody's been bad.

1668
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:35,863
Maybe it's you.

1669
01:38:42,237 --> 01:38:44,637
I won't be able to do it.

1670
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,406
Parents, please? Parents, parents?
Thank you.

1671
01:38:47,408 --> 01:38:48,707
Remember, when you're
in the audience,

1672
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:52,410
be sure you laugh and applaud,
even if it's somebody else's kid.

1673
01:38:52,412 --> 01:38:54,945
Please try to follow the rules.

1674
01:38:54,947 --> 01:38:56,947
They're really very simple.

1675
01:38:56,949 --> 01:38:59,449
You're not allowed
near the stage, okay?

1676
01:38:59,451 --> 01:39:01,517
Now, if you haven't
signed a contract,

1677
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,819
be sure that before you leave
this building tonight,

1678
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:05,654
that all your
paperwork's done...

1679
01:39:05,656 --> 01:39:08,490
You're not allowed
near the stage.

1680
01:39:09,392 --> 01:39:11,158
Hey, you're not allowed
near the stage.

1681
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,560
<i>How's everybody doing tonight?</i>

1682
01:39:13,562 --> 01:39:17,664
<i>We are excited today. We're
here to see</i> The Rainbow House.

1683
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:21,067
I just found out that we
bow before we do anything.

1684
01:39:21,069 --> 01:39:23,202
Great! Then everybody claps!

1685
01:39:23,204 --> 01:39:23,569
Great!

1686
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:26,471
I made up a great bow.
Are you going to look?

1687
01:39:26,473 --> 01:39:29,006
Oh, I wouldn't miss it. Yes?

1688
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:30,607
Yes!

1689
01:39:32,711 --> 01:39:34,110
What's wrong?

1690
01:39:34,112 --> 01:39:37,046
I won't be able to cry.
It's too hard for me.

1691
01:39:37,048 --> 01:39:42,017
Oh, look, they'll give you a lot
of chances after everyone leaves.

1692
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:46,621
You'll get to do it over and over
till you get it right. Don't worry.

1693
01:39:46,623 --> 01:39:48,089
Okay?

1694
01:39:50,092 --> 01:39:54,394
<i>It is my pleasure now to introduce a
bunch of very talented young actors.</i>

1695
01:39:54,396 --> 01:39:58,364
<i>Let's start off with the
charming Heather Deloach.</i>

1696
01:39:58,366 --> 01:40:01,100
<i>A big round of applause</i>
<i>for Heather.</i>

1697
01:40:01,102 --> 01:40:04,703
<i>DJ Dellos!</i>
<i>Let's get him out here.</i>

1698
01:40:05,105 --> 01:40:06,737
<i>Brittany Johnson!</i>

1699
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:08,138
Matt!

1700
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:11,975
<i>Here is Tricia Joe!</i>

1701
01:40:11,977 --> 01:40:13,443
Matt!

1702
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:17,013
I don't want to miss
her introduction.

1703
01:40:17,015 --> 01:40:18,347
I'll talk fast.
It's amazing news.

1704
01:40:18,349 --> 01:40:23,318
Oliver Stone's been looking for a
comedy, and he's doing my picture!

1705
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,152
Good for you.

1706
01:40:24,154 --> 01:40:25,253
No, but part of this
involves you.

1707
01:40:25,255 --> 01:40:27,088
He remembers you from <i> Platoon,</i>

1708
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,557
and he wants to use you
in this one.

1709
01:40:31,527 --> 01:40:34,127
Got your attention, huh?

1710
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:43,069
<i>And now I'd like to introduce
a very special young girl,</i>

1711
01:40:43,071 --> 01:40:45,404
<i>Jennifer Cabrera!</i>

1712
01:40:45,406 --> 01:40:47,506
Oh, Cathy.

1713
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,607
Look, I'm going to watch this.

1714
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:51,475
Let me talk to you
later or tomorrow.

1715
01:40:51,477 --> 01:40:52,342
<i>Jeannie Hobbs!</i>

1716
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:54,911
It's really good news.
I gotta go!

1717
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:57,012
<i>What show is complete</i>
<i>without twins?</i>

1718
01:40:57,014 --> 01:40:58,880
<i>Alissa and Danielle Dowdy!</i>

1719
01:40:58,882 --> 01:41:00,181
Oh!

1720
01:41:01,317 --> 01:41:02,349
I missed it! I missed it!

1721
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:05,151
I promised her I'd see it
and I missed it!

1722
01:41:05,153 --> 01:41:07,720
Get a grip. She'll recover.

1723
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:12,290
Just stop worrying about it.

1724
01:41:12,592 --> 01:41:13,223
I mean,

1725
01:41:13,225 --> 01:41:17,493
my father never saw any of
my things when I was a kid.

1726
01:41:22,132 --> 01:41:25,032
Oh, this looks intense.
Excuse me.

1727
01:41:25,034 --> 01:41:27,434
Good luck tonight, Matt.
I bet it'll be great.

1728
01:41:27,436 --> 01:41:29,736
Oh, thank you. What's going on?
What are you doing?

1729
01:41:29,738 --> 01:41:33,406
<i>We'll start the show in
a couple of minutes.</i>

1730
01:41:33,408 --> 01:41:37,076
She's wishing me luck
because of my kid.

1731
01:41:39,146 --> 01:41:40,612
Oh.

1732
01:41:42,282 --> 01:41:44,348
Why are you doing this to me?

1733
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:47,384
Is it because of that
screen test thing?

1734
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:49,985
No, I don't think so.

1735
01:41:49,987 --> 01:41:50,618
Well, don't be like this!

1736
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:55,155
I mean, especially since anyone in the world
would have done the same thing I did.

1737
01:41:55,157 --> 01:41:59,192
I don't know. It's a big world.

1738
01:41:59,594 --> 01:42:00,559
Look,

1739
01:42:00,561 --> 01:42:04,129
I don't have a kid
or a mate or a talent.

1740
01:42:04,131 --> 01:42:09,400
I've got my work and I am not gonna
apologize for thinking it's important.

1741
01:42:09,402 --> 01:42:12,369
I am being real here, Matt.

1742
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:18,707
You're not going to make me
miss one minute of this show.

1743
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:20,442
I am late for three
things now too,

1744
01:42:20,444 --> 01:42:24,245
two of which are really
important, and I am taking the...

1745
01:42:24,247 --> 01:42:26,313
Don't miss them.

1746
01:42:26,848 --> 01:42:30,683
I couldn't help overhearing because
I was intentionally eavesdropping.

1747
01:42:30,685 --> 01:42:33,652
Don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.

1748
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:35,954
It's not? No.

1749
01:42:36,256 --> 01:42:38,923
It's just that he's
too good for you.

1750
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:58,675
Get Kate in here, and then you
can have your favorite food.

1751
01:42:58,677 --> 01:43:00,209
What is your favorite food?

1752
01:43:00,211 --> 01:43:01,677
Carbohydrates!

1753
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:05,347
You're lucky you
already got to do yours.

1754
01:43:05,349 --> 01:43:06,514
Yeah.

1755
01:43:06,516 --> 01:43:09,583
When the light goes on,
you go in, okay?

1756
01:43:11,587 --> 01:43:14,020
I said stop.

1757
01:43:14,255 --> 01:43:14,686
Will you stop?

1758
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:19,891
I want all you kids out. Clear out
so I can have a talk with her.

1759
01:43:38,344 --> 01:43:40,645
Nan? Just a second.

1760
01:43:42,949 --> 01:43:46,317
Just sit there
and wait till I sign this.

1761
01:43:46,752 --> 01:43:49,219
Okay, time to do this!
Everybody, out!

1762
01:43:49,221 --> 01:43:51,321
Not you, fool. And not you.

1763
01:43:51,323 --> 01:43:52,655
Go easy on her.

1764
01:43:52,657 --> 01:43:54,790
Now, you gonna hear
what I have to say,

1765
01:43:54,792 --> 01:43:58,326
and I'm gonna listen
to what you have to say.

1766
01:43:58,928 --> 01:44:02,896
This is as much about me
as it is about you.

1767
01:44:02,898 --> 01:44:04,230
Now go ahead.

1768
01:44:04,232 --> 01:44:06,532
Say what you got to say.

1769
01:44:09,103 --> 01:44:11,336
What do you think?

1770
01:44:11,338 --> 01:44:13,538
Wait, wait. Listen.

1771
01:44:14,641 --> 01:44:16,507
Stop rocking.

1772
01:44:18,244 --> 01:44:20,510
Now what's going on?

1773
01:44:20,512 --> 01:44:23,312
It's like everyone's pis...

1774
01:44:23,314 --> 01:44:24,980
Ticked off at me

1775
01:44:31,454 --> 01:44:33,887
because I'm not colored!

1776
01:44:33,889 --> 01:44:35,521
The word is "black."

1777
01:44:35,523 --> 01:44:38,957
The word is "African-American."

1778
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:46,162
What do we do with a new word?
We use it in a sentence.

1779
01:44:46,164 --> 01:44:52,134
Go ahead. Use African-American
in a sentence.

1780
01:44:56,907 --> 01:45:00,041
This is where she has to cry.

1781
01:45:03,579 --> 01:45:05,612
Look at me! I...

1782
01:45:18,994 --> 01:45:21,060
They should cut.

1783
01:46:02,101 --> 01:46:05,302
I love an African-American.

1784
01:46:07,072 --> 01:46:10,773
I love a little redneck.

1785
01:46:15,913 --> 01:46:17,212
What?

1786
01:46:17,214 --> 01:46:18,546
No.

1787
01:46:37,466 --> 01:46:41,167
It's okay, Jeannie. We just need
to get that hug at the end.

1788
01:46:41,169 --> 01:46:42,701
Amazing. Amazing, right?

1789
01:46:42,703 --> 01:46:44,402
You were great.

1790
01:46:48,474 --> 01:46:50,874
Do you want me to put you down?

1791
01:46:50,876 --> 01:46:53,076
No, this is okay.

1792
01:46:58,817 --> 01:47:00,950
Okay, you have some
more work to do.

1793
01:47:00,952 --> 01:47:04,586
You have to go hug the lady
just like you did me.

1794
01:47:04,588 --> 01:47:05,987
Wait.

1795
01:47:07,657 --> 01:47:10,024
I'm very proud of you.

1796
01:47:13,295 --> 01:47:16,062
I love you more than anybody.

1797
01:47:27,475 --> 01:47:28,874
When I had to cry,

1798
01:47:28,876 --> 01:47:33,278
I was thinking of someone
taking me away from you.

1799
01:47:43,823 --> 01:47:45,722
Give me a kiss.

1800
01:47:50,495 --> 01:47:55,731
All right, we're clear.
We're not done yet. Come on.

1801
01:48:07,743 --> 01:48:10,643
I can't hear you!
You're a grownup!

1802
01:48:10,645 --> 01:48:12,845
My ear is bleeding!

1803
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:22,853
Hey, Jeannie! You did it!

1804
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:28,091
Do you have any idea
how special you were?

1805
01:48:28,093 --> 01:48:29,358
That looks like a yes.

1806
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,026
Gotta get dressed
for the party.

1807
01:48:31,028 --> 01:48:32,894
There's more?

1808
01:48:33,062 --> 01:48:35,595
The party's on the roof!

1809
01:48:52,544 --> 01:48:53,709
Wait a second.

1810
01:48:53,711 --> 01:48:54,209
I wanna see my kid!

1811
01:48:54,211 --> 01:48:58,513
They're taking the cast picture
now, so just wait for one second.

1812
01:48:59,716 --> 01:49:00,114
Nan...

1813
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:03,517
She doesn't look like the
women I normally go out with.

1814
01:49:03,519 --> 01:49:07,120
But you know what
they say. Beauty fades.

1815
01:49:07,122 --> 01:49:10,957
What they don't say
is it fades very slowly.

1816
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,292
Huh?

1817
01:49:15,129 --> 01:49:17,662
You don't think I can
tell you what to do.

1818
01:49:17,664 --> 01:49:20,598
No, no! Only I can do that.

1819
01:49:20,933 --> 01:49:23,800
I want you to tell
me what to feel.

1820
01:49:24,769 --> 01:49:28,070
This Oliver Stone thing,
does he really want me?

1821
01:49:28,072 --> 01:49:28,603
Yeah.

1822
01:49:28,605 --> 01:49:32,139
Oh, I forgot to say
congratulations.

1823
01:49:35,544 --> 01:49:36,442
Which part?

1824
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:37,176
Which part do you want?

1825
01:49:37,178 --> 01:49:39,578
One of the two leads
wouldn't be bad.

1826
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:42,914
No. It's the crippled
factory owner.

1827
01:49:52,959 --> 01:49:55,492
Best part in the movie.

1828
01:50:03,969 --> 01:50:06,102
Jeannie? Smile!

1829
01:50:06,704 --> 01:50:07,969
Smile.

1830
01:50:09,906 --> 01:50:12,072
Yeah, Mom!

1831
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:24,081
Daddy.

1832
01:50:35,026 --> 01:50:36,925
Why are you breathing so heavy?

1833
01:50:36,927 --> 01:50:38,159
I'm nervous!

1834
01:50:38,161 --> 01:50:42,396
Look, let's move our thing
in a more regular direction.

1835
01:50:42,398 --> 01:50:44,331
What does that mean?

1836
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:45,965
Let me think.

1837
01:50:46,834 --> 01:50:50,302
Why don't we go
out this weekend?

1838
01:50:51,004 --> 01:50:52,837
With your kid.

1839
01:50:55,374 --> 01:50:57,540
Whose name is...

1840
01:51:03,514 --> 01:51:05,113
Leslie.

1841
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:11,085
Okay. Okay.

1842
01:51:20,863 --> 01:51:22,229
I was right?

1843
01:51:24,232 --> 01:51:25,631
Jerk.

1844
01:51:41,615 --> 01:51:43,414
Last ones here?

1845
01:51:43,416 --> 01:51:44,948
I told you.

1846
01:51:47,252 --> 01:51:50,019
What did you think of my bow?
I didn't see it.

1847
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:50,819
I know that!

1848
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:53,054
Well, don't push.
Show it to me.

1849
01:51:53,056 --> 01:51:54,889
Oh, all right.

1850
01:52:13,276 --> 01:52:14,408
Hey, I got a part in a movie.

1851
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:18,779
Oh, good. Don't you just
love it when that happens?

1852
01:52:18,947 --> 01:52:21,047
Yeah, I guess I do.

1853
01:52:28,156 --> 01:52:30,389
<i>¶ You are the best</i>

1854
01:52:30,391 --> 01:52:32,157
<i>¶ You can do everything</i>

1855
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:36,861
<i>¶ You can be everything</i>

1856
01:52:36,863 --> 01:52:39,063
<i>¶ You are a smile</i>

1857
01:52:39,065 --> 01:52:40,831
<i>¶ You are a rainbow</i>

01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:45,435
<i>¶ You were created so perfectly</i>

1859
01:52:45,603 --> 01:52:47,736
<i>¶ Sometimes we laugh</i>
