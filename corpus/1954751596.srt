1
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,158
At that age,

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,927
I was almost too
short to look outside.

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,667
Through one of my
windows, all I could see

4
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:41,774
was a cloud, an ocean of ash.

5
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,977
It suffocated everything.

6
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,181
Out the other window, I
saw the people in town.

7
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,220
Out both, I saw darkness.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,994
Dad had always said,
the job of dam keeper

9
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,963
is to keep the darkness away.

10
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,735
But by then, I was
doing it alone.

11
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,775
I was the dam keeper.

12
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,860
Ugh.

13
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,229
Ugh.

14
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,903
Dad had always

15
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:48,246
said the job of a dam keeper
is to keep the darkness away.

16
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,917
But he never told me what
to do when it surrounds you.

17
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:03,194
His mask protected
me from the cloud.

18
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:08,633
But nothing I had protected
me from the people.
