7
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,187
Morning.

8
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,057
Hi, Dad.

9
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,176
Have you got everything?

10
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,375
Hi. My name is Paul,
and I'm an alcoholic.

11
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,144
Hi, Paul.

12
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,114
I'm still learning
about how this works.

13
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,818
But I... I do know this much.

14
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,053
There is no way that
I would have been able

15
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,790
to stay sober for 18 months...

16
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:18,231
if I didn't have the love
and the support of my family...

17
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:23,136
and my best friend
and sponsor - Zack.

18
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,118
Hello, sweetheart.

19
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,854
How's it going with our
Christmas decorations?

20
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,056
All right.
But I'm always puzzled.

21
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,324
I can't remember...

22
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,994
Is it on the left ear,
or on the right ear?

23
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,798
I, quite frankly,
like it on both.

24
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,366
That's very fetching.

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,235
Mom! Dad!

26
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,870
Hey!

27
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,973
Hi, honey. Welcome home!
Welcome home!

28
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:00,807
Thank you.

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,809
And Vicki,
nice to see you again.

30
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,911
Hi, Mr. Fowler.
Thank you for having me.

31
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,014
We like to have
Christmas carols from you.

32
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,516
You know,
that's what we count on.

33
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,984
It'll be the best time.

34
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,786
You guys both staying here?

35
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,289
- Hi.
- Hi.

36
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,161
How are you?

37
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,862
How are you?

38
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,334
- Merry...
- Merry...

39
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,402
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

40
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,072
- Merry...
- Merry...

41
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,040
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

42
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,909
- That's great.
- Thank you.

43
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,480
Hey, Roy.
Is everything all right?

44
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,016
I just...

45
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,285
I mean, are you sure it
makes sense for me to come?

46
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,021
Just because
my sister got married,

47
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,490
doesn't make me
some kind of a wedding expert.

48
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,459
Well, you know more than me.

49
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,861
And besides, you and Vicki
are my best friends.

50
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,196
I need you both here.

51
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,331
What about your brother?

52
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,500
I mean, I just...

53
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,503
Did you tell him
about me and Gavin?

54
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,574
God, I haven't seen him
since we...

55
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,976
went our separate ways.

56
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,345
You didn't
go your separate ways.

57
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,481
Paul cheated on you,
and then you dumped him -

58
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,983
a lot more gently
than I would have.

59
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:22,455
But, yes, he knows,
and he's better now, Roy.

60
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,491
Really.

61
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,993
OK. I'll be there soon.

62
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,428
All right, I love you.

63
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,963
I love you, too.

64
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,633
- So, that was Alana.
- I figured.

65
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,235
Tell me again
who's gonna be there.

66
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,141
Alana and her family,
including her brother, Paul.

67
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,076
Right, Paul the A-hole.

68
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,212
Whoa, the very hot A-hole.

69
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,582
Is Alana adopted?

70
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,618
Yeah. She and Paul both are.

71
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,689
It's still hard to believe
how stupid I was.

72
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,124
I thought things were perfect.

73
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:03,396
He was smart,
he was funny, he was handsome,

74
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,965
he was sexy as hell.

75
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,135
And then one weekend
I came for a surprise visit

76
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,439
and found out things weren't as
perfect as I thought they were.

77
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,012
Oops.

78
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,014
Wow.

79
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,549
Exactly.

80
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,552
And to make
the whole pathetic thing

81
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,420
that much more pathetic,

82
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,457
Alana spent two solid years
trying to set me up.

83
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,461
Suddenly, visiting her
was like speed dating.

84
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,498
I couldn't take it any more,
so finally I just...

85
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,701
I lied.

86
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,672
I told her
you and I got back together.

87
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,612
So you looking forward
to Christmas with the family?

88
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,215
I'm a little nervous,
to tell you the truth.

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,984
My sister asked Roy
to come, so...

90
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,186
I'll finally get my chance
to apologize.

91
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,056
That's... I'm proud of you, man.

92
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,290
That's really good.

93
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,392
Thanks.

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
Yeah, you're still buying
lunch today though,

95
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,331
'cause I just sold
a dozen areca palms,

96
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,633
so you're not catching me.

97
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,072
I can sell a lot of trees
in 20 minutes.

98
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,743
Did you know that pizza
actually tastes better

99
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,279
when someone else
buys it for you?

100
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,783
When you're hurtful...
I feel sad inside.

101
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,051
And then I wonder whether
I should say nice things

102
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,621
about you to
my sister's friend Vicki,

103
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,257
who will be visiting us
over the holidays.

104
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,465
Thank you for doing this, Gavin.

105
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,070
So, it's Alana
we're trying to fool - not Paul.

106
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,773
And Paul.

107
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,376
I never expected her to invite
me to her parents' house

108
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,778
for Christmas to do this
wedding planning thing,

109
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,447
and Paul
still lives there, and...

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,514
OK, OK.

111
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,082
What else do I have to know?

112
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,785
I mean, how did it happen?
You and me, part two.

113
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,521
Like, we were at dinner,
and you said,

114
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,589
You know how you annoy me

115
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,125
by being a night person.
When I'm a morning person,

116
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,060
and how we have
completely different tastes

117
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,195
in food and fashion?

118
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,597
Yeah, right. What a disaster.

119
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,835
No, I just...
I told Alana the real stuff.

120
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,604
That we hooked up
the summer before college.

121
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,139
But then we were friends.

122
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,542
We'd been close...
we got closer.

123
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,212
She didn't ask for details,
so...

124
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,481
Well, people see
what they want to see.

125
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,149
Amen to that.

126
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,551
Alana will see me being happy.

127
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,220
And Paul?

128
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,755
And Paul.

129
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,162
Whoa! Hey, what is this?

130
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,663
That's the book.

131
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,699
You finished writing the book?!

132
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,567
542 pages.

133
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,169
That's amazing!

134
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,304
Can I read it?

135
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,407
Yeah. I think now
you have to read it.

136
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,809
You owe me.

137
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,379
♪

138
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,781
Alana! Vicki!

139
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,216
In here, Daddy.

140
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,720
Hello, beautiful ladies.
I've got a joke for you.

141
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,589
The past, the present
and the future walk into a bar.

142
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,557
Cookies!

143
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,192
Careful, Daddy, they're hot!

144
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm just gonna let that cool.

145
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,863
So, Alana...
Now, when is Kirk arriving?

146
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,508
He should get here
tomorrow around lunchtime.

147
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,867
Excellent. Glad he's gonna be
in on the wedding plans.

148
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,342
Um, listen, honey.
I realize Meryl...

149
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,379
Well, Mommy, has told you...

150
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,890
Well, she's probably
told you everything.

151
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,148
I just want you to know...

152
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,181
Hello!

153
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,785
Don't eat all the cookies!

154
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,190
Never mind.
We can talk about this later.

155
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,492
Yeah, it's still hot.

156
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,260
Welcome! Merry Christmas!

157
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,362
This is my father...

158
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,498
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Gavin.

159
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,767
And this is Vicki.

160
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,769
College friend Vicki,
who can sing.

161
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,770
Um

162
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,872
Roy told me a little about you
on the way here.

163
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,808
I brought a gift
for you and Mrs. Fowler.

164
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,643
You haven't told me
anything about Gavin.

165
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,445
Let's get your stuff
up to your room.

166
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,880
- Thank you.
- And then I'll...

167
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,882
I'll give you a tour
of the house, all right?

168
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,926
Alana's mother's on the phone...

169
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,252
- Is Paul here?
- No.

170
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,620
Roy, come on.

171
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,355
Two-to three-hundred guests.

172
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,657
June 30th.

173
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,793
Terrific, terrific.

174
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,666
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

175
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,697
OK, thank you so much. Bye.

176
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,373
Paul, is everything OK?

177
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,874
Hey, Mom. Everything's fine.

178
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,676
I just called to say
I'll be a little late.

179
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,954
Zack ran to the store to pick up.

180
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,580
Chanukah present for his niece,
and he got a little hung up.

181
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,683
Go ahead with dinner.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

182
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,419
Hey, did Roy get there yet?

183
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,522
I was just going downstairs
to say hello when you called.

184
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,690
Damn it.

185
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,892
I was hoping to be there
before he arrived.

186
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,928
I haven't spoken to him since...

187
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,730
Since you were
a selfish jackass.

188
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,634
Yes, Mother -
since I was a selfish jackass.

189
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,969
Roy and Vicki
have come all this way

190
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,804
to help your sister
plan her wedding.

191
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,307
So I don't want there
to be any drama.

192
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,243
I've been out of the drama
business for a while, OK?

193
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,445
This weekend is about Christmas

194
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,847
and about planning
Alana's wedding.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,882
Not about me.

196
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,984
Believe me, I understand.

197
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,387
Great.
I'll see you when you get here.

198
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,335
So, what do you interpret?
Plays or lectures?

199
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,404
I do a little bit of everything.

200
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,572
But the best jobs are concerts.

201
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,474
I love interpreting song lyrics.

202
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,643
Can you sign Christmas carols?

203
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,013
- What's that?
- Joy to the World.

204
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,782
Bravo!

205
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,351
- Is that sign language?
- Hey! Paul's home!

206
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,585
Finally.

207
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,287
There he is.

208
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,489
Hey, Mom.

209
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,525
Hey, Sweetheart.
I'll get you some food.

210
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,859
And look who's here.

211
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,628
Welcome home!

212
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,029
How was your flight? Good?

213
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,030
Yes!

214
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,765
Yes, thank you for asking.

215
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,900
Roy.

216
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,903
You look great, man.

217
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,805
It's really good to see you.

218
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,374
And you must be Gavin.

219
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,476
You're a lucky man...

220
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,078
Roy's a terrific guy.

221
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,713
Thanks.

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,649
I, I think so.

223
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,655
So, why do you
know sign language?

224
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,523
Gavin's an ASL interpreter.

225
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,591
Cool.

226
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,060
I learned a little back in
4th grade when Chip...

227
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,529
- Mosely.
- Chip Mosely.

228
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,031
Thanks, Mom.

229
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,033
Yeah, he was this kid
who lived down the street.

230
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,000
He was deaf.

231
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,803
Hey, Mom, I want to
sign something for you -

232
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,705
and Gavin will interpret?

233
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,006
Sure.

234
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,042
OK.

235
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,620
Thank you... I am a goat.

236
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,093
I was actually going for,
Thank you, Mom, I love you.

237
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,370
When are we expecting
Kirk to arrive?

238
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,139
Um, remember...

239
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,841
He'll be here tomorrow,
around lunch.

240
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,778
That's right... Excellent.

241
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm glad he's gonna be
in on the wedding plans.

242
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,888
OK, the teams will be
the boys against the girls.

243
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,456
- What?!
- That doesn't seem right.

244
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,791
- No.
- Why not?

245
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,992
Exactly. Why not?

246
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,493
It's just that Paul is...

247
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,862
Paul is not
a gifted charades player.

248
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:52,965
I'm getting better.

249
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,735
That is right, dear.
You are getting so much better.

250
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,936
And guess what?

251
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,072
You can use sign language
if the clue is - I am a goat.

252
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,441
OK, that's it.

253
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,477
The men are going first.

254
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,680
- OK, he can't be that bad.
- He's that bad.

255
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,148
And if he tries
for the whole thing,

256
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,783
we're completely screwed.

257
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,854
90 seconds, and go.

258
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,997
It's not going to change, dear,

259
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,066
no matter how much time
you spend looking at it.

260
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,968
All right, all right. I got it.

261
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,039
Book.

262
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,775
- Three words.
- Three words.

263
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,543
Good, good.

264
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,680
No, don't... Why do you do this?

265
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
What?

266
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,416
He's going for the whole thing.

267
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,685
One minute.

268
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,796
The clock is running, Paul.

269
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,998
Not good at all.

270
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,438
Is that a clue, or are you
having some kind of a stroke?

271
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,076
What is that? What is this?

272
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,878
Um... The DaVinci Code.

273
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,013
Yes! Woo!

274
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,517
How did you get that?

275
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,087
How did you get
The DaVinci Code from this?

276
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,523
I don't believe it!
That was the Mona Lisa.

277
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,658
Exactly.

278
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,793
- My...
- 59 seconds.

279
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,729
Well, that's never
gonna happen again.

280
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,830
No.

281
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,698
OK, who's next?

282
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,066
I'll go.

283
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,802
Good luck.

284
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,073
90 seconds, and... Go!

285
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,876
Movie.

286
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,979
- Six words.
- Six words.

287
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,080
OK.

288
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,216
No! No!

289
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,552
No, no, the rookie's
making a big move. I like it.

290
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,687
I like it.

291
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,157
- God!
- Gosh.

292
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,029
What is that?
Is that three syllables?

293
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,097
I don't believe it;
he's worse than Paul.

294
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,132
No.

295
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,135
Lights, camera...

296
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,003
Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

297
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,040
- Wow!
- Whoa!

298
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,153
In the movie,
Paul Newman has to fight

299
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,888
the biggest guy in the
Hole in the Wall Gang.

300
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,213
And there's no way he can win.

301
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,281
So then he says,

302
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,616
"We have to agree
on some rules."

303
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,550
But the big guy goes,

304
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,552
"But there's no rules
in a knife fight."

305
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,163
Which is when Newman
kicks him, the big guy,

306
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,264
right in the
downstairs neighbors,

307
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,024
and says, "OK, somebody say,
'One, two, three, go!'"

308
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,663
All right, my turn,
my turn, my turn.

309
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,832
All right, here we go...

310
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,801
Now what was that?

311
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,869
We used to call that
The Twist, right?

312
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:44,837
All right, here we go.

313
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,073
All right...
I got two, that's no good.

314
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,775
- Three words.
- OK.

315
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,677
First word.

316
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,213
They're never gonna get this.

317
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,219
♪

318
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,301
I'm not sure
we're gonna get a chance

319
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,929
to talk much
over the next few days...

320
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:15,901
Well, um,
I just wanted to say that...

321
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,037
Well, Gavin seems like
a great guy.

322
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,605
And you seem really happy,

323
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,340
and I... I think that's awesome.

324
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,209
And...

325
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,813
Well, I wanted to apologize...

326
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,849
For everything I did
when we were together.

327
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,218
I mean...

328
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,954
I was really
selfish back then, man.

329
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:40,159
And, well, I'm trying very hard
to change the way I live.

330
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,961
I quit drinking.

331
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,263
I'm going to AA meetings
almost every day.

332
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm working the 12 steps
all the time and...

333
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,805
Well, even though it's...
it may have taken me a while

334
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,174
to realize what
a big mistake I made...

335
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,679
I do realize it.

336
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,748
And I'm sorry.

337
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,120
I'm truly sorry.

338
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,767
Well, good night.

339
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,338
Um, Paul...

340
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,179
Good night.

341
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:58,771
So, I heard what Paul said...
That's kind of great.

342
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,172
Yeah...

343
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,941
Yeah, I guess.

344
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,910
He did everything
but beg you to take him back.

345
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,221
Isn't that the point
of all this?

346
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,980
No! No!

347
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,449
No, God, no!

348
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,385
The point of this is...

349
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,162
I just didn't
want him to see me as...

350
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,231
some kind of loser.

351
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,004
Are you guys decent?

352
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,072
Yeah!

353
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,742
Roy! You call this decent?

354
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,944
No, no, no, no!
Sorry, not decent!

355
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,446
Not decent at all!
Don't come in!

356
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,114
I can come back.

357
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,382
Put that away!

358
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,784
My God, not there!

359
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,720
Well, where do you
want me to put it?

360
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,422
You know what...

361
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,491
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

362
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,260
You can come in now, really!

363
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,328
Are you sure?

364
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,362
Yeah.

365
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,833
Hi.

366
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,869
You guys... OK?

367
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,338
Yeah, we're comfy.

368
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,875
We're really, really comfy.

369
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,909
Great.

370
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:17,249
I... just came in
because I got this present,

371
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,852
and I forgot to give it to you.

372
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,821
Aren't we
exchanging gifts on Christmas?

373
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,890
This isn't a Christmas present.

374
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,093
It's a thank you
for coming to help me.

375
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,999
I really appreciate you
giving up your Christmas

376
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,369
for me and my crazy
wedding plans.

377
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,139
I'm so overwhelmed.

378
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,878
Mistletoe!

379
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,014
I'm so happy for you,

380
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,517
I thought I'd, you know,

381
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,322
do something to help you
get into the holiday spirit.

382
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,494
Yup.

383
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,065
Mwah!

384
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,034
OK, gentlemen,
that was unacceptable.

385
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,903
I want a 'kiss' kiss.

386
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,205
So do I.

387
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,940
Mistletoe...

388
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,583
Oooh, Merry Christmas!

389
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,418
That's more like it.

390
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,189
Well, I've got to get to bed.

391
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,457
Good night.

392
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,931
I'm so sorry.

393
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:45,371
♪

394
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,455
You scared the hell out of me.

395
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,556
Sorry.

396
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,093
I couldn't fall asleep;
I'm kind of a night person.

397
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,461
Night person?

398
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,998
I'm not familiar with that term.

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,569
Pull up a chair.
The meeting's just begun.

400
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,905
And by the way - this is great.

401
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,908
I didn't know...
Did Roy give that to you?

402
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,376
I'm sorry,
I saw it on the table.

403
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,587
I started reading...
I didn't realize...

404
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,112
No, no, it's fine.

405
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,281
I gave it to Roy to read, and...

406
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,286
You really liked it?

407
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,421
Like it?

408
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,623
It reminds me
of my favorite book:

409
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,624
The Princess Bride.

410
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,960
- You're kidding.
- No... Why? Is that bad?

411
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,929
No. I...

412
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,332
That's pretty much exactly
what I was going for.

413
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah?

414
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
Well, I think it's awesome.

415
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,714
You don't happen
to moonlight as an editor

416
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,640
for a publishing house, do you?

417
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,507
Sorry.

418
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,943
I've got as many
jobs as I can handle.

419
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,045
Between working at the nursery,

420
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,147
going to AA meetings,

421
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,249
and staying sober.

422
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,552
That can't be easy.

423
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,554
No, but it's so worth it.

424
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,624
The good news is -
my alcoholism isn't that bad.

425
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,293
I can drink
as much wine as I want.

426
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,132
It's milk, man.
I'm just messin' with you.

427
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,703
It's going to be fine.

428
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,206
You and Kirk
will have a beautiful wedding.

429
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,710
No, I mean,
I've never done anything so big.

430
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,049
Three-hundred guests.

431
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,253
I don't even know
where to begin.

432
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,727
Remember when we used to
hang out in my dorm room -

433
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:53,332
and you'd tell me you wanted
to get married on the beach...

434
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,502
and everybody in the wedding
party would wear white...

435
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,405
and I would sing
Amazing Grace...

436
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,574
and then after the ceremony
we'd all dance in the sand?

437
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,044
Yeah.

438
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,518
You know the one thing
that surprised me

439
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:18,190
after 18 months of stone cold,
sober therapy is that,

440
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,393
I had issues about
the fact that I was adopted.

441
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,694
Really?

442
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,730
Every other kid
I knew growing up

443
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,199
was so freaking OK
with everything.

444
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,701
And me - I was always
worried about the things

445
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,403
I screwed up in the past,

446
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,173
or the things I was
afraid of in the future.

447
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,777
For some reason,
not knowing where I came from,

448
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,512
or who
my biological parents were -

449
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:43,549
that just really messed me up.

450
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,317
And we all thought maybe

451
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,519
I secretly hated myself
for being gay.

452
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,389
But turns out,
being gay - no problem.

453
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,826
Being adopted -
that just freaked me out.

454
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,728
So, how did you quit drinking?

455
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,399
Well, I had a really big week.

456
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,101
First, I got pulled over
for a DUI.

457
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,171
So, of course,
I immediately got drunk

458
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,807
and started driving around
like the idiot that I was.

459
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,276
Yeah...

460
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,678
I crashed into a tree.

461
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,647
Damn. And that made you quit?

462
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,050
I didn't really hit bottom
until the next day.

463
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,419
I was coming home
from the hospital

464
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,721
and I passed
the tree that I'd hit.

465
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,692
And just as I got there

466
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,228
this little girl
was walking with her father.

467
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,530
And I realized that,

468
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,167
if she had been in that
very same spot hours earlier,

469
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,835
I would have killed her.

470
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,571
Scared the shit out of me.

471
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,308
So the next day,
I checked myself into rehab -

472
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,877
my third try -

473
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,313
and, you know,
this time I stayed.

474
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,252
Hey, can I show you something
I thought was amazing?

475
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,664
Fear not your destiny,
for you have shaped it well.

476
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,568
I love when the old man
says it to the little boy.

477
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,137
And then when the little boy
says it to the prince...

478
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,238
Incredible.

479
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,376
And the wedding scene, like,
where do you get this stuff?

480
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,577
I think it's awesome.

481
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,346
I'm sorry. What?
I couldn't hear you.

482
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,148
Um, I think it's awesome.

483
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,082
I heard you.

484
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,218
I just wanted
to hear you say it again.

485
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,386
Alana told me you were...

486
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,321
Partially deaf. You're fine.

487
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,189
It's not that bad
when it's one on one.

488
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,901
Most people get
a little weird about it, though.

489
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,561
And they either
ignore me completely, or,

490
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,629
they start...

491
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:38,830
talking...

492
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,232
really...

493
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,400
loud!

494
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,474
♪

495
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,379
Have you talked to Paul at all?

496
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,547
Sort of.

497
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,919
Last night, before bed,
he apologized to me.

498
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,721
That's great...

499
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,855
Isn't it?

500
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,559
I didn't exactly accept.

501
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:16,335
Well, I hope someday
you can forgive him,

502
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,438
because he's really changed.

503
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,409
So, I've got
the entire day planned.

504
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,879
But first, I want to tell you
about this brainstorm

505
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,349
that I had when
I woke up this morning.

506
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,785
Good morning, wedding people.

507
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,621
Good morning, sweetheart.

508
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,357
So here it is...

509
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,393
We begin the ceremony
with a brass fanfare.

510
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,566
I guess that sounds great.

511
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,501
Isn't it perfect?

512
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,602
So, anyway,

513
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,705
I thought we would start
with the big picture items.

514
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,474
Like, exactly where in the yard

515
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,309
you want to have the reception,

516
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,311
how many people
in the wedding party,

517
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,579
things like that.

518
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,348
And then, I've invited
a caterer and florist

519
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,651
to come by and show you
what they think would work.

520
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,855
You know,
we were talking last night,

521
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,724
Alana and I,
and I asked her to tell me

522
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,460
what her perfect wedding
would look like.

523
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,296
Because I thought that would
be a great starting point.

524
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,433
That is so true,
I totally agree.

525
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,468
I mean, for years,
Alana's been talking about

526
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,003
having a big wedding

527
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,339
with a reception
here at the house,

528
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,408
with a tent, and waiters,

529
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,343
and a dance floor, and a band...

530
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,713
I just think it's
going to be so fabulous.

531
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,453
Paul?

532
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,256
I think your dad
needs a little help.

533
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,762
Where is my father?

534
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:54,066
Over here, behind the
gigantic Christmas tree...

535
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,735
that I put together
in the wrong place.

536
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,904
Wait a minute, Dad.

537
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,573
Thanks, thanks.
Just watch your feet there.

538
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,509
An artificial tree?

539
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,044
Mom has pine needle issues.

540
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,546
Yeah, and it's been decreed

541
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,848
that Florida Christmas trees
are unacceptable.

542
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,616
Over here?

543
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,420
- No, no, nope, nope.
- Right... here.

544
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,788
There.

545
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,557
- Spread the legs.
- Good.

546
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,592
Wooo!

547
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,762
I finished reading
your book last night.

548
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,764
It was good. I mean really good.

549
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,665
You wrote a book?

550
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,367
- Not a real book.
- It's totally real.

551
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,436
And it's excellent, Dad.
You should check it out.

552
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,538
It reminded me of another
book I think you'd like,

553
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,083
about a couple of guys
that get married.

554
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,541
It's called
All Through the Night.

555
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,110
I read that one. That was fun.

556
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,645
I see that you're dressed
for the holidays.

557
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,781
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
the manual labor

558
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,416
to begin before lunch.

559
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,927
Well, it reminds me
of a yuletide joke.

560
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,086
No, no, no,
I apologize in advance.

561
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,621
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

562
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,757
Why do nymphomaniacs
love Christmas?

563
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,061
Because it's the one holiday you
can never have too many balls.

564
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,932
It is funny, isn't it?
My son has no sense of humor.

565
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,434
I'll get you that book.

566
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,970
Thanks for your help, guys.

567
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,773
And it was a good joke.

568
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,978
You'll get used to my dad.

569
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,747
Where is it?

570
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,749
Got it.

571
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,553
Well, thank you.

572
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,022
I'm gonna take a shower.

573
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,597
- Yeah.
- OK, great.

574
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,467
Tree's in place... Gavin helped.

575
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,802
Wonderful.

576
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,903
And the location?

577
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:41,106
The location is exact.
Christmas remains unmarred.

578
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,507
I love you.

579
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,044
So, Alana,
when are we expecting Kirk?

580
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,185
He'll be here
around lunchtime, Daddy.

581
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,187
And we'll let you know
as soon as he arrives.

582
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,221
Excellent.

583
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,423
I'm glad he's gonna
be here for the planning.

584
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,793
I think I'm gonna
stretch my legs for a minute.

585
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,862
Does anybody have
any idea where Gavin is?

586
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,630
I think he's upstairs with Paul.

587
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,665
Great.

588
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,768
How is the planning going?

589
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,069
It's coming along.

590
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,949
That's my least-favorite photo.

591
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,119
Why?

592
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,490
I was drunk
when we took that picture.

593
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,460
I keep it around as a reminder.

594
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,661
In fact, it was right...

595
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:37,963
- Aw.
- I'm sorry.

596
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,979
Hey, Paul, you in here?

597
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,083
Hey, Roy.

598
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,818
Hey, Paul.

599
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,686
What are you doing down there?

600
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:07,826
Um, I was, um,
I was getting this book...

601
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,627
that I dropped.

602
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,562
This book
I was getting for Gavin.

603
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,264
Have you seen him?

604
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,699
- Who?
- Gavin.

605
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,570
No... Yes... No... Not really.

606
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,640
What I mean is, yes,
he was in the living room

607
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,708
when we were
setting up the tree.

608
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,543
I guess, I don't know, maybe...

609
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,712
Is that his manuscript?

610
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:28,980
I've been looking for it.

611
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,650
I left it downstairs yesterday.

612
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,123
Did you read it?

613
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,791
Yeah.

614
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,960
You've got a very
talented boyfriend, Roy.

615
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,061
I think it's awesome.

616
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,963
I haven't read it yet.

617
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,968
You should.
I think you'll love it.

618
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,737
"Fear not your destiny,
for you have shaped it well."

619
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,106
- What?
- Nothing.

620
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,140
It's just a line from
his book that I really liked.

621
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,811
Listen...

622
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,648
I've been thinking...
about what you said last night.

623
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,052
And I'm glad
that you're doing well.

624
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,688
I am.

625
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,991
I'm glad you're doing well, too.

626
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,194
Gavin is... Well, he's great.

627
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,597
Hey, Roy, we need you!

628
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,932
I'll be right there!

629
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,072
I should get back
to the wedding thing.

630
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,307
It's not going well.

631
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,675
I noticed.

632
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,822
Wow.

633
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,325
You should get out of here.

634
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,109
♪

635
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,068
Escaping the madness?

636
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,139
Maybe a little.

637
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,946
♪ ♪

638
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,787
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

639
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,821
I brought lunch.

640
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,757
Hey, Kirk Corbett,
the son of a preacher man!

641
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,859
- Hey, Pop.
- I brought cake!

642
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,796
Zack, Kirk,
welcome, welcome, welcome.

643
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,864
Hey, where's Alana?

644
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,199
Merry Christmas.

645
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,101
I don't know - where is Alana?

646
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:07,372
And Kirk goes, "Excuse me, Miss,

647
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,375
but you're having
a costume malfunction."

648
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:15,246
And I look, and I'd tucked
my skirt into my underpants!

649
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,849
And he was the only one
brave enough to say anything.

650
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,153
Kirk's here with lunch.

651
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,922
Great. I'll be in in a minute.

652
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,192
A few days later,
I ran into Kirk.

653
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,294
And it could have been awkward.

654
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,763
But he comes
right up to me and says,

655
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,732
"I once gave an
entire presentation

656
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,301
with my fly unzipped."

657
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:42,207
And then, he says, "I really
hope I haven't blown it,

658
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,243
because after we get to know
each other a little better,

659
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,078
I'm gonna ask you to marry me."

660
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,848
OK, now I'm in love with him.

661
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,852
I wish I could just
snap my fingers and be married -

662
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:58,990
without the whole big church,
fancy gown, 300 guests.

663
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,894
Do you guys
even know 300 people?

664
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,796
Mommy and Daddy
are paying for this.

665
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,764
How am I supposed
to tell them who to invite?

666
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,067
Um, "Mom, Dad...

667
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,836
Kirk and I would really prefer
a more intimate ceremony."

668
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,272
Can't do that.

669
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,940
Of course you can.

670
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,814
Lahnie, you know if you
and Kirk really want to

671
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,186
just snap your fingers
and be married,

672
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,278
you can do that.

673
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,954
But I wanted to know
about your wedding.

674
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,358
Well, Richard and I
were hippies...

675
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,860
Yeah, well this was
pre-bidding war.

676
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,863
In fact, when Meryl and I were
young, we didn't have anything.

677
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,832
We got married
in a field of wildflowers.

678
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah, I got stung by a bee.

679
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,537
- You did not.
- I did too.

680
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,571
And my friend, Brice,

681
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,107
played the acoustic guitar
and sang folk songs.

682
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,342
And Richard had a ponytail.

683
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,978
Daddy was a dreamboat.

684
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:57,382
And Meryl wore this
beautiful blue peasant shirt,

685
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,417
that was just...

686
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,353
Well, trust me, she...
You were beautiful, sweetheart.

687
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,788
And we wore beads.

688
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,491
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, a lot of beads.

689
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,027
- I thought you looked fierce.
- I don't remember that.

690
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,195
That reminds me of a joke.

691
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,096
- Ohhhh.
- OK, so...

692
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,998
A guy walks into
the doctor's office,

693
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,868
and the doctor says, "I got
some bad news and worse news."

694
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,312
And the guys says,
"Well, God, that's awful.

695
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,004
Well, give me
the bad news first."

696
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,540
And the doctor says,
"OK, well, the bad news is,

697
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,376
you've got cancer;
you'll be dead in five years."

698
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,078
And guys says,
"Well, Jesus Christ!

699
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,880
What's the worse news?"

700
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,082
And the doctor says,
"You've got Alzheimer's."

701
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,551
The guy looks at the doctor
for a second and he says,

702
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,887
"Well, at least
I don't have cancer."

703
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,562
Excuse me.

704
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,004
OK, that was bad.

705
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,082
Hey, Kirk, take a walk with me.

706
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,462
So, remember how you and Alana

707
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,864
wanted an intimate
little wedding?

708
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,408
Yeah, we were going
to do it right out here.

709
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,900
Yeah.

710
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,502
What do you think about this?

711
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,844
Boy...

712
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,214
I'm so sorry, Merry.

713
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,483
It was only a joke,
it didn't mean anything.

714
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,952
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

715
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,321
You're about as far
from fine as you can be.

716
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,623
Well, I mean, yes,
I've got this disease.

717
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,892
But I'm taking the medicine
the doctor gave me.

718
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,394
I'm doing the mental exercises.

719
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,896
He says we can
do something about this -

720
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,231
you know, to slow it down.

721
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:57,101
It's not all happening at once.
I'm not...

722
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,071
I'm still here... Really.

723
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,175
I'm just so afraid
that you're gonna forget.

724
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,145
Forget what?

725
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,147
Everything.

726
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,187
But, you know...

727
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,955
if there's one thing
you won't forget,

728
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,257
it's your daughter's wedding.

729
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,992
We are going to make that day

730
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,594
so big, so beautiful,
so special...

731
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,364
that no one will ever forget it.

732
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,241
Tessa Quince... My card.

733
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:40,011
Thank you so much
for coming out today.

734
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,978
My pleasure.

735
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,682
Now, since you'll be
having a June wedding,

736
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,318
for appetizers,
I would recommend...

737
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,553
That reminds me.

738
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,688
I read this article,
and it had something

739
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,391
that sounded so fabulous.
Here it is.

740
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,427
Seared scallops with
orange and jalapeño vinaigrette.

741
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,497
What about a salad?

742
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,534
Because you wanted
something simple, right?

743
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,437
How about the seared scallops
on a bed of endive?

744
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,439
Or just a simple salad.

745
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,708
I kind of like Caesar's salad.

746
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,380
And exactly how many of you
are getting married, again?

747
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,292
Hey, Dad, I think you better
run to the store.

748
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,027
We're running
a little low on lights.

749
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,463
Well, your mother
had a concept last year.

750
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,465
We may have overdone it a bit.

751
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,500
Here.

752
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,370
Hey, Gavin...

753
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:41,005
Did you see that caterer?

754
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,141
Yeah, a little... tightly wound.

755
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,076
You think?

756
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,744
- Instant resume.
- What?

757
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,012
Instant resume.

758
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,648
You just sort of make up stuff
about somebody you don't know.

759
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,393
Or you could do it about
somebody you do know.

760
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,751
Like, um, Paul.

761
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,886
Sure.

762
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,423
So my instant resume would
be something like, drunk.

763
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,526
Blackout drunk
with adoption issues.

764
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,161
A real work in progress.

765
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,429
True.

766
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,030
Favorite food, pizza.

767
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,232
- Cries at sunsets.
- Really?

768
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,333
Not all of them.

769
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,502
I get the idea.

770
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,138
So now we do one for Tessa.

771
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,807
Like, favorite piece
of clothing?

772
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,074
Gray pants suit.

773
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,376
Chastity belt!

774
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,446
Thigh-high,
black stiletto boots.

775
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,181
No... Dominatrix?

776
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,283
OK, you're excellent
at this game.

777
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,385
Tessa's favorite expression?

778
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,189
"I did not say
you could touch me there."

779
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,324
"I'll give you
something to cry about."

780
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,359
"There are no
safe words with me."

781
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,398
So, Gavin seems nice.

782
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,833
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,668
How long have
you guys been together?

784
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:48,639
Since, fall... Autumn, autumn.

785
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,809
You've been seeing
each other for, like, months?

786
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,344
Why didn't you tell me?

787
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,413
My God... What did he say when

788
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,248
that weird guy
tried to pick you up

789
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,250
from the drug store last week?

790
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,351
Do you remember him?

791
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,420
Yeah, no, I I...

792
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,289
I didn't, um, he... He didn't...

793
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,091
He thought it was so funny.

794
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,427
I'm going to get back to the...

795
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,062
We'll talk about this later.

796
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,866
So, if I understand
you correctly,

797
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,801
you would like
a simple wedding...

798
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,136
Chrysanthemums...

799
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,838
daisies...

800
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,540
orchids...

801
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,442
daffodils...

802
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:28,412
calla lilies, and dahlias...

803
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,516
tulips...

804
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,850
and roses.

805
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,219
Ecuadorian roses.

806
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,687
Excellent suggestion.

807
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,089
Let me show you...

808
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,326
You know, I love you,

809
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,363
and I can't wait to get
married to you, right?

810
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,865
Well, I can't wait to get
married to you, either.

811
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,435
And you know that it doesn't
matter to me what I'm wearing,

812
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,471
or the flowers, or the food...

813
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,573
It doesn't matter
what you're wearing?

814
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,508
Stop, stop. I'm serious, listen.

815
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,845
I guess what I'm asking is...

816
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,515
What I'm wondering is...

817
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,617
What happened
to your little dream

818
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,321
of being married down here
by the water. You know?

819
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:13,624
Just us, and parents,
and a few friends,

820
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,726
and strings of lights

821
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,362
and Amazing Grace
at sunset and all that?

822
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,599
Well, that changed.

823
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,635
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

824
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,404
If your father weren't sick,

825
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,773
we'd be planning
a small ceremony, right?

826
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,175
Your perfect little wedding?

827
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,238
I think everything
looks pretty good.

828
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,540
Don't you think?

829
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,675
Yeah. I think it's
our best year yet.

830
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,682
You know, I think the men
should all wear tuxedos.

831
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:15,486
Because there's nothing more
handsome than a man in a tuxedo.

832
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,292
God, this family loves charades.

833
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,893
Can you come out for a second?

834
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,262
Just pretend like
you're still working...

835
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,198
OK.

836
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,571
You know, I actually
think last year, at Christmas,

837
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,606
this was all I wore.

838
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,011
So, can you help us?

839
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,546
Sure. Do you think we can
get everything done in time?

840
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,481
I hope so.

841
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,349
I really want to be ready,
just in case.

842
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,752
We've gotta hurry;
sunset's in two hours.

843
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,757
I love having
this much help this year.

844
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,458
It's fabulous.

845
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,960
Anything for you, Mom.

846
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,297
Yeah, it's great
having you help out here.

847
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,001
Come outside for a second, OK?

848
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,236
OK.

849
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:13,778
Looking good, man.

850
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,012
What's going on?

851
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,914
Paul and I were talking,
and we know what.

852
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,649
Alana's perfect wedding
would look like.

853
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:22,653
And it doesn't have tuxedos,
or 300 guests under a tent,

854
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,021
and a covered walkway.

855
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,557
So I've decided I'm going
to ask her to marry me.

856
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,893
You already asked her.

857
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,629
He means ask her
to marry him tonight.

858
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,531
Wow. What can I do to help?

859
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,067
We need flowers, and I need
a ride over to the nursery.

860
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,068
You got it.

861
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,669
- Go!
- Take my truck.

862
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,907
You really think Alana's gonna
want to do this right now?

863
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,041
I don't know.

864
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,410
I just want her to know
that we can do what she wants.

865
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,912
Hi, everyone!

866
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,548
What's happening?

867
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,857
Merry?

868
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,829
Can you, um...

869
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,632
I need to ask you a question.

870
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:12,970
OK.

871
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:18,109
I know you're planning
this June wedding for Alana,

872
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,979
and I just wanted
to know if, um...

873
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,681
if you...

874
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,550
Are you sure
this is what Alana wants?

875
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:27,818
Of course it is.

876
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:29,096
I mean, we've been
talking about this

877
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,087
for I don't know how long.

878
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,590
Is it possible you've
been talking about it

879
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,025
since I got diagnosed
with early-onset?

880
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,363
I don't know.
I suppose it's possible.

881
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,800
And you know how Alana's
always wanted a big wedding,

882
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,669
and a reception in the backyard?

883
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:48,005
Of course, that's exactly
why we're doing this.

884
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,541
I think that was when
she was a teenager.

885
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,748
♪

886
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:58,783
Come on!

887
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:03,053
So, do you have any
experience with weddings?

888
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,055
Well, I was ring bearer
for my cousin Jill.

889
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,391
I was five.

890
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,527
Wore a powder blue tux.

891
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,428
- Very hot.
- I bet you were.

892
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,873
But I was actually wondering
if you ever wrote anything

893
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,632
for a wedding ceremony.

894
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,066
You know, like, vows?

895
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,701
Yeah.

896
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,780
Kirk was worried about the
vows, and I kind of told him

897
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:22,506
you were a great writer,
so I volunteered us to help.

898
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,809
We're... We're writing the vows?

899
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,079
What do you mean?

900
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:32,049
I mean, I think Alana
wanted a big wedding,

901
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,418
when she was a teenager.

902
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,755
I don't think
she wants one any more.

903
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,790
Well, then why
didn't she say something?

904
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,994
Why would she spend
this entire holiday

905
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,096
planning a big wedding
if she doesn't want one?

906
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:57,107
Because she thinks you want one.

907
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:02,580
So that when the disease
starts to affect me...

908
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,149
it will be easier
for me to remember.

909
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,656
I need you
to understand something.

910
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,060
What?

911
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:21,098
They haven't invented a disease
that will make me forget you,

912
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,201
or Paul...

913
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:27,638
or Alana...
or how much I love all of you.

914
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,208
Maybe my body will stop working,

915
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,944
maybe even my mind,
but my heart...

916
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,615
That's... where...

917
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,487
Alzheimer's isn't gonna
touch my heart.

918
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,126
I'm just so afraid.

919
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,462
Me too.

920
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,566
But even though I've
got this disease,

921
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,568

we're both afraid,

1071
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:11,581
You realize that you've just
hosted the perfect wedding?

1072
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:14,851
Pizza and Chinese food
at my daughter's wedding -

1073
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,120
it's a complete disaster.

1074
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,348
Amazing.

1075
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,417
You got Roy
one of his crazy games.

1076
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,386
I... um...

1077
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,922
I didn't know how complicated
the instructions were gonna be.

1078
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,425
And part of the gift
is playing it with him,

1079
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,360
but, holy crap.

1080
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:36,433
Each player's army consists
of five trolls, eight elves,

1081
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:41,404
eleven warriors, two gnomes,
an aardvark, two werewolves,

1082
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,906
and a monarch.

1083
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,941
If the expansion pack is used,

1084
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,977
power zerts
are distributed and...

1085
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,179
What's a power zert?

1086
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,882
You must...
You must really love him.

1087
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,654
Power zerts...

1088
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,624
It says here there are 96

1089
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,393
to be distributed
between the players.

1090
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,563
Let's start with that.

1091
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:10,734
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:16,740
You know, we never did
an instant resume for you.

1093
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,375
You're right.

1094
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,610
So let me begin.

1095
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:23,847
College graduate, English major.

1096
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,317
Not too tough,
considering I wrote a book.

1097
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,686
OK, we can dig a little deeper.

1098
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,456
Let's see...
Favorite piece of clothing:

1099
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:41,531
your father's polyester
disco shirt, circa 1975.

1100
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,433
Woo!

1101
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,936
Not really.

1102
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,639
My dad partied alone
at the local bar

1103
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,608
before he came home every night.

1104
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,643
He was an alcoholic.

1105
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,014
Was?

1106
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,750
Yeah. He, um,
died three years ago.

1107
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,285
I'm sorry.

1108
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,887
No, no, no, no, it's OK.

1109
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,989
He got sober before he died,

1110
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,757
and we caught up
on a lot we missed

1111
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,492
when he was drinking.

1112
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:12,495
Anyway, I know a lot
about the work you're doing -

1113
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:13,763
you know, in AA?

1114
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:19,803
And I...
I really admire, and I...

1115
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,673
Well, I'm...
I'm really impressed.

1116
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,978
Wow...

1117
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,547
That was kind of heavy.

1118
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,852
Want to, um...
Want to get back to the resume?

1119
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,420
Sure.

1120
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,758
How about guilty pleasures?

1121
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:46,863
Oooh, yes, I can work with this.

1122
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,965
Ummm...

1123
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,802
Chocolate chip waffles
and ice cream for dinner.

1124
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:53,870
Wow.

1125
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,875
I thought you were
gonna go for guilty...

1126
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,744
musical pleasures.

1127
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,680
OK. Sure.

1128
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,415
No problem.
The Partridge Family.

1129
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,951
No, no.

1130
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,855
Abba.

1131
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,126
No way.

1132
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,494
Way.

1133
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,562
- Wait, are you... Really?
- Yeah.

1134
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,832
First kiss: Curt Lombardi,
freshman year in high school.

1135
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,068
Fernando was playing
on the radio.

1136
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,470
Wow.

1137
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,477
Next topic.

1138
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,515
Hopes and dreams.

1139
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,651
You know, things to do
before you die.

1140
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,489
Actually, I'm taking care
of one of my dreams in January.

1141
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,593
I'm going to California.

1142
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:51,795
Really?

1143
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,564
Yeah. I, um...

1144
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,433
I got this job
translating for a deaf teacher

1145
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:01,905
at a college in Berkeley,
and, um...

1146
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,374
Well, I'm gonna be
living out west for a while.

1147
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,946
My God, that's...

1148
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,148
You're going to California.

1149
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,783
I had no idea.

1150
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:17,787
Yeah, I'll...
I'll be there until June.

1151
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,892
You're gonna be gone six months?

1152
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:24,861
What does, um...

1153
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,397
What does Roy
think about all this?

1154
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,035
He...

1155
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,071
This was on the radar when
we got back together again,

1156
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,706
so he's on board.

1157
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:43,513
Six months in California...

1158
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,881
I'm almost afraid to ask

1159
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,450
about the rest of
your hopes and dreams.

1160
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:51,855
You know - get married,
have a family, the usual.

1161
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,057
Hey, me too.

1162
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:59,195
Although I hear adopted children
can be a real handful.

1163
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,967
I don't know. I've met a few...
and I like them.

1164
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,507
How about you?

1165
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,877
What do you
want to do before you die?

1166
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,581
I'm still learning how to live
moment to moment - you know?

1167
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:23,586
Not dwelling on how
I screwed up the past,

1168
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,991
not worrying about if I'm
going to screw up my future.

1169
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,860
I'm just trying very hard
to focus on today.

1170
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:37,133
So I guess, for me...

1171
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,203
I'm just trying to find a good
guy to spend my todays with.

1172
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,908
You know...

1173
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,744
Someone to walk beside me.

1174
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,221
My God, I can't.

1175
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,555
- No.
- I can't.

1176
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:01,224
This isn't...
Man, I can't do this.

1177
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,725
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1178
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:04,193
- Paul...
- I'm so sorry.

1179
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,639
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1180
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,174
Merry Christmas!

1181
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,743
Hey, has anybody seen Paul?

1182
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:22,011
He's outside with Zack.

1183
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:23,179
How about Gavin?

1184
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,882
I think he's still asleep.
He was up late.

1185
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,850
Watching the
Christmas Eve service

1186
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,018
from the Vatican, no doubt.

1187
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:30,320
Something like that.

1188
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:31,988
Is there extra coffee?

1189
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,091
I'm gonna wake up Gavin
because I want to open presents.

1190
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,028
And then I kissed him...

1191
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,964
I fucking kissed him.

1192
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,900
How could I be
such a self-absorbed jerk?

1193
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,568
And what did Gavin do?

1194
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,271
You mean after I kissed him
like a gigantic shithead?

1195
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,806
Yeah.

1196
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,977
I don't know what he said.
He was saying something.

1197
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,578
I was just
stammering out an apology,

1198
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,846
and then I ran away.

1199
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,084
And I know that AA tells us that
anger is the dubious luxury

1200
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,962
of the normal man,
and I can't afford to be angry,

1201
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,921
because I'm an alcoholic.

1202
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,790
I'm just so angry
at myself right now,

1203
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:09,258
I don't know what to do.

1204
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,195
I can't be that guy any more -

1205
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,897
the guy who just
breaks up relationships because

1206
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:18,735
he thinks someone's cute,
or nice, or whatever.

1207
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,238
So what are you gonna do?

1208
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,074
I don't know.

1209
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,715
I guess I'm going
to apologize to Gavin...

1210
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,318
make sure he knows that
the last thing I want to do

1211
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,720
is come between him and Roy.

1212
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,758
Jesus, that's the
last thing I want to do.

1213
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,730
So, how did you and Gavin meet?

1214
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,966
Well...

1215
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:55,605
We went out
after high school, and...

1216
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,781
Alana isn't around, is she?

1217
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,783
What? No.

1218
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:07,884
Good.

1219
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,752
I really need
to tell somebody this.

1220
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:17,893
Gavin?

1221
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,199
Gavin, are you awake?

1222
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:28,171
Merry Christmas, Gavin.
It's time to wake up.

1223
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,854
I couldn't face Paul alone.

1224
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,324
I totally understand
why you'd be nervous.

1225
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,993
But he's really changed.

1226
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:54,931
He's acting completely different
than his old asshole self.

1227
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,066
I'm acting exactly like
my old asshole self!

1228
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,336
Well, not exactly.

1229
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,439
What do you mean?

1230
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,809
Well, what would
your old asshole self

1231
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,044
have done last night?

1232
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,979
Kissed Gavin,
which is exactly what I did.

1233
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,848
No, after that.

1234
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:15,184
Well, I would have
kept kissing him.

1235
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,853
And then?

1236
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,488
And then I would have
slept with him.

1237
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,256
You didn't do that, did you?

1238
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,394
No.

1239
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:32,468
So, what about Gavin?

1240
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,005
What do you mean?

1241
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,442
Well, what do you
think about him?

1242
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:44,480
Well, I think he's...

1243
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,818
I know I just met him,

1244
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,120
but I think we might
be great together.

1245
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,191
I mean, I felt this connection
between us when we were talking.

1246
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:58,861
And?

1247
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:05,101
And he's with Roy.

1248
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,336
And?

1249
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:15,511
So whether I felt
a connection or not...

1250
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,380
I'm walking away.

1251
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,384
Hey, Roy.

1252
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:22,385
Hey.

1253
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,987
I just tried to wake up Gavin.

1254
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:26,088
And?

1255
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:29,825
And he's gone, his suitcase,
his clothes, everything.

1256
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,262
I liked Gavin.

1257
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:35,231
I know. He was really nice.

1258
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,332
Hey, did you see this?

1259
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,040
"Dear Roy:

1260
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,209
I'm sorry I had
to leave so suddenly.

1261
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,377
Something came up
and it's complicated.

1262
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,580
I have to leave
for California soon anyway,

1263
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,449
and I found a really
cheap flight online.

1264
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:57,286
It leaves tonight,
so I'm catching the bus home.

1265
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,021
Please tell everyone thank you

1266
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,023
for welcoming me
into the family.

1267
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:03,559
It was the best
Christmas I ever had.

1268
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,895
Love, Gavin Greene.

1269
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:08,898
P.S.

1270
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,299
No matter what Paul might say,

1271
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,169
it was my fault entirely.

1272
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,571
He did nothing wrong.

1273
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,173
And for what it's worth,

1274
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,308
"I think you'd be
really great together."

1275
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,945
What the hell does that mean?

1276
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:25,281
What did Paul do?

1277
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,216
What's going on?

1278
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,584
Gavin disappeared.

1279
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,419
He must've left
early this morning.

1280
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,254
What?

1281
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,489
He said he was
going to California.

1282
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,592
So what happened?

1283
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,210
Last night...

1284
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,479
we were up late,

1285
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,347
reading the directions
to this game

1286
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,383
that Gavin got for you.

1287
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,251
And...

1288
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:08,224
We were talking about
making plans for the future,

1289
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,159
and that kind of stuff,

1290
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,061
and I...

1291
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,101
Well, I... I kissed him.

1292
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:22,638
But that was it, man.

1293
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,373
It was completely my fault, Roy.

1294
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:26,075
Jesus, I'm so sorry.

1295
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:33,516
So, do you want to get
back together with Paul?

1296
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,617
What?

1297
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,651
What?

1298
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,119
No.

1299
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:40,056
I'm... I'm sorry...

1300
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,557
But no!

1301
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,461
So then,
are you going to tell Paul?

1302
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,167
Tell me what?

1303
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,036
I'm...

1304
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,573
I'm so sorry.

1305
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:03,479
Gavin was just
pretending to be my boyfriend.

1306
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,285
I asked him to
so that you wouldn't think

1307
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:14,290
I was a pathetic loser
for still being single after,

1308
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,193
you know, what happened
between us.

1309
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,462
My God.

1310
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:23,032
You were never a loser, Roy.

1311
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,068
It was always me.
And it still is, isn't it?

1312
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,436
I mean, I kissed Gavin,

1313
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,472
even though I thought
he was your boyfriend.

1314
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:34,710
And then you stopped,
before anything happened,

1315
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,645
and you walked away.

1316
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:40,049
So I did the right thing?

1317
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,084
Yeah, after you did
the wrong thing.

1318
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,486
I've been there.

1319
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,960
You...

1320
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,497
You actually like Gavin?

1321
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,466
I do.

1322
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,772
So is that it?

1323
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,173
What do you mean?

1324
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,142
You're just gonna let him leave?

1325
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,113
What was the line you liked
from Gavin's book?

1326
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:17,386
Fear not your destiny,
for you have shaped it well.

1327
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:29,665
So you're saying
I should go after him?

1328
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,003
Duh.

1329
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,406
I should go after him.

1330
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,844
I'm going after him.

1331
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,017
Wait...

1332
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,152
I can't drive.

1333
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:51,487
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

1334
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,822
Shotgun!

1335
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,024
Come on. Let's go, get up!

1336
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,759
I got the keys!

1337
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,561
OK, let's go, everybody!

1338
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,831
Does anybody know how
to get to the bus station?

1339
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,632
I think it's down
near the grocery store.

1340
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,101
No, they moved it! Didn't they?

1341
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,105
His phone
goes right to voicemail!

1342
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,311
Go, Mom, we'll figure it out!

1343
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:19,281
I'm pretty sure
it's by the grocery store.

1344
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,383
Are we completely confident
he's at the bus station?

1345
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:22,451
My God.

1346
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,421
That must have been
one hell of a kiss.

1347
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,690
- This reminds me of a joke.
- Not now, Dad.

1348
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:33,195
♪

1349
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,790
Merry Christmas.

1350
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,327
What are you doing here?

1351
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,735
I needed to tell you something.

1352
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,675
I know Roy
really isn't your boyfriend.

1353
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,380
How did you find out?

1354
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,448
I spoke to him this morning.

1355
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,517
He's still
in love with you, right?

1356
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,820
That's not what he told me.

1357
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,125
What?

1358
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,498
Roy's not in love with me.

1359
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,800
Then he's... crazy.

1360
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,771
Well, I think Roy's crazy

1361
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,472
because he's not
in love with you.

1362
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,579
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

1363
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:09,925
So, um...

1364
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,162
I came to, tell you two things.

1365
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,299
The first one's
a little embarrassing.

1366
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:22,871
There was a time
when I was drinking...

1367
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:25,641
what happened last night

1368
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,177
would have happened
because you had a boyfriend.

1369
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:31,280
But last night was different.

1370
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,450
I didn't want...

1371
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,953
What happened last night

1372
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:41,223
happened despite the fact
you had a boyfriend.

1373
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,494
I mean, despite the fact that
I thought you had a boyfriend.

1374
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,499
If I had the courage to say it,
I would have told you

1375
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:53,502
what I thought of you
as soon as I got to know you...

1376
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,571
That Roy is a lucky man,

1377
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,373
and I wish that I had met you

1378
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,617
before you got together
with him.

1379
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:01,443
- But we aren't...
- I know, I know.

1380
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:03,712
And that's why I have
this other thing to tell you.

1381
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:07,583
I came to try to convince
you to take a later flight...

1382
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,718
because I want you
to spend Christmas with me.

1383
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,856
And I really hope
I haven't blown it,

1384
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,391
because...

1385
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,599
Once we get to know
each other a little better...

1386
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,701

to marry me.
