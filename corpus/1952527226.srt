1
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,941
What happens to a dream deferred?

2
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,341
Does it dry up Iike a raisin in the sun?

3
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:13,377
Pull it in up here.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,681
Or fester Iike a sore, and then run?

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,418
Does it stink Iike rotten meat?

6
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:26,860
Or crust and sugar over, Iike a syrupy sweet.

7
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:31,465
Maybe it just sags Iike a heavy Ioad.

8
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:35,261
Or does it expIode?

9
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:40,440
Come on, Johnson, l'm out.
And there's still hot water.

10
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:44,012
-Morning, Lena.
-Morning, Earline.

11
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,794
-Hi.
-Morning.

12
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,391
-Watch your step.
-Morning.

13
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,739
Walter, it's after seven.

14
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:34,724
You're gonna be late.

15
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,117
Travis out of the bathroom yet?

16
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,661
No, not yet, but he will be soon.

17
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,697
And, what's the point
in having an alarm clock

18
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:44,325
if you don't get up when it goes off?

19
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,165
What l need an alarm clock for
when l got you?

20
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:50,968
Only problem is,
l can't just hit a button and turn you off.

21
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,975
Woman.

22
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,275
What kind of eggs you want?

23
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,481
Not scrambled.

24
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:10,749
-Where the paper?
-Where it always is.

25
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,526
What's your problem this morning?

26
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:16,190
l don't have a problem. And l hope
you don't volunteer to become one.

27
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,234
Yeah, you got a problem.

28
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,714
What's that boy doing in the bathroom
all this time?

29
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,515
He's just gonna have
to start getting up earlier.

30
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:41,352
l can't be being late to work on
account of him fooling around in there.

31
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,619
No, he is not gonna be getting up no earlier.

32
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,591
lt's not his fault he can't get to bed at night
because he got a bunch of

33
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:49,530
crazy, loudmouth, good-for-nothing people,
running their mouths

34
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,295
in what's supposed to be his bedroom
after 10:00 at night.

35
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,597
Why they gotta be loudmouths?

36
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,403
Because they are loud, and nothing that
comes out of them mouths is important.

37
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,040
Not enough to keep my little boy awake.

38
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,942
That's what you're mad about, ain't it?

39
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,378
Things l want to talk about with my friends

40
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:07,746
just couldn't be important
in your mind, could they?

41
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,785
Come here.

42
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:15,324
You looking young this morning, baby.

43
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,523
Looking just like how you looked
when l started courting you.

44
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,970
lt's gone now. You look like yourself again.

45
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,767
Just eat your eggs.

46
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,343
You know that insurance check come
tomorrow, don't you?

47
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:37,903
Yeah, l know.
l really don't want to talk about it.

48
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:42,513
l'm out, but you better hurry. l heard
Mr. Johnson coming down the steps.

49
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,022
The check comes tomorrow, right, Mama?

50
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:56,532
Yes, it does, Travis. But it's too early
in the morning to be talking about money

51
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:57,964
so just eat your breakfast.

52
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,695
But l need fifty cents.

53
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,237
-For what?
-For the poor Negroes in history.

54
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,363
For the what?

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,773
Teacher says we gotta do something about
teaching colored kids about they history.

56
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:11,507
''Their'' history. And what's that got to
do with fifty cents and poor Negroes?

57
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:14,106
All us kids are putting in fifty cents
to buy special books

58
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,709
that'll tell us about the things
the poor Negroes did.

59
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,947
ls that the way the teacher put it,
the ''poor Negroes''?

60
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:21,081
Yes, ma'am. That's the way
she always puts it.

61
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,955
And they need fifty cents for
special books for the poor Negroes.

62
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:26,393
-Yes, Mama, that's what l said.
-l don't have it.

63
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:28,658
But l don't want to be the only one
without the money, Ma.

64
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,892
l said l don't have it, Travis.

65
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,335
Just eat your breakfast.

66
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,338
l'm finished.

67
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:42,175
Then go on and make up your bed.

68
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,254
Can l maybe bag groceries
at the market after...

69
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,452
Travis.

70
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,332
And no sweet rolls today,
Mr. Angry Little Man.

71
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:08,461
You wanna have all your teeth
in your head when you get older.

72
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:09,800
l'm gone.

73
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:24,745
''l know that woman wants me
to kiss her goodbye, but l'll fix her.

74
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,584
''l won't kiss her, and she'll be sorry.

75
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,026
''l won't kiss her goodbye
for nothing in this world,

76
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:34,393
'''cause l know that's
just what she wants me to do.''

77
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,865
Mama.

78
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:41,565
Can l please bag groceries? Can l, Mama?

79
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:44,139
-What is it he want to do?
-Bag groceries after school.

80
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:48,109
-For the poor Negroes in history, Dad.
-Travis. No.

81
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:51,974
-School's raising money for something.
-l gotta have fifty cents.

82
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:55,279
-Why don't you give it to him?
-'Cause we don't have it.

83
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,650
What you going telling the boy
things like that for?

84
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,184
Come here, Travis.

85
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,286
Thanks, Daddy.

86
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:12,126
ln fact, here's another fifty cents.

87
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:15,834
Why don't you go buy yourself some fruit
or take a taxicab to school or something.

88
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:18,465
Hot dog! Thanks, Daddy.

89
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,077
-Go on to school now. Don't be late.
-All right.

90
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,705
That's my boy.

91
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,152
What?

92
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,156
Know what l was thinking about
in the bathroom this morning?

93
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,031
-No.
-Charlie Atkins.

94
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,397
-You remember Charlie Atkins?
-No.

95
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,937
You remember.

96
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:54,168
Remember, he wanted me to go
in that dry cleaning business with him.

97
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,542
Now he's grossing $100,000 a year.

98
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:57,910
$100,000.

99
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,972
-That's nice, Walter.
-That could have been me.

100
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,676
That could have been us.

101
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,378
But he stepped up and l held back.

102
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,977
Walter, you didn't have any money.

103
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:08,148
That was true, then. This is now.
This is our time, baby.

104
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,886
Walter, if you're gonna
talk to me about that check...

105
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,894
Me, Willy and Bobo,
we got this thing figured out.

106
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,224
Bobo?

107
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:17,232
Walter, l got nothing to do with that check.

108
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:27,135
You're tired, ain't you, baby?
Tired of everything.

109
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:30,710
Me, the boy, the way we live.

110
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:35,712
So tired you couldn't do nothing
to help us out, could you?

111
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,218
Walter.

112
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,982
Mama will listen to you.

113
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,456
You know she listens to you more
than she listens to anybody else.

114
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:44,753
That's all l need you to do.

115
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:47,295
Tomorrow morning when you're
sitting down drinking your coffee,

116
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:49,695
just sip on your coffee, real easy like,

117
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:53,497
and talk to her like what you're saying
ain't really that important to you.

118
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:56,402
Then sip on your coffee some more

119
00:08:57,473 --> 00:09:01,068
and tell her that you've been thinking about
the deal Walter Lee is so interested in.

120
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:03,806
And before you know it, she'll be
listening good, asking you questions,

121
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,780
and when l come home
l can fill her in on all the details.

122
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:06,906
No, Walter, no.

123
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,247
This ain't no fly-by-night proposition, baby.

124
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:10,843
-This is real.
-They're all real.

125
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,081
All the schemes that go nowhere.

126
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:15,750
-Not like this one.
-No, Walter.

127
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:17,224
Why not?

128
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:22,225
First of all, l'm not gonna be
pretending anything with your mother.

129
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:25,267
Now that's your nonsense. That's not mine.

130
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:29,396
And second of all,
the money doesn't belong to us, Walter.

131
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,032
-lt's your mother's money.
-What's she gonna do with it?

132
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:36,745
Walter, just finish your breakfast.
Come on, go to work.

133
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:39,247
-Why can't you listen to me?
-Walter, don't shout at me.

134
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,714
That's the only way
l can get through to you.

135
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,273
Walter, please.

136
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,959
Ruth. Ruth, listen.

137
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:58,363
Now it normally costs $75,000,
to get into something

138
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,867
like we're thinking about getting into,

139
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,496
but Willy knows somebody
that can get us in for 30.

140
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,403
That's 10,000 three ways.

141
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,873
Plus a little something extra
to spread around

142
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,807
to the people to get the licenses approved.

143
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,641
-You mean bribes?
-Don't call it that.

144
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:14,342
This is business. Don't nothing happen in
this world unless somebody's getting paid.

145
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,317
Walter, eat your eggs.

146
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:19,753
That's it? ''Eat your eggs''?

147
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:23,517
Walter, that ain't none of our money.

148
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,836
This morning l get up.

149
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,337
l go to a bathroom l gotta share
with two floors of people.

150
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,810
l look in the mirror.

151
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:50,853
Thirty-five years old,
been married eleven years.

152
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:54,787
l got a boy who sleeps in the living room.

153
00:10:56,392 --> 00:11:00,556
And all l got to tell him are stories
about how rich, white people live.

154
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,033
Walter, eat your eggs.

155
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,932
Damn these eggs.
Damn all the eggs that ever was!

156
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,771
Fine. Just go to work!

157
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,833
See, that says it all, don't it?

158
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,340
Morning, everybody.

159
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,137
Says just what's wrong with women today.

160
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,441
Don't know how to build your man up,
make them feel like they can be somebody,

161
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,073
-like they can do something.
-You know, not all women are like that.

162
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,174
Just like there are some men
who actually do something.

163
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,242
No thanks to their women.

164
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:27,389
l'm gonna start timing people.

165
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,482
You should get up earlier.

166
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,497
Anybody ever tell you, you
a horrible-looking chick in the morning?

167
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,463
Mama left early this morning?

168
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,202
Yeah, her last day.

169
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,109
So how's school coming?

170
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,513
Lovely, just lovely.

171
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,842
As if you really care.

172
00:11:57,153 --> 00:12:00,782
l was just wondering if you made up
your mind and everything.

173
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:04,020
Not too many girls who decide
to become a doctor.

174
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:08,389
Have we figured out exactly how much
medical school is gonna cost?

175
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:11,399
Walter, why don't you leave your sister
alone and get on to work?

176
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,162
You know that check coming tomorrow.

177
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:15,170
The money belongs to Mama, Walter.

178
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:18,536
She can do with it whatever she wants
or do nothing at all.

179
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:21,372
Maybe just nail the check up
on the wall and stare at it all day.

180
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:24,811
lt's hers and not ours. Hers.

181
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,577
Well, now ain't we just
the considerate daughter?

182
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,278
You just got your mother's best
interest at heart, don't you, girl?

183
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:33,322
But it's okay if Mama want to
take a few thousand dollars of her money

184
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,448
-to put you through college.
-l never asked her to do that.

185
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,153
No, but the line between asking
and just accepting when the time comes

186
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:40,593
-is big and wide, ain't it?
-What do you want from me, brother?

187
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:43,257
To quit school or just drop dead? Which?

188
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:45,630
-Either one would suit me fine.
-Walter!

189
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,603
No, l'm sick of Her Holiness sashaying
around here like she all high and mighty.

190
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,572
Me and Ruth,
we done made some sacrifices for you.

191
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:54,201
Now it's time you start making some
sacrifices for the rest of the family.

192
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,507
-Don't you be dragging me into this.
-Oh, no, you are in it.

193
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,171
Aren't you the one that's
taking in other people's

194
00:12:58,247 --> 00:12:59,908
dirty laundry to put clothes on her back?

195
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,176
Walter, that ain't fair.

196
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,616
Oh, but it's fair
for Walter not to get anything.

197
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:06,086
No, it's not like anybody expects you to get
on your knees and say,

198
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,146
''Thank you, Walter. Thank you, Mama.

199
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,920
''Thank you, Travis, for wearing
the same pair of shoes the last two years.''

200
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:13,553
Well, l do, all right?

201
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:19,532
Thank you, everybody! Thank you, God!
Thank you, Walter!

202
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,796
Beneatha, stop it.

203
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,565
Forgive me for ever wanting
to be anything at all.

204
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:25,539
Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me!

205
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,769
Who in the hell ever told you
to go be a doctor, anyway?

206
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:28,867
You so crazy about messing
with sick people,

207
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,412
why don't you go be a nurse
like other women?

208
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,673
l'll be what l want to be.

209
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,375
-With somebody else's money.
-lt's Mama's money.

210
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,045
-He was my father, too.
-And mine and Travis's grandfather, too.

211
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,145
Brow-beating me isn't gonna make her
give it to you

212
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,247
to invest in some harebrained scheme.

213
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:46,056
And l, for one,
say ''God Bless Mama'' for that.

214
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,360
Are you listening to her?
Are you listening to her?

215
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:52,265
Will you please just get out of here?
Get on to work, come on.

216
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,099
Nobody in this house is ever gonna
understand me.

217
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,332
'Cause you're a nut.

218
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:58,566
-Who's a nut?
-You.

219
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,632
Thee is mad, boy.

220
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:07,639
The world's most backward
race of women, and that's a fact.

221
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:10,379
And then there's you, a prophet
who would lead us out of the wilderness

222
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,717
-and into the swamps.
-Bennie, why?

223
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:15,313
Why do you have to rile your brother up
so much in the morning?

224
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,916
'Cause it's too much fun not to.

225
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:26,901
l need some money.

226
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,201
Carfare.

227
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,035
What, fifty cents?

228
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:55,594
lf she didn't want to docent
the museum opening, she didn't have to.

229
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,293
Well, yes l am. l am going to get involved.

230
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,267
Because this kind of behavior
can't be tolerated.

231
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:01,928
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

232
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,701
l've have late meetings,
so don't hold supper.

233
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:08,175
Bring the car around for Mr. Arnold.

234
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:12,408
l need to be at the Shipley building at noon.

235
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:13,641
Yes, sir.

236
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,234
Priscilla.

237
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:37,964
l ain't playing no hide and seek, child.
You got to get to school.

238
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:41,270
Well, it looks like you're not in here.

239
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:43,034
And l know you're not in that closet.

240
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:46,673
Not with that big, hairy spider
l saw in there yesterday.

241
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,850
Come on, girl. Put this on.
School bus will be here directly.

242
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:53,884
Are you still leaving?

243
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,947
Yes, l'm still leaving.

244
00:15:56,192 --> 00:16:01,858
And just like yesterday, l expect you to be
a big girl and mind your mother.

245
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:03,955
You hear me?

246
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,126
Yes, Miss Lena.

247
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,827
No sass. No pouting.
And no stomping them little feet.

248
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,098
Turn around.

249
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,745
Bobo, my man.

250
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:59,218
So how we looking?

251
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:03,321
l'm still working on it,
but the check don't come till tomorrow.

252
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,485
So we have time. Seen Willy Harris?

253
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,188
l saw him last night.

254
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:11,461
He asked about you, l told him you're good.
Your word is better than gold.

255
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:15,231
He wants to get together tonight,
nine o'clock at the Green Hat.

256
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,636
Sounds good to me.

257
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:20,539
-l can smell the money, baby.
-Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,370
Let me guess.

259
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,345
This car, he's driving, and this one's yours.

260
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,211
l'm moving it, sir. Right away.

261
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:30,514
Yes, boy, you will. After l cite you.

262
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,585
You, get in your car.

263
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:54,003
Verdi's La Traviata, Randolph Hall,
Friday night. You're with me.

264
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,401
That your idea of asking for a date, George?

265
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,970
lt's more than a date if l'm asking.

266
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,245
Well, l'll have to get back to you.

267
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:09,554
Do so. But tarry not. There are legions
of honeys who would have your place.

268
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:13,189
Goodbye, George. l've got a class.

269
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,239
Relax. lt's coming.

270
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,553
Very good.

271
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:44,819
Were all my students like you,
l would be an even happier man.

272
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:49,092
l don't need false flattery, Asagai.
l do quite well with the truth.

273
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,933
Well, then, l guess l shall tell you the truth.

274
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,669
You are not very good.

275
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,803
You are excellent.

276
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,045
You really think so?

277
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,516
Yes. l am happy with you.

278
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:23,460
l would be even happier if l could take you
out on one of your dates.

279
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,895
A date?

280
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,234
lsn't that what you call it here
when a man and a woman

281
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,501
go out to spend time together?

282
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:36,001
Well, yes, but...

283
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:41,279
Okay, before you crush my spirit and ego,
l will withdraw the offer.

284
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,018
Maybe your phone number
will not be so precious.

285
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:48,386
Well, l suppose a phone number can't hurt.

286
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:10,377
l remember well the things
most important to me.

287
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,510
l have a class.

288
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:38,566
You got any more apples in the back?
lt's been a while since these last saw a tree.

289
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,335
Don't think so.

290
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,310
But you can't be sure unless you check,
right?

291
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:47,548
-How many you want?
-A dozen of your best.

292
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:52,045
Excuse me. Do me a favor,
get me a basket of fresh apples.

293
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:54,385
-Right away, ma'am.
-Thank you.

294
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,826
Lena, you sure was up and out early
this morning.

295
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:01,192
lt was my last day on the job, Earline.

296
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:03,823
My last half-day, to be exact.

297
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,663
-Go on. You stopped working?
-Yes, indeed.

298
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:09,465
-Praise God.
-Yes, l do.

299
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,200
l know l can't wait to lay these
bones down and relax.

300
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:16,608
-The day'll come.
-Sure came in high style for you.

301
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:18,043
What with your insurance money.

302
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:20,308
Well, l can't argue with that.

303
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:22,407
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

304
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,883
Am l being charged for the worms, too?

305
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,727
You don't want them, moms,
you don't have to buy them.

306
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:37,056
l'm not buying them. l don't want them.

307
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,135
And l'm not your mother.

308
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:43,503
There are other stores.

309
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:01,955
-Hi.
-Hello.

310
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,186
You wanna try one?

311
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,542
Oh, no, Ruth. No, l got this.
Go on, now. Go on, now.

312
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,510
l have been carrying these
groceries clear across town.

313
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,377
l can make it from the door to the table.

314
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,943
Well, how was your last day?

315
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:33,415
About the same as the first,
far as l can remember.

316
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:37,016
Well, it must feel good, hanging it all up.

317
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:39,083
lt ain't settled in good, yet.

318
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:42,460
lt will, come Monday morning when you
ain't getting up at the crack of dawn.

319
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,896
You'll feel it.

320
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:46,491
Look at that poor bed.

321
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:49,366
That's his idea of making it up, l guess.

322
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:52,233
Bless his heart. He tries, don't he?

323
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:56,471
No, he don't half-try at all, 'cause he know
you gonna come right behind him

324
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:58,672
and fix everything, just like you always do.

325
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,578
That's how come he don't know
how to do nothing around here.

326
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,082
You done spoil that boy so.

327
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,244
Well, he's a little boy.

328
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,379
He ain't supposed
to know about housekeeping.

329
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:11,650
You okay, Ruth?

330
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:15,227
Yeah, l'm fine, just...

331
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:18,425
l'm just tired, l've been ironing all morning.

332
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,333
Well, leave the rest for me. l'll finish.

333
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,061
ls that what you call retirement?

334
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,664
You gonna come home so you can
start doing somebody else's work.

335
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:31,475
Well, what do you expect me to do,
sit in that chair all day till l grow root?

336
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,812
My poor little plant.

337
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:39,879
lf that plant don't get more sunlight than
it's been getting, it's just gonna give up.

338
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:45,921
Ruth, if you ain't feeling better tomorrow
than you feel today, you best stay home.

339
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:48,656
That woman will have a fit
if l don't show up with her ironing.

340
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,561
Well, let her have it.

341
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,896
What? You ain't never supposed to be sick?

342
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:55,300
l'll call her in the morning
and tell her you got the flu.

343
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,359
Why the flu?

344
00:23:56,438 --> 00:24:00,204
White folks understand about the flu,
that's something they get.

345
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,641
Well, you better call up them sick
with something familiar,

346
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,576
otherwise they gonna think
you were late out drunk,

347
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:07,342
been caught up in a fight or something.

348
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:12,120
Tired as you look, Ruth,
you ain't going nowhere tomorrow.

349
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:15,645
Well, l've got to go, now.
We need the money.

350
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:21,855
Most days, we might. But tomorrow
we got us a great, big old check coming.

351
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,998
Now, wait, that's your money, Lena.

352
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:27,035
lt ain't got nothing to do with me.
And we all feel that way.

353
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,899
$10,000.

354
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:32,766
You know what you ought to do
with that money, Lena?

355
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:38,905
You ought to go off somewhere,
like South America or Europe.

356
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:41,710
Just go on off and have yourself a ball
for once in your life.

357
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:44,274
What would l look like,
wandering around Europe by myself?

358
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:48,380
What? Those rich white women do it.
l read about it all the time.

359
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:52,052
Their feet gets itching, and the next thing
you know, they're packed and gone,

360
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:55,062
waving at the rest of us
from them ocean liners.

361
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:58,599
Something always told me
l wasn't no rich white woman.

362
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:06,833
Well, what you going to do with it?

363
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:09,775
l ain't rightly decided, Ruth,
to tell you the truth.

364
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:12,211
Well, of course, there is that money
for Beneatha's medical schooling.

365
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:16,479
And that much is decided,
'cause Big Walter would have wanted that.

366
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,850
-Yeah.
-He believed in dreams, that man did.

367
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:23,657
And none of his never saw fit to come true.

368
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:28,557
He used to come in here some nights,
he'd be so low.

369
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:34,126
Just sit down on that sofa here,
he'd look at the rug,

370
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:39,535
then he'd look at me,
then he'd look back at the rug.

371
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,408
l know that must've been hard
for the two of you.

372
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:45,742
The hardest thing for me was watching him.

373
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:50,979
And when we lost that baby, l near to
thought l was going to lose that man, too.

374
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,713
You'd never think one man could
grieve so much.

375
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,020
That man loved his children.

376
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,660
Now, of course that ain't to say
he was no saint or nothing,

377
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:03,630
'cause could be a little mean
and kind of wild with the women.

378
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:06,259
But he loved his children.

379
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:08,959
He used to say,

380
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:13,440
''Seem like God didn't seem fit
to give the black man nothing but dreams,

381
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:18,172
''but he did give us children
to make them dreams seem worthwhile.''

382
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:22,649
He could talk like that, you know.

383
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:31,918
Well, look like maybe you remembered
you had a home to come back to.

384
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:34,222
l started my guitar lessons, today.

385
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,287
-Holy Lord.
-You started your what now?

386
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:39,823
Guitar.
You know, an instrument with six strings.

387
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,836
l know what a guitar is, little smart mouth.

388
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,132
ls this something new?

389
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,369
Not really. lt's something l've been
wanting to do for some time.

390
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:50,502
How long is it gonna be before you get
tired of this thing and move on to the next,

391
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:53,605
like you done that little play-acting group
you was all stirred up about last year?

392
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:55,912
And the horseback riding club
the year before that.

393
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:57,975
l've seen butterflies do less flitting, baby.

394
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:01,284
l just want to learn to play the guitar.
ls there anything wrong with that?

395
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:03,517
Ain't nobody trying to stop you.

396
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:05,651
Just wondering why you got to flit so.

397
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:08,628
Never landing on nothing long enough
to have nothing to sink in.

398
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,063
Never done nothing with all that
camera equipment you brought in here.

399
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,830
l don't flit. l experiment
with different forms of expression.

400
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:16,734
Does that include horseback riding lessons?

401
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:19,501
Yes. People have to express themselves
in one way or another.

402
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,337
Well, what is it you're trying to express?

403
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,536
Me.

404
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,848
That's all right. l wouldn't expect you
to understand, for God's sake.

405
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:31,886
-Beneatha.
-Would you just listen to her?

406
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:32,942
Oh, God.

407
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,489
lf you use the Lord's name in vain
just one more time...

408
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,424
-Mama.
-Girl, you are fresh as salt.

409
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,518
Well, if the salt loses its savor...

410
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:41,857
That'll do now.

411
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,331
Not gonna have you round here reciting
the Scriptures in vain, you hear me?

412
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,595
How did l manage
to get on everybody's wrong side

413
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,694
just by just walking into a room?

414
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,705
-Where are you going?
-Got a date.

415
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:53,638
Oh, my, my. Who with?

416
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,539
Who else? George Murchison.

417
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:59,709
That's the third time this month.
This one seems to be sticking.

418
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,978
Like a tick on a dog. They don't have
tweezers big enough to get him off me.

419
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,849
Now, girl, you know you're sweet on him.

420
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:08,355
He's all right. l mean l like him enough
to go out with and stuff.

421
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:10,288
''And stuff''? What's ''and stuff'' mean?

422
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:12,451
Stop picking on her, now, Ruth.

423
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:13,994
What does it mean?

424
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:17,031
l just mean l could never be serious
about George. He's so shallow.

425
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:20,226
What do you mean he's shallow?
Girl, he's rich.

426
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,030
You wouldn't even begin to understand.

427
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:25,368
Anybody who married Walter
couldn't possibly understand.

428
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,670
Now, what kind of way is that
to talk about your brother?

429
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,267
l do believe she just expressed
an insult to me.

430
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,609
Brother is a blip, Mama. Let's face it.

431
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:33,705
What's a blip?

432
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,773
l don't know. l think she's saying he's crazy.

433
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,376
Not crazy. Brother isn't really crazy yet.

434
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:40,250
He's an elaborate neurotic.

435
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:41,721
You hush your mouth, now.

436
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,315
As for George, well, George looks good,

437
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:47,725
he drives a beautiful car,
takes me to nice places.

438
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:50,321
But if the Youngers are waiting
to see if their little Bennie is going to

439
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,559
tie up the family with the Murchisons,
they're wasting their time.

440
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:53,794
-Why?
-Ruth,

441
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:57,134
the Murchisons are honest-to-God,
real live, rich colored folk.

442
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:59,867
And the only people in the world
more snobbish than rich white people

443
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,000
are rich colored people. And that's a fact.

444
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:04,910
You weren't brought up to dislike people
'cause they're well off.

445
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,949
Don't worry about it, Lena.
She'll get over all of this.

446
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:11,110
Get over it? What're you talking about Ruth?

447
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:16,348
Listen, l'm going to be a doctor. l'm not
worried about who l'm going to marry yet.

448
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,891
lf l even ever get married.

449
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:18,983
-lf?
-lf?

450
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,826
l probably will. lt's just that,
first, l'm going to be a doctor.

451
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,889
And George, for one,
still thinks that's pretty funny.

452
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:26,593
l couldn't be bothered with that.

453
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,899
l'm going to be a doctor, and everybody
around here better understand that.

454
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:32,565
Well, of course you're gonna be a doctor,
honey. God willing.

455
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,734
God doesn't have a thing to do with it.

456
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,709
Now that just wasn't necessary, Beneatha.

457
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:39,372
Well, neither is God.
l get sick of hearing about God.

458
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:40,846
-Beneatha.
-l mean it.

459
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,747
l'm just tired of hearing
about Him all the time.

460
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:45,081
What does He have to do with anything?
Does He pay tuition?

461
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:46,814
You about to get
your fresh little jaw slapped.

462
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,014
That's just what she needs.

463
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,354
Why can't l say what l want to
around here like everybody else?

464
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:53,758
'Cause you weren't brought up
to talk that way.

465
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:57,264
Me and your daddy went to a lot of trouble
to see that you and Walter

466
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,061
were brought up in the good Christian way.

467
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:01,432
Well, you and Daddy were wrong.

468
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,665
Mama, you don't understand.
lt's all just a matter of ideas

469
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,265
and God is just one idea l don't accept.

470
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:12,473
lt's not important. lt's not like l'm gonna
go out and be immoral or commit crimes

471
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:16,483
'cause l don't believe in God.
l don't even think about it. lt's just...

472
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:19,179
l get so tired of Him getting credit
for all the things

473
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:21,279
the human race achieves
through its own stubborn effort.

474
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,756
There is simply no God.

475
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:27,090
There is only man,
and it is he who makes miracles.

476
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,860
Now, you say after me,

477
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:39,839
''ln my mother's house, there is still God.''

478
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:45,109
''ln my mother's house, there is still God.''

479
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,910
ln my mother's house, there is still God.

480
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:55,050
There are some ideas
we just ain't gonna have in this house.

481
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:56,988
Not as long as l'm head of this family.

482
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:58,423
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,206
Bennie.

484
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,971
You think you're a grown woman,
but you're still a little girl.

485
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:23,848
What you did was childish
and so you got treated like a... Like a child.

486
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,139
She said she's sorry.

487
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,348
l don't know about these children, Ruth.

488
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:02,114
They frightens me.

489
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,351
Lena, you got good children.

490
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:08,888
Sometimes, they don't think clearly,
but you got good children.

491
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:12,661
No, something done come down
between us.

492
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:15,294
We don't understand each other, no more.

493
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:19,039
lt's like we don't none of us
speak the same language.

494
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:23,509
Walter near done lost his mind
thinking about money all the time,

495
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:27,514
and Beneatha around here talking
about things l just don't understand.

496
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:29,641
What is it, Ruth? What is it that's changing?

497
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:32,380
You just got strong-willed children.

498
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:38,015
And it takes someone with a strong head
like you to keep them in line.

499
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:45,462
lt's a good thing, though,
you helping Beneatha with her school.

500
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,093
This doctor thing sure is
a dream of hers, huh?

501
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:51,104
Yeah, well, she deserves it.

502
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,367
Even with all her foolishness,
she work hard in school.

503
00:32:56,144 --> 00:33:02,276
And Walter, well, it's not like you to think
about one child without helping the other.

504
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:06,387
l understand, Ruth,
but we ain't no business people.

505
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,046
We just plain working folk.

506
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:12,890
Walter Lee says ain't nobody
business people until they go into business.

507
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,787
Walter Lee says the colored people ain't
never going to get anywhere in this world

508
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:20,596
until they start gambling
on some different kinds of things.

509
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,060
lnvestments and things.

510
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:25,470
What done got into you, girl?

511
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,032
Walter Lee done finally sold you
on investing?

512
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:31,437
No.

513
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:35,374
No.

514
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:42,082
Lena, some...

515
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:50,153
Something done come down
with me and Walter Lee.

516
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,896
l don't know what it is.

517
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:01,773
He needs something, you know?
Something l can't give him.

518
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:07,371
He needs this chance, Lena.

519
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:12,344
l hear you, Ruth,
and l take what you say to heart.

520
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:17,853
But l can't throw my husband's
insurance money away on no investment.

521
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,862
This poor little plant.

522
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,460
Nothing l do make it no better.

523
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:28,400
l mean do we even know
what he's talking about investing in?

524
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,561
Ruth?

525
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:39,541
l think it's the way to go, man, liquor stores.

526
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:43,015
People gonna always wanna get
their taste, you know what l mean?

527
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,551
That's my feeling exactly.

528
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,747
Without fail, there are two businesses
you'll find in any city.

529
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,187
Churches and liquor stores.

530
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:51,350
And funeral parlors.

531
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,320
But l ain't messing around
with no dead people.

532
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:56,192
Until you become one.

533
00:34:58,132 --> 00:34:59,258
Where's Willy, man?

534
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,495
Don't worry, man. He'll be here.
You know Willy.

535
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,503
Always got to make a stop
or two on the way.

536
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,335
There he is. Willy. Over here.

537
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:10,810
My man, Bobo. How you doing, brother?
Walter, good to see you again.

538
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:11,937
Willy.

539
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:14,504
My new partners
and you started without me.

540
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,441
Waitress, another round of suds, please.

541
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:18,507
What'll you have, Willy?

542
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:22,852
Scotch, rocks and
another one on the side, beautiful.

543
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:27,727
-So, Bobo, how's it hanging, man?
-Man, you know me.

544
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:31,094
Just another squirrel in the world
trying to get a nut.

545
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:34,999
-So we ready to discuss business?
-That's why we're here, ain't it?

546
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,036
l think we're sold on this liquor store.

547
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:41,565
Sold? l'd say
it's a can't-miss investment, Walter.

548
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:46,512
Look around you. Everybody in here's
sipping on some kind of liquid refreshment.

549
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:51,509
Black folks. They may not have
enough money to rub two nickels together,

550
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:54,521
but drink they're gonna do. Got to do it.

551
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:57,786
-Takes their mind off things.
-We was just talking about that.

552
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,761
All right, here's the deal.
l talked to some people in Springfield.

553
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,822
The right people that'll seed the right
pockets to get our license approved.

554
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,299
They don't have no problems with it.

555
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,665
That's what l'm talking about.

556
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,135
And here's the beautiful part.

557
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:14,197
l found the perfect location,
right here on the Southside. l mean...

558
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:25,484
l mean, we couldn't build us
a better situation than this.

559
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,247
So, how much time we got?

560
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:29,620
Well, here's the thing.

561
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,917
This perfect spot ain't likely
to be available after next week.

562
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:37,988
Personally, l think we need
to move on this by Monday.

563
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,466
l don't see no problem with that.

564
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:44,234
Well, then,

565
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:45,738
sounds like a deal.

566
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:47,001
Cheers.

567
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,443
-l got to run.
-What?

568
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,505
You cats know how to reach me.

569
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,609
-Your change.
-Keep it, sweetheart,

570
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:01,744
and set my partners up
for the rest of the night.

571
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:03,051
-Bobo.
-Thanks, Willy.

572
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,318
-Walter.
-Willy.

573
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:06,383
l'll see you cats later.

574
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:08,689
Gentlemen.

575
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:12,165
Nothing for me. l got to get home.

576
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,394
l think l'm going to hang around
for a little a bit, man.

577
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,801
You know, kind of celebrate the future.

578
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:18,532
Don't you get in no trouble.

579
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,597
-l'm gonna call you later.
-All right.

580
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,361
Morning, doll. We'll be right with you.

581
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,862
l'm looking for Miss Tilly.

582
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,530
What you want with Miss Tilly?

583
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:54,200
lt's personal. ls she here?

584
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:59,642
l am Miss Tilly. What you need, child?

585
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,282
Come. Follow me.

586
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,928
Can't l go outside, grandma?
That spray stuff stinks.

587
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,625
lf l can't go out, you can't go out.

588
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,894
-You finish all your chores?
-No.

589
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,801
Where did Mama go?
She said she wasn't going to work today.

590
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,805
She went to run a little errand.

591
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,033
But where?

592
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:30,544
To tend to her business.
Grown-up business.

593
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,272
-What kind of grown up...
-Travis, get out of here.

594
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:34,337
Just get out of here. Go on downstairs.

595
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:37,213
Stay out front and keep a sharp look out
for the mailman.

596
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,616
Yes, ma'am.

597
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:42,153
And leave them cockroaches alone.
What they ever do to you?

598
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,783
Don't spray that boy with that stuff.

599
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:50,753
Why not? lt's harmless. You ever see
a dead cockroach around here?

600
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,929
Where did Ruth go, Mama?

601
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,992
To the doctor, l think.

602
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,537
What for?

603
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:00,401
Beneatha, get up underneath
that couch over there.

604
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:02,466
Sometimes crumbs get up underneath there.

605
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,512
-Mama?
-What? l don't know.

606
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:10,013
-At least, l ain't saying what l think.
-You think she's...

607
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:13,349
l think l ain't saying,
ain't that what l just said?

608
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:17,448
Of course, l ain't never
been wrong about a woman.

609
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:25,699
Hello.

610
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,996
Bah-oh to you, Asagai.

611
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,832
Come over? Now?

612
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,339
l don't think so. We're cleaning,
and my mother hates it

613
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:41,279
when people come over and the house
isn't up to her standards.

614
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,176
Do you? For me?

615
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,045
Okay, if just for a minute.

616
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,914
l'll see you then.

617
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:52,482
Tell me you didn't just invite
somebody over?

618
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,323
Oh, Mama, it's just Asagai.

619
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:57,762
l don't care if it's Santa Claus, girl.
Ain't you got no pride? Look at this place.

620
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,356
The place is fine, Mama.

621
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:03,301
Besides, it's just Asagai.
He's not judgmental. He's an intellectual.

622
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:07,137
-Who?
-Asagai. Joseph Asagai.

623
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,904
l met him at school. He's from Nigeria.

624
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,640
l don't believe l never met no African before.

625
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:16,740
Well, do me a favor and please don't ask
him any ignorant questions like

626
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,478
do they wear clothes and carry spears.

627
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:21,351
lf we so ignorant, maybe you ought
not to be inviting people here.

628
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,720
Mama, it's not that. lt's just
that people ask such crazy questions

629
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,157
when it comes to Africa,
like all they know is Tarzan.

630
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,388
-Well, him, l heard of.
-See?

631
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:32,728
What? What? What l need to know
anything about Africa for?

632
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:36,034
Because it's part of our heritage.

633
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,064
Why do you give money
at the church for missionary work?

634
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,630
That's to save people.

635
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:44,906
l'm afraid they need more salvation
from the British and the French.

636
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:49,108
So? You pregnant?

637
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,445
What, is it written all over my face?

638
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,919
-You are.
-Oh, Lord have mercy.

639
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,083
How far along are you?

640
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,558
Two months.

641
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:04,125
Did you plan it or was it an accident?

642
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,460
Mind your own business.

643
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:09,162
lt is my business.
Where's it going to sleep, on the roof?

644
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,140
l'm sorry.

645
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:20,546
l didn't mean for it to come out like that.

646
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,374
l think it's wonderful.

647
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:26,716
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's wonderful.

648
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,986
Well, it is.

649
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,887
Doctor say everything going to be all right?

650
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:34,416
Yeah. She said everything's gonna be fine.

651
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:35,553
She?

652
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,465
What doctor you went to?

653
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,470
Ruth, honey, you sick?

654
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,707
What's the matter with her, Mama?

655
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,438
She gonna be all right.

656
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,412
Women get like this sometimes
when they get with child.

657
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:55,039
But they going to be all right.

658
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:58,643
They just got to relax
and put everything out their mind.

659
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,324
Oh, my God. That must be Asagai.

660
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:13,029
Come on, honey. Come on.
lt's going to be all right.

661
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,286
Hello, Alaiyo.

662
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:34,582
Hello.

663
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:37,615
May l come in?

664
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:41,856
Yeah, come in.
Please don't mind how the place looks.

665
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,227
My mother was very upset,

666
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:47,392
she know l was letting
someone seeing it like this.

667
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:50,800
You, too, look disturbed.
Look, if it's not a good time, l can...

668
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:54,773
No, no, no.
lt's never a good time around here.

669
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:59,144
Acute ghetto-itis is all it is. lt'll pass.

670
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:00,836
Well.

671
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:03,347
So, come in and sit down.

672
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,445
Can l hope that box is for me?

673
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,714
Yes. Open it.

674
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:30,333
-Nigerian music. Thank you.
-Tribal Yoruba. But, keep going.

675
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:38,583
lt's beautiful. Why did you...

676
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,387
Let me...

677
00:43:57,538 --> 00:44:01,440
-What's it mean?
-You wear it well, as l knew you would.

678
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:03,238
-You did?
-Of course.

679
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:07,070
From the moment l first saw you at school,
and you pranced up to me

680
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,810
in the most serious of tones, and said,
''Mr. Asagai,

681
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:12,148
''l would like very much like
to talk to you about Africa,

682
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,983
''because l am looking for my identity.''

683
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,790
And why is that funny?

684
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:21,761
Well, because l didn't at first believe it.

685
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:23,929
And why not?

686
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,191
Because assimilationism is so

687
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:32,171
popular, so important in your country
among the blacks and whites.

688
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,867
Everyone must become one
and melt into each other.

689
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,137
l am not an assimilationist.

690
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:41,943
Perhaps not.

691
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,883
So, do you like them?

692
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,650
-What?
-The robes.

693
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,657
They are from my sister's
personal wardrobe, you know.

694
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:52,749
You must take good care of them.

695
00:44:52,827 --> 00:44:54,954
-Your sister?
-Yes, from Lagos.

696
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:58,521
That's the capital. But you knew that.

697
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,961
You sent all the way for me?

698
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,061
Well, l cannot wear them.

699
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:08,068
Joseph.

700
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,536
For you, l would do much more.

701
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,746
l must be going.

702
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,756
Will you call me Monday?

703
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:27,851
Yes, l will. We do have much to talk about.

704
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:33,591
About identity and time and feeling.

705
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:39,103
What sort of feeling
are you talking about, Asagai?

706
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:43,166
l am not interested in being
someone's little episode in America.

707
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:50,372
-Yes, that's real funny, isn't it?
-Truthfully, yes.

708
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:55,747
Every American girl, white, black and brown,
have said the same thing to me.

709
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:58,121
You are all the same with the same speech.

710
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:01,286
lt seems the world's most liberated women
are not so liberated at all

711
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:04,593
or you wouldn't so quickly
jump to the same conclusions.

712
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,068
Mama. Mama, this is Mr. Asagai.

713
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:14,869
How do you do, young man?

714
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:17,911
How do you do, Mrs. Younger?

715
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,776
Please forgive me for coming
at such an inconvenient time.

716
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,372
That's all right.

717
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,850
l just hope that you understand
our house don't always look like this.

718
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,445
-Asagai was just leaving, Mama.
-Yeah.

719
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:30,883
Well, l do hope that you'll come again.

720
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:35,657
l would love to hear more
about your country.

721
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:40,024
l think it's sad the way our American
Negroes don't know nothing about Africa,

722
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,830
except Tarzan and all that.

723
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:45,770
And all that money we been giving
to them churches,

724
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,501
when we need to be helping
you all get liberated from them

725
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:52,273
Englishmen and Frenchmen
what done taken away your land.

726
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:58,413
Well, yes, ma'am. And on behalf
of my people, we appreciate it.

727
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:02,378
Well, l suspect you better come around here
from time to time,

728
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:04,390
get yourself a home-cooked meal.

729
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,790
l think your mama would like that.

730
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:11,856
l think my mother would like that,
Mrs. Younger. And thank you.

731
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:18,162
Well, l should be off.
l will call you Monday, Alaiyo.

732
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:21,469
What is that? That's African for Beneatha?

733
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,669
No, it's a Yoruba word.

734
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,041
lt means, well, roughly,

735
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:29,776
one for whom bread or food is not enough.

736
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:34,348
You are never satisfied. You are always
hungry for more. That is you.

737
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:39,256
That's nice. Well, do come again, Mr...

738
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:43,660
Asagai. Or Joseph would do as nicely.

739
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:46,394
Goodbye.

740
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:03,344
Well, that's a pretty young thing
just walked out of here.

741
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,207
Well,

742
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:08,812
l guess l see why we done give up
horseback riding

743
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,551
and play-acting and cameras

744
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:15,083
and commenced to get so interested
in Africa.

745
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:16,254
Mama.

746
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:20,391
Missionaries, my Aunt Jenny.

747
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,604
What you doing up?

748
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:34,478
Ain't nothing wrong with me
to be lying in no bed for.

749
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,885
-lt's 10:30.
-Yes, it's 10:30.

750
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:44,014
And the mailman going to come today
just like he come every day.

751
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,559
-He's here. Two doors down.
-Lord have mercy.

752
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:50,290
Get on down them steps,
and make sure you don't lose that check.

753
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:54,664
-You mean, he done finally come.
-Lena, what a day this is?

754
00:48:54,735 --> 00:48:56,566
Well, l don't know what
we getting so excited about.

755
00:48:56,637 --> 00:48:58,332
We known for months he was coming.

756
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,033
Knowing it's coming and knowing it's here,
there's a difference.

757
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,908
lmagine being able to hold a piece of paper
in your hand worth $10,000.

758
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:10,208
-l'll take our mail, Mr. Peete.
-l don't think l have anything for you, Travis.

759
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:13,845
You got to have a letter, Mr. Peete.
Grandma's been waiting for months.

760
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:19,091
l think l have something for your grandma.
l just don't got nothing for you.

761
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:23,518
Got it!

762
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:26,357
Lord have mercy,
l wish Walter Lee was here.

763
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,424
Come on, open it. Come on, now, open it.

764
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:31,164
All right, all right, all right, child,
don't act silly now.

765
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,433
We never been no people
to act silly about no money.

766
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:36,874
Well, Lena, we ain't never had
no money before. Now open it.

767
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,373
ls that the right amount of zeros?

768
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:50,256
Yes, ma'am. You're rich, Grandma. Rich.

769
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:53,289
$10,000.

770
00:49:57,631 --> 00:50:00,532
Somebody's idea
of what my Walter was worth.

771
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:17,613
What's the matter with Grandma, Mama?
She don't want to be rich?

772
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,818
Why don't you go on outside and play,
baby. Go.

773
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:41,673
lf it wasn't for you all,
l'd just put that money away,

774
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,141
or give it to the church or something.

775
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,974
Lena, that's crazy talk, and you know it.

776
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:49,138
And Mr. Younger
would tell you the same thing.

777
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,875
Yes, he would.

778
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,213
Big Walter would tell me good.

779
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:01,857
Yeah. We got enough to do with that money,
all right.

780
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,328
Yeah.

781
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,388
Where'd you go today, girl?

782
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,662
l went to the doctor.

783
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:10,894
Dr. Jones does have
some strange ways about him,

784
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,900
but turning from a he to a she
ain't one of them.

785
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,305
l don't know what you're talking about,
Lena.

786
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:22,110
Ruth. Ruth, look at me. Look at me, Ruth.

787
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:25,912
l'm the same Lena Younger
you've known all these years,

788
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,716
and l didn't suddenly turn into no fool.

789
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:33,050
Now, you called the doctor that
you went to see this morning a she.

790
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:37,563
-Well, l made a mistake.
-You went to see that woman, didn't you?

791
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:42,031
-What woman?
-You went to see that woman...

792
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,194
Did the check come?

793
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,170
Now, what you doing here
this hour of the day?

794
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,002
Can you say hello
when you walk into the room?

795
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:48,507
Did it come?

796
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,459
Our lives have changed.

797
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:17,002
Look, Mama. Here's the agreement
between me, Willy Harris and Bobo.

798
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,435
All in written up. All legal-like.

799
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,939
Son, l think you need to talk to your wife.
l will leave you two alone.

800
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:23,272
-Now, what l need to talk to her for? Mama...
-Son, talk to your wife.

801
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,208
Mama, look.
Why can't anybody ever listen to me?

802
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:27,338
Walter Lee.

803
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:31,009
l don't allow no yelling in this house,
and you know that.

804
00:52:31,084 --> 00:52:32,176
Okay.

805
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:34,953
Okay, see, Mama, no yelling.

806
00:52:38,191 --> 00:52:41,718
Now everything's ready.
All signed and executed.

807
00:52:42,596 --> 00:52:45,895
We even got a name
for the business. Southside Liquors.

808
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:49,562
Liquor!

809
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:56,800
ls that what this has been about
the whole time? A liquor store?

810
00:52:56,877 --> 00:52:58,174
Mama, it's a great investment.

811
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:59,769
Listen to me, boy, and you listen good.

812
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:02,007
There ain't gonna be no investing
in no liquor stores.

813
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:03,572
Not as long as there is a breath in this body.

814
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,585
-Mama...
-l don't want to talk about it no more.

815
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:09,588
But, Mama,
you haven't even looked at it yet.

816
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,354
Mama, you haven't even looked at it yet.

817
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,866
That's it?

818
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:26,432
You've decided.

819
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:30,172
Decided that this is the way
we're gonna live.

820
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:37,877
Will you tell that to my boy tonight

821
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:41,045
when you put him to sleep
on the living room sofa?

822
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:45,820
Will you tell that to my wife when she's
slaving over somebody's dirty laundry?

823
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,394
Will you tell it to yourself, Mama,

824
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,794
when you're fixing food
in somebody's kitchen

825
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,856
that your own family
can't even afford to eat?

826
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,305
-Walter, where are you going?
-l'm going out.

827
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:03,002
-l'll come with you.
-l don't want you to come.

828
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,510
Walter, l got to talk to you about something.

829
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,240
That's too bad.

830
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:09,782
Walter Lee, sit down.

831
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:11,609
l'm a grown man, Mama.

832
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:15,416
Ain't nobody said you wasn't grown.
But you still in my house and my presence,

833
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:17,980
and as long as you are,
you will talk to your wife civil.

834
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:20,151
-Now sit down.
-No, let him go on.

835
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:24,357
-He makes me sick to my stomach.
-And you turn mine, too, baby.

836
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:28,191
Walter Lee.

837
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,032
That was my biggest mistake.

838
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:34,096
-What is wrong with you?
-Ain't nothing wrong with me.

839
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:38,577
Yes, there is something wrong with you.
You're being eating up like a crazy man.

840
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:41,876
And it's something more than me not giving
you this money. This ain't new.

841
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:45,782
For the past two years l've been watching
you get all nervous, acting wild in the eyes.

842
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,843
-l gotta go out.
-l'm not finished talking to you.

843
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:49,582
l don't need your nagging right now, Mama.

844
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:52,853
So what you gonna do?
Go somewhere and drink?

845
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:55,656
Seems like you always
tied up in a knot about something.

846
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:59,324
Ready to bust out and yell
anytime anybody say anything to you.

847
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,765
People can't live like that, Walter.

848
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:06,966
Ruth is a good and patient girl in her way,
but you getting to be too much, son.

849
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,134
Don't make the mistake
of driving that girl away from you.

850
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,010
What mistake? What she ever do for me?

851
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:16,776
That girl loves you, Walter.

852
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,920
Now you through?

853
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:25,981
'Cause if it's all right with you,
l would like to go out, please.

854
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,549
l'm sorry, son.

855
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:31,290
l'm sorry about your liquor store.
But that just ain't the thing for us to do.

856
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,298
l gotta go out, Mama.

857
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:35,596
-That's dangerous son.
-What's dangerous?

858
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,832
That. When a man got to go
outside his house to look for peace.

859
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:40,372
Where else am l gonna find it?

860
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,705
-Not in this place.
-What is it, son? What's wrong?

861
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:47,309
Mama, l want so many things.

862
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:51,112
Mama, l want so many things.
lt's kind of driving me crazy.

863
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,049
What is it that you want, baby?

864
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,523
You got a nice wife,
a fine boy, you got a job.

865
00:55:57,591 --> 00:56:02,324
A job? A job, Mama? Mama.

866
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,795
l open and close car doors all day.

867
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:08,893
l drive a man around
that looks right through me.

868
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:13,497
l say ''Yes, sir. No, sir.
Shall l take the drive, sir?

869
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:16,838
''Am l the best trained monkey
you ever seen, sir?''

870
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:21,508
Mama, that ain't no kind of job.
That ain't nothing.

871
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:28,685
Why do l even think
you going to understand me?

872
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:31,552
Understand what, baby?

873
00:56:33,593 --> 00:56:34,582
Mama.

874
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:39,423
Sometimes when l'm driving
that man around,

875
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:42,093
and we passing them cool,
fancy restaurants,

876
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:44,433
and these white boys,
these white boys they've just been there

877
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:48,167
talking about things, important things,

878
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:50,607
they closing million-dollar deals,
l know they are.

879
00:56:50,677 --> 00:56:54,636
And, Mama, these white boys,
they don't look much older than me.

880
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:57,478
So, once again, it's money.

881
00:56:57,551 --> 00:57:00,452
This is about money, because money is life.

882
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:03,614
Money is life?

883
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:07,994
l remember a time
when freedom used to be life.

884
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:11,758
But now, it's money?
Have times changed that much?

885
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,323
No, they haven't changed.
lt's always been about money.

886
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:17,802
We were just never allowed
to get close enough to see it.

887
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:20,601
No, something has changed.

888
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,344
ln my time, if we could make it
to the North without being lynched

889
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:28,745
and still have a shred of dignity, too,
that was enough.

890
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:31,882
But now here come you and Beneatha,

891
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:35,388
you all talking about things
that just go right past me.

892
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:39,858
Now you my children but sometimes
you all might as well be strangers.

893
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:41,894
Mama, you don't understand.

894
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,525
You probably never will.

895
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:49,262
Son, you know your wife's
expecting another baby?

896
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,194
What?

897
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:55,674
Now, l know it ain't my business
to be saying this, but you need to know.

898
00:57:56,343 --> 00:57:58,777
'Cause l think Ruth is thinking
about getting rid of it.

899
00:57:58,845 --> 00:58:01,643
You don't know Ruth, Mama, if you think
she would do something like that.

900
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:03,774
Yes, l would, too, Walter.

901
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:06,715
l already made plans.

902
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:08,943
What?

903
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,054
Gave the woman a down payment.

904
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:25,870
Well, son, it's your turn to say something.

905
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:32,908
And l'm waiting to see
how you be your father's son.

906
00:58:33,747 --> 00:58:37,979
'Cause your wife is saying,
she thinking about destroying your child.

907
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:41,386
l'm waiting to hear your father in you speak

908
00:58:41,454 --> 00:58:45,015
and say we a people who give life,
not who take it away.

909
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:49,026
l'm waiting.

910
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:58,829
l'm waiting to see you stand up
and be the man your daddy was.

911
00:59:05,512 --> 00:59:09,778
Well, if you a son of mine, tell her.

912
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:21,491
You a disgrace to your father's memory.

913
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:57,152
Well, now.

914
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,894
Yes, now. This, my assimilated sister-in-law,

915
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:05,062
is what the well-dressed
Nigerian woman wears.

916
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,534
lsn't it beautiful?

917
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:12,543
Well, yeah, it is something.

918
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,908
lt is.

919
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:19,978
Enough of this assimilationist junk.

920
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,142
What kind of dance is that?

921
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,050
A folk dance.

922
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,986
And what kind of folks
dance like that, honey?

923
01:00:57,056 --> 01:01:00,025
Nigerian folks... People.

924
01:01:00,093 --> 01:01:02,926
lt's a dance of welcome.

925
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:04,861
Who you welcoming?

926
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:09,668
The men. Back to the village.

927
01:01:09,736 --> 01:01:11,499
Yeah. Where they been?

928
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:17,073
l don't know.
Out, tending cattle or hunting or something.

929
01:01:23,316 --> 01:01:26,581
The point is, they're coming home.

930
01:01:26,653 --> 01:01:29,349
To that? Girl, you better put a pot on.

931
01:01:47,941 --> 01:01:52,844
Maybe you heard me wrong. l said we're
going to the theater not going to be in it.

932
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:55,673
l don't like that, George.

933
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:57,979
Have a seat, George.

934
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:03,947
Girl, you think this boy's gonna go out
with you looking like that? Get dressed.

935
01:02:04,023 --> 01:02:08,153
That's up to George.
lf he's ashamed of his heritage...

936
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,987
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie.
Don't be so proud of yourself

937
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,759
just because you look eccentric.

938
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:16,131
How can something that
feels so natural be eccentric?

939
01:02:16,202 --> 01:02:18,193
That's what eccentric means, my dear.

940
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:21,104
Feeling natural
although you're anything but.

941
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:24,074
Go get dressed. l don't want us to be late.

942
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:25,805
Don't worry, George.

943
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:30,748
l wouldn't expect someone like you
to appreciate great and ancient cultures.

944
01:02:31,518 --> 01:02:35,147
l know your only aim in life is to utterly
submerge yourself in the dominant

945
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:36,711
and, in this case, oppressive culture.

946
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:40,225
My, my, my,
aren't we the revolutionary tonight?

947
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:45,196
You will lecture me on our great
West African heritage. Let's hear it.

948
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:49,561
Expound upon the great Ashanti empires
and the Songhay civilizations.

949
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:52,937
Oh, and let's not forget
the brilliance of the sculpture of Benin

950
01:02:53,006 --> 01:02:55,133
and the poetry of the Bantu.

951
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:58,704
Heritage? Let's face it, baby.

952
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:02,009
Your heritage is nothing but
a bunch of raggedy-assed spirituals

953
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:04,106
and foul-smelling chitlins.

954
01:03:04,517 --> 01:03:08,351
How comfortable we are
wallowing in our ignorance.

955
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:14,150
My people were the first people on earth
to smelt iron.

956
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:16,525
The Ashanti
were performing surgical operations

957
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:20,692
when the English were still tattooing
themselves with blue dragons.

958
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:26,167
She'll be out in a minute, George.

959
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:33,743
-What time is the show?
-The curtain is at 8:30.

960
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,407
Which is a bit earlier than
the standard New York curtain of 8:40.

961
01:03:41,554 --> 01:03:44,457
-Mama in there?
-No, she's not back yet.

962
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,693
Do you get to New York a lot?

963
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:50,854
-She say where she was going?
-No.

964
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:53,228
l get there a few times a year.

965
01:03:53,366 --> 01:03:55,163
New York ain't got nothing
Chicago ain't got,

966
01:03:55,234 --> 01:03:57,930
just a bunch more people
all squeezed up together.

967
01:03:58,004 --> 01:03:59,835
-So, you've been?
-Plenty of times.

968
01:03:59,906 --> 01:04:01,965
-Walter!
-Plenty.

969
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:04,509
Why don't you offer this man
some refreshments?

970
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:06,044
They don't know how to entertain here, man.

971
01:04:06,112 --> 01:04:09,047
l don't really care for anything. Thank you.

972
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:31,796
Why you college boys always
wear them silly-looking white shoes?

973
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:34,169
-Walter!
-White shoes, cold as it is.

974
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,538
George, you're gonna have to excuse him.
He's had too much to drink.

975
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:37,906
You don't have to excuse me.

976
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:41,306
l'll excuse myself if l need excusing.

977
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:44,678
l'm just saying they look funny as hell.

978
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,049
-Well?
-lt's the college style.

979
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,081
Style, my ass. Boy, you're something.

980
01:04:58,598 --> 01:05:02,534
l hear your old man is about to buy
that big hotel over there on the drive.

981
01:05:02,669 --> 01:05:07,299
That's a shrewd move.
See, your old man's like me, he thinks big.

982
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:11,944
Bet you got some of that in you.
Like father, like son.

983
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,645
Maybe we get together sometime,

984
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:17,716
have couple of beers
and talk some business.

985
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:20,915
l don't think so, Walter.

986
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:24,654
-You don't think what?
-l really don't have the time.

987
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:35,267
Okay. l understand.
You just a busy little boy, ain't you?

988
01:05:35,334 --> 01:05:38,167
-You ain't got the time for people like me.
-What's your problem, Walter?

989
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:41,400
You my problem. And people like you.

990
01:05:41,474 --> 01:05:44,409
Them college boys.
Like that makes you better.

991
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:46,206
What they teaching you over there?

992
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:48,179
Sociology and psychology?

993
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:51,282
They ain't teaching you how to be a man.

994
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,342
They ain't teaching you how to get out here
and run this world.

995
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,856
They just teach you how to read
them books and talk proper,

996
01:05:57,924 --> 01:05:59,516
and wear them sissy-looking white shoes.

997
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:02,254
You're all whacked up with bitterness, man.

998
01:06:02,328 --> 01:06:03,727
And you?

999
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:07,022
You ain't got no bitterness in you?

1000
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:11,262
You don't see no stars out there gleaming
you just can't reach out and grab?

1001
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:12,736
You happy?

1002
01:06:13,439 --> 01:06:16,169
You contented son-of-a-bitch.
You got it made.

1003
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:18,472
You had the world handed to you
on a silver platter.

1004
01:06:18,544 --> 01:06:20,569
You damn right, l'm bitter.

1005
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:26,111
Man, l'm a volcano.
l'm a giant. A giant surrounded by ants.

1006
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:30,254
Ants can't even understand
what the giant is talking about.

1007
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:31,756
Walter, ain't you with nobody?

1008
01:06:31,824 --> 01:06:34,816
Hell, no. 'Cause there ain't nobody with me.

1009
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:38,195
Not even my own mother.

1010
01:06:41,601 --> 01:06:43,626
Ready.

1011
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:45,603
And do you look great!

1012
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:50,138
You all have a nice time.

1013
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:51,574
See y'all later.

1014
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:55,606
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

1015
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:00,543
-Walter.
-Don't start.

1016
01:07:01,254 --> 01:07:02,516
Start what?

1017
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:05,148
Your nagging. Where was l?

1018
01:07:05,858 --> 01:07:09,021
Who was l with?
How much money did l spend?

1019
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:11,120
Walter, honey,
can't we just try and talk about this?

1020
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:13,495
l was out talking with people
who understand me.

1021
01:07:13,566 --> 01:07:15,534
People who care about the things
l got on my mind.

1022
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:18,331
-l guess that means people like Willy Harris.
-Yes, people like Willy Harris.

1023
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:21,430
Well, then why don't y'all just go on into
business and quit talking about it?

1024
01:07:21,507 --> 01:07:23,134
Why? You want to know why?

1025
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:25,006
'Cause we all tied to a race of people

1026
01:07:25,077 --> 01:07:29,309
that don't know how to do nothing
but moan, and pray and have babies.

1027
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:37,382
-Honey, why can't you stop fighting me?
-Who's fighting you?

1028
01:07:38,457 --> 01:07:40,448
Who even cares about you?

1029
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:59,672
Well, l guess l just didn't realize
how bad things was between us.

1030
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:12,352
l just didn't realize that
somewhere we lost it.

1031
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:22,929
l am sorry.

1032
01:08:24,837 --> 01:08:27,465
l'm sorry about this new baby, Walter.

1033
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:43,821
You want some hot milk?

1034
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,515
With all that liquor you come home with,
you ought to have

1035
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:49,584
-something hot in your stomach.
-No, l don't want no hot milk.

1036
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:52,062
-You want some coffee?
-No, l don't want no coffee.

1037
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:54,531
-l don't want no hot milk.
-Then what?

1038
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:56,760
What?

1039
01:08:56,836 --> 01:09:02,035
What else can l give you, Walter?
What? What? What can l give you?

1040
01:09:29,936 --> 01:09:32,268
lt's been rough, ain't it, baby?

1041
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:35,305
Between two people,

1042
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:38,935
there ain't as much understanding
as folks generally think there is.

1043
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,309
l mean, like between me and you.

1044
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:50,813
How we gets to a place where we scared
to talk softness to each other?

1045
01:09:52,758 --> 01:09:56,125
What gets into people
who ought to be close?

1046
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:06,471
l don't know.

1047
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:13,873
Lately, l been thinking about it a lot.

1048
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,009
On account of you and me, you mean?

1049
01:10:20,086 --> 01:10:22,714
The way something come down between us.

1050
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:25,655
Walter, there ain't so much between us.

1051
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:30,518
Not when you come to me
and you try and talk to me.

1052
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:35,693
Just try and be with me, a little, even.

1053
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,436
Sometimes...

1054
01:10:44,243 --> 01:10:47,007
Sometimes, l don't even know how to try.

1055
01:10:48,814 --> 01:10:50,304
Walter.

1056
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,249
Walter, baby.
Things don't got to be like this.

1057
01:10:57,323 --> 01:10:59,086
No, Walter.

1058
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,590
Sometimes people can do things
so that things are better.

1059
01:11:09,635 --> 01:11:14,095
You remember the way we used to talk
before Travis was born?

1060
01:11:15,141 --> 01:11:18,702
Remember, about the way
we was going to live?

1061
01:11:19,478 --> 01:11:20,911
You remember?

1062
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,744
And the kind of house
we was going to have?

1063
01:11:23,816 --> 01:11:25,511
-l remember.
-Yeah.

1064
01:11:29,121 --> 01:11:32,113
Walter, it's all starting to slip away from us.

1065
01:11:38,064 --> 01:11:39,395
l'm sorry.

1066
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:57,548
Oh, my! That bus stop seems
further away at night.

1067
01:11:57,616 --> 01:11:59,311
Where you been all day, Mama?

1068
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:01,285
How you feeling, honey?

1069
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:04,315
-Where have you been all day?
-Where's Travis?

1070
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,516
What, he ain't out front?

1071
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:09,152
-l didn't see him.
-That boy is gonna get it.

1072
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:10,286
Mama.

1073
01:12:11,464 --> 01:12:13,329
Yes, Walter.

1074
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:15,128
Where were you?

1075
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:17,567
-l went downtown.
-What's downtown?

1076
01:12:19,605 --> 01:12:22,802
l had a little business to attend to.

1077
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,843
What kind of business?

1078
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:28,036
Come on, now. You know better
than to question me like that.

1079
01:12:28,114 --> 01:12:30,742
Mama, you ain't go do nothing crazy
with that insurance money, did you?

1080
01:12:30,816 --> 01:12:33,011
-Mama, l was only next door.
-Mama, nothing.

1081
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:36,179
l have told you a thousand times not to go
running off like that. Now you get in there.

1082
01:12:36,255 --> 01:12:37,984
Well, at least let me tell him something.

1083
01:12:38,057 --> 01:12:41,754
lt's important, and l want him
to be the first to hear. Travis.

1084
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:45,288
Travis, baby, now you remember that money
that come in the mail this morning,

1085
01:12:45,364 --> 01:12:47,161
that money that got everybody so excited?

1086
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:48,257
Yes, ma'am.

1087
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:51,531
What you think your grandma went
and done with that money?

1088
01:12:51,604 --> 01:12:53,629
l don't know, Grandma.

1089
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:56,402
-She went and bought you a house.
-What?

1090
01:12:57,376 --> 01:13:00,345
lt's gonna be yours
when you get to be a man.

1091
01:13:01,547 --> 01:13:03,037
You glad?

1092
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,882
Well, yes, ma'am.
l always wanted to live in a house.

1093
01:13:07,953 --> 01:13:12,322
Well, now you can start.
Give me some sugar.

1094
01:13:13,392 --> 01:13:15,519
Now when you say your prayers tonight,

1095
01:13:15,594 --> 01:13:19,553
you can thank God and your grandfather,

1096
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:22,965
'cause it was both of them
what give you the house.

1097
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:28,807
Now go on, get in there.

1098
01:13:28,874 --> 01:13:30,341
-Mama.
-Go on.

1099
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:41,610
-So, you went and did it.
-Yes. Yes l did.

1100
01:13:43,055 --> 01:13:45,114
Praise God.

1101
01:13:50,029 --> 01:13:51,326
Walter, honey.

1102
01:13:52,565 --> 01:13:57,764
Walter, please. Let me be glad, Walter.
Walter, you be glad, too.

1103
01:13:58,304 --> 01:14:00,067
Walter, it's a home.

1104
01:14:06,245 --> 01:14:08,042
How big is it?

1105
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:10,081
Where is it? How much it cost? Wait. Wait.

1106
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:11,616
When are we moving?

1107
01:14:11,684 --> 01:14:13,413
First of the month.

1108
01:14:13,686 --> 01:14:16,348
Praise God! Praise God!

1109
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:19,414
And it's a nice house, too. Three bedrooms.

1110
01:14:19,491 --> 01:14:20,958
A big one for the two of you.

1111
01:14:21,026 --> 01:14:23,290
Of course, me and Beneatha,
we still got to share a room,

1112
01:14:23,362 --> 01:14:24,886
but Travis will have a room of his own.

1113
01:14:24,964 --> 01:14:27,159
And l was thinking that
if the new baby was a boy,

1114
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:29,565
we could get one of them
double-decker outfits.

1115
01:14:29,635 --> 01:14:32,866
And there's a yard where maybe
l get to grow myself a little something,

1116
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:34,599
and a basement, and...

1117
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:38,775
Look, l don't mean to make it sound
fancier than it is.

1118
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:41,677
lt's just a plain little old house.

1119
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:43,975
But it will be ours.

1120
01:14:44,383 --> 01:14:49,252
And it makes a difference in a man when
he can walk on floors that belong to him.

1121
01:14:56,095 --> 01:14:57,585
Where is it?

1122
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:01,064
lt's in Clybourne Park.

1123
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:03,657
ln Clybourne Park?

1124
01:15:03,736 --> 01:15:06,569
Lena, there ain't no colored people
living in Clybourne Park.

1125
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:08,732
Well, there's gonna be some, now.

1126
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:12,243
So that's the peace and comfort
you went out and bought for us today?

1127
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:16,475
l just tried to find the nicest place
for the least amount of money.

1128
01:15:18,317 --> 01:15:20,046
Now, mind you,

1129
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:22,451
l ain't never been one
to be afraid of no crackers,

1130
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:24,421
but, Lena, wasn't there no other houses?

1131
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,515
-You mean for the colored?
-Yeah.

1132
01:15:26,592 --> 01:15:29,288
There was lots of them,
way out yonder, somewhere,

1133
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:32,125
in worse shape and cost more money. No.

1134
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:34,097
l did the best l could.

1135
01:15:41,206 --> 01:15:43,936
All l can say then is...

1136
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:47,172
This is my time in life to say goodbye...

1137
01:15:49,548 --> 01:15:54,110
Say goodbye to these cracking walls,

1138
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:57,952
and these marching cockroaches

1139
01:15:58,023 --> 01:16:02,960
and the cramped little closet that ain't now
or never was no excuse for a kitchen.

1140
01:16:03,028 --> 01:16:06,361
l'm gonna say it good and loud. Hallelujah!

1141
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:11,626
Goodbye, misery.

1142
01:16:11,704 --> 01:16:14,764
l don't never want to see
your ugly face again.

1143
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,218
l'm gonna go see about Travis.

1144
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:34,848
Lord, l sure don't feel like
whipping nobody tonight.

1145
01:16:38,697 --> 01:16:41,359
Son, you understand what l done, right?

1146
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:50,640
l seen my family falling apart
right in front of my eyes today.

1147
01:16:51,343 --> 01:16:54,471
We was talking about killing babies
and wishing each other was dead.

1148
01:16:54,546 --> 01:16:59,381
When it gets like that, somebody's got to
do something different. Something big.

1149
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:02,285
Come on, son.

1150
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:08,416
Come on. Won't you say how, deep inside,
you know l done the right thing?

1151
01:17:11,764 --> 01:17:14,597
What you need me to say
you done right for?

1152
01:17:15,734 --> 01:17:17,895
You the head of this family.

1153
01:17:19,104 --> 01:17:22,835
lt was your money
and you did what you wanted to do with it.

1154
01:17:22,908 --> 01:17:25,900
So what you need me to say
you done right for?

1155
01:17:26,745 --> 01:17:29,339
So you butchered up a dream of mine.

1156
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:34,052
You, who always talking about
your children's dreams.

1157
01:17:36,555 --> 01:17:38,648
Walter Lee. Walter, wait.

1158
01:17:38,724 --> 01:17:40,191
Wait, Walter.

1159
01:17:57,943 --> 01:17:59,274
Hi, sugar.

1160
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:21,894
Walter, we're closing.
Back open at 10:00, all right?

1161
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,773
You got to eat, honey. lt's more than just
yourself you're eating for, remember?

1162
01:19:10,649 --> 01:19:14,346
He'll be back.
l know my son. He'll come home.

1163
01:19:19,892 --> 01:19:21,052
Hello.

1164
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:27,297
Hello, Mrs. Arnold. Yes, this is his mother.

1165
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,937
Well, l'm sure he just thought
he was off today, and...

1166
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,009
Yes, l'll be sure and tell him. l will.

1167
01:19:39,745 --> 01:19:41,269
Yes, thank you.

1168
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:47,249
Walter Lee didn't show up for work.

1169
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:50,777
lf he don't go in by tomorrow,
he's gonna lose his job.

1170
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:55,690
lt's gonna be all right, honey.

1171
01:19:56,895 --> 01:19:58,886
lt's gonna be all right.

1172
01:20:12,477 --> 01:20:13,910
l'll be back.

1173
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:37,389
-Good morning. Can l help you?
-No, you've done enough.

1174
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:40,663
Let's go.

1175
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,773
You are gonna follow me out of here,
Walter Lee.

1176
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:50,876
Right now.

1177
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,208
Take over for me.

1178
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,020
Take off everything and put on this.

1179
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,950
Sure hope we don't get
no whole bunch of snow this winter.

1180
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,558
l never saw snow till coming up here
to the States.

1181
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,458
Don't have such a nonsense in Kingston.

1182
01:22:21,402 --> 01:22:24,371
l laugh now when l think about how,
growing up,

1183
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,169
we used to complain for the cold.

1184
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:32,339
Child, l didn't know ''cold''
until l move up here to Chicago.

1185
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:38,441
lt's like we went straight from the fire
to the freezer.

1186
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:59,098
You go ahead and put on that robe, huh?

1187
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,939
l'll be back directly.

1188
01:24:01,869 --> 01:24:04,064
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1189
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,999
Where you been, Walter?

1190
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:13,003
-l know you ain't been to work.
-l been out, Mama. Just out.

1191
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,073
So, that's it?
You done come full circle, now?

1192
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:17,842
Next time l come looking for you,

1193
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:21,411
l'm gonna find you laid out
drunk in the gutter or worse.

1194
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:24,985
You got hurt and pain in you?

1195
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:29,360
You think you the only colored man
in Chicago with hurt?

1196
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,954
The only man?

1197
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,725
Well, l used to know a man
who knew how to live with his hurt

1198
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,929
and make his pain work for him.

1199
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:42,341
And he knew trials you don't begin to know,
but he did it with dignity.

1200
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:46,372
l was married to that man, Walter.

1201
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:51,648
And as l knew your father, l know you.
You two are not that different.

1202
01:24:56,324 --> 01:25:00,055
Forty years ago, Mama, you left the South.
Why'd you do it?

1203
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,963
Why'd you leave
the only place you ever knew?

1204
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,661
Well, for the same reason
most folks up here did, l suspect.

1205
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:11,193
To find something better,
to make more of myself.

1206
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,433
But it wasn't like l was gonna
set the world on fire.

1207
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,773
But you came.
You didn't let nobody stop you.

1208
01:25:16,844 --> 01:25:18,004
'Cause nobody else had the right to tell you

1209
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,276
that what you wanted to do
was right or wrong.

1210
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,582
You had to come, didn't you, Mama?

1211
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,753
You got on your train.

1212
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:34,127
So why in God's name wouldn't you let me
get on mine when the time came?

1213
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:41,791
l'm missing it, Mama,
and l don't think it's coming back again.

1214
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,706
l gave the man $3,500 on the house.

1215
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,584
Well, that leaves $6,500.

1216
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:10,464
l want you to put $3,000 in
the savings account for Bennie's schooling

1217
01:26:10,531 --> 01:26:14,126
and the rest l want you
to put into a checking account

1218
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:17,600
with your name on it.

1219
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:21,769
And then you decide what to do with it.

1220
01:26:22,543 --> 01:26:25,808
Now, l know that's not as much
as you wanted,

1221
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,848
but it's all l got in this world.

1222
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,378
Well, you the man of the house,
you the head of this family now.

1223
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,784
So l'm gonna leave it up to you.

1224
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,593
-You trust me like that, Mama?
-l ain't never stopped trusting you.

1225
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:44,691
Just like l'll never stop loving you.

1226
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:51,428
And you need to go home to your wife
who's worried sick about you.

1227
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:53,404
Okay, Mama.

1228
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:07,748
Hello, Mary. lt's Walter Lee.
l'm great, l'm great.

1229
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:14,553
No, it's not raining where l'm at.
All l see is sunshine and blue skies.

1230
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:17,462
Bobo in? Yeah, thanks.

1231
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:26,169
Bobo, my man. Call Willy Harris.
We're back on. Yeah.

1232
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:05,004
l can't tell you how good this feels, Walter.
Movies and a dance.

1233
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,280
Yeah, you should run away
from home more often.

1234
01:28:12,753 --> 01:28:16,917
l'd be lying to you if l didn't tell you
l was a happy man, Ruth.

1235
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,955
Everything's starting to come together.

1236
01:28:23,497 --> 01:28:26,125
lt's gonna be big. You just watch.

1237
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:30,936
l'm not gonna say any more.
lt's gonna be big, though.

1238
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:35,775
-George.
-Come on, Bennie.

1239
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:40,469
-We're having a nice time. Don't spoil it.
-Can't we just talk?

1240
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,427
George, talk.

1241
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,426
Beneatha, we always talk,
and l don't mind sometimes,

1242
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:05,870
but there is more to a relationship,
you know?

1243
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,374
So, let's get to the ''more'' part.

1244
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,711
-What do you plan to do, George?
-Do?

1245
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:19,812
Well, first, l'll put my arm around you,
like this.

1246
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,082
l'm serious, George.

1247
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,822
Okay, l will play along, for a minute.

1248
01:29:29,196 --> 01:29:33,394
l plan to finish college,
then get a job at my dad's company,

1249
01:29:33,467 --> 01:29:36,402
make a lot of money and then get married.

1250
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:37,767
Happy?

1251
01:29:38,572 --> 01:29:41,097
Care to know about me? What l want?

1252
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,408
l think you'll tell me, anyway.

1253
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:50,278
-l want to make a difference.
-A difference?

1254
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:55,618
Yes. l don't want to be like everybody else,
like Mama and Ruth.

1255
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:59,385
l want to do something with my life.
You know what l mean?

1256
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:02,856
No.

1257
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:05,354
Hello.

1258
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:07,298
l think we should
all go see the house tomorrow

1259
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,632
and Ruth has a great idea. Don't you, babe?

1260
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:12,400
-Yes, l do.
-You get one, too.

1261
01:30:22,216 --> 01:30:24,946
-Give us a few minutes, please.
-Yes, sir.

1262
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,724
-This must be it.
-Sold. Sold.

1263
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:42,994
lt's huge.

1264
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,868
Well, now, l never said it was no mansion.

1265
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,637
-Well, why don't we go in?
-A mansion never looked better than this.

1266
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:54,670
-Lady, what have you done?
-Oh, you'll see. Come on, you'll see.

1267
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:06,253
Oh, look at this bathroom.

1268
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:08,261
You said that our bedroom
is up on the right.

1269
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:12,026
-My own bathroom.
-This is my room, right here.

1270
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:15,262
-Nobody touch this room.
-No, this is my room. This is...

1271
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:17,804
-Oh, please...
-This is my room!

1272
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:20,363
Okay, this is her room.
My goodness gracious me.

1273
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,806
Excuse me.

1274
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:25,839
-Where is she?
-ln the backyard.

1275
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:29,041
All right, go on to the taxi and get the stuff.

1276
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,108
Goodness.

1277
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,847
-Look at my kitchen.
-Look at your kitchen.

1278
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:38,551
My kitchen.

1279
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:51,962
-Look what l got over here.
-Wait a minute, now.

1280
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,269
-What is all this?
-Oh, l don't know.

1281
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:58,107
-l have no idea.
-Right here. Right here. Right here.

1282
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,409
Sit right here, Your Highness.

1283
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:06,019
-We got you a little something.
-Oh, that's lovely.

1284
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:08,487
Okay.

1285
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:16,685
Now we won't have to use
our good forks and spoons, Mama.

1286
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,893
Oh, this is wonderful. This is wonderful.

1287
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:25,529
-Can l go get my gift now, Mama?
-Yes. Yes, before you explode, boy.

1288
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:28,642
-Oh, my.
-lt's the big one.

1289
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,199
Travis didn't want to go in
with the rest of us, Mama,

1290
01:32:30,277 --> 01:32:32,973
so he went out and got his own gift.

1291
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:41,412
-Travis.
-Travis, honey, what is that?

1292
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:44,981
See, it's a gardening hat,
like the ladies wear in the magazines.

1293
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,526
Wait, wait, wait. We gotta take her hat off.

1294
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:49,154
Now, who was with him when he got that?

1295
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,826
Well, it's different. lt's expressive.
And he picked it out himself.

1296
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:58,263
-You like it, Grandma?
-Oh, l love it.

1297
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:02,673
Oh, yes, this is a beautiful hat.
l always wanted me one just like it.

1298
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,876
Mama, you look like you're ready
to go chop some cotton, sure enough.

1299
01:33:07,948 --> 01:33:09,176
Go on, Walter Lee.

1300
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,277
Don't you pay him no mind.
This is a beautiful hat.

1301
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:16,414
Come on,
let's take these things into the basement.

1302
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:17,479
Stop laughing.

1303
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:20,994
We not laughing, Lena.
We're not laughing much.

1304
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:26,831
lt's been a long time
since l've seen her this happy.

1305
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,728
So, you like it?

1306
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,230
What?

1307
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:44,009
Come on. Let's just go inside.

1308
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:55,895
Howdy do, neighbors. Howdy do.

1309
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,094
Howdy do.

1310
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:01,025
Howdy do.

1311
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,137
Man, if you don't get up... Hey.

1312
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,833
l'm the one
who's supposed to be lying down.

1313
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:14,944
All in due time, Mrs. Younger.
The leisure life is right around the corner.

1314
01:34:16,684 --> 01:34:20,176
Well, tell it to hurry up. l been ready.

1315
01:34:21,855 --> 01:34:26,292
-Beneatha. Which box has the pots in it?
-ln the crate by the stove.

1316
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,521
No, that crate
has your mother's good China in it.

1317
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:31,929
-l had a dream about our future.
-Lord, do l want to hear this?

1318
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,662
No, you don't have to hear it.
Soon you gonna be living it.

1319
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,499
-That's nice.
-Come on, now.

1320
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:48,477
-Come on. Come on, girl.
-Oh, my goodness.

1321
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:53,584
Let me show you how to dance,
how the rich people dance.

1322
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:59,348
-Talk about old fashioned Negroes.
-What kind of Negroes?

1323
01:34:59,426 --> 01:35:01,291
Old fashioned.

1324
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:06,529
Well, if we're old Negroes,
then you one of them new Negroes.

1325
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,064
Yeah, and when the new Negroes
have their convention,

1326
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:12,162
their first order of business
is going to be to elect Beneatha

1327
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,572
as the Chairman of Unending Agitation.

1328
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:20,080
Chair-woman
and l will wear the crown proudly.

1329
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:23,947
Girl, l do believe you are the first person
in the history of the entire human race

1330
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:26,782
to successfully brainwash yourself.

1331
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:32,417
l mean, damn,
even the NAACP takes a holiday sometimes.

1332
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:36,121
l can see this chick now
before she performs one of her operations

1333
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:39,256
she gonna be leaning over that poor cat,
right before she slices him

1334
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:44,270
she gonna have the nerve to ask him,
''Sir, what are your views on civil rights?''

1335
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:46,361
She would, too.

1336
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:50,411
Sticks and stone may break my bones,
but words will never hurt me.

1337
01:35:51,478 --> 01:35:52,843
How's that?

1338
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:58,746
-Brother.
-Walter.

1339
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:03,784
Hello. l'm sorry,
l was knocking and l guess no one...

1340
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:11,890
l... l'm looking for a Mrs. Lena Younger.

1341
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:25,172
-Why don't you have a seat, Mr...
-Lindner. Carl Lindner.

1342
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:27,540
Walter Younger.

1343
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:31,141
l handle most of my mother's business
and this is my wife, Ruth.

1344
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:32,845
-How do you do?
-And my sister, Beneatha.

1345
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,787
-Have a seat.
-Why, thank you.

1346
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:38,154
-Will you be all right?
-That's quite all right, thanks.

1347
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:42,355
Listen, l represent the Clybourne Park
lmprovement Association.

1348
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,829
Why don't you put your things down,
make yourself more comfortable?

1349
01:36:44,898 --> 01:36:48,834
Why, thank you. Thank you very much.
l'm going to set that right there.

1350
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:53,671
Like l said, l represent the Clybourne Park
lmprovement Association.

1351
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:55,834
Would you like something to drink?
Ruth, get this man a beer.

1352
01:36:55,909 --> 01:36:57,467
-You want a...
-No, no, no, no. No thanks.

1353
01:36:57,544 --> 01:36:59,273
No, no. l'm quite all right.
Thank you very much.

1354
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:02,076
-Sure?
-Yeah, l'm... Really, trust me, l'm fine.

1355
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:08,551
Now, l'm not so sure how much you folks
know about our little organization.

1356
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:14,720
But it's a community group that's set up to,
sort of, look out after things basically.

1357
01:37:14,795 --> 01:37:16,023
Like?

1358
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:21,698
Like block upkeep, special projects.

1359
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:24,829
We have
a New Neighbors Orientation Committee.

1360
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:26,031
And what do they do?

1361
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:30,873
That's sort of a Welcoming Committee,
if you will, and l'm the chairman.

1362
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:36,138
And we go around and we meet
the new neighbors that are moving in

1363
01:37:36,216 --> 01:37:40,812
and we sort of give them the lowdown
on how we do things in Clybourne Park.

1364
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,123
The lowdown?

1365
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:49,094
Yeah, and we also have a category,

1366
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:53,065
what the association calls,
Special Community Problems.

1367
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:56,466
-And, pray tell, what are some of those?
-Beneatha.

1368
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,501
-Go right ahead.
-Well...

1369
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:01,507
You don't look comfortable, Mr. Lindner.
Do you want another chair?

1370
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:03,975
No, no, no, no, no. l'm fine.

1371
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,945
Let me just get to the point.

1372
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:10,472
l'm sure you're aware
of some of the incidents

1373
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:13,384
which have happened
in various parts of the city

1374
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:18,448
where colored people
have moved in to certain areas.

1375
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:24,930
Now, what we have, l feel,
is a unique organization in American life,

1376
01:38:24,998 --> 01:38:27,523
where we're trying to do something about it.

1377
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,228
l mean, most of the trouble in this world

1378
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:33,501
is because people don't sit down
with one another and talk to each other.

1379
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,633
-Well, amen to that.
-Yes.

1380
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:38,075
And that's the way we feel
in Clybourne Park.

1381
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:43,811
And that's why l was elected to come out
and talk to you people, friendly-like,

1382
01:38:43,884 --> 01:38:46,512
as people should talk to one another,

1383
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:50,614
and see, you know,
if we could work this thing out.

1384
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:54,283
Work what out?

1385
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:56,295
Please, believe me when l say

1386
01:38:56,363 --> 01:39:02,199
race prejudice has absolutely nothing
to do with this.

1387
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:06,899
lt's just that the folks
in Clybourne Park feel that,

1388
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:12,378
for the happiness of all concerned,
our Negro families are better off,

1389
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:15,779
they're happier,
living in their own communities.

1390
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,477
This, friends, is the Welcoming Committee.

1391
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:20,952
ls this what you came
all the way over here to tell us?

1392
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:23,216
Well, in the face of what l've just said,

1393
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:27,021
we are prepared
to make your family a very generous offer.

1394
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:28,152
Yeah?

1395
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:32,358
Yes, the association, along with
the collective efforts of our people,

1396
01:39:32,432 --> 01:39:36,232
would like to buy your house back from you
at a financial gain to your family.

1397
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:40,831
-Lord have mercy. Ain't this the living gall?
-All right, you through?

1398
01:39:40,908 --> 01:39:44,002
What? No, l'd like to give you the exact
terms of the financial agreement, if l may.

1399
01:39:44,077 --> 01:39:45,977
Oh, no, no. We don't need no exact terms
of no agreement.

1400
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:47,911
Do you really feel...

1401
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:52,543
No, no. Don't worry about how l feel.
Come on. Get out of my house.

1402
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:55,144
All right,
what do you people think you have to gain

1403
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:57,520
by moving into a neighborhood
where you're not wanted?

1404
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:00,253
You know, people get awful worked up
when they feel their whole way of life,

1405
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,817
everything they ever worked for
is threatened.

1406
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:03,123
Get out.

1407
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,259
You can't force people to change their heart,
Mr. Younger.

1408
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,937
ln case you change your mind,
you have my card.

1409
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:25,518
Come on, Grandma, tell me.

1410
01:40:25,586 --> 01:40:29,044
l'm not gonna tell you.
l told you once before, you...

1411
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:31,784
ls this all the packing
the three of you all got done

1412
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:33,587
since l left out of here this morning?

1413
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:36,390
You all got the energy of the dead.
What time the movers due?

1414
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,954
-4:00.
-Well, then what is wrong with you all?

1415
01:40:39,032 --> 01:40:41,830
-You had a caller, Mama.
-Sure enough? Who?

1416
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:46,034
-The Welcoming Committee.
-The who?

1417
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:48,541
The Welcoming Committee.

1418
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:53,478
They said they sure going to be glad
to see you when you get there.

1419
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:57,650
Yeah they said they can't hardly wait
to see your face.

1420
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,345
What are you all talking about?

1421
01:40:59,419 --> 01:41:03,719
A gentleman stopped by from the Clybourne
Park lmprovement Association.

1422
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:07,055
-Oh, what he want?
-He wanted to welcome you, Lena.

1423
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:09,595
See, the one thing they don't have
in their lovely neighborhood

1424
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:13,190
that they're dying to have,
is a fine family of colored people.

1425
01:41:13,266 --> 01:41:16,167
And he left his card to prove his sincerity.

1426
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:22,966
Go over there, and pack that stuff.

1427
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,575
-Did he threaten us?
-Oh, no, Mama.

1428
01:41:25,646 --> 01:41:28,444
They don't do it like that anymore.
He talked brotherhood.

1429
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:31,780
He said we all ought to sit down
and hate each other

1430
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,877
with good Christian fellowship.

1431
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:35,683
Have mercy.

1432
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:38,586
They wanted to buy the house back from us.

1433
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:40,388
At a financial gain to us.

1434
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,587
Why? What do they think we're gonna do?
Eat them?

1435
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:46,827
-No, honey, marry them.
-Oh, Father, help us.

1436
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,064
-We don't need help, they do.
-No, baby, we all need the help.

1437
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:53,971
Ain't nobody's going nowhere,
we're all in this world together.

1438
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,474
Not if they can have it their way.

1439
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:58,238
Mama, you gonna take that
to the new house?

1440
01:41:58,311 --> 01:42:02,645
-Yes, l am.
-That raggedy looking old thing?

1441
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:06,709
-lt expresses me.
-So, there. Miss Thing.

1442
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:10,581
We are entering a new tomorrow.

1443
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:13,524
Mama, you know how it feels
to climb up in a chariot?

1444
01:42:13,593 --> 01:42:15,060
-What?
-You know...

1445
01:42:15,128 --> 01:42:20,156
I got wings, you got wings
AII God's chiIIun got wings

1446
01:42:21,134 --> 01:42:24,331
lt's ''children,'' not ''chillun.''

1447
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,267
Minstrel man.

1448
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:30,104
Lord, if that man is back...

1449
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:32,668
-Who is it?
-lt's me, Walter. Can l talk to you?

1450
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:33,838
No, l got it.

1451
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:35,848
-You all go pack something.
-Yes, please do something.

1452
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:38,544
Mama, our future has arrived.

1453
01:42:38,618 --> 01:42:43,385
I got wings, you got wings
AII God's chiIIun got wings

1454
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:44,446
Bobo.

1455
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:47,856
-Where's Willy?
-Can we talk, Walter?

1456
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:50,590
-Yeah, come on, come on in here.
-Alone.

1457
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:55,265
-Hey, Miss Ruth. Miss Lena.
-Hello, Bobo.

1458
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:05,535
Be right back.

1459
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:12,418
Ain't nothing wrong, is there?

1460
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,351
Let me tell you, Walter.

1461
01:43:15,722 --> 01:43:18,919
l gotta tell you. You know how it was?

1462
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:23,993
lt's all the money we got, me and Mary,
all our savings.

1463
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:26,225
What are you telling me all this for?

1464
01:43:26,299 --> 01:43:29,962
You know, me and Willy
was supposed to go down to Springfield.

1465
01:43:30,036 --> 01:43:32,197
Yeah, to spread some money around.

1466
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:36,140
l got a bad feeling about it, Walter,
l got a real bad feeling about it.

1467
01:43:36,209 --> 01:43:38,507
-You saying you didn't go?
-l'm trying to tell you, Walter.

1468
01:43:38,578 --> 01:43:41,342
Then tell me, Bobo.
What's the matter with you?

1469
01:43:41,414 --> 01:43:42,972
-Did you go?
-No.

1470
01:43:43,049 --> 01:43:45,984
-Why not?
-l didn't have no reason to go.

1471
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:49,146
What are you talking about?
Bobo, you better start making some sense.

1472
01:43:49,222 --> 01:43:51,520
l'm trying to tell you, Walter.

1473
01:43:55,362 --> 01:44:00,129
When l went down to the train station
to meet Willy yesterday, like we planned,

1474
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,998
man, he didn't never show up.

1475
01:44:03,069 --> 01:44:05,003
And he got the money?

1476
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:08,133
l gave him all the money, like we agreed.

1477
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:11,439
Why didn't he show up then?
Where was he? Where is he?

1478
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:13,536
l don't know.

1479
01:44:13,613 --> 01:44:16,047
What you mean you don't know?
Where is he?

1480
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:23,716
l don't know. l waited for six hours.
l waited till the last train left for Springfield.

1481
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:29,017
Man, that's...
That's all the money we got in this world.

1482
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:36,165
Bobo, maybe he went by himself.

1483
01:44:36,703 --> 01:44:39,103
Maybe you missed each other
at the train station.

1484
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:41,333
He probably got on a earlier train.

1485
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:43,638
Come on, man,
you know Willy got his own ways.

1486
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:45,337
-Walter.
-There's no way.

1487
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:48,939
There's no way, he's gotta be somewhere.
He just gotta be.

1488
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:52,343
Come on, we gonna find him.

1489
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:56,784
-Bobo?
-What's the matter with you, Walter?

1490
01:44:58,124 --> 01:45:02,959
When a cat takes off with your money,
he don't leave no map.

1491
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:15,166
You better be lying. You better be lying!

1492
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:18,541
There's no way. Willy wouldn't do that.

1493
01:45:19,512 --> 01:45:20,809
No.

1494
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:25,417
Willy wouldn't do that.

1495
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:35,953
No. Oh, God.

1496
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:41,729
No, Willy. Oh, God, don't let it be true.

1497
01:45:41,801 --> 01:45:48,434
God, no, no. Not with that money.
Please, God, not with that money.

1498
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,171
That was all the money we had!

1499
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:54,778
l'm sorry, Walter.

1500
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:00,186
-l had my life staked on this deal, too.
-Go!

1501
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:38,285
ls it gone, son?

1502
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:42,651
Walter Lee.

1503
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:48,767
ls it gone?

1504
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:54,373
-Mama. Mama, l'm sorry. Mama.
-Your sister's money for school.

1505
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:55,874
No.

1506
01:46:58,011 --> 01:47:00,036
You used that money, too?

1507
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:04,308
Mama, l never went to the bank at all.

1508
01:47:08,822 --> 01:47:13,816
Mama, it's all gone. All of it.
Mama, l'm sorry.

1509
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:25,063
l seen him come home, night after night

1510
01:47:27,674 --> 01:47:30,507
and he'd look at the rug
and he'd look at me,

1511
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:34,707
the red showing in his eyes,
the veins moving in his head.

1512
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:39,681
l seen him grow thin and old,
before he was 40,

1513
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:44,588
working and working and working,
like somebody's old horse, killing himself,

1514
01:47:44,657 --> 01:47:47,956
and you give it away in one day.

1515
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:51,794
-Mama.
-Oh, God!

1516
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:01,465
Show me the strength.

1517
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,446
l'm sorry.

1518
01:48:24,898 --> 01:48:27,765
-Are you locked out?
-No.

1519
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:31,065
Oh, okay.

1520
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:35,972
Well, l had some free time so l thought
l'd come over and help with the packing.

1521
01:48:36,743 --> 01:48:40,179
There is something magical
about a family in preparation for a journey.

1522
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:44,012
The flow of life. lt makes me think of Africa.

1523
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:47,548
Africa.

1524
01:48:49,722 --> 01:48:54,159
This is not a good mood.
Today is a day for sunlight.

1525
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:58,956
You're moving, as you have moved me.

1526
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,433
Something is wrong.

1527
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:12,304
-He gave away the money, Asagai.
-Who gave away what money?

1528
01:49:12,612 --> 01:49:16,912
The insurance money.
My brother gave it away.

1529
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:22,278
-Gave it away?
-He would say that he made an investment.

1530
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,118
l'm very sorry.

1531
01:49:30,296 --> 01:49:34,289
But, you know, Brother isn't the crazy one.

1532
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:37,596
He did what made sense to him.

1533
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:42,505
Mama is the crazy one for falling for it
and throwing our lives away.

1534
01:49:44,177 --> 01:49:48,136
Perhaps you don't understand some things
as well as your mother.

1535
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,311
-And what about you now?
-Me?

1536
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:57,212
Nothing.

1537
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:01,387
But it's probably just as well, anyway.

1538
01:50:01,461 --> 01:50:04,328
Why would anyone want to be a doctor
in this nutty world?

1539
01:50:04,397 --> 01:50:07,389
l never thought
l would see you in such a despair.

1540
01:50:07,467 --> 01:50:10,925
-And after such a small defeat.
-Small defeat?

1541
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:15,401
Asagai, this family has been wiped out.

1542
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:17,300
What's the matter with you?

1543
01:50:17,377 --> 01:50:20,107
Don't they use money
where you come from?

1544
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,715
Look at me.

1545
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,482
Look at me, Alaiyo.

1546
01:50:29,822 --> 01:50:31,517
Was it your money?

1547
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:35,889
-l asked if it was your money that was lost?
-lt belonged to all of us.

1548
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:39,489
Says who? Did you earn it?
Did anyone earn it?

1549
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:43,058
-My father earned it.
-Oh, yes, and he died to make it available.

1550
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:44,467
But what if he had not died?

1551
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:46,630
What then would have happened
to all the dreams,

1552
01:50:46,706 --> 01:50:49,732
the house, the scheme, the doctor dream?

1553
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:51,106
There is something very wrong

1554
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:54,772
when all the dreams in a house
depend on a man dying.

1555
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:59,618
Yes, your brother made a stupid,
childish mistake,

1556
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:01,153
but you know what l think?

1557
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:03,519
-l think you are grateful to him.
-What are you talking about?

1558
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:06,787
l'm talking about how grateful you are,
now that you can give up on your dream.

1559
01:51:06,859 --> 01:51:09,054
Heck, give up on the whole human race.

1560
01:51:09,128 --> 01:51:11,596
All your big talk about,
''What good is struggle''

1561
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:13,427
and ''where we are all going''
and ''why are we all bothering.''

1562
01:51:13,499 --> 01:51:16,991
-And you cannot answer it.
-l live the answer.

1563
01:51:17,503 --> 01:51:21,940
l am the exceptional man in my village
who can even read a book.

1564
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:27,776
America to most of my countrymen
is an abstract, a place on a map.

1565
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:31,214
l live and study here.

1566
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:36,722
l know extraordinary things can happen
because they happen for me every day.

1567
01:51:37,924 --> 01:51:43,920
So stop your moaning and groaning, Alaiyo,
and tell me what you plan to do.

1568
01:51:47,433 --> 01:51:48,923
l don't know.

1569
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:55,566
l guess l need to think.

1570
01:51:59,812 --> 01:52:01,370
l will help you.

1571
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:05,140
When all this is over, you will come with me.

1572
01:52:06,819 --> 01:52:09,049
You're asking for a date at a time like this?

1573
01:52:09,122 --> 01:52:15,459
Not to the movies or to dinner.
You will come with me, home, to Africa.

1574
01:52:17,597 --> 01:52:19,064
To Nigeria?

1575
01:52:19,465 --> 01:52:25,768
l will show you the mountains and the stars,
and give you cold drinks from the calabash,

1576
01:52:25,838 --> 01:52:29,501
and teach you the old songs
and the ways of the Yoruba people.

1577
01:52:29,575 --> 01:52:30,974
And, if ever you get homesick,

1578
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:34,605
we will pretend you have been away
for only a day.

1579
01:52:47,527 --> 01:52:51,190
-You're getting me all mixed up.
-How? Why?

1580
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:58,603
Too many things.
Too much has happened today.

1581
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:04,508
l need to think.

1582
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:08,914
l will leave you to think.

1583
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:22,320
So often have l looked at you and said,

1584
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:26,126
''So this is what the New World
hath finally wrought.''

1585
01:53:56,529 --> 01:54:01,398
There he is,
Monsieur Ie petit bourgeois noir, himself.

1586
01:54:01,467 --> 01:54:04,436
What's our next scheme, Mr. Carnegie?
A yacht on Lake Michigan?

1587
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,563
Where you'll be installed
as chairman of some board?

1588
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:10,769
l look at you and see the final triumph
of stupidity in this world.

1589
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:13,969
-Who was that?
-Your husband.

1590
01:54:14,313 --> 01:54:17,510
-Where'd he go?
-l think he had an appointment at US Steel.

1591
01:54:17,583 --> 01:54:19,710
Bennie, you didn't say nothing bad to him,
now, did you?

1592
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:23,187
Bad? To him?
No, l told him he was a sweet boy,

1593
01:54:23,256 --> 01:54:26,350
and full of dreams and everything
that's peachy keen.

1594
01:54:35,134 --> 01:54:37,534
Ain't it a mess in here, though?

1595
01:54:39,705 --> 01:54:42,299
Well, ain't no need in moping,
we need to start unpacking these crates

1596
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,673
and one of you all call the movers,
tell them not to come.

1597
01:54:44,744 --> 01:54:45,802
Why?

1598
01:54:45,878 --> 01:54:49,041
But it ain't no need them coming all the way
over here, got to turn around, go back.

1599
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:50,412
They charge for that, too.

1600
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:51,882
No.

1601
01:54:52,885 --> 01:54:55,046
Lena, no. Lena.

1602
01:54:56,456 --> 01:54:58,356
Bennie, will you tell her.

1603
01:54:59,325 --> 01:55:02,556
Bennie, will you tell her, please,
that we can still move?

1604
01:55:03,029 --> 01:55:06,157
Lena, now the house note ain't
but a $1 25 a month,

1605
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:09,599
we got four grown people in this house,
we will work.

1606
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:11,995
Lena l will work 20 hours a day if l have to.

1607
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:16,440
l will strap my baby to my back, if l have to.
But, Lena, we gotta move.

1608
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:19,910
-Lena, no, we gotta get out of here.
-No, Ruth, no.

1609
01:55:19,979 --> 01:55:22,539
l'm starting to see this thing different, now.

1610
01:55:22,615 --> 01:55:25,175
Now, l've been thinking of ways
we can fix this place up.

1611
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:27,879
l seen a secondhand bureau
over on Maxwell Street just the other day

1612
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,785
-that'd fit right in there.
-No. No.

1613
01:55:29,856 --> 01:55:33,155
All it needs is some varnish
and some new handles, now.

1614
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:37,063
And Walter Lee can put up some screens
in your room around the baby's...

1615
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:43,464
-Where you been, son?
-Made a call.

1616
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:45,902
-To who?
-To the man.

1617
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:49,669
-What man, baby?
-The man, Mama.

1618
01:55:49,742 --> 01:55:51,573
Don't you know who the man is?

1619
01:55:51,644 --> 01:55:55,171
Beneatha, you're such a smart little girl.
Tell Mama who the man is.

1620
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:58,081
-Lindner.
-That's right. That's good.

1621
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,811
l told him to come right over.

1622
01:55:59,886 --> 01:56:02,616
-For what? What you wanna see him for?
-We gonna do business with him.

1623
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,588
What you talking about, baby?

1624
01:56:05,358 --> 01:56:07,553
l'm talking about life, Mama.

1625
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:10,721
You the one always telling me
to see life just the way it is?

1626
01:56:10,796 --> 01:56:14,027
Well, l figured it out, life just the way it is.

1627
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,365
He who gets and who don't get.

1628
01:56:17,436 --> 01:56:22,806
See, Mama, life is divided up
between the takers and the tooken.

1629
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,673
And some of us always getting tooken.

1630
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:28,373
People like Willy Harris
don't never get tooken.

1631
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:30,677
You know why the rest of us do?

1632
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:34,015
'Cause we all mixed up, we mixed up bad.

1633
01:56:34,086 --> 01:56:37,715
We just always trying to find
a right and a wrong part of things in life

1634
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:41,282
and we just be worrying about it
and we cry about it.

1635
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,453
We stay up nights trying to figure it out.

1636
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:48,091
And all that time, them takers
is just out there taking and taking.

1637
01:56:49,468 --> 01:56:51,402
Willy Harris?

1638
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:54,462
Willy Harris don't even count
in the big scheme of things.

1639
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:57,509
No. No, but l will say one thing for old Willy.

1640
01:56:57,577 --> 01:57:01,069
He taught me to keep my eye
on what does count in this world.

1641
01:57:01,147 --> 01:57:05,243
-What did you call that man for, Walter Lee?
-l told him to come on over to the show.

1642
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:08,287
We gonna put on a show for the man
exactly what he wants to see.

1643
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:09,787
You talking about taking
them people's money

1644
01:57:09,855 --> 01:57:11,288
to keep us from moving into our house?

1645
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:12,688
No, l'm not just talking about it, baby,

1646
01:57:12,758 --> 01:57:14,157
l'm telling you that's what's gonna happen.

1647
01:57:14,226 --> 01:57:16,285
Oh, God, where is the bottom?

1648
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:19,627
Where is the honest-to-God bottom
so he can't go any farther?

1649
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:25,128
Where's the bottom? Where's the bottom?

1650
01:57:26,105 --> 01:57:30,769
You and the African boy. All you
or anybody ever do is just carry a flag,

1651
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:33,869
or a spear,
or sing some marching songs, huh?

1652
01:57:34,947 --> 01:57:38,883
Y'all always looking it to the right
and the wrong part of things, huh?

1653
01:57:38,951 --> 01:57:41,010
You know what's gonna happen
to that boy one day?

1654
01:57:41,087 --> 01:57:44,386
He's gonna find himself locked away
in a dungeon forever

1655
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:46,425
and the takers are gonna have the key.

1656
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:49,655
Forget it, baby.
There ain't no causes in this world.

1657
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:53,961
There ain't nothing but taking
and he who takes the most is the smartest.

1658
01:57:54,033 --> 01:57:56,661
And it don't make
a damn bit of difference how.

1659
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,863
You making something inside me cry, son.

1660
01:57:58,938 --> 01:58:01,168
Oh no, Mama, don't cry. Don't cry, Mama.

1661
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:03,731
You have to understand that
that white man's gonna come in that door,

1662
01:58:03,809 --> 01:58:06,505
he's gonna be able to give us more money
than we ever had.

1663
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:09,810
More money than Willy took,
more money than Daddy left.

1664
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:12,544
lt's that important to him
and l'm gonna help him out.

1665
01:58:12,618 --> 01:58:14,108
l'm gonna put on a show, Mama.

1666
01:58:14,186 --> 01:58:18,282
Son, l come from five generations of people
who were slaves and sharecroppers,

1667
01:58:18,357 --> 01:58:20,757
but ain't nobody in my family
never took no pay from nobody

1668
01:58:20,826 --> 01:58:24,557
that was a way of telling us
we wasn't fit to walk the earth.

1669
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:30,330
We ain't never been that poor.
We ain't never been that dead inside.

1670
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:34,272
What's the matter with you people?

1671
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,705
l didn't make this world.
lt was given to me this way.

1672
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:40,371
And hell, yes, l want me some yachts!

1673
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:43,847
And, yes, l wanna to hang some real pearls
around my wife's neck.

1674
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:46,111
Ain't she supposed to wear no pearls?

1675
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:47,777
Somebody tell me who decides

1676
01:58:47,853 --> 01:58:50,083
which woman gets to wear real pearls
in this world?

1677
01:58:50,156 --> 01:58:53,387
l tell you, l'm a man
and l want my wife to wear some pearls.

1678
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:54,983
But how you gonna feel on the inside?

1679
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:57,359
l'm gonna feel fine, Mama.
l'm gonna feel like a man.

1680
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:01,298
-But you ain't gonna have nothing left...
-l'm gonna feel fine, Mama!

1681
01:59:02,134 --> 01:59:04,466
l'm gonna look that man in the eyes and say,

1682
01:59:04,537 --> 01:59:07,938
''Okay, Mr. Lindner,
that's your neighborhood out there,

1683
01:59:08,007 --> 01:59:10,100
''you got the right
to keep it the way you want it.

1684
01:59:10,176 --> 01:59:11,973
''You got the right
to have it how you want it.

1685
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:15,343
''Just write the check
and the house is yours.

1686
01:59:15,414 --> 01:59:17,746
''Just put that money in my hands

1687
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:21,116
''and you ain't got to live next
to a bunch of stinking Niggers.''

1688
01:59:21,187 --> 01:59:22,916
And, oh, Mama, for the last act...

1689
01:59:22,988 --> 01:59:25,786
Oh, Mama, l'll just get down
on my black knees, if l have to,

1690
01:59:25,858 --> 01:59:28,383
and get that white man what he really want.

1691
01:59:29,261 --> 01:59:32,025
Captain, mister, bossman.

1692
01:59:32,098 --> 01:59:36,159
Oh, Great White Father,
you just giving us that money,

1693
01:59:36,235 --> 01:59:39,762
and we ain't gonna dirty up
your white folk neighborhood.

1694
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:03,357
And l'm gonna feel fine. l'm gonna feel fine.

1695
02:00:05,297 --> 02:00:06,286
Fine.

1696
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:11,333
That is not a man.
That is nothing but a toothless rat.

1697
02:00:17,042 --> 02:00:19,067
You mourning your brother?

1698
02:00:19,145 --> 02:00:22,376
-He's no brother of mine.
-What's that you said?

1699
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:25,474
l said, that man in there,
is no brother of mine.

1700
02:00:25,551 --> 02:00:31,421
-Oh, you feeling like you better than he is?
-Can't you be on my side for once?

1701
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:36,294
You saw what he just did, Mama.
You saw him down on his knees.

1702
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:39,263
Wasn't it you who taught me
to despise any man who would do that?

1703
02:00:39,331 --> 02:00:42,129
Yeah, me and your daddy,
we taught you that.

1704
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:46,365
And we taught you something else.
We taught you to love him.

1705
02:00:46,972 --> 02:00:52,433
-Love him? There's nothing left to love.
-There is always something left to love.

1706
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:56,705
Have you cried for that boy today?

1707
02:00:56,782 --> 02:01:00,809
l don't mean for yourself or for the family
'cause we lost the money.

1708
02:01:01,654 --> 02:01:05,385
l mean, for him, for what he's been through,

1709
02:01:07,092 --> 02:01:09,219
and what it's done to him.

1710
02:01:10,763 --> 02:01:13,391
Oh, child, when you think is the time
to love somebody the most?

1711
02:01:13,465 --> 02:01:16,491
When they done good
and made everything easy for everybody?

1712
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:18,298
That's what you think?

1713
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:21,633
You ain't done learning.

1714
02:01:22,975 --> 02:01:26,274
The time to love the most
is when he's at his lowest

1715
02:01:26,345 --> 02:01:30,475
and can't believe in hisself
'cause the world done whipped him so.

1716
02:01:32,117 --> 02:01:37,521
When you starts to measure somebody,
you measure them right.

1717
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:40,525
Measure him right.

1718
02:01:44,396 --> 02:01:49,800
Make sure you done taking into account
all the hills and valleys he come through

1719
02:01:49,869 --> 02:01:52,360
before he got to wherever he is.

1720
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:59,238
-The moving men are here.
-Are they, baby?

1721
02:01:59,778 --> 02:02:03,339
Well, l better go downstairs, talk to them.

1722
02:02:03,415 --> 02:02:07,078
l came right over.
Well, was l glad to hear from you people.

1723
02:02:07,152 --> 02:02:09,620
Walter, he's here.

1724
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:16,091
Well, you know, life can really be
so much easier than people let it be, really.

1725
02:02:17,196 --> 02:02:21,496
Okay, so with whom do l negotiate?
You, Mrs. Younger, or your son?

1726
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,693
Oh, you do this with my son.

1727
02:02:25,037 --> 02:02:26,800
Okay.

1728
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:31,575
These are just some official papers.

1729
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:36,081
-Travis, go on outside.
-No, you don't, Travis. You come right here.

1730
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:40,213
Sit down, 'cause your Daddy's
getting ready to do something

1731
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:42,777
you gonna be needing to understand.

1732
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:52,592
Teach him about what's important
in this world and teach him good.

1733
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:54,895
Like Willy Harris taught you.

1734
02:02:56,502 --> 02:02:59,300
Teach him about the takers and the tooken.

1735
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:01,906
Go on.

1736
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:06,841
Show your son
what five generations done come to.

1737
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,888
Well, Mr. Lindner,

1738
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:24,995
l called you here

1739
02:03:27,266 --> 02:03:32,863
'cause me and my family,
we all very plain people.

1740
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:34,030
Yes.

1741
02:03:36,442 --> 02:03:39,172
l've worked as a chauffeur most my life,

1742
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:45,283
and my wife, she does domestic work
and so does my mother.

1743
02:03:47,152 --> 02:03:50,315
-l mean, we're very plain.
-Yes, Mr. Younger.

1744
02:03:50,422 --> 02:03:52,652
And my father...

1745
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:57,050
-My father was a laborer most his life.
-Yeah, l understand. l got that. Yeah.

1746
02:03:57,129 --> 02:03:58,960
My father almost beat a man to death once

1747
02:03:59,031 --> 02:04:01,090
because he called him
a bad name or something.

1748
02:04:01,166 --> 02:04:03,066
You know what l mean?

1749
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:06,227
l'm not so sure.

1750
02:04:06,305 --> 02:04:12,175
What l'm trying to say is that we come
from a people who had a whole lot of pride.

1751
02:04:13,012 --> 02:04:17,005
l mean, we are very proud people.

1752
02:04:21,286 --> 02:04:25,655
And that's my sister over there
and she's gonna be a doctor.

1753
02:04:26,892 --> 02:04:30,658
-And we are very proud.
-Yeah. Well, you should be. l'm sure...

1754
02:04:30,729 --> 02:04:32,697
Hold on, let me finish.

1755
02:04:32,765 --> 02:04:39,603
What l'm trying to say
is that we come from proud people and...

1756
02:04:44,076 --> 02:04:48,103
That's my son, Travis. Come here, Travis.

1757
02:04:49,381 --> 02:04:54,182
And he makes the sixth generation
of our family in this country.

1758
02:04:56,121 --> 02:04:59,887
-We have all thought about your offer.
-Good. Good, good, good, good, good.

1759
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:02,085
And we have decided

1760
02:05:06,131 --> 02:05:10,431
to move into our house, because my father...

1761
02:05:11,336 --> 02:05:17,070
My father, he earned it for us, brick by brick.

1762
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:22,173
And we don't wanna start
no trouble or fight no causes.

1763
02:05:22,414 --> 02:05:26,316
And we will do everything to, you know,
be good neighbors.

1764
02:05:26,385 --> 02:05:29,047
And that's all we gotta say about that.

1765
02:05:30,055 --> 02:05:32,046
We don't want your money.

1766
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,155
So you've decided to occupy?

1767
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:48,971
Well, then l...
l must appeal to you, Mrs. Younger.

1768
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:52,499
l mean, you're older, you're wiser,
you'd know the way this world works.

1769
02:05:52,578 --> 02:05:56,070
-Talk to this boy.
-Oh, l'm afraid you don't understand.

1770
02:05:57,349 --> 02:06:00,580
See, my son just said
we was going to move into the house.

1771
02:06:00,652 --> 02:06:03,212
lt ain't nothing left for me to say.

1772
02:06:04,056 --> 02:06:06,149
Well, you know
how these young people are nowadays.

1773
02:06:06,225 --> 02:06:08,523
You can't do a thing with them.

1774
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:10,889
Goodbye.

1775
02:06:15,033 --> 02:06:20,596
Well, if that's how you people feel about it,

1776
02:06:21,406 --> 02:06:24,341
l guess there's nothing left for me to say.

1777
02:06:29,314 --> 02:06:30,804
l...

1778
02:06:32,017 --> 02:06:35,418
l sure hope you know
what you people are getting into.

1779
02:06:57,776 --> 02:07:00,904
Got an order to move four rooms,
family of five. ls that you?

1780
02:07:00,979 --> 02:07:03,311
-That's us.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

1781
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:04,940
Let's go. Let's go.

1782
02:07:05,617 --> 02:07:08,586
Hey, Travis, put on your jacket.

1783
02:07:08,654 --> 02:07:12,954
Walter Lee, fix your tie,
you look like somebody's hoodlum.

1784
02:07:13,025 --> 02:07:14,617
Don't be laughing, Beneatha.

1785
02:07:14,693 --> 02:07:18,060
Oh, wait, baby, that ain't no bale of cotton,
now. That's my chair.

1786
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:22,157
l had that chair 25 years.
l'd like sit in it again.

1787
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:26,227
Mama, l think l shall marry Joseph Asagai
and go live in Africa one day.

1788
02:07:26,305 --> 02:07:29,502
-You ain't old enough to marry nobody.
-Not now, but some day.

1789
02:07:29,575 --> 02:07:32,772
Think of all the good l can do
