1
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,197
- Morning, Allen.
- Morning.

2
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,371
What's up, Paul?

3
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,375
I know.

4
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,852
I'll have the check waiting
for you here tomorrow. Exactly. Bye.

5
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,047
- Coffee, please.
- Egg white.

6
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,127
- Joleen, how's it going out here?
- Pretty good, a little slow.

7
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,994
- Side work all done?
- Yes.

8
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,002
- Because you know, if you're leaning...
- I could be cleaning. I got you.

9
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,197
- Ira, may I speak with you for a minute?
- What's up, Arthur?

10
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:31,242
- Hey, Howard. How's it going?
- Good, thanks.

11
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,141
Do me a favor and take that around back.

12
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,338
- You got it.
- Thanks, Howard.

13
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,309
What were you saying?

14
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,681
I had a chance
to think things over last night, Ira.

15
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,478
And?

16
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,824
To be frank, I wish you had consulted me
when you were considering this deal.

17
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:51,727
- I might've had some other way to go with it.
- There is no other way to go with it, Arthur.

18
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,999
- We're selling the place, period.
- But, Ira...

19
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,763
You see the register totals, right?
You count the dinners.

20
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,998
If it wasn't for breakfast,
it wouldn't even have lasted this long.

21
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,702
- This isn't a big surprise.
- Unfortunately, it was to me.

22
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,644
If there was something I could have done
to stave this off, I would have by now.

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,707
I'm not happy about it, either,
but it's a done deal. I'm sorry.

24
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,016
When are you telling the wait staff?

25
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,590
I called a meeting for this morning.

26
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,182
Good. I'll check in with you later.

27
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,127
- What's up, Samel?
- All right.

28
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,097
Benita, don't play.
I'm trying to read over here.

29
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,231
- So read, I'm not stopping you.
- Just eat your breakfast.

30
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,037
It's dry. It's too many raisins.

31
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,580
Then push the raisins to the side.
Add some more milk.

32
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,083
You want me to bust you on your head?

33
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,748
- Eat the food. I'm not playing.
- You're not my boss.

34
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:54,655
You wanna tell Mom that
when she comes back from the bathroom?

35
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,785
- No.
- Then shut up and eat.

36
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,889
- You guys ready?
- Hi, Mommy.

37
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,366
- Nita, is that all you're gonna eat?
- I'm not hungry.

38
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,193
I have to get to work.

39
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,330
Will you make sure
Benita catches a bus before your shift?

40
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,635
Yeah.

41
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,943
Samel, you gonna
make that phone call today?

42
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,277
- Yeah, whatever.
- Don't whatever me. You hear me, Samel?

43
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,217
I hear you, Shirley. I'm sorry.

44
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,314
All right. I'll see you guys later on at home.

45
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,120
Love you.

46
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,664
- You better make that phone call.
- Shut up.

47
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,035
- What's up, Joleen?
- Hi, Ali, how you doing?

48
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,372
Life is sweet, baby, you know.

49
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,871
Erin's working the counter.

50
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,514
Yeah? How you know I came to see her?

51
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,279
Stop it.

52
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,978
- Lf you want me to, I'll see you around.
- All right.

53
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,059
What up, E?

54
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,425
- I hit you.
- I never got it.

55
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,096
That must have 'cause I was in the studio.
You know, insulation and shit.

56
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,570
I was wondering why you ain't hit me back.
Come here.

57
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,404
Come here.

58
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,842
What's up? You eat?

59
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,381
I had some toast when I got here.

60
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:28,009
Toast. Tell you about
that skinny-white-girl shit.

61
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,714
Better get up off it,
get some eggs in your system...

62
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,953
Ali, I got a mom, all right?
I do not need another one, believe me.

63
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,955
Yeah, the trains is mad tangled up out there.

64
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,497
Took me forever to get up over here.

65
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,058
I got to find somebody to help me
move my shit over your place next week.

66
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,571
Somebody with a van or something.

67
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,807
Next week?
I thought you said, like, in like a month.

68
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,306
I said that a month ago, Ali.

69
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,441
Right, yeah. Okay.

70
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,042
What's going on?

71
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:03,610
Tell me. Don't play me, Ali.
I can tell something is going on.

72
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:07,749
I don't know, E.
I'm tired, I'm feeling a little way.

73
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,223
I mean, I'm feeling a little way.
I'm feeling like...

74
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:18,266
I don't know if I'm ready
to be shacking up and shit, you know?

75
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,099
- I knew it.
- Come on.

76
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,003
- I knew it.
- I'm saying.

77
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:26,544
I'm not saying it all can't happen.
It can still happen, I'm just saying.

78
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,642
Can we talk about this later? Come on.

79
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:37,113
Fine. I get off at 5:00.
Pick me up then and we can talk.

80
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,488
I got to go to a floor meeting.

81
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,489
That's some rotten shit. Why isn't he here?

82
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,559
Why isn't his ass sitting up in here?

83
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,731
Because I hired everyone
and we felt that I should talk to you all.

84
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,173
Now, in terms of the particulars.

85
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,805
- He's thinking that perhaps...
- You don't have to give me no particulars.

86
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,281
I don't have a job!

87
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,614
How much more particular
does it need to get?

88
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,086
- I can't believe this.
- Are we getting anything?

89
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,918
- Is he giving us something?
- Now, just...

90
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,191
He's gonna give us
a subway token and a handshake.

91
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,284
He's gonna give us
a subway token and a handshake.

92
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,054
<i>- Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
- What's going on?

93
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,892
There will be references for everyone
who's been here a certain period of time.

94
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,627
What do I need a reference from him for?
Talk about money.

95
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,466
Excuse me, Arthur. But when is this
gonna happen? Is this immediate?

96
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,837
- Three to four weeks.
- Three weeks? That's cold, man.

97
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,775
- The place is closing?
- I'm putting three kids through school.

98
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,743
I'm in just about the same boat as you.

99
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,839
- Please. You think we're stupid?
- What'd you say to Ira?

100
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,475
When he was telling you all this,
what'd you say to him?

101
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,884
I asked the same questions
you all are asking.

102
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,013
I tried to find a way out.

103
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,088
I pressed him about the possibility
of getting set up...

104
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:52,129
with some other restaurants and such,
but for now this is all I know.

105
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,096
Wait, setting us up where?

106
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,759
Work for some other Jew bastard?
I don't think so.

107
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,667
You don't got to get
all anti-Semitic up in here. Come on.

108
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,367
The man is trying his best
to handle this in a respectful manner.

109
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,238
I don't think it's appropriate for you...

110
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:09,440
Arthur, you are always speaking up for him
and his father before him.

111
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,708
Always!

112
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,377
He must be getting a nice package.

113
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,350
Come on, guys, it's not Arthur's fault.

114
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,548
The bottom line is, that's all I know for now.

115
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,889
Now I expect you all...

116
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,094
to pitch in and keep the morale up
as we go through this.

117
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,564
Pitch in?
I bet that kid is gonna get a bundle.

118
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,329
Are you gonna retire with him, Arthur?

119
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,102
Come on, tell us.

120
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,663
Are you going off to Florida with him?
To wipe his ass?

121
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,471
That's it. I'm finished here.
I'll tell you more when I know more.

122
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,043
Shit.

123
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,018
That was low about the ass-wiping thing.

124
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,724
Was funny, but low.

125
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,851
What do you know about low, young blood?

126
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,327
Nothing. I know I got work to do.

127
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,106
- What's her deal?
- She don't care, that's her deal.

128
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,643
Little rich kid.
Mommy and Daddy will take care of her.

129
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,143
Old hip-hop, motherfucking
rapity rip-rop shit.

130
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:20,250
I can't stand these young kids today.
No respect, none of them.

131
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,946
He always talks
about this being a family restaurant.

132
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,580
- His ass should be here right now.
- You know something?

133
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,058
His ass can cover my station,
because I'm out of here.

134
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:33,195
Shit, 13 years I put in this place,
and he's gonna give me three weeks?

135
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,994
Shit, I'm a find me a real goddamn job.

136
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,908
- You met with the floor staff?
- Yes.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,683
- How'd it go?
- Not well.

138
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,549
You got some angry people on your hands.

139
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,390
What? What did they say?

140
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,034
A few things that I won't repeat.

141
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,263
Jesus.

142
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,098
- About me?
- People are worried, Ira.

143
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,337
They're losing their jobs.
How did you think they were gonna react?

144
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,208
Right, I understand.

145
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,512
What do you think I should do?

146
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,381
You the boss, boss.

147
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:09,188
Maybe you ought to show your face
out there on the floor a little bit.

148
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:11,888
- Talk to some of these people.
- Right.

149
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:16,528
I have to go to the bank, run a few errands,
but I hear you.

150
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,065
Thanks.

151
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,276
Thank you. Have a nice day.

152
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,243
Thank you. Have a nice day.

153
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,804
Hello, sir. How was your meal today?

154
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,143
Just a coffee, regular, sweet.

155
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,979
Tommy, let me get a regular sweet to go.

156
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,720
That'll be $1.08, please.

157
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,880
Tommy, when you get a chance,
can you get me...

158
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,890
some more of the small bags?
I'm almost out.

159
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,120
Here's your change, sir.
Coffee will be right up. Have a nice day.

160
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,321
Hi, how was your meal today?

161
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,920
You owe me $10.

162
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,900
Excuse me?

163
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,402
I gave you a $20 bill.
You gave me change for $10.

164
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,996
It's simple mathematics. You owe me $10.

165
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,339
I'm pretty sure that you gave me $10.

166
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:02,902
- Hold on a second, I'm sorry.
- You're pretty sure. I'm definitely sure.

167
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,540
Okay. Let me just check the register.

168
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,278
What is there to check?

169
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,355
Do I look like a rich man
that's just throwing money around...

170
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,821
like I don't know what it means?
Please, young lady.

171
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,983
I didn't say that.

172
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,550
If you were doing your job, paying attention,
this wouldn't have happened.

173
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,960
I was paying attention.

174
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,763
No, you were talking to Tommy over there
and not watching what you were doing.

175
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,860
Okay, just give me a second.

176
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,236
You know, I may be black,
but I'm not stupid.

177
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,306
- What?
- Come on, this is an outrage!

178
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,380
Sir, I'm checking the register.
Can you please not yell at me?

179
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,040
- What is there to check?
- Sir, can you just...

180
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,880
Come on, let's get the manager. Do it now!

181
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,547
Okay, here. Here it is, I'm sorry.

182
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,722
Thank you, young man.

183
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,758
I'm sorry about that, ma'am.

184
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,855
I didn't see what he gave you, sugar...

185
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,435
but I know he didn't have to
speak to you like that.

186
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,833
Thank you.

187
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,035
Tommy? Can you take the register?
I'm gonna get those bags.

188
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,624
Maybe I should be
ducking for cover over here.

189
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,860
- You okay?
- Yeah.

190
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,896
This old guy just paid with $10
and then said he gave me $20.

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,695
A little flim-flam?

192
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,497
- I don't even know.
- It's a bummer, man.

193
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,597
You get off at 5:00, right?

194
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,938
Okay, so when you cash out,
we'll see who's right.

195
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,542
Come on now, it can't be that bad.

196
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,980
- Sol, where you at?
- I'm over here, Evans. Calm yourself.

197
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,210
I need glasses, man, come on.

198
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,651
Don't worry about it, Jo. Life is too short.

199
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,246
Take a deep breath and count to 10.

200
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,993
- Mom.
- Hey.

201
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,235
- I wasn't sure if you'd be working.
- What are you doing here?

202
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,635
I have a business meeting here at 11:30...

203
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,867
and I thought I'd come by a little early
to see if we could talk.

204
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,876
- You wanna talk?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,809
About the school thing.

206
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,515
Mom, you wanna talk about that now?
I mean, here?

207
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,052
Yeah, I don't think it's something
that can wait, Erin.

208
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,316
- I've got about...
- Come on. Let's sit down.

209
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,124
Black ribbon. Black ribbon Friday.
All right now, brother.

210
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,189
Want to support our youth center?
I know it's hard. That's all right, my brother.

211
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,166
A vision of loveliness.

212
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,298
My Nubian queen. Please take one of these
and have a lovely day, all right?

213
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,740
Come on over here,
home to the folks, brother.

214
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:50,178
Come on now, Kunta. That's all right,
I understand, brother. Working man, right?

215
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,307
- My goodness.
- What did you just call me?

216
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,386
Kunta. Kunta Kinte. I recognize you.

217
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,321
You might have on that Brooks Brothers,
but I recognize those Ebo features.

218
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,359
Get you one of these black ribbons. Only $1.

219
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,656
Okay, fine, let me hear this.

220
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,290
I'm reeling you in, Kunta. I'm reeling you in.

221
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,901
These black ribbons represent
the death of the spirit of the black man.

222
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:15,700
Our young brothers are facing a world
of despair and we got to help them out.

223
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,175
By wearing one of these black ribbons
every Friday, you will tell the world...

224
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:19,507
By wearing one of these black ribbons
every Friday, you will tell the world...

225
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,809
that you want to change the future
of our endangered young black men.

226
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,743
I think what needs to change...

227
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,979
is these kids thinking
they're more special than anybody else...

228
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,545
that's got to sit in a classroom
and pay attention for eight hours a day.

229
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,718
Horatio Alger, I see. Shelby Steele.
"We losing the race."

230
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,656
Sir, how can you ask a child...

231
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,563
to sit in a classroom that's falling apart?

232
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,693
No books, no pencils, no paper, no hope.

233
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,068
The playing field is not level.

234
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,840
If you're waiting for a level playing field...

235
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,969
then you're gonna be on the sidewalk
for a long time, my friend.

236
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,708
Long as it takes, my brother.
As long as it takes.

237
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,284
- Knock yourself out, okay?
- You, too.

238
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,682
Support the Emmett Till Center.

239
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,483
$1 gets you a black ribbon
for black ribbon Friday.

240
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,353
- Your contribution is gonna...
- Let me ask you something.

241
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,257
How come you don't have
a blue ribbon Wednesday...

242
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,193
for doing well in math class?

243
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,289
Or a green ribbon Monday
for great SAT scores?

244
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,994
Why don't you celebrate the good things
young black people are doing?

245
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,337
A blue ribbon Monday. That's beautiful.
I'm gonna have to write that down.

246
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,809
Writing it down is not the point.

247
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,006
The point is all this negativity, man.

248
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,844
It becomes reality.

249
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,444
Excuse me, my brother.
I think I misplaced my rose-colored glasses.

250
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,886
Look. I'm not your brother.

251
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,284
My name is not Kunta Kinte.

252
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,454
And I'm not gonna give you $1
for one of your ribbons. Okay?

253
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,862
Okay. Let me just say this.

254
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,359
When you came over here,
you were stolen away from your family.

255
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,995
You were bought, sold, traded, humiliated.

256
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,097
The family disintegrated.

257
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,906
Now we need to get that back.
That's why I call you brother.

258
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:04,081
Because I need you. I need you.

259
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,385
And if you don't think you need me,
ask yourself this:

260
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,455
If the Ku Klux Klan
comes around that corner saying:

261
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:13,251
"Let's kill us them two niggers,"
are you gonna say:

262
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,020
"Excuse me, Mr. Klan, but I'm not a nigger"?

263
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:19,358
Or are you gonna turn to me and say,
"My brother...

264
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,299
"let's run together"?

265
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:29,106
I'm gonna get you, Kunta.

266
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,543
I'm gonna get you. Yes, I am.

267
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,342
Support the Emmett Till
Memorial Youth Center. Help teach the kids.

268
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,248
If the ship won't come in, you got
to swim out to it. Ain't that right, brother?

269
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,343
I know you know that's right, my brother.

270
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:48,756
College isn't for everybody, Mom,
and I've realized that it's not for me.

271
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,194
I'm a different person
than you are, all right?

272
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm not trying to
go work in the corporate world.

273
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,862
Why don't you tell me
what it is that you're trying to do?

274
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,702
I'm a poet.

275
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,339
All right. You wanna be a poet.

276
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,809
No, Mom, not "wanna be a poet."
I am a poet.

277
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,973
- No, I am talking about your future, Erin.
- So am I.

278
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:12,811
No, that's not a future.

279
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,581
Poetry will have you sitting in the projects
somewhere hungry and broke.

280
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,384
Mom, you have no idea
what's going on out here, all right?

281
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,118
Poets are getting paid.

282
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,990
It's Def Poetry Jam, it's slam tours.

283
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:26,359
I'm good, Mom.
I'm gonna sell my books and...

284
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:30,594
Erin, please, will you listen to yourself?
You are so simple-minded.

285
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,636
You're gonna sell books.

286
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:35,797
What kind of business sense do you have?

287
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,042
I have enough sense
to be an entrepreneur, Mom...

288
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,170
instead of working 12 years
for some multinational corporation...

289
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,181
- that'll never give me a fucking promotion.
- Watch your mouth.

290
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:49,219
You better watch your mouth
or I will slap the shit out of you up in here.

291
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,686
You have got a lot of nerve judging me.

292
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,593
You have had a roof over your head,
three meals a day, private schools.

293
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,496
The reason you even know how to write...

294
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,593
is because of this abhorrent corporate job
that I have.

295
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,337
I am not about to apologize to you
for who I am. Do you understand me?

296
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,244
You don't understand me.

297
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,546
I found something I'm passionate about, Ma.

298
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,579
And I'm not going back to school, period.

299
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,649
All right? I don't like it, I don't fit in there,
it just ain't happening.

300
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,382
You don't fit in.

301
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,754
I get it.

302
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:34,187
Are we have a little black-girl pity party?
Is that what this is?

303
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,095
I don't fit in at NYU
because I'm little Miss Street Gangster?

304
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,900
Is that what this is?
No, let me tell you something, homeslice.

305
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,603
You are a bourgeois nigger from Montclair,
New Jersey, just like your mama.

306
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,542
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

307
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,774
- I'm a nigger?
- That's right.

308
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:55,046
I can't believe this. You're tripping.
So what are you, Mom? Are you a nigger?

309
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,643
You're damn skippy I'm a nigger.

310
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,383
- Which one, a house nigger?
- No.

311
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,187
I'm a field nigger, 'cause I go to work.

312
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,158
- For real?
- Yes.

313
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,120
And I am out in the field right now.

314
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,631
And you gonna shuffle?

315
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,429
I'm gonna pick some cotton right here.

316
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,438
That's right.

317
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,039
That's right.

318
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,339
I can't believe you.

319
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,201
Shit.

320
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:10,828
Shit.

321
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,835
Okay, the ball's in your court now.

322
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,311
Your foster mom's not gonna
beg you to do this. You know that.

323
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,541
But it would make her very happy.

324
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,914
You can't deny her that
because you're afraid to pick up the phone...

325
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,351
- and call this guy...
- I ain't afraid of nothing.

326
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,753
You don't know nothing about me.

327
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,093
- I'm trying to help you, Samel.
- I don't remember asking for your help.

328
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,131
I got to go.

329
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,374
So, Arianna couldn't make it?

330
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,420
She had a little fire she had to put out
back at the office...

331
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,955
but she sends her regrets.

332
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:16,288
- Have you worked for her long?
- No, actually she took over about a year ago.

333
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,824
- Great lady.
- Yeah, smart lady.

334
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,622
This place is so funny. Pickles.

335
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,771
I used to come here with my mother
when I was a kid.

336
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,066
I had my first egg cream here.

337
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,774
We're signing the deal on this place today.

338
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:34,367
- You're kidding.
- No.

339
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,970
And by the time you guys move in
across the street...

340
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,346
you'll have a high-rise
full of potential customers right here.

341
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,180
That's fantastic, Ron.

342
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,812
It is. We've got a Hard Rock Cafe coming in.

343
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,323
And you know the Brooklyn Diner
in midtown Manhattan?

344
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,189
They're gonna open a place here.
Authentic diner food.

345
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,286
This neighborhood is about to explode.

346
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:57,061
You will certainly be able to get a milkshake
without any difficulty around here.

347
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:03,196
Seriously, though,
I think this is gonna be great for our people.

348
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,902
Stores of quality in our neighborhood
for a change.

349
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,102
Right.

350
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,874
I mean, it can definitely be a challenge, too.

351
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,973
I work with the Harlem Store
and it's a similar situation.

352
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,951
I mean, Banana Republic
is an upscale store...

353
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,022
but it is a store for everybody.

354
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,191
I mean, us black folks
make money, too, right?

355
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:20,486
I mean, us black folks
make money, too, right?

356
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,822
We don't discriminate.
We want everybody's money.

357
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,622
Absolutely. Exactly.

358
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,357
And it is a big change,
I mean, given what's here now.

359
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,763
That's part of what's so exciting about it.

360
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,359
Out with the old and in with the new, right?

361
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,529
- Your drinks.
- Thank you.

362
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,973
- So, Morgan Ventura has this whole area.
- Three square blocks, for now.

363
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,868
What is the residential part
of the project like?

364
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,413
It's all condos.

365
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:46,074
Yeah, we didn't have to do
the affordable housing thing.

366
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,551
- Really?
- Yeah, I think the politicians understand...

367
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,088
that you can't make the thing work
if you're forced...

368
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,658
to stick some project
smack down in the middle of it.

369
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,021
The people from the PJ's...

370
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,722
ain't gonna be spending their benjamins
at Banana Republic, right?

371
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,761
I'm being crude, but seriously.

372
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:06,325
I think in general people are happy
that we're coming in here.

373
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,166
The longtime neighborhood residents...

374
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,107
are tired of hearing gunshots
and seeing graffiti everywhere they look.

375
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,270
- They welcome change.
- True. That is true.

376
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,678
- Hi, guys.
- Arianna.

377
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,149
Arianna, it's great to see you.
I thought you couldn't make it.

378
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:23,345
- No, I wanted to but...
- Here, have a seat.

379
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:25,547
Thank you. Hi, darling.

380
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,125
I was just gonna call in,
but my 12:00 cancelled...

381
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,387
so I thought I'd just come join you guys.

382
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,087
I'm glad you did.

383
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,959
I have a few questions now that you're here.

384
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,500
- How far have you gotten?
- We just...

385
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,695
We haven't even started, really.

386
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,137
What I wanted to ask you about
was the renegotiation on the terms.

387
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,903
Okay, right now
they're set at 10, 20, and 30 years.

388
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,845
Ron, I don't know if we feel comfortable
renegotiating after 10 years.

389
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,210
It's probably gonna be three to five years
before this place turns over...

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,788
so it's something we could think about.

391
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,686
That's what I was thinking.

392
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,952
Also, in terms of the plans for the facade...

393
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,688
We've already had a sidebar
with the architects about that.

394
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,788
Excellent, okay,
I'll catch up with my office on that later on.

395
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,527
You know, I'm really glad
this thing is happening.

396
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,829
Excuse me, folks.

397
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:15,064
I have got some work back at the office
that I need to get done.

398
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,142
It looks like everything is cool here
so I am gonna take off.

399
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,368
No, wait a minute.

400
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,707
No, I'm gonna step away now
so I don't distract you.

401
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,577
- You're not a distraction.
- It's okay with me.

402
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,845
Okay. Are you sure?

403
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,024
Is there any way I can get a copy
of a mockup...

404
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,288
of what you discussed with your architects?

405
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,929
...and remember to always smile.

406
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,968
It won't mess up your hair.

407
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:48,436
<i>Rain</i>

408
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,099
<i>It's gonna rain, yeah</i>
<i>it's gonna rain, well</i>

409
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,370
<i>You better get ready</i>
<i>Gonna bear this in mind</i>

410
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,503
<i>God showed Noah the rainbow sign</i>

411
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,081
<i>Said it won't be water but fire next time</i>

412
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,673
<i>Well way back in the Bible days</i>

413
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,015
<i>God told Noah that it's gonna rain</i>

414
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,453
<i>You probably know so keep this in mind</i>

415
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,820
<i>- He said it won't be water</i>
<i>- You know that it won't</i>

416
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,291
<i>- Said it won't be water</i>
<i>- It surely won't</i>

417
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,260
<i>Said it won't be water but</i>

418
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:18,863
<i>Fire next time</i>

419
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,970
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Have a great day. God bless.

420
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,989
Yo, man. All right.

421
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:58,809
<i>Now here in this flesh-colored world</i>

422
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:05,776
<i>I am dreamin' about the impossible</i>

423
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:12,417
<i>'Cause I know impossible things</i>

424
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:16,389
<i>Happen every day</i>

425
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,228
<i>And the difference between us</i>

426
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,667
<i>Is fading away</i>

427
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,705
<i>Like all of the small things</i>

428
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,471
<i>That make up my day</i>

429
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,046
<i>This world is my town</i>

430
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,650
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

431
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,128
Ira?

432
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,093
Dad.

433
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,637
- Thought you were going out of town.
- No, I put it off.

434
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,832
I'm going over to Arnie's.
You wanna come with?

435
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:07,206
I'm working. I don't know whether I should
order through the month...

436
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,474
or just start pulling stuff
off the menu or what.

437
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,552
Remember that?
This room was filled with Knicks.

438
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,780
What was I like? Five, six?

439
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,557
No basketball stars
coming in here these days.

440
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,651
These days you wouldn't want them in here.

441
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:29,358
Guys today don't even know how to pass
a ball around. There's no rules anymore.

442
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,958
- Ron coming in at 6:00?
- Yeah.

443
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,099
He sent Josh a draft
of the contracts yesterday.

444
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,266
I looked them over.
Everything looks good to me.

445
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,744
You sure we're doing
the right thing here, Dad?

446
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,145
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

447
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,774
I wish we could hold on a little longer.

448
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,012
This restaurant means a lot
to a lot of people.

449
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,455
- Ira, please, don't be so damn sentimental.
- I'm not being sentimental.

450
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,190
- I just care, okay?
- Ira, don't be stupid.

451
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,288
You think a deal like this
is gonna last forever?

452
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,991
We do this now...

453
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,894
and we can take care of a lot of people.

454
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:08,528
We draw this out
and everyone's gonna end up screwed.

455
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,800
- Yeah, but...
- But nothing.

456
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,473
Don't be such a worrywart. Lighten up.

457
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,180
See you worry, you eat.
That's what happens.

458
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,680
And I can tell
you've been worrying a lot lately...

459
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,948
because you got a little jellyroll
happening here.

460
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:28,355
- Dad, no matter what I do, you got to...
- What?

461
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,093
Forget it.

462
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,869
I'm going over to Arnie's.
You wanna come with or not?

463
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,837
I'll buy you a new tie.

464
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,776
- Come on.
- I got work to do.

465
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,044
All right.

466
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,749
I'll talk to you later.

467
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,321
No, I didn't.

468
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,884
How many times do I have to say it?
He said I'd be taken care of.

469
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,997
I don't need to know an exact number.
I trust the man.

470
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,662
Why don't you call him?

471
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,739
No, you call him. Say, "Ira, I don't trust you.

472
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,705
"I don't care about the relationship...

473
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,606
"you and your father have had
with my husband all these years.

474
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,576
"I think you're trying to rip us off."

475
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,773
That is what you're saying!

476
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
Are you finished?

477
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,283
No, are you finished?
I did listen, and now I'm...

478
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,893
Don't wait up.

479
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,890
Goodbye.

480
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,164
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

481
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:49,335
<i>Happy birthday, dear Kiesha</i>

482
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:54,469
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

483
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:02,108
I hate that fucking song.

484
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,820
- Ira.
- Yeah?

485
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,289
I've been thinking
about this whole situation...

486
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,528
and I need to know where I fall in all this.

487
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,993
What do you mean, where you fall?

488
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,435
I mean, what do I leave here with?

489
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,531
Arthur, I haven't even
thought about that yet.

490
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,042
I mean, I thought about it, but...

491
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:30,848
Arthur, I got a million things going on here.

492
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,577
Arthur, I got a million things going on here.

493
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:35,743
I understand that, but this is important, too.

494
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,353
I'm concerned about my future
all of a sudden...

495
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,891
and we have no contract
that says what the deal is.

496
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:43,391
No contract.

497
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:48,028
We're friends here, Arthur.
I grew up in this place with you.

498
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,667
What's so funny?

499
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,568
You're a businessman,
and you're talking to me about friendship.

500
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:58,639
That's how you see me, as a businessman.
That's fucked up.

501
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,070
Listen.

502
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,776
This is a business situation,
and so I'm talking to you as a businessman.

503
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,009
What's going on here, Arthur?

504
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,518
Where's all this coming from
all of a sudden?

505
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,420
I'm trying to do the right thing here,
and I got it coming at me from all sides.

506
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,151
I'm just asking.

507
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,362
Okay, listen.

508
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,030
You want something in writing...

509
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,864
fine, I'll give you something in writing.

510
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,897
Whatever you want.

511
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,865
I would appreciate that, Ira. I really would.

512
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,650
I saw you outside before.
Is everything okay?

513
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,483
My caseworker. Family shit.

514
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,719
I like your mom.

515
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,896
Foster mom. She seems pretty cool.

516
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,666
Yeah, she is.

517
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,535
It's nothing about her.

518
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,270
You cool with your baby daddy, right?

519
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,337
Yeah. Tyrell's gonna spend a month
with him in Ohio this summer.

520
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,748
That's good.

521
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,249
Pretty messed up, this thing
about them selling the restaurant?

522
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,447
Yeah.

523
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,520
You know what you're gonna do for work?

524
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:27,859
I'm leaving for school right after I graduate,
so I might just kick back.

525
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,455
Take advantage.

526
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,691
What about you?

527
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:35,371
I'm so fucked. I was just...

528
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:42,068
What's up?

529
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,016
Shit stinks.

530
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:52,178
It's clove. It's like incense.

531
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,191
James Baldwin?

532
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,359
I read that in high school.
That's some revolutionary shit right there.

533
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,192
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

534
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,691
You ever read that, Joleen?

535
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:05,792
It's a classic.

536
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:09,202
Mister's using mass symbolism up in there.
Metaphors and shit.

537
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,330
True.

538
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,901
He lived in Paris for a while because
he couldn't deal with shit over here.

539
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,377
I feel that.

540
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:21,309
I'm thinking about going to France.
Maybe Spain.

541
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
I'll see you guys out there.

542
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,894
You going to France with Ali,
the mad rapper?

543
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,122
Maybe.

544
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,959
You speak French?

545
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:38,034
Don't need to.
They all speak English over there.

546
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,626
Plus they loves them
some American black folk.

547
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,764
They wanna hear
all about the ghetto and shit.

548
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,009
I'm gonna go over there on a slam tour.
Check it out.

549
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,794
You were right, I was in error.

550
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,533
- Excuse me?
- This is your $10 back.

551
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:15,503
Now, you were very rude,
but I recounted and I was wrong.

552
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,870
I was very rude. Is this a joke?

553
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,772
You are a very rude young lady.

554
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,278
Your whole generation
has no respect for their elders.

555
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,143
I can't believe you're doing this.

556
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:29,242
Your minds are clouded
by all the MTV and rap music you listen to.

557
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:33,255
Look, don't condescend me, okay?
How the hell do you know what I listen to?

558
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,293
Please, come now. I wasn't just
born this age. I was young once.

559
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,555
You shouldn't make assumptions
about people.

560
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,826
I'm not making any assumptions.
I'm trying to teach you something.

561
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,629
Someone needs to teach you some dignity.

562
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,897
You think I watch MTV all day.

563
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,508
You know what I do when I'm not
working here taking abuse from customers?

564
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,204
What? Think up new ways
to desecrate the English language?

565
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,912
Very funny.

566
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,551
I play cello in the orchestra
at the New York City Ballet. Okay?

567
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,051
Second seat.

568
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,624
You almost had me going there
for a second. That's very clever.

569
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,993
Don't believe me. I don't care.

570
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:17,158
See, now, there's your problem.
You don't care.

571
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,526
You know what?

572
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,538
I'm a mother.

573
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,201
I have a beautiful little boy.

574
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:29,541
And you are exactly the kind of man
I'm gonna raise my son not to be.

575
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:34,211
I'm sure your son will not get treated
by a white salesperson...

576
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,345
in the same rude way that I was treated.
So there's no comparison.

577
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:39,649
Asshole.

578
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,093
There you go.

579
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:56,402
- Yo.
- What?

580
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,839
That was nice, very nice.

581
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,468
- You heard all that?
- Yeah.

582
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,908
Should have jacked that guy's ass.

583
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:07,211
I thought you was about to
come over the counter on his ass.

584
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:10,116
I am a Scorpio.

585
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,249
Really?

586
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,391
That's right.

587
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,424
- Better watch out.
- Okay.

588
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,786
I'll check you later, J.

589
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,729
Jo, you really play cello?

590
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,579
- How are you, Benjamin?
- Doing great, Arthur. Good to see you.

591
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:48,954
- How's tricks?
- Things are getting trickier all the time.

592
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,828
Okay. This is Miss Meyer, Miss Martin...

593
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,727
and you know this troublemaker over here.

594
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,323
Pleasure to meet you ladies.
Mr. Califano, how are you?

595
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:58,594
Can't complain.

596
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:01,262
- Your regular spot?
- Sounds good.

597
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:04,568
Ben, here, knows all about our guarantee,
so I'll tell you ladies.

598
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,940
If you eat here every day,
you'll live to be 149.

599
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,445
And, of course,
if something happens and you don't...

600
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,742
we'll give you all your money back.

601
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,218
This tastes good.

602
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,720
Stay away from this,
ain't enough here for you. Sorry.

603
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:28,161
Go crazy. I don't eat anything
that crawls on the bottom of the ocean.

604
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,530
These are some of them
farm-raised shrimps. Tasty, too.

605
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,899
Don't know why that guy sent them back.

606
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,029
You know why they
call them jumbo shrimp?

607
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,507
Wait a second. I forgot the joke.

608
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,440
Guys, what did I miss?

609
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,246
Frantz, you got jokes?

610
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,645
Let me hear one, come on.
I could use a good laugh.

611
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:48,115
Sorry, man, I can't think of any right now.

612
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,817
- How's everything going over here, Sol?
- Yeah, under control, boss.

613
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,222
Good. Let me know if you need anything.

614
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,522
What's up, Victor?

615
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,424
What I need is a fucking raise.
How about that?

616
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,022
Cheap shit.

617
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:08,137
- You pulling a double today, Victor?
- Yeah. I'll be here all night.

618
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:12,538
Me, too. I tell you, I don't need this shit.
I won't stick around here much longer.

619
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,339
None of us are. Didn't you hear?
They're closing the place.

620
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:16,434
What?

621
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,414
Yeah, he's selling it. We got three weeks.

622
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,739
No fucking way.

623
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,820
When was he gonna tell us,
that glom hondeling fuck?

624
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,254
- When did you hear this?
- Arthur told us this morning.

625
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:29,951
Holy shit. See that takes the fucking cake.

626
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,723
I used to wash bodies for surgery,
not motherfucking dishes in some dump.

627
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,992
I was a doctor. Did you know that, Victor?

628
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:38,090
I know, Sol, you've told me.

629
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,996
Okay, you know then.

630
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,232
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you got the kids and everything.

631
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,311
I don't know, Sol. I'm in big trouble.

632
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,815
At least you've got your education.
At least you've got that.

633
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:53,783
At least you've got your education.
At least you've got that.

634
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:02,050
Un-fucking-believable.

635
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:12,166
I don't get off for another hour.
What am I supposed to do with him?

636
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,761
I don't know, figure it out.
I got a job interview and I can't flake on it.

637
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,034
Fuck. What's it for?

638
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,666
Remember that girl Spencer
that came through that time?

639
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,870
- She runs Scratch Publicity?
- Is it daytime?

640
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,880
Both, I guess. I'm not sure.

641
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,974
- I lost my fucking job today.
- Get the fuck out of here.

642
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,543
I told you you need to go by
and see Ruby so she could set you up.

643
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,917
Mad money up in there.

644
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,787
You make more money
working three nights a week there...

645
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,656
than working six days a week here.

646
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,697
- It's true.
- Can you just take him over to Rhonda's?

647
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:44,392
- I'll call her and tell her that you're coming.
- I guess.

648
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,334
And go by Burger King
and get him something to eat.

649
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:51,607
I got to go back inside.
Baby, Mama's got to go to work, okay?

650
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,068
I love you.

651
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:55,610
- I want Mama.
- It's okay.

652
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,345
Bye, Jo.

653
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,208
All right, baby,
we're just gonna go to Rhonda's.

654
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,285
You'll see Mommy later.

655
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,152
Erin.

656
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,357
Check it out, a little trick.

657
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,964
See, here you got
three glasses on one hand...

658
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,760
and you just...

659
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,297
- Like that.
- Very impressive.

660
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,567
You learn that
in butler school or something?

661
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,010
No. Harvard cafeteria, actually.

662
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:34,078
That'll come in handy.
Even after your waitressing days are over...

663
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,415
and you're a big famous writer
throwing dinner parties in your crib.

664
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,680
From what I hear, my waitressing days
are about to be over real soon.

665
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,965
Business is horrible.
You've seen it in your tips.

666
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,658
I'm gonna try to help everyone out.

667
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,702
You'll get some severance
and then you can go on unemployment.

668
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,499
That sounds like a good plan.

669
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,232
Get paid to write.

670
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,507
It's the only artist grant
the government gives out anymore.

671
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,475
Theodore, how are you?

672
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:04,345
Your lunch break, Sol?

673
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,780
It would appear that way.
Listen, we got to talk.

674
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:10,114
Take an extra 10 or 15 if you want.
Things are pretty slow.

675
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,185
Mr. Personality.

676
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,453
- They tell you about this closing thing?
- Yeah, this morning.

677
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,258
That little prick.

678
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,831
- Language, Sol.
- Yeah, right.

679
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,459
My bad.

680
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,595
What's up, Benita? You waiting for Samel?

681
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,639
Okay, a little smoke, back to the gulag.

682
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:39,242
Take an extra 10 or 15. What the hell is that?

683
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:42,550
Excuse me, miss, can I get a menu, please?

684
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,084
I don't know what I'm doing, man.

685
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,216
I feel like some kind of loser over here,
you know.

686
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:54,423
I mean, I show up. I show up for life,
that's what they say to do and I do it.

687
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,999
But everything I do seems to be wrong.

688
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,201
First I got a crappy job.

689
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,338
Next thing you know, I got no job at all.

690
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,440
Something's messed up with this story.

691
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,240
It's twisted up.

692
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,116
You finished with that?

693
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,714
- She's a beauty.
- Thanks, man.

694
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,583
- You ride?
- Yeah, I used to. A long time ago.

695
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:33,722
- Nothing like it, right?
- It's the closest thing to flying.

696
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:35,696
Absolutely.

697
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,589
Take it easy, right?

698
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:39,998
Yeah, take it slow.

699
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,550
- You got a hot date?
- Hardly.

700
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,024
Me, Tyrell, and <i>Friends</i> on the WB.

701
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,292
That's cool. That show is funny.

702
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,763
Actually you remind me
of one of the girls on there.

703
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:13,358
Who's the one
always saying the funny shit? Phoebe.

704
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,431
My God. Please, that's insulting.

705
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:18,571
No. She cute.

706
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,304
Makes me laugh.

707
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:25,578
Whenever you wanna come over
and watch it with us, you're invited.

708
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,910
Yeah?

709
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,784
I could play some cello for you.

710
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,851
All right. You know my song?

711
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,291
I got to hold up.

712
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,662
Sorry.

713
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,600
Yeah.

714
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,774
This isn't a good idea.

715
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,402
Right.

716
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:33,274
Why?

717
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,150
I mean...

718
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,512
I'm not really...

719
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,319
This isn't the right thing for me. Cool?

720
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,292
Because?

721
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:52,225
I'm really not trying to get nothing started
right before I leave for school and all.

722
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,499
That's right. College boy. I forgot.

723
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,068
You got better things to do.

724
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,042
I got to go.

725
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:11,174
- Jo, you're out of here?
- Yep.

726
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:15,013
How'd your register total out?
You right with that guy...

727
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:17,420
- that pulled the little flim-flam?
- Yeah, actually.

728
00:48:17,524 --> 00:48:19,424
There you go. What did I tell you?

729
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:23,562
You're from Ohio, right?
You ever been out West?

730
00:48:23,664 --> 00:48:26,030
You know, New Mexico, the Dakotas?

731
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,233
A lot of those places
don't have any helmet laws...

732
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:31,327
so I'm thinking of taking a ride out there...

733
00:48:31,438 --> 00:48:34,464
That's great, Sol. I got to run.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

734
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:36,870
Yeah. Okay.

735
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:39,141
See you later.

736
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,519
Ali, it's me.

737
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:48,219
It's after 5:00.

738
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:50,790
I thought you said
you were gonna come by here.

739
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:54,384
Guess you're still feeling a little way.

740
00:48:54,928 --> 00:48:56,190
Listen...

741
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,065
Joleen.

742
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:07,568
Come over here a second.

743
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:11,567
I'm gonna write down Ali's number for you.

744
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,908
You can have him
because I'm done with him.

745
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,572
It is not like that.

746
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:17,244
Yeah, all right.

747
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:21,014
I'm serious, Erin. He's not even my type.

748
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:23,682
What's the matter?
He not black enough for you?

749
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,950
No.

750
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:28,858
I usually like to be
the bigger half of a couple, actually.

751
00:49:31,565 --> 00:49:33,032
Okay.

752
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:35,759
You like them skinny-ass boys.

753
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:38,861
I ain't having luck with nobody these days.

754
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:41,372
No matter what size their ass is.

755
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:51,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

756
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,585
Let's go, Benita. Time to go home.

757
00:50:03,697 --> 00:50:04,959
Finally.

758
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:07,295
I brought you a piece of pie. Come on.

759
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:19,708
- What song is he playing?
- I don't know, come on.

760
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:23,881
I was thinking, when you talk to him...

761
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,817
are you gonna call him Charlie
or are you gonna call him Dad?

762
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,152
Benita, don't ask me questions right now.
Let's just get home, okay?

763
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,237
Let's cross the street.

764
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:53,745
What's up, Samel?

765
00:50:54,214 --> 00:50:56,409
What's up, Beadie? What's up, Raymond?

766
00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:01,482
Big brother. Little sister.

767
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:08,524
My brothers.

768
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:11,257
It's my Zulu nation.
Y'all have a good evening.

769
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:12,855
Keep on keeping on.

770
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:14,092
Bum.

771
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:18,827
Excuse me?

772
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:20,804
Where you get them kicks from,
black power?

773
00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:23,501
When you was marching
on Alabama and shit?

774
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:28,103
- Actually, I didn't...
- You's a bum, what?

775
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:34,412
Raymond, I didn't see you sitting up there.

776
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:36,946
How is your mother doing?

777
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:39,848
She fine.

778
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:44,393
Give her my regards.

779
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:47,262
Tell her the bum said hello.

780
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:39,880
Melanie, you're up!

781
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:47,656
What you doing, papa?

782
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:49,557
That shit's giving me a headache, man.

783
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:50,925
Damn.

784
00:52:57,003 --> 00:52:59,267
Turn that off, Devon. I can't think over here.

785
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:02,136
Victor, I got entrees for Table 12.
Come and get them.

786
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,040
Hope those aren't for Table 6, Frantz...

787
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:08,512
because their entrees are up
in three seconds.

788
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,515
I'll keep them warm. Move your ass.

789
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:12,179
Go.

790
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:16,485
Melanie. There you go.

791
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,629
Victor, what's up with this ticket?

792
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,526
What do you mean?

793
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:33,134
Don't fuck around with me here, Victor.

794
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,368
You got four plates on your tray
and two entrees on your ticket.

795
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,002
My God.

796
00:53:38,111 --> 00:53:40,739
Russell, can you please
take this to Table 12?

797
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,984
Who's your partner in the kitchen, Victor?

798
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:48,111
- How long you been stealing from me?
- Never.

799
00:53:48,221 --> 00:53:49,882
I've never done that before. I swear!

800
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,823
This is the first fucking time?
I just happened to see it?

801
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:55,053
No, I swear to God,
I've never done that before.

802
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:59,121
I mean, I was scared.
I just... Look, I'm sorry, sir.

803
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:02,326
I didn't know what to do.
And all I was thinking was...

804
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,740
Jesus.

805
00:54:11,578 --> 00:54:13,478
Here, Victor.

806
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,280
Come over here. Let's get some water, okay?

807
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:32,627
I don't believe this. I'm so embarrassed.

808
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:36,765
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

809
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,532
I'm 58 years old. Who's gonna hire me now?

810
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,539
I don't have any retirement.

811
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:44,036
I got three kids.

812
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:45,869
What am I gonna tell my wife?

813
00:54:45,979 --> 00:54:47,674
- Victor, listen.
- My God.

814
00:54:48,114 --> 00:54:50,048
Take a minute, catch your breath...

815
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,449
and then go back to work
and we'll both figure this out. Okay?

816
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:57,179
I'm so sorry.

817
00:54:58,391 --> 00:54:59,756
It's okay.

818
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:03,428
Here, take these back to the laundry room.

819
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,132
Take your time, okay?

820
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:23,939
Everything's okay.

821
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:49,101
- Walter?
- Mr. Ira, good afternoon.

822
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:51,000
Hi, Walter.

823
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:55,904
- Aren't you off at 5:00?
- Yeah. I just have few more to go.

824
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,418
I wanted to make sure
everything is ready for the weekend.

825
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:06,923
Nice and quiet here, isn't it?

826
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,700
Like I said,
we'll deal with the long form later on...

827
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:25,004
but all the overriding points
are addressed here.

828
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,205
- Everything we talked about in terms of...
- Listen...

829
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:35,312
I changed my mind. I can't do this.

830
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:39,014
What do you mean, you can't do this?

831
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:41,388
I changed my mind.

832
00:56:42,162 --> 00:56:44,722
But you asked me to come here today
with the contract.

833
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:48,494
I know, and I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do about that.

834
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,835
I changed my mind.

835
00:56:56,776 --> 00:57:00,143
I understand you probably have
a lot of feelings about this place.

836
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:02,441
It's a family business. I understand that.

837
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:04,881
It's a Brooklyn institution.

838
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,650
And it's important to respect that...

839
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:09,813
in our community. I hear that.

840
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,250
But then there's the reality
of what's going on here...

841
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,793
and there's the future.

842
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:17,419
The future is what I'm talking about.

843
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:26,905
There are four square blocks of
commercial property surrounding Raskin's.

844
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:29,702
- We own almost all of it.
- Right.

845
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,174
You should understand.
Starting in two months...

846
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:35,907
you're gonna have construction crews
out here working 12 hours a day.

847
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:38,381
Making noise, stopping traffic.

848
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:42,285
Seriously impeding customers
from finding your front door.

849
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:47,625
This is happening, Ira. It's a reality, my man.

850
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:49,858
I'm not your fucking man.

851
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:52,431
And I don't care about your reality, okay?

852
00:57:52,532 --> 00:57:55,126
I care about these people. And this place.

853
00:57:55,235 --> 00:57:58,068
This place, Ira, is history.

854
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:00,898
We got a Hard Rock Brooklyn
going up across the street...

855
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:05,273
that's gonna sell more T-shirts in a week
than you take in in pickles in a year.

856
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:08,342
These places are gonna
put you out of business.

857
00:58:08,448 --> 00:58:09,745
Period.

858
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:12,812
Fuck you.

859
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:21,584
You sure about this, Ira?

860
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:24,460
You've got a business
that's going down the tubes...

861
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:27,431
and a chance to sell it
at the height of the seller's market.

862
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:29,798
You really wanna throw that away?

863
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:34,495
Okay.

864
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,208
Our price starts going down now.

865
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:42,748
Every 12 hours, our offer goes down.

866
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,079
And a year from now,
when you're ready to shutter the place...

867
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:48,745
and you come to us?

868
00:58:49,189 --> 00:58:53,023
We're not gonna pay you a fraction
of what we were gonna pay you today.

869
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:54,650
Not a fraction.

870
00:59:06,306 --> 00:59:09,366
- Sol, you seen Arthur?
- He's not back here.

871
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:10,807
Tough day?

872
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,071
Don't play with me right now.
I'm not in the mood.

873
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:15,204
I'm not playing with you, I'm feeling for you.

874
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:18,250
Go feel for the cleanliness of the dishes,
and let me do my work.

875
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:19,409
Speaking about work...

876
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,250
when were you thinking of telling me
I'm out of a job? Next week some time?

877
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:26,250
You have no idea what's going on, Sol.

878
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:28,589
- So...
- You little shit.

879
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:32,662
What's up, Sol?
Why are you talking to me like this?

880
00:59:32,765 --> 00:59:34,426
Because you're hondeling me.

881
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:35,932
What the fuck is that? Hondeling?

882
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:38,469
We're supposed to stick together.
Help each other out.

883
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:39,868
Now I'm out on the street.

884
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:41,702
This is a Jewish thing?

885
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:45,437
You know when I was in prison?
You know who reached out to me?

886
00:59:45,545 --> 00:59:47,877
The black guys, the Muslims...

887
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:49,642
even the KKKers.

888
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:52,240
You think a rabbi ever came to see me?

889
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,783
- Not once.
- Sol, what are you talking about?

890
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:56,856
What happened to you
in prison has nothing...

891
00:59:56,956 --> 00:59:58,924
I was a medical doctor.

892
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,090
Okay, fine. I made some mistakes.
So now I'm dirt?

893
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,823
That's how you see me,
an ex-con, an ex-junkie.

894
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:09,993
- That's bullshit, Sol, and you know it.
- No, that's the way I feel.

895
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:13,163
You fucking schoolboys
think people are disposable.

896
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:15,207
Survival of the richest.

897
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:18,402
- You little pischer.
- Okay, that's enough.

898
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:21,770
I don't care about before, I care about now.

899
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,042
Now, you're a dishwasher.

900
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:27,142
Jew, gentile, doctor, lawyer,
I don't give a shit.

901
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:29,221
You are a dishwasher.

902
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:33,717
Now get back to work
or you won't even be that.

903
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:39,724
What goes around, comes around.

904
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:43,635
That's in the Torah...

905
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:46,296
the Bible, and the Koran.

906
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,873
That's in all of them.

907
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:19,061
Where have you been?

908
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:21,299
I've been looking all over the restaurant
for you.

909
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:24,899
I was right here in my booth.
Same place I am every Friday at this time.

910
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:27,536
- You know that.
- I don't know anything right now.

911
01:01:28,514 --> 01:01:31,039
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

912
01:01:32,018 --> 01:01:35,044
Marc, could you please,
just for a minute here?

913
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:37,420
Thank you.

914
01:01:40,793 --> 01:01:42,488
I think I fucked up.

915
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:45,428
I called off the deal.

916
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:50,493
- You what?
- I told him forget it.

917
01:01:52,505 --> 01:01:54,439
That it's not right.

918
01:01:56,142 --> 01:01:58,167
What are you doing, Ira?

919
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,679
I don't know.

920
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,610
I think I fucked up.

921
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:11,316
This place is an institution, Arthur.

922
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:13,789
You said so yourself.

923
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:17,391
Arthur, come on.

924
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,559
I don't know
whether I'm coming or going with you, Ira.

925
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:30,072
I have to get back to work.

926
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:13,771
<i>Go!</i>

927
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:15,407
<i>Fire!</i>

928
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:20,853
Okay?

929
01:04:21,254 --> 01:04:22,812
What's up?

930
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:24,415
Here.

931
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:26,819
Break a leg.

932
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:28,689
I love you, baby.

933
01:04:35,935 --> 01:04:37,266
Excuse me.

934
01:04:51,317 --> 01:04:53,945
You wanna drink one now
or wait till they refreeze?

935
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:55,884
I'll wait, thank you.

936
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,152
I talked to Mr. Brown.

937
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:04,525
He said we could use their van
to move your stuff.

938
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:05,619
Cool.

939
01:05:05,731 --> 01:05:07,323
We might have to get a U-Haul, too...

940
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:09,731
depending on how much
you decide to take with you.

941
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:12,669
I wouldn't want you
to be without your girlie posters.

942
01:05:12,772 --> 01:05:15,639
You're gonna need them to help you study.

943
01:05:17,877 --> 01:05:20,402
You could bring some stuff down
with you on the train...

944
01:05:20,513 --> 01:05:22,208
when you come to visit.

945
01:05:23,115 --> 01:05:24,912
That could work.

946
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,786
You don't have to call him
if you don't want to, Samel.

947
01:05:34,293 --> 01:05:37,387
I'd understand that. I'd respect that.

948
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:39,191
He's a grown man...

949
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:41,698
and he hasn't made the effort
to reach out to you.

950
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:46,129
No matter what you do, this is your home.

951
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,537
This is your family.

952
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:53,843
You just do what feels right for you, okay?

953
01:06:18,137 --> 01:06:19,434
What's up?

954
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:22,271
- Busy night.
- Guy here?

955
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,343
He's over here. Come on.

956
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:35,479
V!

957
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:40,755
- What's up, Ruby?
- This is my friend I told you about, Joleen.

958
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,384
Hello, Joleen, how are you?

959
01:06:42,495 --> 01:06:44,053
- Hi.
- Do me a favor.

960
01:06:44,163 --> 01:06:47,098
Hang out here, get her a drink.
And I'll be right with you.

961
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,066
I'm gonna go back to work. Good luck.

962
01:07:29,408 --> 01:07:31,842
I had this fight with my mom today.

963
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:35,770
She thinks I'm gonna end up
on the street or something.

964
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:38,543
She said some really fucked up shit.

965
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:42,612
That's your prerogative
to end up on the street.

966
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:46,750
- So you think I'm gonna fail, too?
- I didn't say that.

967
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:49,687
I'm just saying
that what happens to you isn't the point.

968
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:52,025
It's her job to love you no matter what.

969
01:07:52,131 --> 01:07:54,759
So you still think it's an okay idea.

970
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:57,492
You know I do, we've discussed it.

971
01:07:57,737 --> 01:08:01,173
- But I might end up on the street.
- Yeah, you might. So what?

972
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:05,232
Most of the great poets in the world
have ended up on the street at some point.

973
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:06,641
That's old school.

974
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:08,509
You know, I'm gonna succeed.

975
01:08:08,614 --> 01:08:11,981
All right? I'm gonna make great work
and get paid.

976
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:14,378
- Okay.
- I am.

977
01:08:15,087 --> 01:08:18,181
Erin, we've talked about this in class.
Come on.

978
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,522
Don't count on it, okay?
That's all I'm saying.

979
01:08:21,627 --> 01:08:23,356
Jump off the cliff, yes.

980
01:08:23,462 --> 01:08:26,522
But jump off the cliff
because you love to write. Period.

981
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:31,534
I understand what you're saying.

982
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:33,467
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

983
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,767
Okay. But you brought it up.

984
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:14,539
I was thinking today about what I want...

985
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,574
because I feel for the last seven years...

986
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,836
I've really been focusing
on what I don't want.

987
01:10:18,944 --> 01:10:21,970
You know what I mean.
I said no to the bottle, no to the pills...

988
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:25,107
but I really haven't said yes to anything.

989
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,078
I feel stuck here.

990
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:29,445
I'm just as stuck now
as when I was in prison.

991
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:30,886
It's the same old shit.

992
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:35,355
So I don't know.
I think I'm ready to try something new.

993
01:10:36,896 --> 01:10:38,955
I don't know. I'm scared, man.

994
01:10:39,498 --> 01:10:41,193
I'm up against it.

995
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,874
Yeah, hi. I'm calling for Ira, please.

996
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,879
It's Ron from Morgan Ventura.
He knows who I am.

997
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:34,884
Thank you.

998
01:11:47,533 --> 01:11:49,433
No, you don't have to page him.

999
01:11:49,535 --> 01:11:52,629
Just... Will he be in later tonight,
do you know?

1000
01:11:54,506 --> 01:11:57,134
Okay, thanks. No, no message. Thank you.

1001
01:12:36,749 --> 01:12:39,115
- Lf they make it to the playoffs?
- Not even.

1002
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:43,315
It's called a sweep.

1003
01:12:46,759 --> 01:12:49,023
Watch where you looking, nigger.

1004
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:18,351
And to the birthday boy!

1005
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:35,697
<i>New York Times.</i> Tough stuff.

1006
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:40,144
My wife used to do the puzzle every day.
She'd always...

1007
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:43,043
shout out the things she thought I knew.

1008
01:13:43,148 --> 01:13:44,775
Sports questions mostly.

1009
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:46,214
Tea, please?

1010
01:13:46,452 --> 01:13:49,546
Can I get an English muffin,
toasted well with jelly?

1011
01:13:49,655 --> 01:13:52,215
- Sure.
- Burn the British, thank you.

1012
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,086
"Burn the British," that's diner talk.

1013
01:13:57,096 --> 01:13:58,893
Friday's a tough one.

1014
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:01,365
Saturday's the hardest, I think.

1015
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:04,368
Looks like
you're doing pretty good, though.

1016
01:14:04,703 --> 01:14:06,261
You stuck on any?

1017
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:11,140
Give me one.

1018
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:15,704
Sometimes you get one,
the rest of them fall into place.

1019
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:18,875
What makes you think I need your help?

1020
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:20,884
It's a tough puzzle.

1021
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:25,481
Come on. Six, down. I'm pretty good at it.

1022
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:29,726
What's the matter, man?

1023
01:14:31,196 --> 01:14:33,027
I'm just trying to talk here.

1024
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:35,862
- You want coffee?
- I don't want nothing from you.

1025
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:37,333
All right?

1026
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:40,094
- Thank you.
- What's up, Samel?

1027
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:42,336
What you doing here?

1028
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:44,136
Had to get out the house, man.

1029
01:14:44,243 --> 01:14:47,610
Trying to find a little peace and quiet.
You know what I'm saying?

1030
01:14:48,514 --> 01:14:49,981
Same with me.

1031
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:52,346
Getting out of the house, I mean.

1032
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,941
Samel, is it?

1033
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,347
My name is John.

1034
01:14:57,356 --> 01:15:00,120
What are you doing? What do you want?

1035
01:15:00,392 --> 01:15:02,952
I'm just trying to make conversation.

1036
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,263
It's an old-fashioned pastime.

1037
01:15:05,364 --> 01:15:06,763
You in school?

1038
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,964
I'm about to go to Howard University.

1039
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:15,664
Very impressive.

1040
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:19,071
- What?
- I didn't say Harvard, I said Howard.

1041
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:23,547
I heard you. Howard University,
Washington D.C. It's a very good school.

1042
01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:27,212
Come on.

1043
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:30,345
There's got to be
some sports questions in there.

1044
01:15:30,456 --> 01:15:31,855
My wife, she would always ask me...

1045
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:36,485
Why don't you go home to your wife and
do your own crossword puzzle with her?

1046
01:15:36,595 --> 01:15:38,085
I wish I could.

1047
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:40,956
I buried her two weeks ago.

1048
01:15:41,633 --> 01:15:43,760
That's why I'm out wandering around...

1049
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:46,201
I'm trying to get it off my mind.

1050
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:49,937
Come on. Twelve, down.

1051
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:51,906
Try me out.

1052
01:15:56,982 --> 01:15:59,678
Snowfall. Nine letters, starts with "A."

1053
01:16:03,322 --> 01:16:06,348
- Sorry to hear about your wife.
- Thank you.

1054
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,867
I don't know.

1055
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:19,228
Okay, you got me.

1056
01:16:25,844 --> 01:16:28,335
I'm staying with my sons for now...

1057
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:30,677
see what they need.

1058
01:16:31,783 --> 01:16:33,011
Good man.

1059
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:35,613
Nice you're in their life.

1060
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:38,849
- Pardon me?
- I said it's nice you're in their life.

1061
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:42,186
My father's dead.

1062
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:44,958
Sorry to hear that.

1063
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,861
- That's hard.
- Right.

1064
01:16:50,335 --> 01:16:52,394
I could've been a better father.

1065
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:56,369
I wasn't there for the important times.

1066
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:58,204
The teenage years.

1067
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:01,336
When I finally figured things out
and came home...

1068
01:17:03,348 --> 01:17:05,282
she was already sick...

1069
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:07,775
and I realized how much I missed.

1070
01:17:07,886 --> 01:17:09,251
So you fucked up.

1071
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:12,016
I had to leave. We were fighting all the time.

1072
01:17:12,124 --> 01:17:14,217
I thought it would be worse if I stayed.

1073
01:17:14,326 --> 01:17:15,884
How could it be?

1074
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:19,054
You get in a beef with a woman
and it makes you leave your kids?

1075
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:22,833
That's weak, man.

1076
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:25,960
I mean, look...

1077
01:17:26,538 --> 01:17:29,166
your wife is dead now
and you're sobbing about her.

1078
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,673
I feel that.

1079
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:32,438
That's real.

1080
01:17:33,011 --> 01:17:36,378
When she was alive,
your kids were sobbing about you.

1081
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,217
Good point.

1082
01:17:45,824 --> 01:17:47,121
Avalanche.

1083
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:49,355
- What?
- Avalanche.

1084
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,588
Nine letters for a snowfall.

1085
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,692
See?

1086
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,239
I was bullshitting you.

1087
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:04,867
What, you're not really going to Howard?

1088
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:07,411
No, hell, yeah, I'm going to Howard.

1089
01:18:07,512 --> 01:18:09,207
I meant about my father.

1090
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:10,838
He ain't dead.

1091
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:13,713
May as well have been
the last 15 years, though...

1092
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,844
he damn sure wasn't around being my dad.

1093
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:20,156
You haven't seen him in 15 years?

1094
01:18:20,392 --> 01:18:22,360
I'm supposed to call him.

1095
01:18:23,261 --> 01:18:25,456
I don't have to, legally.

1096
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:31,063
But my foster mom wants to adopt me.
She wants me to call him.

1097
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:32,466
All right.

1098
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:35,500
- What are you gonna say to him?
- Nothing.

1099
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:38,636
I ain't calling.

1100
01:18:38,977 --> 01:18:41,207
How do you know what happened?

1101
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,314
Do you know his story?

1102
01:18:43,415 --> 01:18:45,975
- Because you never know.
- I don't care about his story.

1103
01:18:46,084 --> 01:18:47,642
I care about mine.

1104
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,785
And if I ever have kids,
I'm gonna be a better father than he was.

1105
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:54,120
I will never leave my family.

1106
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,022
We all wanna be better than our fathers.

1107
01:19:29,995 --> 01:19:32,463
"I was floating above it all

1108
01:19:33,265 --> 01:19:35,961
"You looked at me, thinking I might fall

1109
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:37,797
"I watched you all

1110
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,201
"You've showed me so much love and care

1111
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:44,100
"Told me I could go anywhere
do anything, be anyone

1112
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:46,302
"Tackle shit and get things done

1113
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:48,402
"Well, I'm up here still

1114
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:50,913
"And ready to jump, no fear

1115
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:54,076
"I'll go it all alone
I'll make it happen on my own

1116
01:19:54,186 --> 01:19:55,585
"I will rise

1117
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:58,085
"I will rise, I will rise

1118
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,814
"And you will see

1119
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,085
"Look up

1120
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,792
"Look up here at me"

1121
01:21:05,257 --> 01:21:07,282
Glenmorangie, please. Double, up.

1122
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:10,954
- Dewars okay?
- Dewars is fine.

1123
01:21:11,396 --> 01:21:13,296
- Dewars will do the trick.
- Right.

1124
01:21:13,799 --> 01:21:16,529
You going for the serious stuff, honey.

1125
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:19,602
I've had a serious day.

1126
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:23,270
- Let your hair down.
- I wish I had hair to let down.

1127
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:26,404
So you can laugh.

1128
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,106
I try.

1129
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:31,510
Here's to trying.

1130
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:34,713
Honey...

1131
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,512
you had a little trouble tonight?

1132
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:39,215
Yeah.

1133
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:43,055
A little encounter
with some of our endangered black youth.

1134
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:45,090
If only I'd been wearing my ribbon.

1135
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:46,630
What's that?

1136
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:49,526
Nothing, it's a bad joke.

1137
01:21:50,235 --> 01:21:51,497
Cheers.

1138
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,632
Friday night.

1139
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:04,872
- This place is gonna close, you know.
- Say what?

1140
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:06,211
This place.

1141
01:22:06,318 --> 01:22:09,219
It's gonna get torn down.
Become a high-rise.

1142
01:22:09,321 --> 01:22:11,585
This whole neighborhood, actually.

1143
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:14,625
Where did you get
this information from, honey?

1144
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:17,818
I'm the man responsible.

1145
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:20,694
Ain't that something.

1146
01:22:21,366 --> 01:22:22,765
It is.

1147
01:22:23,935 --> 01:22:25,630
You're the man.

1148
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,305
I am the man, yes.

1149
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:32,009
This afternoon, I wasn't the man...

1150
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:35,011
but I'm gonna try and see if I can't fix that.

1151
01:22:35,146 --> 01:22:37,671
Okay. A tree grows in Brooklyn.

1152
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:39,911
Rock 'n' roll.

1153
01:22:41,586 --> 01:22:44,555
But you need to reconsider your job, honey.

1154
01:22:47,993 --> 01:22:49,085
Fuck.

1155
01:22:51,296 --> 01:22:56,063
I'm sorry to see a black man out here
selling the property out from under us.

1156
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:57,759
What do you mean "us"?

1157
01:22:58,003 --> 01:23:00,198
The owners of this place aren't black.

1158
01:23:00,305 --> 01:23:02,034
They may as well be.

1159
01:23:02,407 --> 01:23:05,399
This is ours. They welcome us here.

1160
01:23:05,911 --> 01:23:09,779
- You wanna make everything the same?
- It's not gonna change that much.

1161
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:12,873
It'll still have the same flavor...

1162
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:15,042
just cleaner. Safer.

1163
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:19,321
Honey, you can't wash out
all the color and keep the flavor.

1164
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:22,853
Jesus.

1165
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:28,331
I didn't come in here to take on the world.

1166
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:32,535
Here's to your success.

1167
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:34,772
Maybe yours will be mine.

1168
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:38,074
Thank you.

1169
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,074
That would be nice.

1170
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:47,846
Hit me.

1171
01:23:49,621 --> 01:23:51,486
You're the man all right.

1172
01:23:52,757 --> 01:23:55,988
- Nice to know you.
- Nice to know you, too.

1173
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:03,529
So where you going from here?

1174
01:24:04,936 --> 01:24:06,563
You mean tonight?

1175
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:11,500
I haven't thought that far.

You got time.

1177
01:24:15,046 --> 01:24:16,536
Think about it.

1178
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:18,808
Okay.

1179
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,351
The music is good.

1180
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:28,086
Classic.

1181
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:34,258
My world is changing.

1182
01:25:19,878 --> 01:25:22,108
<i>What's happening?</i>

1183
01:25:22,714 --> 01:25:25,148
<i>Nice night in Brooklyn.</i>
<i>Glad to be here with you.</i>

1184
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:28,084
<i>Let's get lovely up in here.</i>
