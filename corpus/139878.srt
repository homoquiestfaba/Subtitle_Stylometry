1
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,262
Aah!

2
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,717
I can't believe
this is happening.

3
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,193
I wish I could see his face
just one last time.

4
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,259
I hope you're in a better place,
my friend.

5
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,277
How you holding up, Jake?

6
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,279
I'm just great, Mike.

7
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,345
Aren't we all
just fucking great?

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,785
I feel so much better
now that you guys are here.

9
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,259
What's his problem?

10
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,664
Let it go, Mike.

11
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,328
We're here to pay respect,
remember?

12
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,206
Where's Adam's family?

13
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,437
His mom found him.

14
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,071
I doubt she'll be going
anywhere for a while.

15
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,308
What about his dad?

16
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,944
South America, South Africa.
I can never remember which.

17
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,885
I don't think he's got a dad.

18
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,855
I think he was making it all up.

19
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,225
You all right?

20
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,818
Yeah.

21
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,854
I guess we're the closest thing
he has to family here.

22
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,496
Christ. How many times
do you have to tell a guy?

23
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,868
It's just a stupid game.

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,531
Hey.

25
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,041
We were all addicted
to Hellworld, man.

26
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,737
He's right, Mike.

27
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,211
We should've seen this coming.

28
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,807
But we didn't.

29
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,313
We didn't do a damn thing.

30
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,750
We have to live with that now.

31
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,055
Jake.

32
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,432
Jake.

33
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,177
No!
Let go!

34
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,475
Let go!
No!

35
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,014
No!

36
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,943
What's up, Mike?

37
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,039
What?

38
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,514
I paid 100 bucks for this thing
on the Internet.

39
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,986
Didn't it scare you at all?

40
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,114
Mike, Cenobites don't exist.

41
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,592
And even if they did, I never
opened the Lamont Configuration.

42
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,357
Which, as we know,
isn't really real anyway.

43
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,863
You talk the talk pretty good

44
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,696
for someone who's not really
into it anymore.

45
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,097
What are you doing?

46
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,302
Something amazing, Chelse.

47
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,073
Wow.
My curiosity's killing me.

48
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,012
Funny you should ask.

49
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,011
The box. You opened it.

50
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,576
We came.

51
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,781
"Dare to enter hell?"

52
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,325
Now your soul belongs to me.

53
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,383
"You've just been invited
to the fifth annual

54
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,928
secret Hellworld party.

55
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,159
Be at the Leviathan House. "

56
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,292
Leviathan House?

57
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,769
Mike, I'm over it.
We've been through this before.

58
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,737
Oh, what?
So now you're above it all?

59
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,410
You can count me out.

60
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,810
- I have some sights to show you.
- We will.

61
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,643
Please.

62
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,808
You may want to spend
quality time

63
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,442
with the "Hellraiser"
geek brigade.

64
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,180
But Derrick and Allison
would never waste

65
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,485
a perfectly good Friday night
in Hellworld.

66
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,960
The Wall Walker's
right behind you.

67
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,621
I know the Wall Walker is
right behind me.

68
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,221
There you go.
Easy, there, kiddo.

69
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,960
Now go through the door.

70
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,798
I can't believe it! The box!

71
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,098
Oh. Come on.
Open it.

72
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,900
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- No.

73
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,134
Allison, you're all herky-jerky.
Come here.

74
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,141
You got to finesse it.

75
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,507
Oh, Derrick.

76
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,070
Time to play.

77
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,809
Ooh!

78
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,483
What's your pleasure?

79
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,420
Holy sugar.
We did it!

80
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,788
I'm going to a real, live
secret Hellworld party!

81
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,690
But what about me?

82
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,126
- No guests.
- Welcome to hell.

83
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,857
That's not very fun, is it?

84
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,696
Now move aside.
I can get my own invite.

85
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,860
Okay.

86
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,525
Come to Papa.

87
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,331
I'll tear your soul apart.

88
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,467
Don't tell me
you're going to Hellworld.

89
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,305
Hell, yeah!

90
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,868
Allison, please.
We aren't kids anymore.

91
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,414
Sure you don't want to
check this out?

92
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,278
Hang on, Allison.
Good night, Mike.

93
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,183
I have all eternity
to know your flesh.

94
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,481
- Good night, Mike.
- Come on, Chelse.

95
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,181
- For old times' sake?
- Good night, Mike.

96
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,656
- Website shuts down at midnight.
- Yeah. I'll call.

97
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,057
- Little kiss?
- Good night.

98
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,456
Sorry.

99
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,992
So what if I'm still
into Hellworld?

100
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,534
It's only a party, sweetheart.

101
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,660
That's not the point.

102
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,604
Look, I do find myself bored
and playing it now and again.

103
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,473
But this is like
"Space Voyage" convention crap.

104
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,011
There is a major difference

105
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,377
between Space Voyagers
and Hellraisers.

106
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,678
Hellraisers know how to party.

107
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,310
Reality check. We should've
grown out of this by now.

108
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,217
Reality check.

109
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,846
We're going.

110
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,255
Are you gonna come or not?

111
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,325
Hey, good-lookin'.

112
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,393
About freaking time, boys.

113
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,831
Look at you, sexy.

114
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,703
You like this?
Let me tell you something.

115
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,766
You want to come back here?

116
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,709
Oh, come on, Allison.

117
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,269
At least let me sit up there.

118
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,111
Ohh!
That's gonna leave a bruise.

119
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,411
Yeah, I know.

120
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,715
Oh, leg cramp.
Leg cramp!

121
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,186
Derrick, you're kicking me!

122
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,255
Anybody need a lift?

123
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,458
So, what made you
change your mind?

124
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,296
I just wanted to keep you all
out of trouble.

125
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,461
You've been away from
the Dark Realm awhile.

126
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,629
How'd it feel playing again?

127
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,538
Just like any other
ultraviolent, 24-hour,

128
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,803
wildly popular
yet utterly purposeless,

129
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,902
embraced-by-the-masses,
Internet role-playing game.

130
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,379
All right, Pinhead Junior.

131
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,384
100% mayhem, 0% guilt.

132
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,592
Hellraisers, let's play!

133
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,432
Oh, yeah!

134
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,439
A little something from the
Norman Bates School of Design.

135
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,941
This is such a perfect place
for a Hellworld party!

136
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,340
Let's go.

137
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,572
Let's go raise some hell.

138
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,978
Adam would've loved this.

139
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,646
Whoo!

140
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,709
Hang on.

141
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,586
Chelse, are you coming or what?

142
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,849
Yeah, she's coming.

143
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,223
- Oh!
- Come on.

144
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,228
Mike, put me down!

145
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,230
- Mike!
- Whoo-hoo!

146
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,196
Mike!

147
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,831
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

148
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,131
Yeah.

149
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,570
I like this.

150
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,473
This is so rad!

151
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,309
Oh, this is gonna kick "A"!

152
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,870
Whoo-hoo!

153
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,045
I've died and gone to hell!

154
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,297
Gratuitous tit shot.

155
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,528
Necessary tit shot.

156
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,900
Come along, boys.
Don't be antisocial.

157
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,149
Now, that's what I call
a buzz kill.

158
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,745
Hi! Jake!

159
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,790
Didn't expect to see you here.

160
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,060
What the hell is he doing here?

161
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,823
I haven't seen him
since the funeral.

162
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,660
Who has? I'm not surprised
to see him here.

163
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,529
He got us started
in all this crap.

164
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,125
Even Adam.

165
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,364
Jake blames us for Adam's death.

166
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,065
I blame us for Adam's death.

167
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,301
Come on, guys.
It's just a game.

168
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,071
A crazy fucking Internet game.

169
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,340
It's one thing to play it,
another to live it.

170
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,110
What Adam did was his decision.

171
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,048
End of story.

172
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,608
We're here to have fun, right?

173
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,881
Right?

174
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,081
Jake!

175
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,488
Come on over and join the party.

176
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,888
So, what have you been
up to, Jake?

177
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,127
Trying to forget the past.

178
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,337
Welcome, Hellraisers.

179
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,845
I take it this is your first
time at a Hellworld party.

180
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,609
Invitations.

181
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,414
Outstanding.

182
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,789
May I offer you a drink?

183
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,085
Make yourselves at home.

184
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,423
I have a feeling you're going to
be here for a while.

185
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,895
I'm your host
for the festivities tonight

186
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,194
and perhaps the ultimate
Hellworld fanatic.

187
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,599
Look at this stuff.

188
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,767
You see this?

189
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,033
It's like a "Hellraiser" museum.

190
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,372
I don't think you'll find
a greater collection anywhere.

191
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,571
Who's the pretty kitty?

192
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,139
You're the pretty kitty.

193
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,647
Yes, you are.

194
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,188
Hey, guys.
Five bucks, see your future?

195
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,887
Oh!

196
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,197
This is where the shit hits
the fan, guys.

197
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:33,959
Ooh.

198
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,467
Did you see this?

199
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,800
Mr. LeMarchand himself!

200
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,185
Mmm!

201
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,421
I wear Eau de Cenobite.

202
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,753
Oh.
Oh, God.

203
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,320
Ow.
That stuff stings.

204
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,660
Oh.

205
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,826
- Derrick!
- What?

206
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,463
May I offer you a drink?

207
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,698
It's from my family's
private stock.

208
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,108
A little ritual
for newcomers only.

209
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,237
Here you go.

210
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,007
Guys?

211
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,878
No.
I don't drink.

212
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:24,847
I'm driving.

213
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,408
Come on.
Let's not insult the dude.

214
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,249
No insult taken.

215
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,811
Bottoms up.

216
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,753
Knock yourselves out.

217
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,816
Mm.

218
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,257
Holy cow.

219
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,561
That is amazing.

220
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,533
Yes.
It's made out of human skin.

221
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,297
There's no texture
quite like it.

222
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,395
Wow.

223
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,770
This place is all skin
and bones. I love it.

224
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,936
I see you all have a fondness
for the macabre.

225
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,310
There's more
where this came from.

226
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,674
I'd like to show it to you.

227
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,491
I'm an authority on Leviathan
House, Philip LeMarchand's

228
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,459
second greatest
architectural achievement.

229
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,326
I assume you already know
his first greatest.

230
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,390
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here
tonight.

231
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm getting goose bumps.

232
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,475
Like most great artists
of his time,

233
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,277
LeMarchand found himself
commissioned by the Church

234
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,476
to build a convent.

235
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,543
And for decades, LeMarchand's
palace stood as such.

236
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,990
Then came the convent's final
mother superior, Sister Ursala.

237
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,688
A nun whose vows were shattered

238
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,161
by an obsession
for a tiny puzzle box

239
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,063
and the unholy pleasures
sealed inside it.

240
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,777
Hey, Derrick!
Man, you got to listen to this.

241
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,083
Sometime during the blizzard
of 1809,

242
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,251
some 80 women vanished
from this house without a trace.

243
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,591
Ursala was the only one
they found.

244
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,223
Only she wasn't all there.

245
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,297
You might say
she went to pieces.

246
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,399
Oh, but...

247
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,798
Years later,
the house was renovated

248
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,571
and became a lockup
for the criminally insane.

249
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,509
From nuns to nuts.

250
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,447
That is, until the staff
began reporting occurrences

251
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,780
of paranormal violence.

252
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,685
So the house is haunted.

253
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,415
Ooh.

254
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,289
Oh, man!

255
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,354
That's what I'm talkin' about!

256
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,127
Whoa.

257
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,395
This is awesome.

258
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,772
Oh!

259
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,180
Oh, man!

260
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,684
One cold spring morning,

261
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,880
the team locked themselves
in this surgical amphitheater,

262
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,355
injected themselves
with a local anesthetic,

263
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,255
and dismembered one another.

264
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,758
So the house is haunted.

265
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,164
I think tonight will bring you
many answers.

266
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,997
Very nice.

267
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,534
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

268
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,875
Often the butchery of
human flesh was so monumental,

269
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,849
they used these devices
to discard the excess.

270
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,386
You mean they chucked
human beings out with this?

271
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,717
No. Bodies.

272
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,926
Forget goose bumps.

273
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,660
My you-know-whats
are getting hard.

274
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,167
Mm.

275
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,104
So, who owns the house today?

276
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,000
You do.

277
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,912
Oh.

278
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,553
Now, that's just wrong.

279
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,123
Whoa!

280
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,626
What the fuck?

281
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,595
Are you all right, Derrick?

282
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,832
Yeah.

283
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,498
Ew.

284
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,288
So, Jake, are you here
with some new friends?

285
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,653
It's a friend.

286
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,021
A girl?

287
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,186
You sound surprised.

288
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,695
No, I'm not surprised at all.

289
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,630
Look.
This isn't a reunion, okay?

290
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,635
I never was one of you guys,
and I never will be.

291
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,396
Same old Jake.

292
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,034
Chelsea.

293
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,450
Have a good time tonight.

294
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,117
You still look
woefully underwhelmed.

295
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,651
Whatever.

296
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,796
Have a high tolerance, do you?

297
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,501
The props are cool,
but this is just an old house.

298
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,300
LeMarchand is a character
from some scary story,

299
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,901
the puzzle box a myth,
and Hellworld is just a game.

300
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,605
Thirsting for something more?

301
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,238
Something I believe.

302
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,010
How about pain?

303
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,269
Adam was right.

304
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,072
Chelsea? Are you okay?

305
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:27,634
Chelsea?

306
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,374
Hey, take it easy.

307
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,105
You all right?

308
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,046
You stay away from me.

309
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,610
I'll try to contain myself.

310
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,088
Okay.
Everybody just calm down.

311
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,557
Is everything cool, Chelsea?

312
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,957
Yeah.

313
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,254
She hasn't even
started drinking yet.

314
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,323
I think I need some air.

315
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,701
I need a drink.

316
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,536
Hell seekers,
this is your house tonight.

317
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,012
Now, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

318
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,776
What's with the masks, anyway?

319
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,648
Everybody gets a mask
and a cellphone.

320
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,778
Each mask has
a four-digit number on it.

321
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,584
If you wish to engage
in the pleasures

322
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,647
that only flesh can bring,

323
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,661
you pick a tasty morsel
and dial that number.

324
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,663
Sweet.

325
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,993
Anonymous debauchery.

326
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,057
Ooh. I like this already.

327
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,466
God.
A day in the life of you guys.

328
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,529
Does nothing ever change?

329
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,633
Much as I love watching
old wounds being opened,

330
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,177
I do have other guests.

331
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,739
But if you need anything,
just scream.

332
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,115
So, Jake, still haven't found
your date?

333
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,121
For your information,
I met her on-line.

334
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,716
Oh, so you don't even know
what she looks like.

335
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,918
What kind of
chat-room-challenged moron

336
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,725
do you think I am?

337
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,434
That's why I'm here.

338
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,003
This ought to be fun.

339
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:14,075
Can you hear me now?

340
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,680
Can you hear me now?

341
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,807
Three shots over here.

342
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,644
Lot of talent here.

343
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,412
What?

344
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,385
A lot of...

345
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,380
A lot of talent here tonight.

346
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,356
Go get some.

347
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,359
Oh, yeah!

348
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:01,026
You know, as in,
you should go get some.

349
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,543
Oh. Oh.

350
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,477
Yeah.

351
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,036
Good luck.

352
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,880
You're gonna need it.

353
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,984
Don't you have
anything better to do?

354
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,754
Oh, I'm enjoying myself, Jake.

355
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,921
I'm not hurting anybody.

356
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,760
The only way you guys
ever enjoy yourselves

357
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,129
is when you're hurting somebody.

358
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,531
You never change, do you?

359
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,159
I told my date about you guys.

360
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,602
Don't be surprised
if she's not exactly friendly.

361
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:45,109
You are not guilting me into
having a crummy time tonight.

362
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,542
We didn't earn your hatred,
Jake.

363
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,774
None of us earned it.

364
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,283
You guys don't earn anything.

365
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,012
You just take it.

366
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,396
It then became a lockup
for the criminally insane.

367
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,061
I'm a bit of an authority
on Leviathan House.

368
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,539
God damn, y'all are fine.

369
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,202
Oh. Yeah.
Excuse me.

370
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,140
I'll be right back.

371
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,210
I'm not Mr. Right,
but I'm Mr. Right Now.

372
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,845
Oh, goody.
These things actually work.

373
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,411
Thanks, Derrick.

374
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:33,788
What the...

375
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,060
Oh.

376
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,652
Ladies?

377
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,595
Damn it, Allison!

378
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,238
Oh, yeah.

379
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,117
So, here we are again.
Just the two of us.

380
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,021
Just the two of us.

381
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,755
I see.

382
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,768
So, how long has it been now?

383
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,201
Two years?

384
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,432
You're still holding a torch
for a guy

385
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,340
who you're never gonna get
a second chance with.

386
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,813
He's dead, Chelse.

387
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,440
Move on.

388
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,881
You know what, Mike?
Have a great time tonight.

389
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,421
Go fuck somebody.

390
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,290
But when you sober up,
I expect an apology.

391
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,797
Well, that went well.

392
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,863
Whoa!
Hey, baby.

393
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,266
You know what would
look good on you?

394
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,770
Me.

395
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,937
Whoa. Whoa.

396
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ooh.

397
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,306
Enjoy the party.

398
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,180
Asshole.

399
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,819
Hey, baby.

400
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,127
Hey, baby.

401
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,909
Hi.

402
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,843
Bye.

403
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,250
Yeah, right.

404
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,479
As if.

405
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,041
Hey.
How's it hangin'?

406
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,482
Ooh.
Don't answer that.

407
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,425
Hello.

408
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,946
Kids, don't try this at home.

409
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,734
The sacrificer is quite becoming
on you, Allison.

410
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,938
Get this thing off me.

411
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,574
It's been used to drain
the blood of Hellworld explorers

412
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,881
since Leviathan himself first
spoke the realm into being.

413
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,218
There is no faster way
to bleed a human

414
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,723
without decapitating him.

415
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,425
Please get this thing
off me now.

416
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,091
Relax. Relax.

417
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,292
It's perfectly safe.

418
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,365
Unless the cutting blades
are engaged.

419
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,877
The cutting blades are engaged.

420
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,281
Someone.

421
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,618
No!

422
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,386
No!
Please don't leave me!

423
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,552
No! No!

424
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,285
Chelsea!

425
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,627
Do you believe Adam now,
Allison?

426
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,723
Allison?

427
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,227
Allison?

428
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,070
Hello?

429
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,709
Hello?

430
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,319
Adam?

431
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,997
What the hell?

432
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,102
Hey!

433
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,042
Hey!
Open up!

434
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,408
Let me out!

435
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,980
Shit.

436
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,592
Adam.

437
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,373
"It's just a game"?

438
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,069
You're a bright one,
aren't you, kid?

439
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,970
Not like the others.

440
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,038
Where'd you get this?

441
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,344
How do you know Adam?

442
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,113
Adam was a very talented player.

443
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,621
In fact, he was so passionate
about Hellworld...

444
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:02,889
...that he made this
with his own hands.

445
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,054
Go ahead.
Open it.

446
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,369
It's not real.

447
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,600
It's...

448
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,745
Is it just a game now, Jake?

449
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,068
I'd love to see your puzzle box.

450
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,307
Want to dance?

451
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,912
Want to party?

452
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,397
Hey, how you doing?
Can I have a drink, please?

453
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,336
Sir, I'll take a drink.

454
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,174
Some party, huh?

455
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,234
Thanks.

456
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,806
Fucking asshole.

457
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,155
Whoa.

458
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,120
Anyone see this?

459
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,601
Hey.

460
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,001
Jake.
How you doing?

461
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,836
Listen.
I was just wondering what...

462
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,571
So sorry about that.

463
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,175
Hey, how you doing?
When'd you get into Hellworld?

464
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,947
Hello?

465
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,750
What's going on?
Hello.

466
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,485
What's going on here?

467
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,049
Guys.

468
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,497
What the fuck, man?

469
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,996
Hey.
Guys?

470
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,968
Hello?

471
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,699
Is everybody ignoring me?

472
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,035
Is this a joke?

473
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,542
Is this a big fucking joke?

474
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,211
Hey. Hey!

475
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,609
Hello?

476
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,745
Fuck this.

477
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,357
What a great party.

478
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,850
Ah!

479
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,183
Yeah.

480
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,448
Yes.

481
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,541
No!

482
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,365
No!

483
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,265
Can't disappoint my fans.

484
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,030
Hey, baby.
What's your name?

485
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,867
Mike, it's Chelsea.
Listen.

486
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,534
I am locked inside a room
on the second floor,

487
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,941
and I need you to come up
and help me.

488
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,808
Oh, so now you want me?

489
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,075
Mike, look,
I'm not messing around here.

490
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,846
There's something really strange
going on in this house.

491
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,387
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
blown me off.

492
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:33,949
Please.

493
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,855
Would you please come up
and help me?

494
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm serious!
I need your help!

495
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,223
What's wrong with you, Mike?

496
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,628
Mike?

497
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,368
Great.

498
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,223
Fuck!

499
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,659
What's the matter?

500
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,986
Oh, shit!

501
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,047
- Allison, thank God.
- Chelsea!

502
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,642
Help me!
Chelse!

503
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,211
Allison, if you and Mike
are fucking with me,

504
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,517
so help me, God.

505
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,524
Chelsea, help me!

506
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,288
And I thought you had
a high threshold.

507
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,559
Don't worry about Allison.
You'll see her again.

508
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,030
Sooner than you think.

509
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,270
Welcome to Hellworld, Chelsea.

510
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,761
911. What's your emergency?

511
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,320
I need help.
I'm at 86 Hillbound Drive.

512
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:55,380
Are you there?
I can't hear you. Hello?

513
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,802
Can I help you, fellas?

514
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,479
Hey, there.

515
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,140
Sorry to bother you
at this hour.

516
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,706
It's all right.

517
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,012
I think.

518
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,284
We just got a call.
Probably a prank.

519
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,017
Young woman says her friends

520
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,684
are being taken hostage
or something.

521
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,422
I'm entertaining some guests
here tonight.

522
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,661
She sounded whacked
out of her gourd.

523
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,028
Do you mind if we look around?

524
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,900
I'd rather you didn't.

525
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,001
Scare away my guests.

526
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,405
Hey!

527
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,137
Up here!

528
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,645
I have a reputation to uphold.

529
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,738
I don't want some drugged-out
chick tarnishing it.

530
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,248
Up here!

531
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,680
Officer,
I have Ms. Murdoch on the line.

532
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,052
This is Officer Riley.

533
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,252
I'm at the big house now.
Where are you?

534
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,660
I'm upstairs by the window,
just above the veranda.

535
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,794
I'm looking up at the window
right now.

536
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,601
I don't see a damn thing.

537
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,538
What the fuck
are you talking about?

538
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,009
I'm right here!
Look!

539
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,170
Look!

540
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,907
- Definitely drugs.
- Hey!

541
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,142
Probably speed or meth.

542
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,808
Come back!

543
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,384
Hey!

544
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,116
Up here!

545
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,348
Hey!

546
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,757
Look!

547
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:49,765
I'm rerouting you
back to Dispatch.

548
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,425
I don't believe this.

549
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,763
Dispatch.

550
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,360
This is Officer Riley.

551
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,200
Did the trace come up
with anything?

552
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,468
Yeah. The call
came from your number.

553
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,566
No shit.

554
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,270
Yeah.
Somebody's pulling your leg.

555
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,403
They're always one step ahead.

556
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,244
Okay, guys. We're going home.
Prank call.

557
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,284
Apparently she was calling me
from my phone.

558
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,622
These kids and their gadgets.

559
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,025
I don't want to sound nosy.

560
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,995
But what's a guy like you do

561
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,726
with a big house
like this, anyhow?

562
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,967
I love to party.

563
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,610
I believe you owe me one.

564
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,012
Come on, stud.

565
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,642
It's your turn to go down.

566
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,696
Up here!

567
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,593
Up!

568
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,696
Look up!

569
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,702
Up here!

570
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,846
That's gonna bruise.

571
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,651
Easy, sweet cheeks.
You're gonna bruise my tonsils.

572
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,875
That's not cool.

573
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,539
Open up.

574
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,583
Get in here.

575
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:56,977
Hello?

576
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,317
Come on. Open up.
This is not fair.

577
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,423
Hey!
Where are you going?

578
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,327
Don't leave me in here!

579
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,866
Fuck.

580
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,187
Props.

581
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,093
Just props.

582
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,500
Damn good props.

583
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,800
Just...

584
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,103
props.

585
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,724
Of course.

586
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,317
Latex.

587
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,163
Even put it
in Derrick's clothes.

588
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,635
Nice touch.

589
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,411
Derrick?

590
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,344
Derrick?

591
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,096
Oh, shit!

592
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,099
Fuck!

593
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,696
Oh.

594
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,748
Hello?

595
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,995
Anybody?

596
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,528
Somebody.

597
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,071
Sweet cheeks?

598
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,622
Not good.

599
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,776
Please!

600
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:09,812
No!

601
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,521
Please!

602
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,816
No!

603
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,468
This is just the beginning.

604
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,412
Hey!

605
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,881
Wait!

606
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,448
Over here!

607
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,650
Come back!

608
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,291
No!
Wait!

609
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,833
Oh, come on!

610
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,437
Please.

611
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,178
Come on!

612
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,907
Like a bad horror movie,
isn't it?

613
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,841
Come on, guys.
It's just a game.

614
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,545
A crazy fucking Internet game.

615
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,881
Adam was a very talented player.

616
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,587
None of us could've seen him

617
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,685
taking the game
as far as he did.

618
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,095
Aah!

619
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,102
What Adam did was his decision.

620
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,578
We should've seen this coming.

621
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,021
Not real!

622
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,238
Hey! Easy, now!
Whoa!

623
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,776
Hold on. Everything's fine.
Easy, easy, easy.

624
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,277
Ho.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

625
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,937
Hey, I'm a cop.
Easy, now.

626
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,505
Are you the girl
who called for help?

627
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,515
What's your name?

628
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,915
Chelsea.

629
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,577
What the hell
are you doing out here?

630
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,417
There's something strange
happening in that house.

631
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,286
Something terrible
happened to my friends.

632
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,619
You've got to believe me.

633
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,989
I believe you, Chelsea.

634
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,460
This isn't the first time
I've had to come out here.

635
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,861
There's something
about that house.

636
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,696
Hang on.

637
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,962
Dispatch, this is Unit 12.

638
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,061
Dispatch.
What's your situation?

639
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,663
I'm at the old house.

640
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,674
You still don't understand,
do you?

641
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,548
There is no way out for you,
Chelsea.

642
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,815
Oh, what wonders
we have to show you.

643
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,686
Chelsea!

644
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,357
- Jake!
- Chelsea, it's Jake!

645
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,628
Chelsea, it's coming.

646
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:55,296
Don't leave me here, Chelsea.
Don't leave me here!

647
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,464
I'm at the house, Chelsea.

648
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,472
Chelsea, please!

649
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,735
- Jake, hold on.
- Oh, my God!

650
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,141
Don't leave me here!

651
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,409
Don't leave me here.

652
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,312
Oh, my God, no.
They're coming.

653
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,874
Please don't leave me here.

654
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,421
Jake!

655
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,396
Jake!

656
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:29,364
Jake!

657
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,864
Chelsea!

658
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,873
Jake!

659
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,311
Jake, hold on!

660
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,909
Where are you?

661
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,473
Chelsea?

662
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,819
Chelsea!

663
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,923
Hello?

664
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,094
Chelsea!

665
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,028
Chelsea?

666
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,458
Shit.

667
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:02,868
Chelsea.

668
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,600
Jake!
Are you okay?

669
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,107
What happened?

670
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,200
No. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

671
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,040
What are you talking about?

672
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,706
There's something majorly wrong
going on here.

673
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,306
No shit.
Where is everybody?

674
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,045
I haven't seen anyone.
Have you?

675
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,053
No.
Nobody.

676
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,986
And I mean nobody.

677
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,321
It's this house, Jake.

678
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,256
It's like it's playing with us.

679
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,323
It's haunting us.

680
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,236
Not if I can help it.

681
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,758
That better be you, Mike.

682
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,427
Not this time, Chelse.

683
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,296
Great party.

684
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:14,275
Welcome to motherfucking
Hellworld, Chelsea.

685
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:16,940
No!

686
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,004
Get away from me!

687
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,476
Come on, Chelse.
Let's raise some hell.

688
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,314
Leave me alone!

689
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,979
Adam was right, Chelse.

690
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,023
No!

691
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,063
Come on, Chelse!

692
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,655
It's what we've always wanted.

693
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,723
You want me, Chelse.

694
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,029
You know you want me.

695
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,070
Game over, Chelsea!

696
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,197
Only you and Jake left.

697
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:46,570
No!

698
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,049
Stop!

699
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,668
Oh, God!

700
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:19,799
God.

701
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,380
Hello.

702
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,254
Hello, Chelsea.

703
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:40,489
I hope this night is everything
you dreamed it could be.

704
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:42,690
How obviously cryptic that was.

705
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,665
Why don't I
just call you Pinhead?

706
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,827
If that's what
you want to think.

707
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,632
So you are Pinhead, right?
Let me guess.

708
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,070
You're going to rip off
your face

709
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,870
and morph into some
franchise icon, right?

710
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,036
You don't know Hellworld
from your ass.

711
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,101
How come you're in it?

712
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,113
Get your mythology right, buddy.

713
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,808
First, I have to open the box.

714
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,147
Then, Pinhead appears.
The hooks and chains.

715
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:04,811
But none of that's happened.
Why?

716
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,855
Because none of it's real.

717
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,549
You'll come to believe it,
Chelsea.

718
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,821
I'll say this much.
It is about a box.

719
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,637
"Come to the party.
Come to the party. "

720
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,355
No!

721
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,663
Chelsea.

722
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,970
I'm sorry.

723
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,064
Why?

724
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,733
I didn't know.

725
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,707
I'm sorry.

726
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,542
Chelsea?

727
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,377
Please don't die.

728
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,513
What the fuck is going on?
Who the fuck is this?

729
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,052
Whoa! Jake!
Calm down!

730
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,849
It's just me, Chelsea.

731
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,753
What happened?

732
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,563
I just killed you.

733
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,064
Huh?

734
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,658
I just killed you.

735
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,397
You just died in my arms.

736
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,128
Oh, Jake.

737
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,142
Can I ask you a stupid question?

738
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,235
Could this place be a portal?

739
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,542
I mean to the real Hellworld.

740
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,206
Somebody wants us
to believe that.

741
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,080
That's for sure.

742
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,413
I'm not buying it.

743
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,082
I mean, where's the engineers?
Where are the jailers?

744
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,354
Now, Pinhead is just supposed to
show up and take your soul away.

745
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,689
That's it.

746
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,491
It's not adding up.

747
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,158
Maybe we're already dead.

748
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,100
No, Chelsea.
Nobody opened up the box.

749
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,105
Suppose it has nothing to do
with the box, Jake.

750
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,870
Suppose we're in hell
because we belong here.

751
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,469
For what?

752
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,273
For not saving Adam.

753
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,214
From who?

754
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,615
From himself.

755
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,449
From Hellworld.

756
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,949
Chelsea, none of us thought
he would take it that far.

757
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,549
We knew what Hellworld
was doing to Adam.

758
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,527
But we kept on playing it.

759
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,723
That was nobody's fault.

760
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:40,000
If this is hell,
none of us belong in it.

761
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:46,373
Well, I'm starting to think
we may not make it out, Jake.

762
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,036
At the rate we're going,

763
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:52,603
we might not make it long enough
to see the sun rise.

764
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,941
Chelse, when we get out
of this place,

765
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,283
I promise you the most
beautiful sunrise ever.

766
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,323
You're on, Jake.

767
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,919
Where are you?

768
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,794
I locked myself in the attic.

769
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:11,731
You don't even want to know why.

770
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,290
Okay.
Sit tight.

771
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,927
I'm on my way.

772
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,238
It's from my family's
private stock.

773
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,875
Come on.
Let's not insult the dude.

774
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,044
No insult taken.

775
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,517
Knock yourselves out.

776
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,895
Ow!

777
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,844
Welcome, Hellraisers.

778
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,372
Invitations.

779
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,681
Oh, shit.

780
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,890
Oh, shit.

781
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:57,803
Chelsea.

782
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,312
Come here, Chelsea.

783
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,318
Come here.

784
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,134
It's just a game, Chelsea.

785
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,268
Adam?

786
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,620
Adam?

787
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,063
Jake!

788
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,124
Jake!
Help!

789
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:02,461
Chelsea!

790
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:05,572
No!

791
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,040
Jake!

792
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,303
Chelsea!

793
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,836
- Jake, he's got me!
- Chelsea!

794
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:11,845
Help!

795
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,472
Whatever it is,
don't believe it.

796
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,211
It's not real!
It's all in your head!

797
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,220
It's whatever you're afraid of!
Don't be afraid!

798
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,586
He's not letting go!

799
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:24,717
You have to believe me!
It's not happening!

800
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,318
Chelsea, it's not real!

801
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,863
Chelsea!

802
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,334
Jake!

803
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:47,445
Chelsea.

804
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:52,250
It's okay.
Listen, Chelsea.

805
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,414
This whole Hellworld thing
has been one big trap.

806
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,082
We've been brought here
for some reason.

807
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,455
I don't know why, but...

808
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,584
Jake.

809
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,595
It's Adam's dad.

810
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,162
What?

811
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,937
No.

812
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,567
It can't be.

813
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,340
It's Adam's dad, Jake.

814
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,282
It can't be.

815
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,285
No, it is.

816
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,617
Do you want to stick around
for any more surprises?

817
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,588
Let's go!

818
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,361
Leaving so soon,
without even saying goodbye?

819
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,233
Goodbye.

820
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,637
Asshole.

821
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:53,772
Damn!

822
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,482
Go, Chelse.

823
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,918
Let's get out of here!

824
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,155
Let's go!
Move!

825
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,323
Oh, God!

826
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,024
Let's go!

827
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,366
Go!

828
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,462
No.
This way.

829
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:18,198
Boo.

830
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,558
What is it, Jake?

831
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,667
What is it?

832
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,294
It's us.

833
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,908
You ought to
pat yourself on the back, Jake.

834
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,740
Everything worked out
just like you said it would.

835
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,437
No.
I had nothing to do with this.

836
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:01,743
No, no, no, no.

837
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,717
I got to give credit
where credit's due.

838
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,013
The rest of them, I knew,

839
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,351
would respond
to a private-party invitation.

840
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,788
But you I wasn't sure about.

841
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,091
No.

842
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,261
I had to lure you out.

843
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,300
And I found you, Jake,
on the Internet.

844
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,199
In the Hellworld chat room.

845
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,464
You did it all for me.

846
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:28,639
Oh, the things a young man
will tell a prospective lover.

847
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,209
The myth of LeMarchand.

848
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,941
The puzzle box.

849
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,210
Hellworld.

850
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:37,911
How the game itself would be
the perfect weapon

851
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,647
to do everybody in.

852
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,450
I take my hat off to you.

853
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,048
I couldn't have done it
without you, Jake.

854
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,354
You couldn't have done this.

855
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,689
Oh, yes, I could.

856
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,357
Call it poetic justice for
the people that buried my son.

857
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,730
You sick son of a bitch!

858
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,463
You were never even there
for your own son!

859
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,002
Your son spent his life

860
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,440
waiting for a father
who never came home!

861
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,206
You didn't even go
to his fucking funeral!

862
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:09,280
That kid took 16 years
of loneliness to his grave.

863
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,843
And now you want to come back
and get revenge on us?

864
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:16,313
We were the only family
Adam ever had.

865
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,054
You still think you have
a fighting chance, don't you?

866
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:24,093
No! No!

867
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,565
Fuck!

868
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,435
Get me out!

869
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:29,435
Chelsea!

870
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:30,596
Let me out!
Chelsea!

871
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,401
- Can you hear me?
- Jake!

872
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,004
Chelsea! Let me out!
Let me out!

873
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,980
Oh, my God!

874
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,811
I can practically smell
the terror

875
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,441
coursing through your veins.

876
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:44,917
Why?

877
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,613
Why did you do this?

878
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:47,655
Revenge.

879
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,893
You and your friends
were right all along.

880
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,762
Hellworld never really
even existed.

881
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,664
It was in your mind
the whole time.

882
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,794
Don't!

883
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,668
Even this very moment.

884
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,872
You believe me now, don't you?

885
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,380
You and your friends have been
six feet under since this began.

886
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:20,348
Sodium amytal is a drug that
induces a highly impressionable,

887
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,014
trancelike euphoria.

888
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,524
It can be taken in every
which way you can imagine.

889
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,185
No!

890
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,195
You can inhale it.

891
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,494
You can touch it.

892
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:34,364
- Ingest it.
- No! Please.

893
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,529
You and your friend Jake
were reluctant

894
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,129
to sample my free gifts.

895
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,036
Fuck!

896
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,808
I had to take you by force.

897
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,245
Chelsea!

898
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,754
Once you were drugged,
you were under my spell.

899
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,630
I buried you.

900
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,156
Each in separate coffins
with cellphone at hand.

901
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,762
With ventilation
so you wouldn't run out of air

902
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,501
and miss out on all that
sweet suffering.

903
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,514
It was through these cellphones

904
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,284
I could communicate
subliminal suggestions.

905
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,031
Your own fertile imaginations
did the rest.

906
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:38,759
Chelsea!

907
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:49,610
There were freak-outs,
confessions, negotiations,

908
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,908
orgasms, surrenders.

909
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:59,283
Your own guilt-ridden conscience
even threw Adam in there.

910
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,753
Chelsea.

911
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,586
What a pleasant surprise
that was.

912
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,489
It was all so exhausting.

913
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,222
I barely had enough energy
to go back and enjoy myself

914
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,285
at the party.

915
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,424
I figured, "Why not?

916
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,900
Why not enjoy myself?"

917
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:27,671
There were a few unexpected
casualties along the way.

918
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:29,717
Allison severely gouged herself

919
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:32,116
trying to claw off
her imaginary neck device

920
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:34,018
and then bled to death.

921
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:37,950
Derrick's asthma took him out.

922
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,326
And Mike?

923
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:50,736
He died of good old-fashioned
drop-dead fear.

924
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:03,608
You know what makes
my revenge so sweet?

925
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,279
I beat you guys
at your own game.

926
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:08,447
We loved him.

927
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,855
We didn't deserve this.

928
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,156
Tell him that when you see him.

929
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,832
Your dream's over, Chelsea.

930
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,367
No!

931
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,926
Your nightmare is
just about to begin.

932
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,202
No!

933
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,138
See you in hell.

934
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,199
No!

935
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,214
Goodbye, Chelsea.

936
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,533
Come on, guys.

937
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:01,768
No!

938
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,902
- You're all right.
- No! No!

939
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,241
Let go of me!

940
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,712
- Get off!
- You're okay.

941
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,373
- It's all right.
- You're safe.

942
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,509
- Get off me!
- Let's go.

943
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,576
No!

944
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,212
You're safe.

945
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,189
You're safe now.

946
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,781
You're safe!

947
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,724
Stop!
Stop.

948
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,621
- Oh, my God! No!
- Hey.

949
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:27,200
You don't need to see.
You don't need to see that.

950
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,462
- Come on.
- No!

951
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:29,468
Come on.

952
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:30,868
No!

953
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,092
Oh, God!
Jake!

954
01:23:57,165 --> 01:24:00,464
Oh, my God!
Jake, are you okay?

955
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,969
Jake!

956
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,471
Oh.

957
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,009
Wow.
What a party.

958
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,045
We made it, Jake.

959
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,974
We made it out.

960
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,913
Guess I owe you that sunrise.

961
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,939
You're very lucky, you know.

962
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:47,072
We almost gave up on you.

963
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,340
I don't understand.

964
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,010
You've been missing for days.

965
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,180
And somebody made a call
a little while ago.

966
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,779
We traced the call
to this location.

967
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,884
I'm sorry to say the house owner
cleared out a few days ago.

968
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,259
Covered his tracks
pretty good, too.

969
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,094
Don't worry.
We'll catch him.

970
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:06,957
He's gone?

971
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:11,070
But then, how'd you find us?
Who made the call?

972
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,630
Traced the signal
right to this very spot.

973
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:17,701
Damndest thing.
We'd have never have found you.

974
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:20,714
Your cellphone was found
up at the house.

975
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,915
Maybe the owner made the call,
but I doubt it.

976
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,181
I don't get it.

977
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,019
Welcome.

978
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,187
Welcome to hell.

979
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:50,957
This is not happening.

980
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:53,933
Seeing is believing.

981
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:58,735
I should've come for you
a long time ago.

982
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:02,105
Hellworld.
There's no Hellworld.

983
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,268
It doesn't exist.

984
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:05,244
Your son was quite the prodigy.

985
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:08,373
He opened the gateway to hell.

986
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:12,010
But you never believed yourself,
did you?

987
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,221
Got to wake up.

988
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,422
I got to wake up.

989
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,237
I got to wake up.

990
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:33,606
Wake up!

991
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:50,451
How's that for a wake-up call?

992
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,198
Chicago.

993
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,368
No.
No. It's too cold.

994
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,537
Miami.

995
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:10,372
Typical male.

996
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:13,846
Yeah. Well,
this typical male delivers.

997
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,109
Check it out.

998
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:30,958
Hello?

999
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:33,456
Hello?

1000
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,468
Hello, Chelsea.

1001
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,465
Jake.
