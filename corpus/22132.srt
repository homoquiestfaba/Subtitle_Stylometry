1
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,620
Stop!

2
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,810
Hey, y'all.

3
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,250
You bugger!

4
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,130
Not live rounds, Lara.

5
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,130
He's in real pain right now.

6
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,050
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

7
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,180
Was it programmed to stop
before it took my head off?

8
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,140
Ah, well, that would be a no.

9
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,270
But you said make it
more challenging, so--

10
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,820
Hence, the live fire.

11
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,360
Hmm, live rounds again.

12
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,410
Poor Simon.

13
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,450
What has she done to you?

14
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,840
Very funny.

15
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,140
I'm only trying to
turn you into a lady.

16
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,390
And a lady should be modest.

17
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,900
Yes, a lady should be modest.

18
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,750
Brothers and sisters...

19
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,880
today is the 15th of May--

20
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,510
the first day
of the planetary alignment--

21
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,090
and we are still no nearer to
discovering the location of the key.

22
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,550
It seems...

23
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,060
we are running out of time.

24
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,390
This is not acceptable.

25
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,400
Mr. Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

26
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,900
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

27
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,160
Except to once again
respectfully remind the Council...

28
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,240
that we are working from clues based
on ancient cosmological models...

29
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,080
predating Aristotle.

30
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,090
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

31
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,420
And I am supremely confident...

32
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,970
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

33
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,890
So, we will have possession
of the key in...

34
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,810
one week.

35
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,270
Yes, indeed-- one week.

36
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,860
This is good news, Mr. Powell,
but remember...

37
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,900
we have only
a single opportunity...

38
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,320
to retrieve the two halves
of the triangle.

39
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,870
And if we fail...

40
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,580
we must wait another 5,000 years.

41
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,330
I don't know about you,
but that's more time...

42
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,880
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

43
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,470
We shall be ready.

44
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,930
Trust me.

45
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,150
We're not--
We're not ready, are we?

46
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,490
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

47
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,910
Back to work, I'm afraid.

48
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,250
It's adventure time.

49
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,960
Egypt again.

50
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,220
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

51
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,220
I know.
Gets everywhere-- in the cracks.

52
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,180
Spanish galleon?

53
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,520
Do you know what day
it is, Hillary?

54
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,110
Yes, of course.

55
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,900
The 15th.

56
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,240
And that is never a good day.

57
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,020
I miss you, Daddy.

58
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,730
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

59
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,720
My father would love
to have seen this.

60
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,390
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

61
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,020
It's the first stage of
the alignment of all nine planets...

62
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,350
culminating
in a full solar eclipse.

63
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,480
It only happens
once every 5,000 years.

64
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
When is the eclipse?

65
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,110
One week from today.

66
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,070
But there is plenty
to look out for until then.

67
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,490
Incredible.

68
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,190
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

69
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,030
Mummy!

70
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,410
I wish I could remember her too.

71
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,330
I still have you, Daddy.

72
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes, you do.

73
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,460
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle...

74
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,340
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

75
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,720
But that will prove to be
just long enough...

76
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,480
for little Lara Croft to grow up...

77
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,520
and to find it.

78
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,390
Bryce!

79
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,810
Hello, fellas.

80
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,690
- How's business?
- Bryce!

81
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

82
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,370
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?

83
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,250
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

84
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,790
Right.

85
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,880
What's that smell?

86
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
5:00 a.m. Let's go.

87
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,340
This had better be good.

88
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,810
It's a clock.

89
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,690
I found it last night.
It was ticking.

90
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,980
Must be one of them
ticking clocks, eh?

91
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,030
It was hidden in a secret room.

92
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,530
Don't start.

93
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,250
Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.

94
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,250
It started ticking...

95
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,920
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.

96
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,760
Well, gonna need some coffee.

97
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,810
Okay, in we go.

98
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,770
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

99
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,730
Well, keep looking.

100
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,320
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with nonfat milk.

101
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, champion.
Steaming sump oil.

102
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,460
Wait. What did you do?

103
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,340
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?

104
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,720
I don't know. I just took
my hand off the fiber optics.

105
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,430
What is that?

106
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,310
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

107
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,980
Screw 13 to quadrant four.

108
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,740
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.

109
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,740
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

110
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,830
It's camouflage.

111
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,470
Okay.

112
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,810
Hidden within.

113
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,690
What is that?

114
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,950
The All Seeing Eye.

115
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,090
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.

116
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,390
Showing on my left,
1,800,000 pounds.

117
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,640
1,800,000. Thank you.
One million eight. 1,900,000.

118
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,140
Two million pounds.
Two million pounds now.

119
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,190
2, 100,000. 2, 100,000 now.
2, 100,000 pounds.

120
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,980
Any advance on 2, 100,000 pounds?

121
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,700
Any more? Two million one.
2,200,000. Thank you, sir.

122
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
2,200,000 pounds now.

123
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,450
At 2,200,000.
2,300,000.

124
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,540
Two million three.
2,400,000.

125
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,040
Lady's bid, 2,400,000 pounds.
2,400,000.

126
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Against you, sir.
Two million five? No.

127
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,460
2,400,000 pounds, then. Lady's bid
at two million four. 2,500,000.

128
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,050
In a new place at 2,500,000 pounds.

129
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,720
Any more at 2,500,000 pounds?

130
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,100
Sold.

131
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,980
Lara, my dear.

132
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,900
- Mr. Wilson.
- Come to my study. I'll take that.

133
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,690
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.

134
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,820
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.

135
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,750
You still pretending
to be a photojournalist?

136
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,630
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job...

137
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,710
even though it's obviously
just for show.

138
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,800
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?

139
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,560
Do we always have to
fight like this?

140
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,810
I mean, maybe we don't.

141
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,060
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

142
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,650
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

143
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,690
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's--

144
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,530
It's not like you ever
really owned them or anything.

145
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,490
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

146
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,740
Mr. West, we are ready for you.

147
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,790
Oh, I think your clients need you.

148
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,880
Go ahead.
You're wanted on the floor.

149
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,170
After all, as you said so memorably,
''It's all just a business.''

150
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,760
Right?
So go do business.

151
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,260
Go.

152
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,120
Lara, this is a unique object.

153
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,000
Only one of the dials
is working.

154
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,550
It glows, like the eye, lesser.

155
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,590
But it seems
to be getting brighter.

156
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,590
And it's also
running backwards--

157
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,010
like it's not so much keeping time
but counting down to something.

158
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,010
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

159
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,810
It's as though it fits into
something, almost like a key.

160
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,070
Yes. Yes, fascinating.

161
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,030
- Incredibly beautiful.
- My father once told me...

162
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,530
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.

163
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,660
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power--

164
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,240
the power to control time.

165
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,290
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?

166
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,580
No. No, I haven't.

167
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,720
He always steered his own course,
your father.

168
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,060
He was a great man.

169
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,310
Would you like some port?

170
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,020
- It's really very fine.
- No.

171
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,230
I can't help you, Lara.

172
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,950
This clock truly is a mystery.

173
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,930
- Hello.
- Lara?

174
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,930
Hello, it's Mr. Wilson.

175
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,850
Yes. Well, I--
You see, I had a second thought...

176
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,690
about that clock.

177
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,650
There is a man who
may be able to help you.

178
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,730
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.

179
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,780
You should see him.

180
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,150
Thank you. I will.

181
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,990
- Good-bye, Lara.
- You take care.

182
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,780
Thank you.

183
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,700
Bugger.

184
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,680
Forgive me.

185
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,910
Lady Croft.

186
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,870
- Ah, Mr. Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.

187
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,790
I'm actually
his associate, Mr. Pimms.

188
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,210
- Mr. Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.

189
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah, she's here.

190
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,730
What does Mr. Powell do?

191
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,980
He's a lawyer.
I'm his law clerk...

192
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,230
and fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

193
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,860
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

194
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,870
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

195
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,910
- Manfred Powell, QC.
- Good morning.

196
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,540
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.

197
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,120
Well, I travel.

198
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,710
No, no, Mr. Wilson said you were
quite the archaeologist.

199
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,760
Please.

200
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,380
Oh, he's very sweet.

201
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,430
He knew your father, I believe.

202
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,810
Yes, they were great friends.

203
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,940
I had the honor of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.

204
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,270
I was so sorry
to hear about his death.

205
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,150
This is the clock I spoke of.

206
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,330
Very interesting.

207
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,830
It's a shame you
only brought photographs.

208
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,130
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

209
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,090
You said it started ticking
the night of the alignment.

210
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,220
Yes.

211
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,270
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

212
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,350
And the study of clocks is a hobby?

213
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
This is an obsession.

214
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,530
Really my speciality. My practice
centers around antiquities.

215
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,820
But the origin of this clock...

216
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,200
completely eludes me.

217
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,330
I think I've never seen
anything quite so beautiful...

218
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,500
that I know so little about.

219
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,130
This is a pleasurable torment.

220
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,930
My ignorance amuses me.

221
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,220
''My ignorance amuses me.''

222
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,520
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

223
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,900
Powell, however, is not ignorant.

224
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,650
He's a liar.

225
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,960
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.

226
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,010
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

227
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,590
Forward team, wait for my command.

228
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,430
In position awaiting your order.

229
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,520
Bastards!

230
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,730
Bloody hell!

231
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,820
On the left.
On the left.

232
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,680
Come on, Simon!

233
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,560
Bugger!

234
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,550
Lara, Lara, are you there?
Pick up!

235
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,170
Lara, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

236
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,470
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.

237
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,760
I know. I saw them.

238
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,810
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?

239
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,860
After a fashion, yes.

240
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,280
All right.
Three bad guys.

241
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,400
Number one standing
by the Aston Martin.

242
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,490
Right.

243
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,450
Bingo!

244
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,680
- Next.
- Okay, number two...

245
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,720
crouched by the McLaren.

246
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,680
Oh, bugger!

247
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,950
-Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.

248
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,760
You're done, mate.
Nice one.

249
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,710
I think they've all gone.

250
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,880
They got what they came for.

251
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,470
Sorry about that.

252
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,050
That's fine.

253
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,810
Hello?

254
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,900
What the hell happened here?

255
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,910
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

256
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,580
Yes. You have something for me?

257
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,760
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.

258
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,930
Right. Thanks.

259
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,930
Who's Stribling, Clive
and Winterset then?

260
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,980
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.

261
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,070
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.

262
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,240
I'm not nosy.
I just saw the name.

263
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,820
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.

264
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,080
It's from my father.

265
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,830
It was written before he died...

266
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,710
and delivered today
as per his instructions.

267
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,670
- Blimey!
- Holy sh--

268
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,810
''To see a world
in a grain of sand...

269
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,560
and a heaven in a wild flower...

270
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,150
hold infinity
in the palm of your hand...

271
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,530
and eternity in an hour.''

272
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,570
William Blake.

273
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,730
The All Seeing Eye.

274
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,750
My darling daughter...

275
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,960
I knew you'd figure this out.

276
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,760
If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you...

277
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,760
and I miss you...

278
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,850
and love you always and forever.

279
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,060
It also means I have failed...

280
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,690
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.

281
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:59,020
Lara, by now I am sure you will have
discovered the clock I concealed.

282
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,780
The clock is the key, Lara.

283
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,870
It will unlock the hiding place
of two pieces of a sacred icon.

284
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,750
This is the magical triangle I told
you about when you were little.

285
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,670
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.

286
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,340
The triangle was forged from metal
found in the crater of a meteor...

287
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,590
that had fallen to Earth
at the exact moment...

288
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,590
of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

289
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,220
The people of the light built
a great city in this crater...

290
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,220
where they worshipped the triangle
for its ability to control time.

291
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,900
It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.

292
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,400
An abuse of this power led
to the destruction of the city.

293
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,070
To be sure no man would
ever again wield this power...

294
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,280
they split the triangle
into two pieces...

295
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,830
and hid them at opposite ends
of the Earth.

296
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,080
Lara, do you remember the jasmine
that only grows in one temple...

297
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,000
along the ancient Khmer trail
in Cambodia?

298
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,000
Find that and you will
have found the entrance...

299
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,300
to the Tomb of the Dancing Light...

300
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,380
where the first half
of the triangle is hidden.

301
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,180
You must be there
at the exact moment...

302
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,640
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

303
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,640
You must hurry.
You have very little time.

304
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,690
And as the planets
move into alignment...

305
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,150
the world will be
in great danger...

306
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,980
for the secret society
known as the Illuminati--

307
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,700
devious, dangerous men...

308
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,740
who seek to fulfill
an ancient prophecy...

309
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,120
by reuniting the two halves...

310
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,120
and attaining the triangle's
awesome and terrible powers.

311
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,250
This you must prevent
at all costs.

312
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,800
So, Lara, I am asking you
to complete my work--

313
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,840
to find and destroy
both halves of the triangle.

314
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,350
How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

315
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,440
I'll be calling in a favor.

316
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,900
- What kind of favor?
- Well, that is a secret.

317
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,690
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

318
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,370
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.

319
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,380
Right on target.
Thank you, boys. Over and out.

320
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,090
How predictable.

321
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,550
Alex West.

322
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,100
What are you doing here?

323
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,850
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.

324
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,850
We have to work faster.

325
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,280
Come on, guys!

326
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,950
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!

327
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,200
Pull! It's coming!

328
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,670
Good.

329
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,000
So, any sign of Lady Croft?

330
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,170
Not yet.

331
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,710
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong...

332
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,550
but she's in it for the glory...

333
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,920
whereas I'm in it for the money.

334
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,220
Fortunately.

335
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,930
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

336
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,170
Jasmine.

337
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,690
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space...

338
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,280
but also in time.

339
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,280
The clock is the key.

340
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,290
My God.

341
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,640
''Return the iron to
the stone's embrace...

342
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,760
the wheel of heaven will turn.

343
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,560
Exhume the light
from its watery grave...

344
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,850
to receive the gift of heaven...

345
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,190
as you are condemned
to the depths of hell.''

346
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,450
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.

347
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,620
We have two minutes, Mr. West.

348
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,200
You're the tomb raider.
Figure it out.

349
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,510
Tempus fugit.

350
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,520
Yes, ''time flies.''

351
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,640
It's the swords!

352
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,900
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.

353
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,700
That's it. Come on.
Coming down.

354
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,820
I want them all down.

355
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,790
Take them, carry them
across the ladders.

356
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,500
Let's hustle.

357
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:44,000
All right. Now slide them
into the slots over there.

358
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,550
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

359
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,880
Come on. Let's go! Move it!

360
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,890
Too slow, ladies, too slow.
Come on.

361
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
- That's it.
- Count it down.

362
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,240
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

363
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,600
Sixty seconds to go.

364
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,060
59, 58...

365
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,600
57, 56...

366
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,440
55, 54...

367
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,280
53, 52, 51...

368
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,360
fifty seconds.

369
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,370
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!

370
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,500
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!

371
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,460
41, 40...

372
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,800
39, 38...

373
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,640
- 37--
- Tourist visa?

374
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,760
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me...

375
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,850
is there a good reason
why I kept you alive?

376
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,690
Yes. That is not the true eye.

377
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,770
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.

378
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,940
It's a mirror image.

379
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,450
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.

380
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,490
Why would I try and cheat you
out of anything now?

381
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,530
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

382
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,660
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note--

383
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,120
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.

384
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,540
Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.

385
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,050
We can do it my way, or we can come
back in time for the next alignment...

386
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,300
and you are welcome
to try and kill me then.

387
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,510
In, oh, say
another 5,000 years.

388
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,640
12, 11...

389
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,480
ten...

390
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,940
nine, eight...

391
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:13,490
seven, six, five...

392
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,950
four, three...

393
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,700
two, one...

394
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
zero.

395
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,670
I guess she was right.

396
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,100
The log must pierce the urn.

397
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Come on!

398
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,990
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

399
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,500
Pure light, fire and water.

400
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,210
Get the clock.

401
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,300
Got it.

402
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,190
Hold it right there!

403
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,020
Give it up.

404
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,150
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

405
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,630
My phone is wet.

406
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,560
Yes?

407
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,230
Lady Croft, how are you?

408
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,980
Alive.

409
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,270
And kicking, I hope.

410
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,440
- And you?
- Superlative.

411
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,110
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.

412
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,360
And you have
my father's clock.

413
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,700
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

414
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,580
We should reevaluate
our positions.

415
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,290
Like it or not,
you and I are in business together.

416
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,960
We should have
a business meeting.

417
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,420
You mean you'd love to have another
opportunity to try and kill me.

418
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,170
Oh, that's harsh.

419
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,550
But perhaps.
Wait and see.

420
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,680
Come to Venice,
Via Dolorosa.

421
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,270
Wonderful. Bye then.

422
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,360
Harder.

423
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,690
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.

424
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,410
Look out.
It's some sort of machine.

425
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,370
Bryce, it's me.

426
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,120
- Hello?
- It's Lara. I found the temple.

427
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,670
- Ran into Mr. Powell.
- Did you get the clock?

428
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,420
No, but I got the first piece.

429
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,590
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

430
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,470
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr. Powell.

431
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,630
-Won't he just want to kill you now?
-No, silly.

432
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,100
His problem is that he needs
the piece that I have.

433
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,140
Until then,
I'm his new best friend.

434
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,600
What about the other half?
The final alignment...

435
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,060
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea...

436
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,690
where the second piece is hidden.

437
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,320
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.

438
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,660
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.

439
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,530
Pack for where?Hello?Lara?

440
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,660
Bye then.

441
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,360
Drink.

442
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:06,820
Rest.

443
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,700
There's no rest
for the wicked.

444
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,080
You got what you came for?

445
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,210
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.

446
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,250
Bad for the world.

447
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,300
The world is safe now.

448
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,720
Little bit safer,
perhaps...

449
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,090
because you will go on.

450
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,680
Your father said
you will never give up.

451
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,310
My father?
You knew my father?

452
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,850
Now, drink.

453
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,690
Finish your tea.

454
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:44,360
It tastes quite bad,
but it is good for you.

455
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,860
See?

456
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,320
Good evening.

457
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,910
You're with the Illuminati.

458
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,620
Beg your pardon?

459
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,290
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.

460
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,340
Illuminati--

461
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,390
The people of the light.

462
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,810
Have you brought my triangle?

463
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,810
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

464
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,530
You can keep
the triangle you have...

465
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,240
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

466
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,910
Who sits here?

467
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,580
We can be partners
and go for the big prize--

468
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,910
the Triangle of Light.

469
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,290
Yes, but who sits here?

470
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,800
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

471
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,800
It could set right
so many wrongs.

472
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,970
I don't think you sit here,
do you?

473
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,440
I sit here...

474
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,740
on God's right hand,
as it were.

475
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,950
In fact...

476
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,620
I now sit exactly
where your father sat.

477
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,870
You're lying.

478
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,300
No, he mentored me
in the order.

479
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,680
It was truly an honor.

480
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,800
I don't believe you.

481
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,890
My father was not
with the Illuminati.

482
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,520
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

483
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,310
Not from me.

484
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,570
Especially from you.

485
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,780
I know what you want, Lara.

486
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,410
Oh, I doubt it.

487
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,340
Another life with your father--

488
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,760
a second chance.

489
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,390
It'll be within my power
to give.

490
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:00,430
The triangle gives
its possessor...

491
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,390
the power of God--

492
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,440
to move back and forth
through time, undo the past.

493
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,690
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want--

494
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,070
to have your father
returned to you.

495
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,910
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece...

496
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,370
that you wouldn't then
just try to kill me?

497
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,710
Would it make it easier
for you--

498
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,090
on more familiar ground--
if I killed you now?

499
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,640
Will you reconsider?

500
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,580
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think...

501
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,500
I'm a greedy,
unscrupulous sellout...

502
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,500
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

503
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,750
Well, the money bit's true,
I guess.

504
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Is it, Alex?

505
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,890
If you cross me, we may not
be able to remain friends.

506
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,770
Always a pleasure.

507
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,820
Now for a cold shower.

508
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,030
I think we're in big trouble.

509
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,450
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

510
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,700
They already think we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

511
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,120
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

512
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,960
Is it?

513
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,540
Why don't you
worry about something else?

514
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,630
Of course it's not.

515
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,880
I don't understand. What chance
of success do we have without it?

516
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,510
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

517
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,180
But--

518
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,060
What a nice surprise.

519
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,440
Thank you.

520
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,990
Now, time to save the universe
again then, is it?

521
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,530
Absolutely.

522
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,570
Are we sure
she's really necessary?

523
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,700
Well, one tomb raider
is good. Two, better.

524
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,960
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.

525
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,920
Really?
That's fascinating.

526
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,930
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

527
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,350
We have to take
the last hour over land.

528
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,850
Helicopters won't
fly near the ruined city.

529
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,890
It's a dead zone.

530
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,310
We take all doggies.

531
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,820
Much-o U.S. greenback.

532
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,900
All doggies.

533
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,930
Welcome to the dead zone.

534
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,040
It's not a country.
It's an ice cube!

535
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,080
Come on!

536
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,010
All right. Let's go.

537
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,310
Go on, get it!

538
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,400
Holy shit.

539
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:03,910
It's a time storm.
Time is broken here.

540
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,660
We must find the eye!
All of you! Hurry!

541
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:11,080
We're running out of time!
Hurry! Hurry!

542
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,600
It's begun.

543
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,570
Fifty bucks says
the piece is inside the sun.

544
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:25,160
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!

545
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,630
Give me the clock.
I know what to do.

546
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,730
Has she got the piece?

547
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,190
We will now...

548
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,610
unite these two parts--

549
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:50,080
the past and the present.

550
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,080
At last,
we of the Illuminati...

551
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,130
will control time and fulfill
the sacred promise...

552
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,590
to our ancestors.

553
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:04,840
- Soon, the entire world will bow--
- Enough of this twaddle.

554
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,390
Come on! Come on!

555
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,630
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr. Powell?

556
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,430
I have a gut instinct
about this.

557
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,270
After all, you are
the daughter of a genius.

558
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,690
Let me test my theory.

559
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:53,320
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

560
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:55,240
You show me
how to complete the triangle...

561
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,330
we can change his fate.

562
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:02,710
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

563
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,750
It's only a little trip
back in time.

564
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:10,380
But I'm pretty sure you've figured
out the answer to the problem.

565
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,760
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

566
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:18,220
I can change that.

567
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:33,370
You'd better be ready
for this.

568
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,670
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

569
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,620
''To see a world
in a grain of sand.''

570
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,740
Daddy?

571
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,790
Is this real?

572
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,460
It is a crossing...

573
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,630
of my past and your present.

574
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,970
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

575
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,100
You were only a child.

576
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,310
You could have written
in your journals.

577
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:24,810
- You never mentioned it-- not once.
- I burst to tell you everything.

578
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:27,520
But in the fierceness
of my own battles...

579
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,320
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you...

580
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,860
and keep you safe.

581
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,780
I love you so much.

582
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,700
But I've missed you.

583
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:42,410
And I have missed you.

584
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,040
I know why you came here--

585
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,500
why you took the power of the
light-- but this must not happen.

586
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,710
Why? Why can't we use
the power just this once?

587
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,720
Why can't you stay?

588
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,640
We can't change time.

589
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,640
But time was stolen from us...

590
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,400
and it's not fair.

591
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,690
No, it's not fair.

592
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:13,780
But you have stolen
time itself...

593
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,820
and you must give it back.

594
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,160
You must destroy the triangle.

595
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,870
Suddenly I feel so alone.

596
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:31,580
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

597
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,980
Move out!

598
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,660
Wait!

599
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,660
Your father begged for his life...

600
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,830
when we caught him betraying us.

601
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,880
He pleaded like a baby.

602
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,170
Surrender.

603
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,130
Never.

604
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:49,640
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.

605
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,860
Lara, no!
The place is coming down!

606
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,900
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

607
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,030
You just hurry.

608
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,550
There you go--

609
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,720
safe and sound.

610
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,310
No guns.

611
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,910
Oh, my God!

612
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,540
Quiet.

613
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,450
What?
