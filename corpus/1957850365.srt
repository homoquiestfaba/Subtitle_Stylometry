4
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:18,410
<font face="Merriweather">I mean,
there was this sense of awe,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the sound of the TV
almost like dropped out,</font>

6

take my eyes off of her.</font>

00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:40,321

12
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:44,878
<font face="Merriweather">This is my secret that I've been
walking around with for years.</font>

13

where she was born.</font>

58

<font face="Merriweather">We then go to Denver
where she found her calling</font>

00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:58,468
<font face="Merriweather">to go from Denver to Stanford
all the way to Washington, D.C.</font>

00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:12,231
<font face="Merriweather">This is something that I did
not even want to tell you now.</font>

65
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:15,425
<font face="Merriweather">I feel like an idiot that I got
talked into telling you.</font>

you think you really are, right?</font>

a little addlepated right now.</font>

is very close to being insane.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So you have no intention
of getting an apartment?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to completely transport
into another world.</font>

87

have the most in common.</font>

It's the girl across the street.</font>

why they would close--</font>

219
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,239
<font face="Merriweather">why they would close this hospital?</font>

220
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,989
<font face="Merriweather">Because of
the civil rights movement,</font>

to African Americans,</font>

223
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:08,832
<font face="Merriweather">so this hospital no longer
had an appeal or a need</font>

was a preacher and read her</font>

has set forth a plan.</font>

253
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:37,588
<font face="Merriweather">One reason why she doesn't
really look back that much</font>

254
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,798
<font face="Merriweather">is she doesn't dwell on the kind
of mistakes she might have made,</font>

255
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,010
<font face="Merriweather">because what is happening
is that God's plan is unfolding.</font>

the existence of God.</font>

this aspect of Jesus life.</font>

00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,070

that my faith and my intellect</font>

- That was January 1962.</font>

00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,345
<font face="Merriweather">And we played outside a lot.
We liked that.</font>

274
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,290
<font face="Merriweather">Six years and I never
thought I'd be this close.</font>

275
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,102

there at the bottom the step.</font>

292
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:08,745

was on this side.</font>

293
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,057

important role in my childhood.</font>

294

great-grandmother all played piano.</font>

was also a piano teacher</font>

296

<font face="Merriweather">and I would bang at the piano</font>

students trying to emulate</font>

doing with her students,</font>

"Let's teach her to play."</font>

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,033
<font face="Merriweather">I was only about
three and as a result</font>

301
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,534
<font face="Merriweather">I learned to play very, very young.</font>

302
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,577
<font face="Merriweather">I could read music
before I could read.</font>

304
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:40,902
<font face="Merriweather">she could play Beethoven
and other classical music.</font>

305
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,614
<font face="Merriweather">She was--
she was good as a little girl.</font>

306
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,701
<font face="Merriweather">Everybody thought music
was going to be her career.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You've gotten this far.
Come on in and look.</font>

308
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,557
<font face="Merriweather">Now you're actually in the room.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter]</font>

312
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,132
<font face="Merriweather">She would read her books
and do her homework here.</font>

313
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,403
<font face="Merriweather">And had a doll collection.</font>

314
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,905
<font face="Merriweather">She had a lot of dolls.</font>

to her house with my mom</font>

317
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,951
<font face="Merriweather">and she had all her
dolls all nice in a row</font>

318
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,164
<font face="Merriweather">and kept them all cute
and then we would sit them down</font>

00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,249
<font face="Merriweather">at little tables and have tea parties.</font>

320
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,293

friends at the tea party.</font>

321
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,653
<font face="Merriweather">Was she a good tea host?</font>

322
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:26,197
<font face="Merriweather">She was always polite and offer
you what she had, you know.</font>

323
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,801
<font face="Merriweather">She was the girl next door.</font>

324
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,843
<font face="Merriweather">She went to church with us.</font>

325
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:33,705
<font face="Merriweather">She bowled and she became the most
powerful woman in the world.</font>

326
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,017
<font face="Merriweather">Just because she was a woman
and just because she was black</font>

327
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,544
<font face="Merriweather">did not stop her from doing
what she wanted to do.</font>

328
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:43,607

it may be that you can't have</font>

the Woolworth's lunch counter</font>

to this amusement park Kiddyland,</font>

including his daughter</font>

three times as hard"</font>

"And isn't that unfair?"</font>

349
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,992
<font face="Merriweather">They stated it in the most
matter-of-fact way</font>

00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:39,354
<font face="Merriweather">and it did teach us all
to sort of get on with life.</font>

who came from this community.</font>

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,856
<font face="Merriweather">and I just couldn't
believe that she was dead.</font>

431
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,878
<font face="Merriweather">What stands out
in Condi Rice's mind</font>

432
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:00,632
<font face="Merriweather">about that bombing is particularly
memories of the funeral.</font>

433
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:05,411
<font face="Merriweather">She recalls being very moved
by seeing those little coffins.</font>

434
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:09,957
<font face="Merriweather">That's an image that has
been emblazoned in her memory.</font>

435
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,853
<font face="Merriweather">Who would have
thought in September 1963</font>

436
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,395
<font face="Merriweather">when my little
classmate Denise McNair</font>

437
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:17,340
<font face="Merriweather">was killed in the bombing
of that church</font>

438
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:21,218
<font face="Merriweather">that I would stand before
you as Secretary of State.</font>

439
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,516
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice's father took her
to the White House in Washington.</font>

440
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,018
<font face="Merriweather">She was 10 years old.</font>

441
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,895
<font face="Merriweather">They looked at the White House,
she said I want to be there.</font>

442
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,358
<font face="Merriweather">She was on a mission
from her earliest age</font>

443
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,168
<font face="Merriweather">to prove to her
father, to her mother.</font>

444
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,963
<font face="Merriweather">Rising up in those very
tough years in Birmingham,</font>

445
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:42,591
<font face="Merriweather">her mission was to get to the top,</font>

446
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,368
<font face="Merriweather">to get to the top politically
and that's exactly what she did.</font>

447
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:53,185
<font face="Merriweather">So this time we need
a dedication to I think which is really</font>

and gone to heaven.</font>

511
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,528
<font face="Merriweather">She was a senior in my class</font>

to DU at the same time.</font>

everything she did?</font>

520
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:51,364
<font face="Merriweather">Well, she had
a very academic background.</font>

521
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,217
<font face="Merriweather">Her father became
the assistant dean</font>

522
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,051
<font face="Merriweather">at the Graduate School
of International Studies</font>

523
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,847
<font face="Merriweather">and I think it was
just in the whole family,</font>

524
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:04,019
<font face="Merriweather">they were very, very
dedicated and directive to her.</font>

525
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,630
<font face="Merriweather">I think what's happened
to me is 90% upbringing.</font>

526
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:10,316
<font face="Merriweather">I really do believe that my
parents were extraordinary</font>

527
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:13,445
<font face="Merriweather">in what they provided for me
and the kind of self-confidence</font>

528
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,947
<font face="Merriweather">that they gave me
and they never said, no,</font>

529
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:18,106
<font face="Merriweather">you shouldn't do that
or you shouldn't try that.</font>

530
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:20,702
<font face="Merriweather">They really had high
expectations for me</font>

531
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:21,936
<font face="Merriweather">and they passed them on.</font>

532
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:25,373
<font face="Merriweather">You know, I think that was
hard on her to be so young</font>

533
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:28,400
<font face="Merriweather">and I think she probably felt,
"What am I getting into here?"</font>

534
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,463
<font face="Merriweather">and the only black girl in the class.</font>

535
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,300
<font face="Merriweather">I understood that something
was deeply wrong</font>

536
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,508
<font face="Merriweather">in Birmingham, Alabama</font>

537
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,637
<font face="Merriweather">when I didn't have
a white classmate</font>

538
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,481
<font face="Merriweather">until we moved to Denver, Colorado.</font>

539
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,350
<font face="Merriweather">It didn't take her long to,
you know, acclimate to it,</font>

540
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:48,921
<font face="Merriweather">but she was also practicing
the piano several hours a day.</font>

541
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:52,025
<font face="Merriweather">She wanted to be a concert pianist
at the time she was here</font>

542
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:53,691
<font face="Merriweather">and if she didn't make
that she was going to be</font>

543
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,219
<font face="Merriweather">a professional ice skater.</font>

544
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:58,406
<font face="Merriweather">I was a very,
very bad competitive figure</font>

exceedingly hard at it</font>

546
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:04,120

every time that I competed.</font>

547
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,414
<font face="Merriweather">But I think those experiences</font>

548
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:10,124
<font face="Merriweather">did help me to have
a kind of discipline;</font>

549
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,487
<font face="Merriweather">a kind of sense
of organization in life</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think music might
be the way to her heart?</font>

572
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:03,303
<font face="Merriweather">Yes, because...</font>

573
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:06,623
<font face="Merriweather">music is the way
to many people's hearts.</font>

574
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:10,519
<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that serenading
could work today on Condoleezza</font>

575
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,796
<font face="Merriweather">as a courtship technique?</font>

576
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,468
<font face="Merriweather">It might very well,
particularly since she has</font>

577
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:18,762
<font face="Merriweather">such an eclectic taste.</font>

578
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,846
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, I would say yes.
Go for it.</font>

579
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:23,932
<font face="Merriweather">As a student, how was
she at taking direction?</font>

580
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:28,187
<font face="Merriweather">In taking very specific technical
directions, she was very good;</font>

581
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:33,358
<font face="Merriweather">emotional directions, she didn't
have an easy time doing that.</font>

582
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:37,421
<font face="Merriweather">As long as it was
mechanical things: do this,</font>

583
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:40,549
<font face="Merriweather">hold your hand
this way, or do that, fine,</font>

584
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:44,761
<font face="Merriweather">but as soon
as I touched her inside,</font>

585
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,206
<font face="Merriweather">there was a resistance.</font>

586
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:50,310
<font face="Merriweather">She seemed not to be interested</font>

587
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,127
<font face="Merriweather">in that aspect of music making.</font>

588
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:56,023
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice
ended her music career at 17</font>

589
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:58,276
<font face="Merriweather">when she was a sophomore
at the University of Denver.</font>

590
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:00,612
<font face="Merriweather">That summer she went
to the Aspen Music Camp</font>

591
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,323
<font face="Merriweather">and there she saw prodigies
who could play from sight,</font>

592
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,366
<font face="Merriweather">music that had taken her
months or weeks to learn.</font>

593
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:08,703
<font face="Merriweather">She saw she wasn't good
enough and she dropped it</font>

594
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:10,579
<font face="Merriweather">with no emotion,
no feeling whatsoever.</font>

595
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,248
<font face="Merriweather">It's not just talent,
it's that intangible</font>

596
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:16,711
<font face="Merriweather">that some people have
that just puts them over the top.</font>

597
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:17,877
<font face="Merriweather">I knew I didn't have it</font>

598
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:20,448
<font face="Merriweather">and I knew I probably wasn't
going to practice hard enough</font>

599
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:21,824
<font face="Merriweather">to compensate for it.</font>

600
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:24,510
<font face="Merriweather">This was a very important
turning point in Rice's life</font>

601
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,221
<font face="Merriweather">and so in one of our
interviews I asked her about it</font>

602
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,790
<font face="Merriweather">and she said to me,
"I don't do life crises. Period."</font>

603
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,251
<font face="Merriweather">She says she does
not believe in regret.</font>

604
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:36,105
<font face="Merriweather">She thinks life is too short and so
she doesn't look back on mistakes.</font>

605
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,398
<font face="Merriweather">She keeps looking forward.</font>

606
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:39,300
<font face="Merriweather">Self-reflection is not
something she does.</font>

607
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:41,067
<font face="Merriweather">She believes it's a waste of time</font>

608
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:42,678
<font face="Merriweather">and I think it had
a profound impact.</font>

609
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:45,098
<font face="Merriweather">Her one goal that she had set,
she failed at.</font>

610
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,849
<font face="Merriweather">I think she didn't
want to fail again.</font>

611
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:51,246
<font face="Merriweather">Well, I was a lost music major
to be truthful about it.</font>

612
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,666
<font face="Merriweather">I had decided that I was not going
to be a great concert pianist,</font>

613
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,192
<font face="Merriweather">but I didn't know what
I was going to be.</font>

614
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:58,461
<font face="Merriweather">I wandered into spring
quarter junior year,</font>

615
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,655
<font face="Merriweather">a course in international
politics taught by Josef Korbel,</font>

616
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:06,511
<font face="Merriweather">and he was a wonderful professor
because he was a great story-teller.</font>

617
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:11,599
<font face="Merriweather">He could really put
you there in the Soviet Union</font>

618
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,061
<font face="Merriweather">or in Czechoslovakia
or in Yugoslavia</font>

619
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:18,604
<font face="Merriweather">and I was just taken with him</font>

620
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:22,693
<font face="Merriweather">and with the history
and I remember the exact lecture</font>

621
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:27,615
<font face="Merriweather">that won me over and it
was one about how Joseph Stalin</font>

622
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:31,411
<font face="Merriweather">had consolidated his power
and I thought this is just terrific.</font>

623
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,788
<font face="Merriweather">This is what I want
to study and I went to him</font>

624
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,040
<font face="Merriweather">not long after that
and I said, "Dr. Korbel,</font>

625
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,400
<font face="Merriweather">I think I'd like
to study the Soviet Union."</font>

626
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:41,129
<font face="Merriweather">Josef Korbel was the professor</font>

627
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,129
<font face="Merriweather">who turned her on
to international affairs.</font>

628
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,826
<font face="Merriweather">He taught her the drama that
was inherent to global politics.</font>

629
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:49,887
<font face="Merriweather">He made her want
to be a political scientist.</font>

630
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:51,972
<font face="Merriweather">It was as she put it
"love at first sight."</font>

631
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,808
<font face="Merriweather">She was fascinated
and she became smitten</font>

632
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,047
<font face="Merriweather">with everything to do with
Russia and Russian politics.</font>

633
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:01,190
<font face="Merriweather">We don't know really
what would have happened</font>

634
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,440
<font face="Merriweather">if Lenin had survived.</font>

635
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,777
<font face="Merriweather">It is really Joseph Stalin
that made the Soviet Union</font>

636
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,485
<font face="Merriweather">into what the Soviet Union became:</font>

637
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:10,450
<font face="Merriweather">militarized, secretive,
a Byzantine state</font>

638
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,285
<font face="Merriweather">behind the walls
of the Kremlin,</font>

639
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,410
<font face="Merriweather">a state with pretensions
to greatness</font>

640
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:15,954
<font face="Merriweather">on the international scene.</font>

641
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:17,582
<font face="Merriweather">Joseph Stalin,</font>

642
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,275
<font face="Merriweather">that is really the legacy
of the Soviet Union, not Lenin.</font>

643
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,837
<font face="Merriweather">Now the other extraordinary
thing about Josef Korbel</font>

644
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,340
<font face="Merriweather">was that he was also
the father of Madeleine Albright.</font>

645
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,965
<font face="Merriweather">So he actually
is a man who had the two</font>

646
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,386
<font face="Merriweather">American female
secretaries of state in history,</font>

647
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,428
<font face="Merriweather">who were both as they
both would tell you,</font>

648
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:34,097
<font face="Merriweather">the daughters of Josef Korbel.</font>

649
00:31:34,473 --> 00:31:36,476
<font face="Merriweather">Albright literally
and Condoleezza Rice,</font>

650
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,169
<font face="Merriweather">she says uh, figuratively,
he was her second father.</font>

651
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:42,189
<font face="Merriweather">Well, Korbel was what
is known as a realist.</font>

652
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:44,649
<font face="Merriweather">A kind of group
of foreign policy specialists</font>

653
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:47,195
<font face="Merriweather">who believe you deal
with states as they are,</font>

654
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:50,448
<font face="Merriweather">you know, great powers.
The internal dynamics</font>

655
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:53,533
<font face="Merriweather">of those states doesn't
quite matter as much.</font>

656
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,662
<font face="Merriweather">Realists don't believe
and don't trust moral aspirations.</font>

657
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,164
<font face="Merriweather">They don't trust
countries that say,</font>

658
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:01,250
<font face="Merriweather">"We're the moral ones, we're
doing-- we have God on our side,"</font>

659
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,667
<font face="Merriweather">realists don't trust that stuff.</font>

660
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,436
<font face="Merriweather">There is that belief
in the concept of America</font>

661
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:25,048
<font face="Merriweather">that is an important part
of Rice's philosophy.</font>

662
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:31,388
<font face="Merriweather">I think I have athlete's--
Athlete’s complex.</font>

663
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,741
<font face="Merriweather">She once said, "I will
only marry a football player."</font>

664
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:36,744
<font face="Merriweather">I've got to do
something about this.</font>

665
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:38,538
<font face="Merriweather">Well, we need to get
you to meet these guys.</font>

666
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,164
<font face="Merriweather">They're the people
who can teach you.</font>

667
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:42,458
<font face="Merriweather">What about contacting
that ex-fiancé of hers,</font>

668
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:45,235
<font face="Merriweather">the football star, Rick Upchurch?</font>

669
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:48,214
<font face="Merriweather">You can meet him, you can
say whatever you want to him,</font>

670
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:49,715
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not gonna have anything
to do with it though.</font>

671
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,050
<font face="Merriweather">We're setting up an interview.</font>

672
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,077
<font face="Merriweather">You do the interview so
what's the problem with that?</font>

673
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,680
<font face="Merriweather">You want me to do
an interview with the one man</font>

674
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:58,224
<font face="Merriweather">that was engaged to her?
Don't even bother.</font>

675
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:00,143
<font face="Merriweather">There's no way I'm going.
I'm not doing it.</font>

676
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,144
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not doing it.</font>

677
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,439
<font face="Merriweather">Hello, Devin, how are you?
Hello, Sebastian.</font>

678
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,982
<font face="Merriweather">- It's a great pleasure.
- Honor and a pleasure.</font>

679
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:09,943
<font face="Merriweather">Today is Condoleezza's birthday</font>

680
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:13,070
<font face="Merriweather">and this is the first time
that I've had the opportunity</font>

681
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,139
<font face="Merriweather">to tell the story.</font>

682
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:17,451
<font face="Merriweather">There was tens
of thousands of young ladies</font>

683
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,536
<font face="Merriweather">that were here in this stadium</font>

684
00:33:19,828 --> 00:33:21,998
<font face="Merriweather">and there was only one young lady</font>

685
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,691
<font face="Merriweather">that I really wanted
and that was Condoleezza.</font>

686
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,710
<font face="Merriweather">When Condoleezza first saw me,</font>

687
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:31,531
<font face="Merriweather">I was in my second year
with the Denver Broncos</font>

688
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:36,137
<font face="Merriweather">and I just remember I had
a fantastic year that year.</font>

689
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,055
<font face="Merriweather">I had set a couple of records,</font>

690
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:40,598
<font face="Merriweather">had returned two punt
returns, man, in one game</font>

691
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,893
<font face="Merriweather">against the Cleveland Browns.</font>

692
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:46,339
<font face="Merriweather">I ended up tying a record
for touchdowns in a season.</font>

693
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,066
<font face="Merriweather">All of a sudden, everybody
was starting to recognize</font>

694
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,777
<font face="Merriweather">that Rick Upchurch was here
and he was making some noise</font>

695
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,153
<font face="Merriweather">out on the football field.</font>

696
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:57,891
<font face="Merriweather">My first encounter was going
over to Condoleezza's house</font>

697
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:00,660
<font face="Merriweather">and meeting Dr. John Rice</font>

698
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:02,522
<font face="Merriweather">and talking with him about school</font>

699
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,707
<font face="Merriweather">and she met me and says,
"Oh, you're that--</font>

700
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,984
<font face="Merriweather">you're that guy that that returns
those punts and that whole deal."</font>

701
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,171
<font face="Merriweather">and she says,
"You're a pretty good ball player."</font>

702
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,632
<font face="Merriweather">She really focused
in on the football aspect of it</font>

703
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,909
<font face="Merriweather">because she was really
interested in the game.</font>

704
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:19,913
<font face="Merriweather">Condi's appetite
for football is just like war.</font>

705
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:23,708
<font face="Merriweather">She likes to strategize
and put herself in a--</font>

706
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:26,102
<font face="Merriweather">in a position of power</font>

707
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:28,813
<font face="Merriweather">and a position of control</font>

708
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,757
<font face="Merriweather">and being able to make decisions</font>

709
00:34:31,274 --> 00:34:34,469
<font face="Merriweather">and she would probably be
one heck of a football coach.</font>

710
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,571
<font face="Merriweather">The thing that I knew</font>

711
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,933
<font face="Merriweather">is that she had a lot
of smarts about her.</font>

712
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:41,744
<font face="Merriweather">Very intelligent.</font>

713
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,663
<font face="Merriweather">Some of the questions
she would ask</font>

714
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,455
<font face="Merriweather">and the things that she would
talk about just let you know</font>

715
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:49,860
<font face="Merriweather">that this was a lady with a lot
of class and a lot of poise.</font>

716
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,987
<font face="Merriweather">She was truly
an American princess.</font>

717
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:55,157
<font face="Merriweather">Okay, this is where
I first met Condoleezza.</font>

718
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:58,301
<font face="Merriweather">This is where I first
courted Condoleezza</font>

719
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:01,873
<font face="Merriweather">and this is where
I proposed to Condoleezza.</font>

720
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:05,309
<font face="Merriweather">Now, where was it that you first
held Condoleezza's hand?</font>

721
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,354
<font face="Merriweather">I first held Condoleezza's
hand in the house.</font>

722
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:10,396
<font face="Merriweather">One night I was
getting ready to leave</font>

723
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:11,899
<font face="Merriweather">and I just grabbed her hand</font>

724
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,383
<font face="Merriweather">and just told her I said,
good night.</font>

725
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:16,595
<font face="Merriweather">And where was the first
place that you kissed her?</font>

726
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:20,532
<font face="Merriweather">The first place that I that
I kissed her was at the door.</font>

727
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:23,894
<font face="Merriweather">As I was leaving,
I gave her-- I gave her a kiss.</font>

728
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:28,248
<font face="Merriweather">When I said I loved her, she
actually looked at me and says,</font>

729
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:29,749
<font face="Merriweather">"You know, I like you too,"</font>

730
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:33,295
<font face="Merriweather">you know, and uh,
and at that point in time</font>

731
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:36,757
<font face="Merriweather">um, I felt like, you know,
we could go some places</font>

732
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,658
<font face="Merriweather">as far as our
relationship was concerned.</font>

733
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:42,555
<font face="Merriweather">You know, I like cheeks
and she had big cheeks.</font>

734
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:44,432
<font face="Merriweather">She had some juicy cheeks.</font>

735
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,708
<font face="Merriweather">I just wanted to kiss 'em,
so I kissed 'em.</font>

736
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:48,853
<font face="Merriweather">And was there
a lot of cheek action</font>

737
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,896
<font face="Merriweather">in terms of touching
her cheeks and...?</font>

738
00:35:50,897 --> 00:35:51,897
<font face="Merriweather">Absolutely.</font>

739
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,275
<font face="Merriweather">What I would do is I would put my
hand up and just touch her cheeks</font>

740
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:57,094
<font face="Merriweather">and that whole deal
and I would kiss her on her cheeks.</font>

741
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,404
<font face="Merriweather">[makes kissing sounds]</font>

742
00:35:58,405 --> 00:35:59,821
<font face="Merriweather">And where was the first time</font>

743
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:02,198
<font face="Merriweather">that you had your first like</font>

744
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:04,659
<font face="Merriweather">what is traditionally
known as a French kiss?</font>

745
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,061
<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

746
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:07,703
<font face="Merriweather">Never did.</font>

747
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:09,523
<font face="Merriweather">Didn't have no
French kiss with her.</font>

748
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,816
<font face="Merriweather">I never had
a French kiss with her.</font>

749
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,545
<font face="Merriweather">You know,
Condoleezza had gone out on dates</font>

750
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:17,047
<font face="Merriweather">and had seen other people uh, and,</font>

751
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:20,091
<font face="Merriweather">and one thing
that she says is that she was--</font>

752
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,885
<font face="Merriweather">she was respectful of her body</font>

753
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:24,722
<font face="Merriweather">and that was
something that she was going to</font>

754
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:25,972
<font face="Merriweather">to save for marriage.</font>

755
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,851
<font face="Merriweather">She would date
and she would meet people,</font>

756
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:31,770
<font face="Merriweather">but going outside of that,
she would not do.</font>

757
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:34,190
<font face="Merriweather">She didn't feel like
she needed to give her body up</font>

758
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,564
<font face="Merriweather">to show her love to anyone</font>

759
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:38,218
<font face="Merriweather">and so she wasn't going
to have sex before marriage.</font>

760
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,071
<font face="Merriweather">She's not married now.</font>

761
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,305
<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that she's
kept that promise?</font>

762
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:45,033
<font face="Merriweather">I think Condoleezza Rice today</font>

763
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:47,269
<font face="Merriweather">is still holding on
to those same principles.</font>

764
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:50,498
<font face="Merriweather">In England we had
the Queen Elizabeth I,</font>

765
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,357
<font face="Merriweather">who was known as the Virgin Queen.</font>

766
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,903
<font face="Merriweather">What do you think it means to
be the virgin secretary of state?</font>

767
00:36:58,129 --> 00:36:59,823
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, I'm not-- yeah,
I'm not going there.</font>

768
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:01,300
<font face="Merriweather">[laughs]</font>

769
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,784
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not going there, Sebastian.</font>

770
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:08,665
<font face="Merriweather">Here in this room here is where
I first proposed to Condoleezza.</font>

771
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:12,877
<font face="Merriweather">Here’s the ring and, um,
the ring wasn't a whole lot.</font>

772
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:17,924
<font face="Merriweather">Imagine Condi is Devin and what
exactly would you say to him?</font>

773
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,112
<font face="Merriweather">I said-- I said, "Condoleezza..."
I said, "Condoleezza Rice..."</font>

774
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:24,407
<font face="Merriweather">I said, "Um, I'm in love with you.</font>

775
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,809
<font face="Merriweather">Would you marry me?"
and she said yes.</font>

776
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,977
<font face="Merriweather">So then I offered the ring to her.</font>

777
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,691
<font face="Merriweather">I offered the ring
to her and she put it on.</font>

778
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,002
<font face="Merriweather">But there was a roadblock there.</font>

779
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:39,629
<font face="Merriweather">She had an offer
to go to Washington, D.C.</font>

780
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:40,905
<font face="Merriweather">and work there.</font>

781
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,800
<font face="Merriweather">And we knew at that point in time</font>

782
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:47,345
<font face="Merriweather">that her job was important to her</font>

783
00:37:47,595 --> 00:37:49,873
<font face="Merriweather">and her career was important to her</font>

784
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:54,502
<font face="Merriweather">and by me staying here and by
her going to Washington, D.C.,</font>

785
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:56,504
<font face="Merriweather">that it wouldn't--
it wouldn't work.</font>

786
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,549
<font face="Merriweather">She basically chose
Jimmy Carter over you.</font>

787
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:02,861
<font face="Merriweather">She chose--
she chose power over love.</font>

788
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:06,973
<font face="Merriweather">She chased her dream
and today she's living that dream.</font>

789
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,126
<font face="Merriweather">Another year, another birthday,</font>

790
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:20,987
<font face="Merriweather">but you keep on looking younger.</font>

791
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,200
<font face="Merriweather">I am so impressed with you, Condi.</font>

792
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,534
<font face="Merriweather">I'm so impressed.</font>

793
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,619
<font face="Merriweather">Each new day I find
out more about you.</font>

794
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:31,306
<font face="Merriweather">I am so impressed,
you've gone this long holding out</font>

795
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:33,583
<font face="Merriweather">and sticking to your principles.</font>

796
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:35,001
<font face="Merriweather">Good for you.</font>

797
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:38,881
<font face="Merriweather">I hope you enjoy this next
love disc I made for your birthday.</font>

798
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,382
<font face="Merriweather">Happy birthday.</font>

This is Devin Ratray.</font>

of your stepdaughter.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, she is.</font>

without permission. Okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Please let her know
that I'm a huge admirer and...</font>

874
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,408
<font face="Merriweather">I'll talk to her tomorrow and I'll
tell her that I talked to you...</font>

875
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:02,745

a listen to the discs</font>

her with her-- with her bags.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You deserve it.</font>

889
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:34,859
<font face="Merriweather">I was an associate dean
in the office of faculty affairs</font>

890
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:39,072
<font face="Merriweather">when a faculty member came
to us and said that he had just</font>

891
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:41,657
<font face="Merriweather">discovered a young scholar</font>

892
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:45,952
<font face="Merriweather">who had given a pretty good paper</font>

893
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:47,981
<font face="Merriweather">on Sino-Soviet relationships</font>

894
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:51,794
<font face="Merriweather">and he thought that it
might be wonderful for Stanford</font>

895
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,378
<font face="Merriweather">to use Affirmative Action
funds in this way</font>

896
00:43:55,129 --> 00:43:57,965
<font face="Merriweather">and so money was made
available for her appointment.</font>

897
00:43:58,257 --> 00:44:01,302
<font face="Merriweather">I'm sure there was a concern</font>

898
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:05,556
<font face="Merriweather">not to miss
an extraordinary opportunity</font>

899
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:08,851
<font face="Merriweather">to hire someone who was a woman,</font>

900
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:13,231
<font face="Merriweather">who was black and who was also,
you know, stunning</font>

901
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,858
<font face="Merriweather">personally and intellectually.</font>

902
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:19,363
<font face="Merriweather">She discussed with me
how she was counted six times</font>

903
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:22,198
<font face="Merriweather">as a black and a woman
for Affirmative Action purposes</font>

904
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:23,907
<font face="Merriweather">in the Arms Control,</font>

905
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:25,869
<font face="Merriweather">Disarmament set of
the Political Science Department</font>

906
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,982
<font face="Merriweather">and one other unit, so she actually
showed up as six at Stanford.</font>

907
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:33,250
<font face="Merriweather">So she was making fun</font>

908
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:35,212
<font face="Merriweather">of the Stanford
Affirmative Action Program.</font>

909
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:37,923
<font face="Merriweather">She's admitted at various
times that she's a beneficiary</font>

910
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:40,425
<font face="Merriweather">of Affirmative Action,
yet she uses her personal story</font>

911
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:42,427
<font face="Merriweather">to say “I didn't need
government action.</font>

912
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:45,347
<font face="Merriweather">I didn't need public
protest to advance.</font>

913
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,623
<font face="Merriweather">I advanced, um, all on my own.”</font>

914
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:51,228
<font face="Merriweather">I'm clearly a package:
I'm black and I'm female,</font>

915
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,730
<font face="Merriweather">but I've always thought
that the most important thing</font>

916
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,274
<font face="Merriweather">is to do your job and do it well</font>

917
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,317
<font face="Merriweather">and don't question other people's
motives for your selection.</font>

918
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:02,739
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice, uh,
in 1991 was made provost.</font>

919
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,284
<font face="Merriweather">She's the youngest
person ever to get that job,</font>

920
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,895
<font face="Merriweather">the only African-American,
the only woman.</font>

921
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:11,790
<font face="Merriweather">Suddenly she's inheriting
a deficit in the budget</font>

922
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,150
<font face="Merriweather">of some 20 million dollars.</font>

923
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,253
<font face="Merriweather">For my 20th tenure at Stanford,
she called me in.</font>

924
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:19,839
<font face="Merriweather">She said, "Oh, Cecilia,</font>

925
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,051
<font face="Merriweather">I'm so glad to see you
and I want to thank you</font>

926
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:25,761
<font face="Merriweather">because you really
were so helpful to my father</font>

927
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:29,015
<font face="Merriweather">and that's why this
is a bit hard but, you know,</font>

928
00:45:30,224 --> 00:45:31,642
<font face="Merriweather">I know you're not happy</font>

929
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:33,644
<font face="Merriweather">and I know you want to leave,</font>

930
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:36,047
<font face="Merriweather">so I'm making it
possible for you to leave."</font>

931
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:40,109
<font face="Merriweather">We were quiet,
I stood up, I walked out</font>

932
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:44,531
<font face="Merriweather">and she said to her
secretary in a deep sort of--</font>

933
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:46,432
<font face="Merriweather">she took a deep
breath and she said,</font>

934
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:48,951
<font face="Merriweather">"Oh, good. Who's next?"</font>

935
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,356
<font face="Merriweather">I always remember that little tone.</font>

936
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:54,416
<font face="Merriweather">Cecilia Burciaga was the first Latina</font>

937
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,874
<font face="Merriweather">to make it to the top of Stanford.</font>

938
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:59,862
<font face="Merriweather">She was a super
popular Dean of Students</font>

939
00:46:00,254 --> 00:46:02,299
<font face="Merriweather">and she had a center
where students love to come.</font>

940
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,969
<font face="Merriweather">This is a woman who
was simply cut down.</font>

941
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,246
<font face="Merriweather">Her career destroyed.</font>

942
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:10,790
<font face="Merriweather">This was sort of Condoleezza Rice's
step to advancement.</font>

943
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:12,935
<font face="Merriweather">For her it was more
important to show she was tough,</font>

944
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,938
<font face="Merriweather">show she could cut the budget
even when it came down</font>

945
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,131
<font face="Merriweather">to cutting the most
advanced Latina.</font>

946
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:22,927
<font face="Merriweather">It was a very contentious
decision at the Stanford campus.</font>

947
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:27,783
<font face="Merriweather">The numbers show
that when she became provost,</font>

948
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,494
<font face="Merriweather">she basically
reversed what had been</font>

949
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:32,454
<font face="Merriweather">an institutional
commitment by Stanford</font>

950
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:35,916
<font face="Merriweather">to try to diversify its faculty</font>

951
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:39,861
<font face="Merriweather">and the upper levels
of its administrative staff.</font>

952
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:43,839
<font face="Merriweather">She essentially kind
of pulled up the ladder,</font>

953
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,574
<font face="Merriweather">you know, after she
had gotten that helping hand.</font>

954
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,428
<font face="Merriweather">In education in particular</font>

955
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:52,764
<font face="Merriweather">I continue to believe
that Affirmative Action</font>

956
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,475
<font face="Merriweather">that is not driven by quotas</font>

957
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:57,253
<font face="Merriweather">is an extremely
important thing to practice.</font>

958
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:01,149
<font face="Merriweather">A college-based
committee formed a report,</font>

959
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,861
<font face="Merriweather">produced a report about
the state of play of race relations</font>

960
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:09,156
<font face="Merriweather">on the campus and the degree to
which the college was not obeying,</font>

961
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:12,659
<font face="Merriweather">uh, that dictates, the demands
of Affirmative Action,</font>

962
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,248
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice's response
wasn't to try to figure out</font>

963
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:17,624
<font face="Merriweather">what could be
done to make it better,</font>

964
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:20,776
<font face="Merriweather">her response was
to debate the data very angrily.</font>

965
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:25,132
<font face="Merriweather">Her name she says
means "with sweetness"</font>

966
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,185
<font face="Merriweather">But, you know,
she says she speaks Spanish</font>

967
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:30,761
<font face="Merriweather">so she always also
knows that her name means</font>

968
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,290
<font face="Merriweather">Condolencia: "with pain."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cut it.“Don’t look…”</font>

994
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:17,493
<font face="Merriweather">Dev, it's good, it's good.</font>

995
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:18,828
<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah?
- How are you feeling?</font>

996
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:20,996
<font face="Merriweather">Sorry, I just didn't
want to be boring.</font>

997
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,124
<font face="Merriweather">And it's a little boring.
That's my only concern.</font>

998
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,860
<font face="Merriweather">My only little concern here.</font>

999
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,923
<font face="Merriweather">I think we just need to sort
of take it to the next level</font>

1000
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:31,965
<font face="Merriweather">and you're completely
in control here</font>

1001
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,219
<font face="Merriweather">so you can make
a decision about this,</font>

1002
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,971
<font face="Merriweather">but this line "look at me
because I'm naked,"</font>

1003
00:49:38,055 --> 00:49:39,099
<font face="Merriweather">because I think it is--</font>

1004
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,625
<font face="Merriweather">this is really justified is to go--</font>

1005
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,378
<font face="Merriweather">is to perform this naked.</font>

1006
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:46,606
<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to show her naked.</font>

1007
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,400
<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to show myself to her
before our wedding night naked.</font>

1008
00:49:49,692 --> 00:49:52,528
<font face="Merriweather">I wouldn't ask an actor
to do anything I wouldn't do.</font>

1009
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:55,806
<font face="Merriweather">Sebastian, I'm not an actor.</font>

1010
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:59,744
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not act-- I mean, I'm trying
to convince a woman that I love.</font>

1011
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:01,997
<font face="Merriweather">I know you're not.
Now take your shirt off.</font>

1012
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,331
<font face="Merriweather">Wha...?
Sebastian, please don't do this.</font>

1013
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,375
<font face="Merriweather">I think this is almost harassment.</font>

1014
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,837
<font face="Merriweather">Why am I so--?
And what about the earwig?</font>

1015
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,088
<font face="Merriweather">They'll see everything.</font>

1016
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:13,324
<font face="Merriweather">We're seeking truth here
and truth requires nudity.</font>

1017
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:15,969
<font face="Merriweather">Why does this require nudity?</font>

1018
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,870
<font face="Merriweather">Because it's nudity of the soul.</font>

1019
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:20,557
<font face="Merriweather">This is not what I wanted to do.</font>

1020
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:23,626
<font face="Merriweather">Sebastian, I'm feeling
like I'm being raped by you!</font>

1021
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:25,378
<font face="Merriweather">Stop it!</font>

1022
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:27,922
<font face="Merriweather">Stop!</font>

1023
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:30,774
<font face="Merriweather">Get the fuck out of here!</font>

1024
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:34,654
<font face="Merriweather">I'm done! I'm done! I'm done!</font>

1025
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:36,405
<font face="Merriweather">Are you an artist
or not an artist?</font>

1026
00:50:36,572 --> 00:50:39,618
<font face="Merriweather">Are you going to stop at
this point with your boxers on?!</font>

1027
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,869
<font face="Merriweather">Tell the truth.</font>

1028
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,913
<font face="Merriweather">Are you ready?!
Are you ready?!</font>

1029
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,206
<font face="Merriweather">I can't do this!</font>

1030
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,273
<font face="Merriweather">I cannot!
Oh my God!</font>

1031
00:50:46,665 --> 00:50:48,418
<font face="Merriweather">- No fucking way!
- You're gonna do this.</font>

1032
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:49,544
<font face="Merriweather">No.
I'm not looking.</font>

1033
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:50,670
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not looking.</font>

1034
00:50:50,671 --> 00:50:52,863
<font face="Merriweather">No, Sebastian, don't do this!</font>

1035
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,907
<font face="Merriweather">Don't do this to me!</font>

1036
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:56,909
<font face="Merriweather">Get off of me!</font>

1037
00:50:57,635 --> 00:50:59,453
<font face="Merriweather">Fucking get him away from me!</font>

1038
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:02,998
<font face="Merriweather">Fucking do something!</font>

1039
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:07,436
<font face="Merriweather">- Dev...
- No, no, no, no, no.</font>

1040
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:09,397
<font face="Merriweather">- I just come to say something.
- No, no.</font>

1041
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:12,025
<font face="Merriweather">I really-- no, I really--
I can't talk to you right now.</font>

1042
00:51:12,026 --> 00:51:13,527
<font face="Merriweather">I'm trying to write something.</font>

1043
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,028
<font face="Merriweather">I definitely don't want
cameras on right now.</font>

1044
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,140
<font face="Merriweather">I really don't want
to deal with this, please.</font>

1045
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,492
<font face="Merriweather">I just want to say I'm really,
really sorry</font>

1046
00:51:20,493 --> 00:51:22,118
<font face="Merriweather">for what happened
on the beach today.</font>

1047
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:23,352
<font face="Merriweather">I overstepped the mark.</font>

1048
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,622
<font face="Merriweather">I was-- I guess
a little bit stressed.</font>

1049
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:28,275
<font face="Merriweather">I was doing stupid things.
I'm just deeply sorry.</font>

1050
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:29,942
<font face="Merriweather">How's the music coming along?</font>

1051
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,986
<font face="Merriweather">It sucks, Sebastian.</font>

1052
00:51:32,545 --> 00:51:34,755
<font face="Merriweather">I just feel like I'm drying up.</font>

1053
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:38,343
<font face="Merriweather">I've got an idea.
I've got this person I know in L.A.</font>

1054
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:41,054
<font face="Merriweather">Her name is Carol Connors
and she is a great songwriter.</font>

1055
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:42,581
<font face="Merriweather">I think you and she could
work really well.</font>

1056
00:51:42,582 --> 00:51:44,332
<font face="Merriweather">How do you know Carol Connors?</font>

1057
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,226
<font face="Merriweather">I made a film about her cats.</font>

1058
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,520
<font face="Merriweather">She paid me forty thousand dollars
to make a film about her cats.</font>

1059
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:52,006
<font face="Merriweather">And for our final impersonation,
we will do...</font>

00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:10,233

you're making that up.</font>

1065
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:11,501
<font face="Merriweather">No, I'm not.
I'm not.</font>

the Hollywood Hills with her cats</font>

sweetie, how are you?</font>

1071
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,186
<font face="Merriweather">Very well. Let me
introduce you to Devin Ratray.</font>

1072
00:52:30,187 --> 00:52:31,688
<font face="Merriweather">- Hi.
- Devin.</font>

1073
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:33,481
<font face="Merriweather">He's the patient
you're gonna work on.</font>

1074
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:35,382
<font face="Merriweather">We have things to talk about.</font>

1075
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:38,820
<font face="Merriweather">Carol as you know the reason
we're here is because</font>

1076
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:40,445
<font face="Merriweather">Devin is on a rather
special mission</font>

1077
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:41,906
<font face="Merriweather">to meet a rather special woman</font>

1078
00:52:41,907 --> 00:52:45,118
<font face="Merriweather">and I think you are
the person who can guide him</font>

1079
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,243
<font face="Merriweather">in the right way musically</font>

1080
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:49,456
<font face="Merriweather">and Elvis was gentle
with you the first time.</font>

1081
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,749
<font face="Merriweather">I mean, is that important...?</font>

1082
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,585
<font face="Merriweather">Oh he was gentle with me many,
many, many, many times.</font>

1083
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:55,445
<font face="Merriweather">I was so shy.</font>

1084
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:56,988
<font face="Merriweather">He was my first love.</font>

1085
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,531
<font face="Merriweather">He was just wonderful.</font>

1086
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:00,908
<font face="Merriweather">What kind of tips
do you have for him?</font>

1087
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,219
<font face="Merriweather">I think gentleness
is going to be your key here.</font>

1088
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:07,973
<font face="Merriweather">And remember, underneath the heart</font>

1089
00:53:08,307 --> 00:53:10,334
<font face="Merriweather">of our secretary of state</font>

1090
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,128
<font face="Merriweather">beats the heart of a woman.</font>

1091
00:53:15,773 --> 00:53:16,773
<font face="Merriweather">Okay.</font>

1092
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,029
<font face="Merriweather">Okay, I've written a song
for you because I really think</font>

1093
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,429
<font face="Merriweather">that this is important.</font>

1094
00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:25,683
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza, Condi,</font>

1095
00:53:26,325 --> 00:53:29,353
<font face="Merriweather">I think of you so fondly,</font>

1096
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:34,275
<font face="Merriweather">Sugar 'n spice, everything nice</font>

1097
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:39,905
<font face="Merriweather">Wedding bells
and a handful of rice…</font>

1098
00:53:40,923 --> 00:53:43,425
<font face="Merriweather">Remember,
this is the secretary of state</font>

1099
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:45,637
<font face="Merriweather">and she's on the world stage.</font>

1100
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:47,887
<font face="Merriweather">I mean,
it's very logical the song,</font>

1101
00:53:47,888 --> 00:53:50,040
<font face="Merriweather">but there's a romantic feel to it.</font>

1102
00:53:50,557 --> 00:53:53,086
<font face="Merriweather">I'll be in front of the--</font>

1103
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:54,395
<font face="Merriweather">No!</font>

1104
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:58,817
<font face="Merriweather">I'll be in front of the towers</font>

1105
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,968
<font face="Merriweather">At the Watergate</font>

1106
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:04,322
<font face="Merriweather">- Important word is Watergate.
- Hmm.</font>

1107
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:06,616
<font face="Merriweather">That's where
she lives and think of it as,</font>

1108
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:09,076
<font face="Merriweather">"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair."</font>

1109
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:12,373
<font face="Merriweather">I don't like her
hairstyles sometimes but...</font>

1110
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,064
<font face="Merriweather">- Why?
- I don't know,</font>

1111
00:54:14,456 --> 00:54:16,917
<font face="Merriweather">but towers is very good</font>

1112
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:20,614
<font face="Merriweather">because she lives
in the towers at the Watergate.</font>

1113
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:21,630
<font face="Merriweather">Get it?</font>

1114
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,926
<font face="Merriweather">Your beauty's in everything</font>

1115
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:28,762
<font face="Merriweather">That I see,</font>

1116
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:32,626
<font face="Merriweather">Condi, you mean
the world to me.</font>

1117
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:35,502
<font face="Merriweather">To me...</font>

1118
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:40,525
<font face="Merriweather">God you're almost
as good as Plácido Domingo.</font>

1119
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:41,735
<font face="Merriweather">Thank you!</font>

1120
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,319
<font face="Merriweather">So, Carol, I know you have
another song which is your new,</font>

1121
00:54:44,528 --> 00:54:45,696
<font face="Merriweather">Gonna Fly Now.</font>

1122
00:54:45,904 --> 00:54:47,282
<font face="Merriweather">- Yes!
- That's what I need.</font>

1123
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,200
<font face="Merriweather">- A type of song like that.
- It's... It's...</font>

1124
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,326
<font face="Merriweather">it's very Rocky-ish.</font>

1125
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:52,746
<font face="Merriweather">It's a "Yo, Stallone!"
you know, that type of--</font>

1126
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,772
<font face="Merriweather">it's got tremendous energy.</font>

1127
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,875
<font face="Merriweather">I'll settle for that just
a measly snack</font>

1128
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:02,672
<font face="Merriweather">If that would make Condi mine!</font>

1129
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:04,798
<font face="Merriweather">Mine! Mine!</font>

1130
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,258
<font face="Merriweather">He's gonna win her,
win her, win her</font>

1131
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:09,053
<font face="Merriweather">When he is a little thinner,
thinner, thinner</font>

1132
00:55:09,054 --> 00:55:10,678
<font face="Merriweather">Win her, win her, win her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The trumpets are blaring.</font>

1135
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,557
<font face="Merriweather">Win her, win her, win her</font>

1136
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,228
<font face="Merriweather">When he's thinner,
thinner, thinner</font>

1138
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:20,398
<font face="Merriweather">Oh my god, the brownies.</font>

1139
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:22,192
<font face="Merriweather">- Bravo! Bravo!
- Oh, thank you so much.</font>

1140
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,010

1141
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:26,029
<font face="Merriweather">The brownies smell
like they're burning.</font>

1142
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,262
<font face="Merriweather">How are you feeling?</font>

1143
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:31,326
<font face="Merriweather">It sounded kind
of like wet pieces of shit</font>

1144
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,868
<font face="Merriweather">sprinkled on a Jerry Lewis film.</font>

1145
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:34,869
<font face="Merriweather">Dev...</font>

1146
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:40,376
<font face="Merriweather">It's perhaps the most
insulting song I've heard thus far.</font>

1147
00:55:40,377 --> 00:55:42,253
<font face="Merriweather">Excuse me.
Excuse me.</font>

1148
00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:46,131
<font face="Merriweather">I don't-- I'm not an eavesdropper,
but what the fuck did you just say.</font>

1149
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,343
<font face="Merriweather">Devin, let me just make
something plain, okay?</font>

1150
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:52,347
<font face="Merriweather">When you become
an Academy Award songwriter,</font>

1151
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,391
<font face="Merriweather">then you can sit here and tell me
that I don't know what I'm doing.</font>

1152
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:57,101
<font face="Merriweather">- God!
- I am so upset...</font>

1153
00:55:57,102 --> 00:55:59,395
<font face="Merriweather">Carol, this song
is making fun of me.</font>

1154
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:01,272
<font face="Merriweather">- It's telling me...
- I'm not making fun of you.</font>

1155
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:02,899
<font face="Merriweather">- It's genius.
- How can I...?</font>

1156
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,192
<font face="Merriweather">- I mean...
- Thank you.</font>

1157
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:05,276
<font face="Merriweather">- This is the secretary...
- She's a genius.</font>

1158
00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:07,070
<font face="Merriweather">Have some respect.
It's a beautiful song.</font>

1159
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:09,197
<font face="Merriweather">It's well...
No it's a powerful song.</font>

1160
00:56:09,198 --> 00:56:10,740
<font face="Merriweather">I don't want
to say it's beautiful.</font>

1161
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,325
<font face="Merriweather">- Powerful?!
- The other song is beautiful...</font>

1162
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:15,770
<font face="Merriweather">"Just the measly snack
would make me want her back"?</font>

1163
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,330
<font face="Merriweather">No.
That's not what it says.</font>

1164
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:18,915
<font face="Merriweather">Don't fuck up my words.</font>

1165
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,333
<font face="Merriweather">I-- don't talk to me.</font>

1166
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:23,002
<font face="Merriweather">Carol, I cannot possibly approach</font>

1167
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:25,463
<font face="Merriweather">The Secretary of State
of The United States</font>

1168
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:27,581
<font face="Merriweather">with this song and expect
her to take me seriously.</font>

1169
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,633
<font face="Merriweather">Why not?</font>

1170
00:56:28,634 --> 00:56:30,927
<font face="Merriweather">You're denying her one of the
biggest gifts she can give you?</font>

1171
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,929
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not singing the song!
I'm not singing the song.</font>

1172
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,013
<font face="Merriweather">I can't do this.</font>

1173
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:36,099
<font face="Merriweather">You know something,
I don't want him to sing the song.</font>

1174
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,666
<font face="Merriweather">I don't want anybody to sing.</font>

1175
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:41,062
<font face="Merriweather">Read these lips,
I think George H. Bush said that.</font>

1176
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:42,730
<font face="Merriweather">- Your friend?
- Yes. President Bush.</font>

1177
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:44,065
<font face="Merriweather">Didn't you sing at
his inauguration?</font>

1178
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:45,817
<font face="Merriweather">I sang at George W.'s.
Both of his.</font>

1179
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,734
<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.
Read my lips.</font>

1180
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:49,094
<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.</font>

1181
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:50,771
<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.</font>

1182
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:51,823
<font face="Merriweather">- Okay.
- Carol...</font>

1183
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:53,116
<font face="Merriweather">- He's doing it.
- Guys, together.</font>

1184
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,576
<font face="Merriweather">This is insanity.</font>

1185
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,911
<font face="Merriweather">I will sing the song together.</font>

1186
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:58,288
<font face="Merriweather">Why are you going
to sing the song?</font>

1187
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,706
<font face="Merriweather">Because it's a great idea.</font>

1188
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,584
<font face="Merriweather">He's your inner self and I have
to go check the brownies</font>

1189
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,778
<font face="Merriweather">and if you're not good you're
not going to get a brownie.</font>

1190
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:06,504
<font face="Merriweather">I'm like-- I can't
even have a brownie?</font>

1191
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:07,905
<font face="Merriweather">Peace and love.</font>

1192
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,340
<font face="Merriweather">Where are we?</font>

1193
00:57:11,884 --> 00:57:15,329
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, my friend Adrian Grenier,
uh, his offices.</font>

1194
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:17,081
<font face="Merriweather">How do you know Adrian?</font>

1195
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:18,808
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, we were high school friends.</font>

1196
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,834
<font face="Merriweather">What do you think
he's talking about?</font>

1197
00:57:21,435 --> 00:57:23,729
<font face="Merriweather">What do you think
he's talking about, huh?</font>

1198
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:25,188
<font face="Merriweather">She's dead.</font>

1199
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:26,590
<font face="Merriweather">You got to wake up.</font>

1200
00:57:27,065 --> 00:57:29,301
<font face="Merriweather">Hey, what's up?
What's going on, man?</font>

1201
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:30,945
<font face="Merriweather">- How you doing?
- Good.</font>

1202
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:32,304
<font face="Merriweather">Really good.
How are you?</font>

1203
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:35,282
<font face="Merriweather">I think it's very important
that you make sure</font>

1204
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,201
<font face="Merriweather">that you prove
to her that you show her</font>

1205
00:57:38,994 --> 00:57:40,747
<font face="Merriweather">that you are being a sincere,</font>

1206
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,773
<font face="Merriweather">honorable, loving human being.</font>

1207
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:48,588
<font face="Merriweather">Dude, come on secretary of state,
powerful woman,</font>

1208
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:50,171
<font face="Merriweather">boring old white guys all day,</font>

1209
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:51,925
<font face="Merriweather">she's got to be
a big dirty submissive</font>

1210
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,843
<font face="Merriweather">and you grab her by
the hair and you spank her.</font>

1211
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:55,261
<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Jim, whoa easy.</font>

1212
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:56,930
<font face="Merriweather">- I mean, you got to be delicate.
- Yeah.</font>

1213
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:57,972
<font face="Merriweather">- I mean...
- You don't.</font>

1214
00:57:57,973 --> 00:57:59,807
<font face="Merriweather">Take what's yours.
Smack her around a little bit.</font>

1215
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,142
<font face="Merriweather">Spank her.
That's what she likes.</font>

1216
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:02,727
<font face="Merriweather">Oh, whoa.</font>

1217
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:04,270
<font face="Merriweather">No, no, no, no.
There's no smacking.</font>

1218
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:06,981
<font face="Merriweather">How could I ensure my sincerity?</font>

1219
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:08,423
<font face="Merriweather">Just humble yourself.</font>

1220
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:14,596
<font face="Merriweather">You have to be able to find some
way into a more tender part of her.</font>

1221
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:16,866
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, but you got
to remember something.</font>

1222
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:19,035
<font face="Merriweather">You know, she was
a Democrat until the late '70s?</font>

1223
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:20,119
<font face="Merriweather">Yes.</font>

1224
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,039
<font face="Merriweather">And because Jimmy Carter
wouldn't invade Afghanistan</font>

1225
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,416
<font face="Merriweather">and attack the Russians, she left.</font>

1226
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:27,293
<font face="Merriweather">- That's true.
- She likes it when you go in.</font>

1227
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,379
<font face="Merriweather">She's with Bush Senior,
she's with Bush Junior.</font>

1228
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,072
<font face="Merriweather">She likes it when you go
in and take what's yours.</font>

1229
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:34,157
<font face="Merriweather">You're not going
to get her in the mind.</font>

1230
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:38,471
<font face="Merriweather">You got to get her on
like an emotional visceral...</font>

1231
00:58:38,472 --> 00:58:39,555
<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah...
- Some...</font>

1232
00:58:39,556 --> 00:58:40,682
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.</font>

1233
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:44,143
<font face="Merriweather">So like I don't know if you like
maybe wore some lingerie</font>

1234
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:45,645
<font face="Merriweather">or something as simple as that.</font>

1235
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,063
<font face="Merriweather">Look, I don't want
to fight with you.</font>

1236
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:49,232
<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to fight with you,
but I understand the Condi thing.</font>

1237
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,134
<font face="Merriweather">I've seen her body,
she's fucking sexy.</font>

1238
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:53,486
<font face="Merriweather">That little gap between the teeth,
how sexy is that.</font>

1239
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:55,613
<font face="Merriweather">Just be careful of those teeth.
They can get caught in your bag.</font>

1240
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:57,115
<font face="Merriweather">- Watch those little...
- Fucking, Jim!</font>

1241
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,408
<font face="Merriweather">Honestly?!</font>

1242
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,434
<font face="Merriweather">My bag between her gap?!</font>

1243
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,228
<font face="Merriweather">Is that really advice that I need?</font>

1244
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:07,081
<font face="Merriweather">All right, man.</font>

1245
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,959

<font face="Merriweather">I just walked in the front door.</font>

1272
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,328
<font face="Merriweather">I'm not trying to get you upset.</font>

1273
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:28,331
<font face="Merriweather">- Yes, you are!
- I'm looking for...</font>

1274
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:29,665
<font face="Merriweather">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

1275
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,459
<font face="Merriweather">You and she are both
interested in women.</font>

1276
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:35,171
<font face="Merriweather">There's something in
common that you have.</font>

1277
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:36,380
<font face="Merriweather">Devin, Devin, come here.</font>

1278
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:38,007
<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to sleep.
I'm going to bed.</font>

1279
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:39,884
<font face="Merriweather">- I've been up all night.
- We know.</font>

1280
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,886
<font face="Merriweather">Okay. It's all right.
It's all right. I'm going to bed.</font>

1281
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,262
<font face="Merriweather">No, no. Come here. Come here.</font>

1282
01:00:43,263 --> 01:00:45,098
<font face="Merriweather">- No, no, no.
- You just got home...</font>

1283
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,514
<font face="Merriweather">I know I just got home.</font>

1284
01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:48,475
<font face="Merriweather">and I can't deal
with this right now.</font>

1285
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:51,878
<font face="Merriweather">Guys, look please
disconnect the phone.</font>

1286
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:54,298

1287
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:55,650
<font face="Merriweather">You can't...</font>

1288
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:56,818
<font face="Merriweather">Welcome home, dear.</font>

1289
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,402
<font face="Merriweather">You don't know when to quit,
do you?</font>

1290
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,763
<font face="Merriweather">Devin, I'm sorry.
Dev?</font>

1291
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:02,139
<font face="Merriweather">All because I'm in love.</font>

1292
01:01:02,614 --> 01:01:04,558
<font face="Merriweather">Doesn't matter.
It's just love.</font>

1293
01:01:08,787 --> 01:01:11,707
<font face="Merriweather">Long before Condoleezza Rice
was part of the team</font>

1294
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,459
<font face="Merriweather">that brought us the Iraq war,</font>

1295
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,417
<font face="Merriweather">she was one of those who believed</font>

1296
01:01:15,418 --> 01:01:17,487
<font face="Merriweather">that corporate
interests come first.</font>

1297
01:01:17,796 --> 01:01:20,591
<font face="Merriweather">During the ten years
the Condoleezza Rice</font>

1298
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:23,008
<font face="Merriweather">was on the board
of the Chevron Corporation,</font>

1299
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:24,387
<font face="Merriweather">big oil developers.</font>

1300
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:27,140
<font face="Merriweather">They were exploiting
the oil off the coast</font>

1301
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,583
<font face="Merriweather">of the Niger Delta in Nigeria.</font>

1302
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:32,562
<font face="Merriweather">Home to some
of the world's poorest people</font>

1303
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,939
<font face="Merriweather">and indigenous people
like the Ogoni people;</font>

1304
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,232
<font face="Merriweather">who at that time were
fighting for some revenue</font>

1305
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:40,653
<font face="Merriweather">to come to them from
this oil that was being</font>

1306
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:42,971
<font face="Merriweather">drained out from
underneath their homeland.</font>

1307
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,535
<font face="Merriweather">Throughout that period, it was
the Nigerian government's policy</font>

1308
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:51,414
<font face="Merriweather">to suppress protest
and to arrest and, in some cases,</font>

1309
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:53,482
<font face="Merriweather">shoot down and kill the protesters.</font>

1310
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:57,170
<font face="Merriweather">The corporations that cut deals
with the Nigerian government</font>

1311
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,256
<font face="Merriweather">were complicit with that
and were sued for being complicit</font>

1312
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:02,048
<font face="Merriweather">with that in U.S court.</font>

1313
01:02:02,465 --> 01:02:04,886
<font face="Merriweather">Now, the interesting thing
about your friend Condoleezza Rice,</font>

1314
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,722
<font face="Merriweather">Devin, is that she was
playing an active role</font>

1315
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:10,222
<font face="Merriweather">in turning shareholder
initiatives back</font>

1316
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:11,934
<font face="Merriweather">when the shareholders were saying</font>

1317
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:14,145
<font face="Merriweather">“we want to be pushing
for more human rights</font>

1318
01:02:14,146 --> 01:02:18,148
<font face="Merriweather">not ignoring abuses at
the Nigerian government's hands.”</font>

1319
01:02:18,607 --> 01:02:20,902
<font face="Merriweather">Wait. You're saying
the Nigerian government killed</font>

1320
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,777
<font face="Merriweather">its own people to ensure</font>

1321
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,241
<font face="Merriweather">Chevron had exclusive
oil rights to their country?</font>

1322
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,034
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.
I hate to break it to you, Devin,</font>

1323
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:32,896
<font face="Merriweather">she picked empire and colonialism
over being a concert pianist.</font>

1324
01:02:33,205 --> 01:02:34,981
<font face="Merriweather">I think you've got
to think about that, Devin.</font>

1325
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,585
<font face="Merriweather">There's an easy way
to Condoleezza Rice's heart.</font>

1326
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:41,280
<font face="Merriweather">You just need to promise her a few
oil contracts in the Caspian Sea,</font>

1327
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,674
<font face="Merriweather">maybe give her a few seats
on a few corporate boards.</font>

1328
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:44,966
<font face="Merriweather">Nothing she likes better.</font>

1329
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:46,760
<font face="Merriweather">How's he gonna do that?</font>

1330
01:02:47,093 --> 01:02:49,329
<font face="Merriweather">Well, you've got your work
cut out for you, let's face it.</font>

1331
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,475
<font face="Merriweather">Great.</font>

1332
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,147
<font face="Merriweather">She became a member
of the Bush inner circle</font>

1333
01:02:58,148 --> 01:02:59,481
<font face="Merriweather">when she was discovered</font>

1334
01:02:59,898 --> 01:03:03,736
<font face="Merriweather">by Bush Senior's National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft</font>

1335
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:04,985
<font face="Merriweather">and brought into Washington</font>

1336
01:03:04,986 --> 01:03:07,156
<font face="Merriweather">to be part of the National
Security Council.</font>

1337
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:12,310
<font face="Merriweather">Here among all these grand
men was this little slip of a girl.</font>

1338
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:14,830
<font face="Merriweather">I had never met her before,</font>

1339
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:17,748
<font face="Merriweather">but I soon found
that she held her own</font>

1340
01:03:17,749 --> 01:03:20,026
<font face="Merriweather">with all these very senior people.</font>

1341
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:23,005
<font face="Merriweather">When he introduced her
to Gorbachev, he said,</font>

1342
01:03:23,006 --> 01:03:25,216
<font face="Merriweather">"This is Condoleezza Rice,
she's taught me everything</font>

1343
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:26,992
<font face="Merriweather">I know about the Soviet Union."</font>

1344
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:30,662
<font face="Merriweather">Bush Senior wanted
his son George to meet her.</font>

1345
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,349
<font face="Merriweather">Of course she's
a foreign policy specialist</font>

1346
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,518
<font face="Merriweather">especially an Eastern
European specialist.</font>

1347
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,677
<font face="Merriweather">He had a lot of studying to do.</font>

1348
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:39,772
<font face="Merriweather">Can you name
the president of Chechnya?</font>

1349
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:40,982
<font face="Merriweather">No, can you?</font>

1350
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,984
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, the new prime
minister of India is, uh, uh...</font>

1351
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:45,861
<font face="Merriweather">No.</font>

1352
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:47,697
<font face="Merriweather">George W. Bush
and Condoleezza Rice hit it off</font>

1353
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,698
<font face="Merriweather">from the very beginning,
based on their common affinity,</font>

1354
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:54,353
<font face="Merriweather">uh, in things like, uh, their sports
and their Christian faith.</font>

1355
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:57,915
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, they had this instant as one
of Rice's best friends called it</font>

1356
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:00,125
<font face="Merriweather">"mind meld" that happened
from the very beginning.</font>

1357
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:03,087
<font face="Merriweather">During the course
of the 2000 election campaign</font>

1358
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:07,341
<font face="Merriweather">she'd really been President Bush's
tutor on foreign affairs.</font>

1359
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:09,635
<font face="Merriweather">President Bush had
been governor of Texas,</font>

1360
01:04:09,636 --> 01:04:11,802
<font face="Merriweather">had very little
background in foreign policy</font>

1361
01:04:11,803 --> 01:04:13,013
<font face="Merriweather">or national security.</font>

1362
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:15,057
<font face="Merriweather">She's the one who
taught him these issues</font>

1363
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:16,726
<font face="Merriweather">during the course of the campaign.</font>

1364
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:22,147
<font face="Merriweather">I advise him on how to take his
very strong principles and values.</font>

1365
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:25,442
<font face="Merriweather">What it is that he wants
to do in the world</font>

1366
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:27,802
<font face="Merriweather">and translate those
into policy initiatives.</font>

1367
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,490
<font face="Merriweather">Rice, when it came to Bush, saw
in this young Texas governor</font>

1368
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:36,036
<font face="Merriweather">the values, the strength,
the vision of Ronald Reagan.</font>

1369

father for whom she had worked.</font>

1371
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:45,002
<font face="Merriweather">She thought with these
two personalities</font>

1372
01:04:45,003 --> 01:04:46,630
<font face="Merriweather">combined into one president,</font>

1373
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:49,007
<font face="Merriweather">she thought they could
burst into Washington</font>

1374
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:50,885
<font face="Merriweather">and they were going
to remake the world.</font>

good for American interests.</font>

01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:30,025
<font face="Merriweather">What is that shirt made of?</font>

1411
01:06:30,026 --> 01:06:31,818
<font face="Merriweather">- What's the fabric of that shirt?
- Rayon.</font>

1412
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:35,738
<font face="Merriweather">Everything from
now on is 100 percent cotton</font>

1413
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:40,101
<font face="Merriweather">and wrinkle-free.</font>

1414
01:06:40,827 --> 01:06:42,079
<font face="Merriweather">- Those shoes...
- Yeah?</font>

1415
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,688
<font face="Merriweather">Did you get them in the 1950s?</font>

1416
01:06:44,664 --> 01:06:46,559
<font face="Merriweather">Are they your
father's bowling shoes?</font>

1417
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:51,571
<font face="Merriweather">I want shoes that have
a professional look to them.</font>

1418
01:06:52,464 --> 01:06:54,550
<font face="Merriweather">Next thing, what is this?</font>

1419
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:56,093
<font face="Merriweather">What is that?
What do you call that?</font>

1420
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:57,384
<font face="Merriweather">- These?
- Yes.</font>

1421
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:58,679
<font face="Merriweather">These are my sideburns.</font>

1422
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,847
<font face="Merriweather">- Okay.
- My mutton chops.</font>

1423
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:02,433
<font face="Merriweather">Yes.
No sideburns.</font>

1424
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,751
<font face="Merriweather">Hold on.
This is my individuality, man.</font>

1425
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:07,313
<font face="Merriweather">Would you tell Elvis not to use,
not to...?</font>

1426
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:10,049
<font face="Merriweather">No, I won't tell Elvis
anything because he's dead.</font>

1427
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,629
<font face="Merriweather">What would you tell her about
the Middle East Peace Accord?</font>

1428
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:13,692
<font face="Merriweather">Um...</font>

1429
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:17,097
<font face="Merriweather">Palestinians need
to be represented.</font>

1430
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:22,243
<font face="Merriweather">Okay. We'll call the Palestinians
just for short "scum."</font>

1431
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,329
<font face="Merriweather">Where does she
stand on the Middle East?</font>

1432
01:07:24,662 --> 01:07:27,040
<font face="Merriweather">Well, she believes
in a strong Israel.</font>

1433
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,375
<font face="Merriweather">Okay.</font>

1434
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:31,320
<font face="Merriweather">So she recognizes that
the Palestinians have to have--</font>

1435
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,630
<font face="Merriweather">Don't play with your hair.</font>

1436
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,840
<font face="Merriweather">- I didn't play with my hair.
- You just played with your hair.</font>

1437
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:36,509
<font face="Merriweather">- You just did.
- What is he talk...?</font>

1438
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,468
<font face="Merriweather">You've got the monitor.
Play it back.</font>

1439
01:07:38,718 --> 01:07:40,913
<font face="Merriweather">What would Bush say
in terms of the Middle East?</font>

1440
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:43,015
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, we need strategery.</font>

1441
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:44,916
<font face="Merriweather">Strategery.
Excellent.</font>

1442
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:47,544
<font face="Merriweather">What would Dick Cheney say?</font>

1443
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:50,064
<font face="Merriweather">"Kill them all.
Fuck the Jews.</font>

1444
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,799
<font face="Merriweather">Fuck the Jews.
Fuck the Palestinians.</font>

1445
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,067
<font face="Merriweather">Kill them all.</font>

1446
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:54,509
<font face="Merriweather">I need blood."</font>

1447
01:07:55,026 --> 01:07:56,528
<font face="Merriweather">That's what Cheney would say?</font>

1448
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:58,531
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, it was a tape recording.</font>

1449
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,740
<font face="Merriweather">I-- I-- I see.</font>

1450
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:00,824
<font face="Merriweather">- Pirated.
- Yes.</font>

1451
01:08:00,825 --> 01:08:04,686
<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that putting them
down is gonna help your cause?</font>

1452
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:07,773
<font face="Merriweather">I mean, explain to me
here how this is gonna work?</font>

1453
01:08:07,774 --> 01:08:10,209
<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna go in and you're
gonna say these things</font>

1454
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:13,319
<font face="Merriweather">flippantly or are you gonna say
this with convition-- conviction?</font>

1455
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,215
<font face="Merriweather">There are consequences
for everyone's accountability.</font>

1456
01:08:16,216 --> 01:08:17,216
<font face="Merriweather">That's not conviction.</font>

1457
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:19,301
<font face="Merriweather">Conviction is:</font>

1458
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:21,369
<font face="Merriweather">"9/11 changed everything."</font>

1459
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:23,454
<font face="Merriweather">Let me hear you say it.</font>

1460
01:08:23,555 --> 01:08:25,266
<font face="Merriweather">9/11 changed everything.</font>

1461
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,267
<font face="Merriweather">Even more emphatic.</font>

1462
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,310
<font face="Merriweather">9/11 changed everything!</font>

1463
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:29,894
<font face="Merriweather">Perfect.
That's conviction.</font>

1464
01:08:30,144 --> 01:08:31,272
<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna get one shot.</font>

1465
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,730
<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna get one opportunity.</font>

1466
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:37,110
<font face="Merriweather">Do you have the words,
do you have the passion,</font>

1467
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:41,239
<font face="Merriweather">do you have the focus of someone</font>

1468
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,000
<font face="Merriweather">who can woo her?</font>

1469
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:45,185
<font face="Merriweather">You're such a beautiful woman.</font>

1470
01:08:47,412 --> 01:08:49,439
<font face="Merriweather">Can you get him a breath mint,
please?</font>

1471
01:08:50,873 --> 01:08:53,443
<font face="Merriweather">I can see that you're
a little nervous.</font>

1472
01:08:54,752 --> 01:08:56,296
<font face="Merriweather">Your hands are clammy,</font>

1473
01:08:57,964 --> 01:09:00,408
<font face="Merriweather">but I don't want
you to be intimidated by me</font>

1474
01:09:00,883 --> 01:09:03,578
<font face="Merriweather">just because I'm a person
who knows what I want...</font>

1475
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:05,663
<font face="Merriweather">But you are a large person.</font>

1476
01:09:06,472 --> 01:09:08,141
<font face="Merriweather">There's more of me to love.</font>

1477
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,145
<font face="Merriweather">I would strongly urge
that his first meeting</font>

1478
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:13,338
<font face="Merriweather">with the secretary
not be over a meal.</font>

1479
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,983
<font face="Merriweather">I'm taking notes here
from the Pillsbury Doughboy.</font>

1480
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:17,151
<font face="Merriweather">It's just not fair.</font>

1481
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:20,571
<font face="Merriweather">What you don't understand
is I'm not trying to court</font>

1482
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:22,279
<font face="Merriweather">the secretary of state,</font>

1483
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,699
<font face="Merriweather">the most powerful
woman on the globe.</font>

1484
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,101
<font face="Merriweather">This is Words that Work.</font>

1485
01:09:27,744 --> 01:09:29,604
<font face="Merriweather">This book will help
you communicate.</font>

1486
01:09:30,455 --> 01:09:32,874
<font face="Merriweather">Good language is like a great meal</font>

1487
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:36,402
<font face="Merriweather">and I assume that you'd
understand that metaphor.</font>

1488
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:38,571
<font face="Merriweather">Didn't see that one coming.</font>

1489
01:09:39,297 --> 01:09:41,966
<font face="Merriweather">I'm pleased that you take
this so seriously.</font>

1490
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:44,385
<font face="Merriweather">The focus group
is going to tear you apart,</font>

1491
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:47,722
<font face="Merriweather">but it's not just words,
it's also appearances.</font>

1492
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:49,350
<font face="Merriweather">- Well. Devin.
- Devin.</font>

1493
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,683
<font face="Merriweather">This is your stylist.</font>

1494
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:52,811
<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to make
you a runway model.</font>

1495
01:09:52,812 --> 01:09:54,896
<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, well you better
reinforce that runway.</font>

1496
01:09:55,188 --> 01:09:57,941
<font face="Merriweather">He should run away very quickly.</font>

1497
01:09:57,942 --> 01:10:00,069
<font face="Merriweather">Listen, once you look
at yourself in the mirror</font>

1498
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,527
<font face="Merriweather">and you see
this presidential transformation</font>

1499
01:10:02,528 --> 01:10:04,056
<font face="Merriweather">that I'm going to create for you,</font>

1500
01:10:04,057 --> 01:10:05,906
<font face="Merriweather">you're going to be mentally ready</font>

1501
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:08,576
<font face="Merriweather">and visually ready to meet her.</font>

1502
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:15,108
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza loves shoes,
so you must love shoes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

1504
01:10:19,253 --> 01:10:20,963
<font face="Merriweather">The shoes make the man.</font>

1505
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:23,784
<font face="Merriweather">That's very nice.
That's like I'm going to the prom.</font>

1506
01:10:23,785 --> 01:10:26,203
<font face="Merriweather">All right.
I look like the Joker.</font>

1507
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:28,012
<font face="Merriweather">You have these in a 17?</font>

1509
01:10:34,686 --> 01:10:36,855
<font face="Merriweather">Ever since I was
a little girl I liked to shop.</font>

1510
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:39,400
<font face="Merriweather">My father would go
to work on his sermons</font>

1511
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,982
<font face="Merriweather">on Saturday morning,
and my mother and I would head</font>

1512
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:42,444
<font face="Merriweather">downtown to go shopping.</font>

1513
01:10:42,445 --> 01:10:44,029
<font face="Merriweather">I think she looks very powerful</font>

1514
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,446
<font face="Merriweather">despite the fact
that she dresses in a way</font>

1515
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:48,492
<font face="Merriweather">that is both feminine</font>

1516
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:51,227
<font face="Merriweather">and has a certain
degree of sensuality to it.</font>

1517
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:54,414
<font face="Merriweather">If anything I think it makes her
perhaps look even more powerful.</font>

into a presidential candidate.</font>

1522
01:11:07,178 --> 01:11:09,304

are our future.</font>

- Yeah.</font>

01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:23,778
<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to Washington...</font>

1553
01:12:25,797 --> 01:12:26,797
<font face="Merriweather">D.C.</font>

1554
01:12:30,218 --> 01:12:31,619
<font face="Merriweather">Need I ask why?</font>

1555
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:33,931
<font face="Merriweather">You needn't.</font>

1556
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,474
<font face="Merriweather">Okay.
All right.</font>

1557
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:37,476
<font face="Merriweather">- So you're going to Washington?
- Yeah.</font>

1558
01:12:37,477 --> 01:12:39,268
<font face="Merriweather">I should have known
that was coming.</font>

1559
01:12:39,477 --> 01:12:41,480
<font face="Merriweather">You're going to see big
things coming from me.</font>

1560
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:42,648
<font face="Merriweather">Well, I hope.</font>

1561
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,357
<font face="Merriweather">I have no doubt
about your success.</font>

1562
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:46,902
<font face="Merriweather">I want you to do anything
that makes you happy</font>

1563
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,861
<font face="Merriweather">but stay out of trouble.</font>

1564
01:12:49,237 --> 01:12:50,847
<font face="Merriweather">I always do that, Mom.</font>

1565
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:53,534
<font face="Merriweather">That wasn't so bad.</font>

1566
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,992
<font face="Merriweather">No, it wasn't, was it?</font>

1567
01:12:55,284 --> 01:12:56,870
<font face="Merriweather">I suppose I'll hear from you.</font>

1568
01:12:56,871 --> 01:12:58,605
<font face="Merriweather">Yes, you totally will, Mom.</font>

1569
01:12:58,606 --> 01:13:00,023
<font face="Merriweather">When you want something.</font>

1570
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:01,357
<font face="Merriweather">You'll hear from me.</font>

1571
01:13:10,842 --> 01:13:13,661
<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

1572
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:21,753
<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

1573
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:29,177
<font face="Merriweather">Got to your city
and I feel so alive,</font>

1574
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,809
<font face="Merriweather">I'm inching closer
to the heart of your mind.</font>

1575
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:43,858
<font face="Merriweather">Ev'rything I see is like
a monument to you,</font>

1576
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:51,757
<font face="Merriweather">Ev'rything I dream
of is finally comin' true,</font>

1577
01:13:52,216 --> 01:13:53,552
<font face="Merriweather">I'm feelin'...</font>

1578
01:13:53,553 --> 01:13:58,414
<font face="Merriweather">Free in the arms
of the brave and true,</font>

1579
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:05,796
<font face="Merriweather">Free in the place
where I've come to find you,</font>

1580
01:14:08,274 --> 01:14:13,554
<font face="Merriweather">No one to tell us how
we're not meant to be...</font>

1581
01:14:14,196 --> 01:14:18,935
<font face="Merriweather">Baby, we're finally free,</font>

1582
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:27,026
<font face="Merriweather">Baby, we're finally free,</font>

1583
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:33,825
<font face="Merriweather">baby, we're finally free...</font>

1584
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:38,386
<font face="Merriweather">I am honored, in fact, humbled,</font>

1585
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:40,474
<font face="Merriweather">uh, that President-elect
Bush has asked me</font>

1586
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,416
<font face="Merriweather">to serve as his
National Security Adviser.</font>

1587
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:44,811
<font face="Merriweather">In January 2001,
when Condoleezza Rice</font>

1588
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:47,395
<font face="Merriweather">took the oath of office
to be National Security Adviser</font>

1589
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:51,175
<font face="Merriweather">it was, uh,
the ultimate rise in political power.</font>

1590
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:53,028
<font face="Merriweather">This we're talking
about a little girl who grew up</font>

1591
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:54,488
<font face="Merriweather">in segregated Birmingham, Alabama</font>

1592
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,905
<font face="Merriweather">and yet she had gone
from that place in her life,</font>

1593
01:14:56,906 --> 01:14:59,242
<font face="Merriweather">uh, all the way up
to literally the right hand</font>

1594
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:00,602
<font face="Merriweather">of the President of the United States.</font>

1595
01:15:00,603 --> 01:15:02,186
<font face="Merriweather">I'm so impressed.</font>

1596
01:15:02,453 --> 01:15:04,122
<font face="Merriweather">- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.</font>

1597
01:15:04,123 --> 01:15:05,374
<font face="Merriweather">- Perfect tie.
- Yeah?</font>

1598
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,875
<font face="Merriweather">- Nice suit.
- Thank you.</font>

1599
01:15:06,876 --> 01:15:08,043
<font face="Merriweather">It's from Florence.</font>

1600
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:10,921
<font face="Merriweather">Well, you still got
the sideburns but, you know what?</font>

1601
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:12,322
<font face="Merriweather">Oh, this is so much improvement.</font>

1602
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:13,924
<font face="Merriweather">- Come on back.
- Thanks.</font>

1603
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:16,176
<font face="Merriweather">These are the people right there.</font>

1604
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,552
<font face="Merriweather">- Would you grab a seat?
- All right.</font>

1605
01:15:17,553 --> 01:15:19,161
<font face="Merriweather">- Let's take the group.
- Thank you.</font>

1606
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:25,268
<font face="Merriweather">Boy, nothing to make
you relax like a bunch of strangers</font>

1607
01:15:25,269 --> 01:15:26,878
<font face="Merriweather">judging everything you say or do.</font>

1608
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,772
<font face="Merriweather">I need a word or phrase</font>

1609
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,011
<font face="Merriweather">that you would use
to describe Condoleezza Rice?</font>

1610
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:36,528
<font face="Merriweather">Sophisticated.</font>

1611
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:38,655
<font face="Merriweather">Well-traveled.</font>

1612
01:15:39,156 --> 01:15:40,617
<font face="Merriweather">- Regal.
- Captivating.</font>

1613
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:41,659
<font face="Merriweather">Hot.</font>

1614
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:43,744
<font face="Merriweather">- Together.
- Incompetent.</font>

1615
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,691
<font face="Merriweather">In some ways, this is the most
important part of the session</font>

1616
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:50,626
<font face="Merriweather">because Devin may not get
a chance to meet her personally.</font>

1617
01:15:51,043 --> 01:15:54,405
<font face="Merriweather">She may only respond to
a video that he's put together.</font>

1618
01:15:54,839 --> 01:15:57,384
<font face="Merriweather">We're going to measure
your second by second reaction</font>

1619
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:00,745
<font face="Merriweather">which is what Secretary Rice
would have as watching this video.</font>

1620
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:06,100
<font face="Merriweather">Love discs are love
letters in music and pictures.</font>

1621
01:16:07,143 --> 01:16:09,896
<font face="Merriweather">Dude, “love disc” doesn't work.</font>

1622
01:16:09,897 --> 01:16:11,064
<font face="Merriweather">Look at that.</font>

1623
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:12,981
<font face="Merriweather">- [laughter in background]
- Look at that response.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter in background]</font>

1625
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:15,944
<font face="Merriweather">That's as low as it gets.</font>

1626
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:16,987
<font face="Merriweather">I'm sorry.</font>

1627
01:16:16,988 --> 01:16:17,988
<font face="Merriweather">Wow.</font>

1628
01:16:19,697 --> 01:16:23,075
<font face="Merriweather">I mean that's lower than when
Bill Clinton used the phrase,</font>

1629
01:16:23,534 --> 01:16:26,453
<font face="Merriweather">"It depends on
the meaning of the word 'is' is."</font>

1630
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,374
<font face="Merriweather">I want a word or phrase
to describe Devin</font>

1631
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,627
<font face="Merriweather">based on what you saw.</font>

1632
01:16:32,628 --> 01:16:33,837
<font face="Merriweather">We're going to start in the front.</font>

1633
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,379
<font face="Merriweather">Potential Cyrano de Bergerac.</font>

1634
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,491
<font face="Merriweather">- Terrible.
- Sad.</font>

1635
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:41,995
<font face="Merriweather">Uh, very sad, desperate.</font>

1636
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:43,246
<font face="Merriweather">Embarrassing.</font>

1637
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:44,998
<font face="Merriweather">I thought it was
sweet and genuine.</font>

1638
01:16:44,999 --> 01:16:46,415
<font face="Merriweather">He's not my type.</font>

1639
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:50,604
<font face="Merriweather">It is a little unfortunate that
most people are very shallow</font>

1640
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:54,647
<font face="Merriweather">and will be put off by his
clear physical deficiencies.</font>

1641
01:16:54,648 --> 01:16:55,883
<font face="Merriweather">[laughter]</font>

1642
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:57,569
<font face="Merriweather">What exactly do you mean by that?</font>

1643
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,696
<font face="Merriweather">- [laughter]
- Sideburns, his sideburns.</font>

1644
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:00,989
<font face="Merriweather">Sideburns?</font>

1645
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,766
<font face="Merriweather">How many of you would keep
the sideburns, raise your hands?</font>

1646
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:06,185
<font face="Merriweather">How many of you would
take them off?</font>

1647
01:17:07,203 --> 01:17:08,647
<font face="Merriweather">Overwhelming.</font>

1648
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:11,208
<font face="Merriweather">I want you to put your dials
as to what you thought of Devin</font>

1649
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,292
<font face="Merriweather">at the end of that video.</font>

1650
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:14,360
<font face="Merriweather">Give him a rating
between zero and 100.</font>

1651
01:17:15,503 --> 01:17:18,030
<font face="Merriweather">Now I want you to take
a look at the new Devin.</font>

1652
01:17:18,839 --> 01:17:20,966
<font face="Merriweather">- Wow.
- Very nice.</font>

1653
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,827
<font face="Merriweather">Now give him a rating.</font>

1654
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,747
<font face="Merriweather">Laura what's the rating
for men and women now?</font>

1655
01:17:25,748 --> 01:17:27,332
<font face="Merriweather">48/66.</font>

1656
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:28,600
<font face="Merriweather">Women are at 66.</font>

1657
01:17:28,601 --> 01:17:31,185
<font face="Merriweather">How many women went up
based on looking at him now?</font>

1658
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:32,895
<font face="Merriweather">There you go.
Why?</font>

1659
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:34,338
<font face="Merriweather">Why'd you go up?</font>

1660
01:17:34,855 --> 01:17:36,091
<font face="Merriweather">He looks great in a suit.</font>

1661
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:37,842
<font face="Merriweather">Looks more serious
and respectable.</font>

1662
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,359
<font face="Merriweather">Thank you.</font>

1663
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:46,308
<font face="Merriweather">She likes clean-shaven men.</font>

1664
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:48,811
<font face="Merriweather">The sideburns have to go.</font>

1665
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:50,938
<font face="Merriweather">She would never look at you.</font>

1666
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,191
<font face="Merriweather">The only thing that's
stopping me right now is me.</font>

1675
01:18:44,049 --> 01:18:45,326
<font face="Merriweather">a re-Genesis.</font>

1676
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:51,016
<font face="Merriweather">A lot of people will tell
you that Rice was weak</font>

1677
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,976
<font face="Merriweather">and she was too weak
to be National Security Adviser</font>

1678
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:55,353
<font face="Merriweather">when she had these
titans on either side,</font>

1679
01:18:55,354 --> 01:18:58,339
<font face="Merriweather">uh, Rumsfeld and Cheney on
one side, and Powell on the other.</font>

1680
01:18:59,023 --> 01:19:01,401
<font face="Merriweather">Probably three
of the best bureaucrats</font>

1681
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,359
<font face="Merriweather">that have ever worked the system.</font>

1682
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,929
<font face="Merriweather">Huge egos.</font>

1683
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:08,116
<font face="Merriweather">Much more experience than she had</font>

1684
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:11,018
<font face="Merriweather">particularly in national security
issues and foreign policy.</font>

1685
01:19:11,327 --> 01:19:13,121
<font face="Merriweather">So I think what you see
is when she realizes</font>

1686
01:19:13,122 --> 01:19:16,039
<font face="Merriweather">that she can't beat Dick Cheney
or Donald Rumsfeld,</font>

1687
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,859
<font face="Merriweather">she learns how
to maneuver around them.</font>

1688
01:19:19,418 --> 01:19:21,922
<font face="Merriweather">She decided to use her personal
relationship with the president</font>

1689
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,906
<font face="Merriweather">to gain power inside
the Administration.</font>

1690
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:27,719
<font face="Merriweather">Rice's relationship
with President Bush is very close.</font>

1691
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,304
<font face="Merriweather">She goes to Camp David a lot.</font>

1692
01:19:29,305 --> 01:19:31,581
<font face="Merriweather">She stays in the main
house at Crawford.</font>

1693
01:19:31,582 --> 01:19:34,226
<font face="Merriweather">So it is a very
unusual relationship</font>

1694
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,544
<font face="Merriweather">between the President
and his National Security Adviser.</font>

1695
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:42,734
<font face="Merriweather">Well, there's a famous
story about how, uh,</font>

1696
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:45,652
<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice
and George W. Bush are in the U.N</font>

1697
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,155
<font face="Merriweather">in the General Assembly</font>

1698
01:19:47,156 --> 01:19:49,032
<font face="Merriweather">and he actually passed
a little note to Rice.</font>

1699
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:51,533
<font face="Merriweather">What the note said was,
"Can I go to the bathroom?"</font>

1700
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:53,743
<font face="Merriweather">You have
a President of United States,</font>

1701
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:55,247
<font face="Merriweather">the most powerful man in the world</font>

1702
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:56,915
<font face="Merriweather">who literally would
not go to the bathroom</font>

1703
01:19:56,916 --> 01:19:58,941
<font face="Merriweather">without asking permission
of Condoleezza Rice.</font>

1704
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:03,837

thinks in seconds or minutes.</font>

1705
01:20:04,129 --> 01:20:06,383
<font face="Merriweather">This is a woman
who thinks in decades.</font>

1706
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:09,386
<font face="Merriweather">I think she came to this conclusion
very early and she said,</font>

1707
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:12,080
<font face="Merriweather">"Well, I build my intimacy
with the president.</font>

1708
01:20:12,081 --> 01:20:15,124
<font face="Merriweather">I become a very close
confidant of the president.</font>

1709
01:20:15,808 --> 01:20:20,087
<font face="Merriweather">I build my power
and my eye’s on the prize.</font>

1710
01:20:20,771 --> 01:20:23,674
<font face="Merriweather">If I do this,
I'll be the next Secretary of State."</font>

I'll call them.</font>

to leave right now though.</font>

1841

1855
01:29:36,745 --> 01:29:41,541

of Dr. Rice's testimony</font>

1856
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,042
<font face="Merriweather">was that she was filibustering.</font>

1857
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:48,905
<font face="Merriweather">I think Dr. Rice was well
aware of the restrictions of time</font>

1858
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:51,842
<font face="Merriweather">and was chewing up the clock</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with long and rambling discourses.</font>

1860

<font face="Merriweather">The question is what did
we need to do about that...</font>

01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:04,063
<font face="Merriweather">And fuel-filled

1862
01:30:04,064 --> 01:30:07,231
<font face="Merriweather">I also understood that...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that was what the FBI was doing...
that the FBI…</font>

01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:12,571
<font face="Merriweather">I think her objective was
to say as little as possible</font>

your repeated claims</font>

weapons of mass destruction?</font>

1882
01:30:59,202 --> 01:31:02,246

the intelligence community</font>

<font face="Merriweather">said that he had a nuclear bomb.</font>

1888
01:31:14,674 --> 01:31:16,426
<font face="Merriweather">That's really going</font>

1889
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:19,055
<font face="Merriweather">a long way with that talking point</font>

1890
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,599

to the American people</font>

tomorrow morning.</font>
