[Hiccup]
<i>This is New Berk at Snoggletog,</i>

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,732
<i>the greatest time of the year.</i>

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,735
- <i>The lights, the hunting songs...</i>
- [vocalizing]

5
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:15,469
<i>...the holiday shopping...</i>

6
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:16,704
- [man] Oh.
- [woman] Uh-huh.

7
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:19,707
- Cheers!
- <i>...the Yak-nog shooters.</i>

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,307
- 'Nother round!
- Make mine a double!

9
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,711
<i>The only thing missing...
was dragons.</i>

10
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:25,779
[whimpers]

11
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:29,549
<i>It's been ten years since Vikings
and dragons agreed to live apart.</i>

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,285
<i>But that doesn't mean we've
forgotten our flying friends.</i>

13
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:35,487
And the best part
of it all, Nuffink,

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,388
- was on Snoggletog Eve...
- [Nuffink] Yeah?

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,025
- ...I'd make Toothless his favorite meal.
- What was it?

16
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:42,593
- Lake trout with a side of sea trout...
- Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:45,863
- ...on a bed of brook trout.
- We all like trout.

18
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:49,366
And even though he's gone,
I still make it for him.

19
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,501
A lot of families
do stuff like this.

20
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:54,338
It keeps our loved ones in our
hearts, even though they're far away.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,841
- So, want to help me catch some fish?
- Good on ya!

22
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,642
We're gonna
feed Toothless!

23
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,377
I don't need
a fishing pole, Dad!

24
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,479
I'll just butt the wee
fishes with me own wee head!

25
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,481
- Ow!
- [sighs]

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,783
- Ow! Ow!
- [Hiccup] Come on, Nuffink. Let's get Toothless a snack.

27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,684
[laughs]

28
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:14,487
[Hiccup] <i>We were excited about
making a traditional dragon feast.</i>

29
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>And then it hit me.</i>
[grunts]

30
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,661
<i>Not everyone was on board.</i>

31
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:23,528
[giggles]
Yes! It worked!

32
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,497
Zephyr,
what are you doing?

33
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,500
Testing my dragon
defense system.

34
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,635
You and all the grown-ups in New
Berk are leaving them snacks.

35
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:34,839
- What if one shows up?
- That would be great. We love dragons.

36
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,907
Why?
They're monsters.

37
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:42,414
[voices screaming]

38
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,480
- Oh.
- Uh...

39
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,782
I found this in the attic.
It was Grandpa's.

40
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:49,518
How come you never told us
the truth about dragons?

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,653
But we did.
Dragons are wonderful.

42
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:52,755
They're our friends.

43
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:55,356
Tell me this.
Are they giant?

44
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,558
- Well, yeah.
- Razor-sharp teeth?

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,392
- Breathe fire?
- I suppose so.

46
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,560
- Claws?
- That'd be yes.

47
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:03,663
- What happened to your leg?
- Oh. Oh. Uh...

48
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,364
That's what I thought.

49
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,101
Maybe we don't leave fish snacks
around to attract them.

50
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,803
'Cause you know who doesn't
want to be dragon dessert?

51
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:12,505
Me!

52
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,774
Nuffink, do you want to be
dessert for a dragon?

53
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,343
Hmm.
Methinks I don't.

54
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,447
Let's kill
the dragons!

55
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,413
How did this
happen?

56
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:27,417
Our ancestors were terrified of
dragons because they didn't know them.

57
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,419
Astrid, we cannot let our
kids go down that road.

58
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,856
Hmm. Remember when we were
kids back in Old Berk,

59
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,358
- how we used to put on a pageant at Snoggletog?
- [grunting]

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,860
Oh, yeah.
Those were fun.

61
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:40,428
What if we brought
the pageant back?

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,132
We showed the children of New Berk
how humans and dragons became friends?

63
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,800
- [Nuffink] Bigger!
- That's a great idea.

64
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:48,569
But we've only got
four days until Snoggletog.

65
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,805
Three if you don't count
Black Plague Friday.

66
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,840
Yeah,
nothing gets done.

67
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:54,941
Everybody's just
shopping and coughing.

68
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,576
- [Zephyr] More spikes.
- [pounding]

69
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:59,547
I think we can do this.
Let's talk to Gobber.

70
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,613
[growls]

71
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,484
- [grunts]
- [giggles]

72
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,717
You got me!

73
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,587
Kid can take a hit.

74
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,720
[sighs]

75
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,824
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:17,561
It's just, all this talk of
dragons kind of makes me miss him.

77
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,598
It's hard at the
holidays, you know.

78
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,334
Wonder if Toothless
ever misses me.

79
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,479
[chitters]

80
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:48,821
[coos]

81
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,725
[both snarling]

82
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,759
[chitters]

83
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:00,466
[purrs]

84
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:10,442
[coos]

85
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,481
[grunts]

86
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,517
[groans]

87
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:26,956
[purrs]

88
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:28,958
[purrs]

89
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,793
[roars]

90
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,664
[both shrieking]

91
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,836
- [Toothless roars]
- [coos]

92
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,672
- [boy grunts]
- Hit his nose.

93
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:48,708
[Zephyr grunts]

94
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,677
Yeah!
That's two for me.

95
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,544
Oh!
Curse ye, hellions!

96
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:58,416
How dare ye desecrate the
statue of Stoick the Vast?

97
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,084
- Who?
- Stoick!

98
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:03,686
The bravest Viking
in the history of Berk!

99
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,922
He put the "king"
in Viking.

100
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:07,023
[all] Huh?

101
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:10,825
Oh, my dear mate,
I miss you so.

102
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,028
Remember the time we
were at that mead-house

103
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,931
and those two Visigoths wagered
I couldn't hold my left elbow

104
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,800
in a boiling pot of
gruel for five minutes?

105
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:22,568
[laughs]
Good times.

106
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,938
- [clears throat] Gobber.
- Hey, kids.

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,709
I was just talking to a statue of
your father as if he were really here.

108
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:33,912
It pains me how the wee ones of
this town have forgotten Stoick.

109
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:37,015
I know,
and Zephyr is afraid of dragons.

110
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:40,051
That's why we want to bring
back the Snoggletog pageant.

111
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,819
- [blows]
- [coughs]

112
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:45,755
You're in luck.
The script I wrote for the last pageant.

113
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:49,893
Die, you evil beasts
with twisted souls!

114
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:53,829
Vikings will forever swim
in rivers of your blood!

115
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,998
[groans]
That's nasty.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,733
This has not
aged well.

117
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:01,035
Mmm. We may need
to start from scratch.

118
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,004
Why don't we show
when everything changed?

119
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:04,706
Oh, that would be
fantastic!

120
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,007
Like when I met
Toothless and...

121
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,608
Maybe more
big picture, honey.

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,011
When all Vikings and
dragons became friends.

123
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:14,081
Oh, Astrid, I love that.
I'll start writing immediately.

124
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,881
This is gonna be
just what we need...

125
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:18,619
to honor our friendship
with dragons and, of course,

126
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:22,522
my great friend,
Stoick.

127
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:25,460
Okay.

128
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,800
[chitters]

129
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:39,704
[snores]

130
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,641
[chitters]

131
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,850
[all chittering]

132
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,053
- [squeals]
- [chitters]

133
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,961
Hiccup,
I've been up all night.

134
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:11,662
It's just a first draft,
but I'm gonna be honest...

135
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,098
it's brilliant!

136
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,801
Oh! Toothless?

137
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,803
Pretty great,
right?

138
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,637
Amazing!

139
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,672
Wait a minute,
I've got an idea.

140
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,841
We should use this
for the pageant.

141
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,210
Well, yeah,
that's, that's...

142
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,079
Gee, I never would've
thought of that.

143
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,981
I'm gonna make him look
so much like Toothless,

144
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,116
Zephyr's gonna fall
in love with him.

145
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:37,052
He's beautiful.

146
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:40,822
But cogs and gears can't bring back
the warmth of your friend's nose

147
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:43,124
or the light
in his eyes.

148
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,661
Or the sound of your
best friend's voice.

149
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,863
Yeah, I miss my dad,
too, Gobber.

150
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:51,566
Ah, we'll make them
both proud.

151
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,935
[Hiccup] <i>It was a couple
of days before Snoggletog,</i>

152
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,939
<i>and I was getting excited
about the pageant.</i>

153
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,872
Ah. Uh-uh.

154
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:02,040
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

155
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,674
[screams, grunts]

156
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,710
- [apparatus clanking]
- [gasps]

157
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,980
- Yes! It works!
- We're going to catch a dragon, Dad!

158
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,882
Knock him cold
so he can't eat us!

159
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,917
Zephyr designed
the whole trap herself.

160
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,852
[Hiccup] Ah, so proud.
[chuckles]

161
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,121
Come on, Nuffink.
Let's set some traps outside.

162
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,156
- Come on!
- We're going to kill a dragon!

163
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:23,125
- [Astrid] What did I say about using the good knives?
- [Hiccup] A little help here?

164
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,793
- [Astrid] Kids!
- Has anybody...

165
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,131
Okay. This pageant
better work.

166
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,173
[snores]

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,648
- [yelps]
- [growling]

168
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:54,087
[both chattering]

169
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,021
[man] Coming through.

170
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,289
Great news, chief.

171
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,191
After exhaustive casting,
we've found our Hiccup.

172
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:04,161
Yeah, Gobber,
actually I wanted to ask you

173
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,729
about the whole Hiccup
character in the story.

174
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,166
Hiccup,
present yourself!

175
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,001
- Tuffnut?
- Tuffnut, give us a taste.

176
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:15,237
Uh, a dragon is coming.

177
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:18,106
Aah. Help me. Help...

178
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,077
Uh... uh, line?

179
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:21,976
Me?

180
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,044
- Right. Me.
- [Hiccup] Are you...

181
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,047
Great. Now let's see you
run away in fear.

182
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,916
- [shouting]
- Oh, look at those knock-knees,

183
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,285
- the splayed gait of a newborn lamb.
- [Hiccup] I don't...

184
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,753
I do not run
like that.

185
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,088
- Do I run like that?
- Mmm.

186
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,290
Which brings me
to a bigger point.

187
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,927
I read the script, Gobber,
and I have some notes.

188
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,096
I'm not sure the character
of Hiccup is coming through

189
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,964
quite as heroic
as I was.

190
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,033
I was pretty heroic.
No?

191
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,335
Oh, mate, I think
we got the gist of it.

192
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,303
But that's not,
in any way, me.

193
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:55,205
Hey, Hiccup.
I was...

194
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,839
Oh.

195
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,040
- Are you serious?
- [chuckling]

196
00:09:58,042 --> 00:09:59,010
[man]
Coming through!

197
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,147
- [sighs]
- [shrieks]

198
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,750
[all chittering]

199
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:11,852
[chittering continues]

200
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:14,154
[Gobber] Better luck next time, Haggis.
Nice effort.

201
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,956
- Who's next?
- I... [sighs]

202
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,129
Fishlegs Ingerman reading for
the role of Stoick the Vast.

203
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,097
[exhales]

204
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,264
If I don't return...

205
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:29,236
Nope. No.
[clearing throat]

206
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,037
[deep voice]
If I don't return,

207
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,707
know that all I am,
all I do,

208
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:38,175
is for you,
my precious Hiccup.

209
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:40,110
[gasps] Wow.

210
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,979
So, are you thinking
what I'm thinkin'?

211
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:45,949
Yes, I am.
This isn't working.

212
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,217
What?
Not working?

213
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,552
You're right.
I should do it.

214
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:51,220
No, don't try
and talk me out of it.

215
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:53,123
- I knew Stoick best.
- [whimpers]

216
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,025
[clears throat]

217
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:58,027
If I don't return,

218
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,995
know that all I am,

219
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,330
all I do...

220
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:05,999
[sobbing]
I miss him so much!

221
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,100
[sighs]

222
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,134
I just need
a moment.

223
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,905
Da-da-da,
we're doomed.

224
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,309
- [shouts]
- [laughs]

225
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,279
[hisses]

226
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,115
[Gobber sobbing]

227
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,019
[coos]

228
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,186
[sobbing]

229
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,156
Gobber, the pageant's tonight. So, are
you sure you're gonna be able to do this?

230
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,259
I hoped it wasn't
noticeable.

231
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,426
You know, it is.

232
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,161
But, Gobber,
think of the kids.

233
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,429
- We're doing this for them.
- [grunting]

234
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:42,097
Ay, Hiccup.

235
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,967
Brilliant, as always.

236
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,970
- [squeals]
- [barks]

237
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:51,606
[Gobber] All right.
I'm all right. I'm okay.

238
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,376
- It's gonna be fine.
- [Gobber] Fine.

239
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:56,212
[chitters]

240
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,414
[all growling]

241
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,783
What?

242
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,187
[Gobber] Okay, people,
two minutes to curtain.

243
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,621
[man]
Has anyone seen my sword?

244
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:12,925
[all shriek]

245
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,326
[bleats]

246
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,063
[groans]

247
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,198
[whimpering]

248
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,174
[branch snaps]

249
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:34,944
[grunts]
Ah?

250
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,413
[growls]

251
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,849
[roars]

252
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,417
[all whimper]

253
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,451
[roaring]

254
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,322
[horn plays]

255
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:49,857
[chuckles]

256
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,332
[audience applauding]

257
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:05,670
Hiccup, today is the
day everything changes.

258
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,841
- I have tamed a dragon.
- [audience oohs]

259
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,942
I am so tiny and afraid.

260
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:15,345
What is that? What is that?
That never happened.

261
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:17,447
So Gobber took
a few liberties.

262
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,115
I don't know.
There were dragons everywhere,

263
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:23,985
and people doubting me,
especially my own father.

264
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,120
And then I stood my
ground and touched one.

265
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,289
I touched a dragon.
That's hard-core.

266
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,191
He's got the spirit
of the story.

267
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,460
And that's what this pageant
is really about, isn't it?

268
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,228
Yeah, I guess so.

269
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,398
- Hiccup, you are weak and fear dragons.
- [audience laughs]

270
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,201
I am strong
and understand them.

271
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,136
I don't know if I want
to go through with this.

272
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,139
- You're on!
- Yeah, I...

273
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,275
No. Astrid? I... What?

274
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:52,011
[audience oohs]

275
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:57,348
[boy] A dragon!

276
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,317
There he is.
The Night Fury.

277
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,985
[groans]

278
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,155
- [boy] It's Toothless!
- [girl] Toothless.

279
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,557
[audience oohs]

280
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,126
- Whoa!
- Nope.

281
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,295
Mmm. Whatever.

282
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,196
[audience exclaims]

283
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:17,532
[coos]

284
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:21,101
This pageant is bringing
up the feelings.

285
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:23,003
Stoick would've
loved this.

286
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:26,340
The only thing vaster
than his presence

287
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:29,475
was his capacity
for mirth!

288
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:33,046
[blows nose, wails]

289
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,317
Oh, pookie lump.

290
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,528
- Brave father, I remember your wise words.
- [both gasp]

291
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,097
"Hiccup,
you can be a giant,

292
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:57,166
but face thine enemies
with care."

293
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:59,568
[yelps] Oh, no.

294
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,307
"Hiccup, you can be
a giant, but face..."

295
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:07,341
No. Line?

296
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:09,076
[shouting]

297
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,445
[both scream]

298
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,212
[all exclaim]

299
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:15,182
"Hiccup, you can be
a giant but face!"

300
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:17,186
Don't panic.
It's just part of the show.

301
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,222
[shouting]

302
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,957
[screams]

303
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,426
[all screaming]

304
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,130
[grunts]

305
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,500
[all cooing]

306
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,203
[shouts]
Oh! Hey, you...

307
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,604
[screams]

308
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,106
[whimpers]

309
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,074
Do something!

310
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:47,110
Yeah, I got it.
Maybe this one.

311
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,181
Why would you give it
that functionality?

312
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,316
[screams]

313
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:55,252
[screams]

314
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:57,987
I'm on it.

315
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:02,456
Yeah, I got it.

316
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,593
[roars]

317
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:11,098
No, no, no, no, no.
[screams]

318
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,107
Gobber? Gobber?

319
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,475
Is that you?

320
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,109
- Thank you for helping out there.
- [sniffs]

321
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,511
[chitters]

322
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,447
[groans] What did you
have, raw trout for lunch?

323
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,151
Let me just shift my weight so I can...
[shouts]

324
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,285
Uh, Gobber?

325
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,854
How did you lose your last two
limbs, Gobber?

326
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,422
Oh, it was a pageant.

327
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,225
- [Hiccup] Gobber?
- Huh?

328
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,294
Hiccup!

329
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,062
[chitters]

330
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,433
[audience exclaims]

331
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:00,439
[all chittering]

332
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,241
Whoa!
Nice one, Hiccup.

333
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:07,512
Greetings,
magnificent creature!

334
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:12,653
Will you allow Stoick to tame
you with his gentle... touch?

335
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,390
[chitters]

336
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:20,392
[chitters]

337
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:29,197
[audience] Aww!

338
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,166
[cheering]

339
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:35,603
Let man and dragon
be forever bonded

340
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:38,141
in trust and love.

341
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,209
[giggles]

342
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,612
Yes!

343
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,216
[chitters]

344
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:54,720
Oh, thank you. Thank you,
thank you. Thank you very much.

345
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,355
Whoa!
That was amazing!

346
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:00,358
I'm so excited
I could fly!

347
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,327
It's just a show, Nuffink.
It's just Dad in a suit.

348
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,428
Best show yet!

349
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,663
[Nuffink] Way to go, Dad!
[whoops]

350
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:08,765
Hey, Dad. Dad?

351
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,702
- [growls]
- [gasps]

352
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,176
[gasps]

353
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:23,614
Hi.

354
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,513
[sniffs]

355
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,749
Little help here?
Gobber?

356
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:32,387
- [chitters]
- Anyone? Literally anybody?

357
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,256
[purrs]

358
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,669
Oh! [giggles]

359
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:56,406
I love dragons,
and I love Toothless!

360
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:58,775
He's beautiful!

361
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:02,411
Why didn't you tell me you were
really going to bring him here?

362
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,347
I have literally no idea
what she's talking about.

363
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,716
This whole thing was
not what I expected.

364
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:09,652
[boy] Okay.
How about now?

365
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:12,422
Up a little.
A bit to the right.

366
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:19,994
- I am Stoick the Vast!
- I'm Toothless! Let's be friends. [giggles]

367
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:22,429
[sighs]
You were right.

368
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,698
It was exactly
what everyone needed.

369
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,633
For the kids,
and for the memory of my father.

370
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,337
[clicks tongue]
Aww.

371
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:35,840
Gobber, you have well honored
my father and your friend.

372
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,477
It was my deepest
privilege to do so.

373
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,614
Thank you,
Hiccup.

374
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,184
Well, guess I'll be
headin' home.

375
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,718
Alone.

376
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,752
Oh, the best Snoggletogs

377
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:54,289
are spent in solitary,
cavernous silence.

378
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,457
- Gobber.
- If you're free tonight...

379
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,727
- I'd love to!
- [Astrid laughs]

380
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:58,696
Gobber, wait!

381
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,734
- [chuckles] Oh, that's clever.
- And...

382
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,369
You're good.

383
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,305
[sighs] So proud.

384
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:15,575
- [gasps]
- Look at that. It's so cool!

385
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:17,276
It's beautiful.

386
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:20,279
- Hiccup, did you do this?
- No.

387
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,715
The bowl!
It's empty!

388
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,752
- Toothless?
- Can it be?

389
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:27,787
[gasps]

390
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,391
[roars]

391
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,226
Toothless!

392
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:35,761
Yeah!

393
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,529
- [Hiccup] <i>And then it hit me...</i>
- [shouts]

394
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,832
<i>...our loved ones
are always nearby</i>

395
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,667
<i>when we hold them in our hearts.</i>

396
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:46,802
Maybe it's our turn
to visit them.

397
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,338
[all shrieking]

398
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,314
Hey!

399
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:08,423
[chitters]

400
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:27,218
