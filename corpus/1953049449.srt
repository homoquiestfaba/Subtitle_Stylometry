00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,198
You got a problem, puto? Huh, gringo?

173
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,918
-I don't want any trouble.
-Then you should not kick the door.

174
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,189
You hear me?

175
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,435
Shit.

176
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,035
-I just want to talk to a doctor.
-You just want to talk, huh?

177
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,435
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

178
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,788
What's in his wallet?

179
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,792
There is no licence. Nothing. Only money.

180
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,758
Turn around! Turn around, puto! Come on.

181
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,309
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

182
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,635
He doesn't have anything.
Not even a passport.

183
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,439
Who the fuck are you?

184
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,312
Where did you come from?

185
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,391
I just want to talk with Dr Navarro.

186
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,275
Dr Navarro, huh?

187
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,915
We're the bosses around here!
You talk to us!

188
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,549
Stop it.

189
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,312
You'll kill him.

190
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,555
You speak to us. Understand?

191
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,393
Go home!

192
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,036
After consulting my colleagues
I'm afraid they are of the opinion that

193
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,275
Chloe's entering Stage Four.

194
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,238
That's the final stage, right?

195
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,795
Oh, my God.

196
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,438
I'm sorry, Diane.

197
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,955
Yeah.

198
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,872
There is a rumour that has been nagging
at me for some time

199
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,679
and I ran a name through UOOS.

200
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,950
There's only two reasons
for a patient to go off the list.

201
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,119
They either get a transplant or they die.

202
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,151
This has to remain confidential.

203
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,314
-James Harrison?
-James Harrison.

204
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,039
The James Harrison?

205
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,034
According to his medical information,

206
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,438
in 2001 he had a two-year life expectancy.

207
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,912
And then a few months later,
he was taken off the list.

208
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,399
What are you saying?

209
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,113
He must have found an alternative solution.

210
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,311
I'm sorry. Are you saying he might
have had an illegal heart transplant?

211
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,076
Possibly. Different countries
have different laws and resources.

212
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,394
We call it "organ tourism."

213
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,274
In China they sell the organs
of inmates on death row.

214
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,512
In Iran, a person can sell
his own kidney legally.

215
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,074
If you are in need of a transplant
and have money

216
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,758
there are options.

217
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,872
You were right, Paul.

218
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,638
The lungs did die
on their way to Salt Lake City.

219
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,156
I don't think we can depend
on UOOS to save Chloe's life.

220
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,275
What are you going to do about Harrison?

221
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,594
What can I do?

222
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,234
Talk to him. Ask him about the transplant.

223
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,555
And say what?

224
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,830
"Excuse me. My doctor,
who may now lose her licence,

225
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,717
"illegally provided me
with your medical information.

226
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,876
"And I was just wondering
if you wouldn't mind telling me,

227
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,350
"now your political career's over,
where you picked up your new heart."

228
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,032
This is about your career.

229
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,835
'Cause if Harrison actually
gave you the information,

230
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,754
you might have to do something that
might compromise your superior morality.

231
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,798
That's fucking unfair.
This isn't about my career.

232
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,319
It's about me not breaking the law.

233
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,119
Fine. You want to be
on the right side of the law?

234
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,593
Go defend child molesters.

235
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,709
Wait.

236
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,069
Please.

237
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,159
Please, I'll pay you.

238
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,597
-It's empty, cabron.
-I'll pay you later.

239
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,792
Fuck you!

240
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,916
Hey. Just give me my keys!

241
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,069
Hey.

242
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,155
(HORN HONKING)

243
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,269
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

244
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,395
Let me go.

245
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,119
The keys, I want those keys.

246
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,109
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

247
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,033
Does it make you feel good, fag?

248
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,319
Fuck you, asshole.

249
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,874
Say something, idiot.

250
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,952
I just needed the keys.

251
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,715
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

252
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,159
Don't run, asshole.

253
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,633
You a cop?

254
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,393
You a cop, cabron!

255
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,068
Shut up!

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,668
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I'm looking for someone.

257
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,829
Who?

258
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,589
Dr Navarro.

259
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,915
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

260
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,712
Any of you heard of Dr Navarro?

261
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,033
Tico and Chepe fucked him up.

262
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,912
But they didn't steal anything.

263
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,918
They left his wallet, keys and cell.

264
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,589
Do you have them?

265
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,994
I have the cell.

266
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,753
What did Tico and Chepe want with you?

267
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,310
I don't know. Tico, Chepe?

268
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,719
The guys who beat you up.

269
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,068
You know them? You know those guys?

270
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,237
-I know where they work.
-You do? Will you take me there?

271
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,230
Take you there? $20.

272
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,032
Okay, you take me where they work.
I'll pay you then.

273
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,749
Get in.

274
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,438
-Get in.
-How do I know you'll pay me, cabron?

275
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,595
You're the one with the gun.

276
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,229
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

277
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,759
Move it.

278
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,355
Give me the cell.

279
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,549
Why?

280
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,870
I'm gonna sell it back to the American.

281
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,872
I'll see you guys later.

282
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,474
What's your name?

283
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,109
Call me Jefe.

284
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,395
No funny shit, Jefe.

285
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,398
You're the only funny shit here.

286
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,592
You're looking for putas?

287
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,318
Forget about Tico and Chepe.

288
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,513
Tell me what you like
and I take you good places.

289
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,959
-Ten dollars.
-No, I...

290
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,475
I don't want ladies. I'm married.

291
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,435
Okay. To the left.

292
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,316
-Left, estupido, left.
-That is left.

293
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,159
-The other way.
-Right?

294
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,311
Which is right, pendejo.

295
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,311
Mr Harrison, Paul Stanton is in your office.

296
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,034
Hi, Paul. What can I do for you?

297
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,991
Well, I've been thinking
about the Pechinsky case.

298
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,392
Maybe you were right.

299
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,516
I don't know.
I thought you were handling it pretty well.

300
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,038
What would you do?

301
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,429
Me?

302
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,033
I'd get the hell out of it while I could.

303
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,792
You don't want to get cornered
with this case, Paul.

304
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,031
This Pechinsky's a scumbag.
Everybody knows that.

305
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,832
He got what he deserved.

306
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,869
Let the father do minimum time.
Get back to his family.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,197
It's not about pursuing
the law to its limits, Paul.

308
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,437
It's about what kind of society
you want to raise your kids in.

309
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,839
Don't you think?

310
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,555
Huh?

311
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,470
I'm going to take some time off.
My daughter's not doing too well.

312
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,196
I'm sorry to hear that, Paul.
If there's anything I can to help...

313
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,596
You could make a few calls.
Find me a pair of lungs.

314
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,755
That'd be great.

315
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,869
I'll keep her in my prayers.

316
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,072
World famous, Hollywood girls.

317
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,713
I told you, no ladies.

318
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,791
Tico and Chepe are in there.

319
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,115
How do you know that?

320
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,272
They work here.

321
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,119
All right. Here you go.
Can I have my cell phone?

322
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,955
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

323
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,915
Amigo.

324
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,477
This is a very dangerous place.

325
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,116
-Oh, yeah?
-For cars.

326
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,395
Oh, yeah?

327
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,799
If you like, I watch.

328
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,957
How much is it going to cost me?

329
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,639
Twenty to watch.

330
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,479
Forty, no stealing.

331
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,271
You come back for a little bit more or what?

332
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,839
I want to talk to Navarro.

333
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,516
I don't know what you're talking about.

334
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,109
Just know I'm not leaving until
you let me talk to him.

335
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,669
No, no.

336
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,034
(INAUDIBLE)

337
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,593
-DIANE: So, Claudia?
-Yes.

338
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,949
-I'll check in at 9:00.
-Don't worry. I'll call you if there's a problem.

339
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,789
Hey.

340
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,275
Hi, honey.

341
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,712
Hey, I think those new glasses look
really cute on you.

342
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,199
I look like a nerd.

343
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,435
A cute nerd.

344
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,149
-Hey.
-What's going on?

345
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,071
We're going to the Harrison's fundraiser.
Remember?

346
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,468
I thought you said you didn't want to go.

347
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,749
We're going.

348
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,472
-Isn't mommy beautiful?
-Yeah.

349
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,431
Thank you.
You still have to go to bed at 8:00.

350
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,959
Say goodnight.

351
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,274
You're handsome, too, daddy.

352
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,311
All right, get ready. We're going to be late.

353
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,795
All right. I guess I'll jump in the shower.

354
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,315
Thank you.

355
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,873
When Jim asked me to say a few words

356
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,669
he dulled the fear I would experience

357
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,439
by plying me with a bottle of Jack.

358
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,473
And offering me a twenty.

359
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,195
I told him I couldn't be bought.
So he offered me $50.

360
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,995
And I asked him if he thought I was cheap.

361
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,909
So, finally...

362
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,077
I'm sorry. Is there another restroom?
The powder room is full.

363
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,991
Just go upstairs through the bedroom.

364
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,149
While I was chasing girls,
Harrison studied at night.

365
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,794
Working towards becoming
the incredible man we see before us today.

366
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,875
Let's raise our glasses
to the worst patient I've ever had.

367
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,359
And the best governor we'll ever find.
Jim Harrison.

368
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,358
Thank you for the kind words, Henry.

369
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,269
Like all good Republicans,

370
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,271
I trust you with just about
anything in the world,

371
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,679
except public office.

372
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,351
I'm humbled by the support
and goodwill out here tonight

373
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,629
and I want to thank you all for coming.

374
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,838
I deeply appreciate it. Thank you.

375
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,914
So, you're Jim's doctor.

376
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,993
-I'm Paul Stanton. I work with him.
-Oh, yes.

377
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,115
I'm not surprised to hear
he's a terrible patient.

378
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,599
-Is he keeping you busy?
-No.

379
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,359
Beer, please.

380
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,194
I've been following the Pechinsky case.

381
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,238
You're doing a great job.
I hate the mob mentality.

382
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,351
Yeah, you're a man after my own heart.

383
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,239
Nice speech, Henry.

384
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,158
I'll have to prove you wrong tomorrow
on the course.

385
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,515
-No, I can't play. I'm on call.
-What a shame.

386
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,069
Thanks for coming, Paul.

387
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,076
Harrison knows I'm on to him.

388
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,877
He shut me down the minute
I got near his doctor.

389
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,598
I don't know how I'm going
to get him to talk to me.

390
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,790
-Maybe this will help.
-What's that?

391
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,150
Azathioprine. From his medicine cabinet.

392
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,633
-Jesus, Diane!
-Nobody saw me. I promise.

393
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,749
Well, he's going to miss it.

394
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,595
He's got plenty more.
It's like a pharmacy in there, Paul.

395
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,510
I mean, he's got Neoral, CellCept, Paramycin.

396
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,036
-Okay.
-They're all anti-rejection medications.

397
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,999
He needs to take one of those pills
every 12 hours to stay alive.

398
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,951
-Who are you?
-Where is Navarro?

399
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,838
You want to see him? Sit.

400
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,798
I just need some information.

401
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,751
-What are you doing?
-This is the easy way.

402
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,274
Or I can call your old friends
Tico and Chepe.

403
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,839
No, don't do that.

404
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,158
You do as I say
if you want to meet Dr Navarro.

405
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,871
Are you wearing a wire?

406
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,874
I'm not wearing a wire.

407
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,392
Let me talk to Navarro.
I'll answer your questions then.

408
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,549
Okay?

409
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,394
Please.

410
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,433
If you won't answer my questions,
that's okay.

411
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,039
You can take your time.

412
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,909
-Mommy!
-I'm right here, baby!

413
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,915

My daughter has a progressive lung disease,
and it's killing her.

427

She needs new lungs.

Dr Navarro's my only chance.
Please take me to him.

-I saw your name on the UOOS list.

UOOS list? What are you talking about?

Don't insult me, Jim.

458
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,992
According to your medical records,
you should be dead.

My medical records?

460
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,832
So you've accessed private,
confidential medical records?

461
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,909
I could have you disbarred for that.

-Diane saw the pills in your medicine cabinet.
-What?

463
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,917
Yeah. For someone who acts like
he knows nothing about this,

you're sure as hell taking
a lot of anti-rejection medication.

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,433
So now you're breaking into my house?

466
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,909
Forget about being disbarred.
I could have you thrown in jail.

You want to get thrown in jail?

and put me on the UOOS list.

I got a call from Juarez, Mexico.

How did they know about your condition?

477
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,115
I don't know. Inside information,
access to the UOOS list.

478

and was desperate.

Why didn't you tell me?

481

That's how it happened.

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,478
Where do you get the medication?

489
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,989
Dr White. I had to come clean with him.

490
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,911
You got to get me in touch with these people.

491
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,434
You don't get in touch with them!
They call you.

Look. I've never taken a bribe.
I've never used my position for personal...

You know. But I did break the law.

-I don't have...

if that's his real name or not.

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,159
-I fell.
-Of course.

519
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,115
Come with me.

520
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,592
Jefe helped me.

521
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,037
-Oh, yes. Jefe. "The Boss."
-Yes.

522
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,589
Esperate aqui, Miguel.

523
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,028
Miguel?

524
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,151
See you later. Paul.

525
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,470
How do you know, Miguel?

526
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,194
I met him tonight with his gang.

527
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,557
Oh, yes. The familia.

528
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,511
We call them Los Olvidados.
"The Forgotten Ones."

529
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,797
They're street kids.

530
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,512
We get them occasionally
for a free meal or a check-up.

531
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,070
-Can I ask you a question?
-Of course.

532
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,359
What's the local policy
regarding organ transplants?

533
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,875
Why are you here, Mr Stanton?

534
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,988
It's just a question.

535
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,553
I have a friend who's waiting for a donor.

536
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,197
Well, basically, just like in the US.

537
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:33,679
Mexican law requires prior written consent
from the donor or the next of kin.

538
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,192
So it's the same ranking system as there?

539
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,748
Or can people jump the line here?

540
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,398
You're wondering if you should send
your friend down here to buy a cheap organ.

541
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,598
I've heard about this organ tourism.

542
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,712
Pick up a sombrero, some tequila,
and a kidney.

543
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,559
-No, it's not anything like that.
-You're done.

544
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,595
It's an urban myth that
body parts are for sale in Mexico.

545
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,515
We've got our own people who need organs
and we don't have spares lying around.

546
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,672
I'm sorry. I know. I didn't mean to offend you.

547
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,752
It's just that my friend's desperate.

548
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,391
You want to see desperation? Follow me.

549
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,429
Look.

550
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,638
There are countless facilities like this and
still not enough to meet the social demand.

551
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,953
Everyone you see is facing a death sentence.

552
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,909
And we don't have the resources
to save them.

553
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,513
If you'll excuse me, I have patients waiting.

554
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,789
Good luck to your friend.

555
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,956
Okay, okay. I'll give you your $100.

Keep the change.

559
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,079

Is that your wife?

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,229
Si, and my daughter, Chloe.

566
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,239
She is very beautiful.

567
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,949
Yes, she is.

00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,393

-Who the fuck is Aguilar?

He owns the club!
He's the one who told us to film you.

You have some balls coming here.

588
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,389
I came here because my daughter's dying
and she needs a lung operation.

589
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,799
Really?

590
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,118
I thought you came down here
for a Turkish aperitif.

591
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,475
This should entertain the other prosecutors
in your office.

592
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,798
You know what?
You can post that on the Internet if you want.

593
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,108
I don't give a shit.

594
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,837
I just want to save my daughter's life.

595
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,991
It's too high risk.

596
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,792
We'll take our chances.

597
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,910
You say that now.
But what if she dies on the table?

598
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,198
You are part of the American justice system.

599
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,389
Are you going to come after us?

600
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,676
How am I going to come after you?
I'd be an accomplice.

601
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,595
I mean, come on, we both know you've
done business with people like me before.

602
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,508
That was different. We contacted him.

603
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,508
He didn't know who we were. He came alone.

604
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,319
And if he died on the table,
that would not have been a problem for us.

605
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,675
I'm not going to leave unless you help me.

606
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,353

Mr Stanton, we're going to
make an exception for your daughter.

The price is $200,000 cash, non-negotiable.

611
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,913
You'll give the money to Arturo.

How can I trust you?

616
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,679
You can't.

617
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,158

have to do business with us.

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,678
There's a mule going to the house.

621
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,633
Wait until he gets there, then you go in.

622
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,393
-Get out of the car.
-I can't get out here.

623
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,117
Please, pull around the corner.

624
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,395
Now get out.

-What's your real name?
-Carlos.

do you know where that is?

632
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,635
This part of town is owned
by the Perros cartel.

-He's a volunteer.
-What do you mean volunteer?

-We're in the hospital.
-What?

696
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,595

had collapsed.

697
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,473
Oh, shit.

698

How much time do we have?

701
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,831
A week. Maybe less.

702
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,990

I've tried everything.

703

730
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,156
Through these clinics, you're coming
in contact with American doctors.

731
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,153
One of the doctors mentions,
shall we call him "Dr White,"

732
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,117
that he's got a patient
who's desperate for a new heart.

733
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,520
Aguilar, or should we call him "Dr Navarro,"

734
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,349
tracks the patient down
and promises to help him.

735
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,596
The patient pays his money and a week later,

736
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,432
he's brought down here
and given a new ticker.

737
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,753
I got to hand it you.

738
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,749
It's one hell of a cover, your charitable clinic.

739
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,510
-Helping the poor, homeless, runaway...
-I do help the poor.

740
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,031
The money from those operations
keeps the clinic running.

741
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,873
Come in.

742
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,029
Come in.

743
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,829
Juarez is the murder capitol of Mexico.

744
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,553
The city of death.

745
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:25,398
Everyday dozens of people die
from drugs, violent crime, traffic accidents.

746
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,869
Sit down.

747
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,075
Here in Mexico,

748
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,189
orphans, homeless and poor people
don't fill out donor cards.

749
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,552
So, when they die, their hearts, lungs,
and kidneys cannot be legally used,

750
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,676
regardless of demand.

751
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,391
Should more people die
because of such a technicality?

752
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,911
We don't think so.

753
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,230
We are firm believers
in the law of presumed consent.

754
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,235
You're familiar with the concept, no?

755
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,594
Yeah, you assume everyone's a donor
unless they state the contrary.

756
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,439
-Exactly.
-Right.

757
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,913
Some countries
have already adopted this law.

758
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,115
We take from those already dead...

759
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,832
This is not what...

760
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,588
This is not what I was expecting. I thought...

761
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,439
What did you expect?

762
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,594
I thought I was buying my way
to the top of the Mexican donor list.

763
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,960
Even if it were possible,
buying your way to the top of the list

764
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,350
only cheats a Mexican child out
of a life-giving opportunity.

765
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,113
What we're doing only cheats death.

766
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,037
We live in a war zone down here.

767
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,074
The murder rate in Mexico
is three times that of the US.

768
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,552
What is wrong with using dead people
to save other people's lives?

769
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,713
Do not negotiate with your daughter's life,
Mr Stanton.

Oh, Jesus.

771
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,318
How soon can you get the lungs?

772
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,151
Usually, within a week.

773
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,999
I need them tomorrow.

774
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,999

775
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,115

You don't mean that! Diane!

870
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,631
We can't go back now. You understand me?

871
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,998
I don't care where they found those lungs.

872
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,958
But if we don't get one to Chloe
she's going home in a fucking casket.

873
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,594
You don't mean that! Diane!
You don't mean that!

874
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,037
Please just get those lungs, okay?

875
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,431
We don't ever have to
come back to this place.

876
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,269
Please.

877
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,351
Jesus! Fuck!

878
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,070
Pull over! Pull over!

879
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,078
Pull the fuck over, right now!

880
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,911
Where's Martinez? Where is he?

881
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,393
He's not here today. Sir!

882
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,309
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

883
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,515
You can't enter that area, sir.

884
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,075
Where's Martinez?

885
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,189
He's not here.

886
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,795
-Where is he?
-He's not here today. I told you, senor.

887
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,349
Shit!

888
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,589
You can't go in there without permission.

889
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,791
You're killing them!
You're fucking killing them!

890
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,394
-Keep your voice down.
-You set up the hit-and-runs.

891
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,869
And they never get investigated.
Come on, where are they?

892
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,272
You fucking take me to them. Right now!
Or you won't see the rest of your money.

893
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,669
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

894
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,835
You're not allowed in here!

895
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,949
It's okay.

896
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,952
We only had a day. What did you expect?

897
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,433
You said you were only using the dead.

898
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,836
Ideally, yes, but sometimes
these cases require immediacy.

899
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,279
You pushed us.

900
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,273
Did you really expect a perfect match
would die within 12 hours?

901
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,075
How many months have you waited
in America?

902
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,354
Who are you to judge us?

903
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,033
Come on, Mr Stanton.

904
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,710
You knew exactly what you were doing
when you crossed the border.

905
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,712
The boy's going to die anyway.

906
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,152
Maybe not this week or next.

907
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,069
But kids like this don't last long in Juarez.

908
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,390
Another boy dying here means nothing.

909
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,314
But a pair of lungs for your daughter,
that's worth something, isn't it?

910
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,832
Do you want to do the right thing?

911
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,831
There's still time.

912
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,040
You paid for the surgery.
We can still save the boy.

913
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,754
But it will certainly mean
your daughter's death.

914
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,389
Thank you.
