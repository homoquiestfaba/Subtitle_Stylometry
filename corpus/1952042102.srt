Have you been experiencing vision problems?
Headaches? Dizziness?

<i>a whole lot of pressure in your head.</i>

01:18:20,357 --> 01:18:22,154
They made a pact.

1019
01:18:22,226 --> 01:18:24,160
Maybe if you kill your father...

1020
01:18:24,228 --> 01:18:26,788
the pact will be dissolved.

1021
01:18:26,864 --> 01:18:29,230
What?

1022
01:18:29,299 --> 01:18:32,962
<i>Of course I can't offer you that choice,</i>
<i>but... maybe God can.</i>

1023
01:18:33,637 --> 01:18:35,229
No. No!

1024
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:38,900
Go ahead. Do it.
Just do it.

1025
01:18:38,976 --> 01:18:40,967
Go on.

1026
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,942
Sweetie, I love you.

1027
01:18:50,988 --> 01:18:53,923
- It's- It's the only way.
- Just do it.

1028
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:55,856
<i>Please do it.</i>

1029
01:18:57,394 --> 01:18:59,419

1032
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,499
I've always loved you.

1033

1037
01:19:25,789 --> 01:19:28,121
You've always belonged to us.

1038
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,728
Welcome.

1039
01:19:35,966 --> 01:19:37,957
<i>We've been waiting.</i>

1040
01:19:44,007 --> 01:19:47,204
<i>The patient confessed to the murder</i>
<i>and was brought in about a week ago.</i>

1041
01:19:47,277 --> 01:19:49,711
<i>There were several</i>
<i>attempted suicides...</i>

1042
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,114
<i>as well as paranoid</i>
<i>and religious delusions.</i>

1043
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:57,585
I know this is a lot to take in.

1044
01:19:57,654 --> 01:20:00,589
We've had him
under observation for a week.

1045
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,751
<i>So far there's been no change.</i>

1046
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:06,724
Some interaction with you
might draw him out of his shell.

1047
01:20:06,725 --> 01:20:07,422
No.

1048
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,432
I'm sorry?

1049
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,661
I can't.
I need to move on.

1050
01:20:11,735 --> 01:20:14,226
Don't give up on him.
He's your father.

1051
01:20:14,304 --> 01:20:15,999
Not anymore.

1052
01:20:16,073 --> 01:20:19,839
Miss Hartley, is there
something you wanna tell me?

1053
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:22,344
It's just the way
things were meant to be.

1054
01:20:22,412 --> 01:20:25,779
I know you'll take
really good care of him.

1055
01:20:27,684 --> 01:20:29,618
<i>On a personal note...</i>

1056
01:20:29,686 --> 01:20:33,122
<i>I would like to thank Huntington Prep</i>
<i>for not only welcoming me into their school...</i>

1057
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,886
but for endowing me with
the honor of valedictorian.

1058
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:40,726
<i>In closing, I truly believe that</i>
<i>each one of us has a special destiny...</i>

1059
01:20:40,797 --> 01:20:43,823
<i>and we owe it to the world</i>
<i>to fulfill that destiny.</i>

1060
01:20:43,901 --> 01:20:48,770
We are the generation who will change
the world like no one has changed it before us.

1061
01:20:48,839 --> 01:20:50,773
You can count on it.

1062
01:20:50,841 --> 01:20:52,775
Good luck, everyone!
