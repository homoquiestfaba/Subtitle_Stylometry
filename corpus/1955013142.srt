My brother keeps a human head
in his closet.

2
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,428
Every few days
it's a new head.

3
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,700
Usually, they are black women.

4
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,703
But one time he had
a white man's head in there.

5
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,778
I was going bowling
with my friend David one day...

6
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,680
And I needed
to borrow Steve's ball.

7
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,587
He wasn't home,
so I took it
without asking permission.

8
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,489
That's a big no-no.

9
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:34,728
When I opened the bag
at the bowling alley,
I almost cried.

10
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:39,700
I didn't tell anyone about it,
and I used David's ball
instead.

11
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:45,038
I lied and said
the one I brought
was too heavy for me.

12
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,874
I'm surprised
they couldn't smell it.

13
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,549
It's another black
woman's head,

14

And her hair
has been ripped out.

15

I've seen lots of
horror movies,

16
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:39,627
And the heads in those things
don't come close to looking
like the real thing.

17

I can't explain
what it feels like
to hold one of them.

18

At one point
it had thoughts and feelings...

19

And it kissed somebody
it loved.

20

Now it's just a bloody head
in a bowling ball bag.

I hope I don't end up that way.

22

If Steve found out
I was in his room,
he'd probably kill me too.

23

finding out.

What if I put
the head back in the bag
facing the wrong direction?

25
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,401
If he's a killer,
he probably thinks
about things like that,

26

I wish my mom wouldn't worry
about what I watched or drew.

54
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,362
The only reason she cares
is because of a picture
I drew in art class last year.

55

My teacher freaked out
about it,

So Mom had to come to school
and talk about it.
