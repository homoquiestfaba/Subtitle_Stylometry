6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,900
- I've got to go Rosie, I'm late for John.
- Millie, please.

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,351
It's Mr Donaldson,
I don't know what's happening.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,380
Get Dr Stroud, he'll be on his way out
heading for the Masons Arms on Praed Street.

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,061
And wear that.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,586
Run, Rosie.

I am mindful that the first people

14
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,308
to conquer these islands in 43 AD

15
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,340
we British have long memories, you know

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,510
were the Romans.

17
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,260

built a better way of law and order.

18

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,820
And gave us hot baths.

Which, throughout my long
and not uneventful life

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,580
I have, as my wife would confirm,
partaken twice a day.

22

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,582
Thank you.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,389
I'm sorry you missed John.

25

He'll see more than enough of me
when we're married.

I dunno what I'm gonna do
when you're in Australia.

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,705
Well, I've not gone yet.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,625

through two terrible wars

33

and now live in the precarious days
of the hydrogen bomb

a lasting peace between nations.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,700
Therefore, at the Bermuda conference
this summer, I will seek American support

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,780

I give you Signor De Gasperi

to retire to the state drawing room.

- What?

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,660
Glass of water, perhaps.

50

- Yes.

- Uh, yes, darling?

56

Would you excuse me a moment?

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,460
- Christopher, don't let the waiters in.
- Of course.

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,587
Winston, do you think
you're able to stand up?

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,700
- He needs an ambulance, Mama.
- He needs his doctor.

60
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,271
Get Lord Moran, Jock, make our excuses
to the Italians and clear the house.

61

What Italians?

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,225
Just hold my hand, Winston, hmm?
Just hold my hand.

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,460
Would you give his apologies to De Gasperi
and get them to leave.

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,107
Of course.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,782
- Rab.
- Jock, what's going on?

66
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,940
We've got the Americans on the phone, Rab

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,860
and we could do with
clearing the house, actually.

68
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,791
Would you give Christopher a hand?

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,501

75
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,227
Good morning, Winston.

76
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,140
How are you feeling?

77
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,027
I was thinking about Bermuda.

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,426
Let's get you just sitting down, shall we?

79
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,380
- Where exactly is it?
- Not my subject, I'm afraid.

80
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,903
Just sitting, sitting on the edge.

81
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,106
On the edge, that it.
Good, good, gently.

82
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,260
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

83
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,940
Now, Winston, could you,
could you just grasp my fingers here?

84
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,020
Just here.

85
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,820
And with this hand,
with your left, that's good.

86
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,220
- Where are my cufflinks?
- You're wearing them, Winston.

87
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,662
Ah.

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,940
I'm sure it's just tiredness.

89

He's exhausted, Mary. He's 78.

And being Foreign Secretary as well
while Eden's ill.

91
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,380
- What's his first appointment?
- Cabinet at 11.

92
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,947
Cancel it.

93
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,345
I think we should wait
for Lord Moran's report.

94
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,300
- Could you raise both arms for me?
- If I must.

95
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Raise them both, gently, good.

96
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,949
Both arms, Winston, both arms.

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,388
Both, yes, good.

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,791
Good. That's fine, now, just relax,
just drop. Now...

100

you found it difficult
to squeeze the paint out of the tubes?

101
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,270
- The Monte Carlo clutch, yes.
- Well, this could be the same.

102
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,421
Well, just give me a pill.

103

- Very precise, is that a medical term?
- No, behave.

112

If my brain's got billions of connections,
then quite a few will still be working.

He's an old man, Chris.
We love him, but it's time he stood aside.

Let Eden take the strain,
for his own good, as well as the party's.

122
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,100
But Anthony's in no shape
to take over at the moment, is he?

00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,862
He's in America,
getting his gall bladder fixed.

Your man's sicker than Winston.

125
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,740
He'll be alright after
he's been under the knife.

- And when is that?
- Tonight.

127
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,700
- Is the Bermuda conference first?
- Fourth, Prime Minister.

128
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,460
Korea first, then German elections,
then commercial television.

129
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,984

He's your patient, Charles!
It's your job to stop him.

There was nothing I could do.

138

There was just one other thing.

139
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,461
He was singing.

- Yeah.

The thing to stress in Bermuda,
Prime Minister,

143
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,406
is that your approach
will not be seen as unilateral.

144
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,700
If they see is as a personal crusade
by yourself, they'll block it.

145
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,260
But it has to presented
as a united diplomatic effort.

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,669

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,020
His studio's at the back where he paints

174
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,668
but I don't imagine he'll be
doing much of that this weekend.

175
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,660
Where who paints?

176
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,860
- You signed the Act?
- I don't know.

177
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,340
I signed something.
Those men wouldn't speak to me.

178
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,140
You signed the Official Secrets Act

179
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,060
which means that any discussion
of this assignment anywhere, ever

180
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,981
will be severely punished.
Do you understand?

181
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,468
Bedroom and study are through here.

182
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,820
- Do you want to see his bedroom?
- Excuse me, Mr er...

183
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,831
- Colville.
- Colville.

184
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,102
Who lives here?

185
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,260
The Prime Minister.

186
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,146
He'll be here within the hour.

187
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,864
The Prime Minister has had a mild stroke.
You're here to look after him for a few days.

188
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,582
Why me?

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,423
I've been asking myself
the same question, Miss Appleyard.

190
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,822
Wait.

191
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
I can't nurse him in here, it's too small.

192
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,140
I need to be able to get round
both sides of the bed.

193
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,663
I want the bed moved
into this bigger room.

194
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,060
Oh, God! Charles!

195
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,786
- Darling?
- Support his head, Clemmy.

196
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,820
- That's it, good.
- Darling.

197
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,343
Drive on quickly as you can, Sergeant,
we're almost there.

198
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,106
Any minute now.

199
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,551
You're gonna think I'm a bit daft.

200
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,102
What?

201
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,865
Will he mind I didn't vote for him?

202
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,705
- Nurse, quickly.
- Oh, take his weight.

203
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,420
Arm under his shoulder.

204
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,863
- Sergeant. There.
- Yep.

205
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,260
Mind his arm.

206
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,827
Gently with him.

207
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,310
I'll take his head.

208
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,589
Get his feet.

209
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,621
And round.

210
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,183
MORAN:
Thank you gentlemen, some privacy please.

211
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,671
- How bad is it?
- Shh.

212
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,380
- Charles.
- Heart is struggling.

213
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,108
Circulation is very poor.

214
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,748
He may not last the weekend.

215
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,349
Jock, will you give me a hand
with the boxes?

216
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,541
How is he?

217
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,140
- What?
- He, um... they had a difficult journey.

218
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm so sorry, Mary.

219
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,067
- Have you told anybody?
- Nobody.

220
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,101
Why has his bed been moved in here?

221
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,941
It's easier for us to attend to him.

222
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,991
What happened, Charles?

223
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,666
I suspect he has had a more severe stroke.

224
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,350
And will he be alright?

225
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,261
Tell me the truth.

226
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,795
If he regains consciousness at all

227
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:48,619
he may suffer paralysis and brain damage

228
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,786
and there is also the risk
of heart failure.

229
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,426
Oh, Papa...

230
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,980
The Prime Minister wasn't
in the house this afternoon

231
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,300
because he is preparing
for his voyage to Bermuda, Stephen.

232
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,740
No, no, Lord Moran's
visit to Downing Street

233
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,740
was a routine check-up
before such a long journey.

234
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,900
Soames. Christopher Soames.
I don't know, I'll have to ask Mr Colville.

235
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,380
Thank you, Steve, one minute please.

236
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,700
Downing Street want to confirm
the travel arrangements to Bermuda.

237
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,746
He'll get back to you. Later on.

238
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,180
We need to let the Americans know first
he isn't making Bermuda.

239
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,660
The minute you do that,
everyone will know he's sick.

240
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,785
Moran thinks he's dying.

241
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,148
What?

242
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,942
We have to decide what we're
going to tell the press.

243
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,581
Mama.

244
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,463
Well, you've seen him?

245
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,428
Yes.

246
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,348
I want us all together, here.

247
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,421
I don't want the family
reading about it in the papers.

248
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,190
I'll telephone the others now.

249
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,580
Hello, Express?

250
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,989
Lord Beaverbrook's office, please.

251
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,660
I don't care, the Prime Minister wants
to speak to him, just put him through.

252
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,500
This is the Prime Minister's
parliamentary private secretary.

253
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,226
Which theatre?

254
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,940
The Savoy.
No, I'll do it myself, thank you.

255
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,780
Jock, which telephone can I use?

256
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,060
Er, you can use one of mine.

257
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,660
The message reads: "Urgent, the Prime
Minister requires your immediate presence

258
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,820
tonight at Chartwell."

259
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,020
Pimlico, double 3, double 2.

260
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,224
CHRISTOPHER: That's it. Thank you.

261
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,347
Piccadilly 8000 please.
The Savoy concierge.

262
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,751
Diana? It's Mary.

263
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,949
- What are you doing?
- His left side is very weak.

264
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,548
I feel that working the muscles might...

265
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,910
encourage better blood flow
and maybe improve his chances of recovery.

266
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,061
At the very least,
it must be comforting to be touched.

267
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,027
Christopher.

268
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,581
- "Operation Hope Not."
- JOCK: His funeral.

269
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,500
What's this?

270
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,860
The only precedent
was the Duke of Wellington's.

271
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,191
It was the Queen's personal suggestion
that we base it on that.

272
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,551
Was the name your idea?

273
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,027
Afraid so.

274
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,225
Lords of the press.

275
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,068
We'll see them in the studio,
we don't want Lady Churchill disturbed.

276
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,666
CLEMENTINE: Look at them.

277
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,461
MILLIE: Who?

278
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,547
The cronies.

279
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,946
Gathering at the deathbed of their leader.

280
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,987
Thank you. I'll sit with him now.

281
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,146
I won't go far.

282
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,620
I got your cloak-and-dagger summons, Jock

283
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,220
and I thought either Winston's
been a Communist spy all along

284
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,180
or he's dying. Which is it?

285
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,431
My lords, if you'd like to step this way
we can use the studio.

286
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,385
I'll just be a moment.

287
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,583
I live in fear of being given
one of his paintings as a gift.

288
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,780
Is Winston joining us?

289
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,267
No.

290
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,180
If Winston is dying, we'll have to pull
the morning editions, I need a telephone.

291
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,860
Max, please, at the moment
we don't know anything for sure.

292
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,820
We know enough.

293
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,500
I'm asking, we are asking, that you wait.

294
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,540
- We think that's what he'd want.
- To gag us.

295
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,140
Only until the situation is clearer.

296
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,940
It is impossible to make a proper
diagnosis until he comes round.

297
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,780
And what if The Mirror sniffs something?

298
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,380
They'd be only too happy to report
a headless government in crisis.

299
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,020
That's why you're here,
to make sure that doesn't happen.

300
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,524
What about Eden?

301
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:16,327
- Do we know how his operation went?
- CHRISTOPHER: I've got a man at the hospital.

302
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:20,460
So have I but without Winston
and with Eden out of the running

303
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,660
you've got no-one.

304
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,380
Maybe a caretaker government for 6 months,
under Lord Salisbury?

305
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,867
Are you serious?

306
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,740
He'd have a general election in a week.

307
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,547
This is why the party
needs more time, Max.

308
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,340
(CHOKING NOISES)

309
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,102
Nurse! Nurse!

310
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,303
Nurse, he's choking!

311
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,910
He's swallowed his tongue.

312
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,621
Take a breath.

313
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,666
Right, let's get him up.

314
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,548
There you go.

315
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,220
MAX: What about the cabinet?

316
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,500
- Rab will inform them in the morning.
- And parliament?

317
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,886
- No plans to tell them.
- This is bullshit.

318
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:25,982
I know the constitution's not written down,
but you're trampling all over it.

319
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,940
Lord Moran, the Prime Minister's
regaining consciousness.

320
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,427
Would you excuse me gentlemen?

321
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,820
- Find out about Eden.
- Hmm.

322
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,149
I'm going to see Winston.

323
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,345
(HE MUMBLES IN LATIN)

324
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,306
Latin, Winston?

325
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,664
To show my mind hasn't gone.

326
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,702
That's the last thing that will pack up.

327
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,591
Shall we just step outside?

328
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,270
No.

329
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,545
I... I want...

330
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,863
to know the truth.

331
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,831
Your heart is very weak

332
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,504
and there's a loss of sensation
on the left side.

333
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,184
You're vulnerable to further strokes.

334
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,942
Tell me.

335
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,023
Am I dying, Charles?

336
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,701
I don't know.

337
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,506
Max.

338
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,547
Max.

339
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,705
Yes, my friend.

340
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,740
How's Anthony?

341
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,388
We're finding that out now, Winston.

342
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,751
Give me time.

343
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,181
Give me time.

344
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,222
Please, for me.

345
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,071
- I'll talk to the others.
- Thank you.

346
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,347
CHRISTOPHER: How is he?

347
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,300
Conscious, but very weak.

348
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,540
His speech was hard to understand,
but his meaning was as clear as ever.

349
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,540
How's Eden?

350
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,660
There's no question of his returning
to public life before the autumn.

351
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,580
MAX: So, we'll need to keep quiet
about this for longer than a few days.

352
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,940
Maybe the whole summer
if Winston hangs on.

353
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,620
Ministries will still need decisions from the
Prime Minister. How will we handle that?

354
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,300
Rab will hold the fort with the cabinet.

355
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,905
As for decisions, Christopher and I know
what we wants, I think we can make it work.

356
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,540
He was going on holiday
after Bermuda anyway

357
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,740
so if he pulls through, he can carry on.

358
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,900
And no-one will be any the wiser.

359
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,020
And do what exactly?

360
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,620
Drag himself back to Westminster
half-paralysed, slurring his words?

361
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,780
If he regains enough strength, Clemmy,
I know he still hopes

362
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,380
to lead the way
to the end of the Cold War.

363
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,580
What about his family?

364
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,423
We don't want a man crippled with illness
who's worked himself to death.

365
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,180
Don't you think we deserve
some time with him?

366
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,420
- Clemmy...
- No.

367
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,300
You've kept him propped up
on pills for years, Charles.

368
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,380
If you have any love for him,
if any of you do, you would get him to stop.

369
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,460
You would let him come home to his family.

370
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,860
Winston has two families,
one at Westminster...

371
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,740
He has one family, Max.

372
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,260
He's given enough, we both have.

373
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,140
We'll keep this quiet, one day at a time.

374
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,820
I think we all want the same thing here,
just time for him to recover

375
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,502
so he can make up his own mind.

376
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,911
Don't you agree?

- ...and our country.

381
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
Nurse Appleyard, sir.

382
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,542
No, not your rank. Your name.

383
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,788

384

No, Mary wasn't born then.

401
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,747
- When are you getting married?
- We're going to emigrate to Australia.

402
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,900
He's going in a few weeks and
then I'll join him. We plan to marry there.

In time.

Thank you.

408
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,547
How is he?

409
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,940
He's much better today, actually.

supposed to be on that train.

411

we're going to have to wait for her.

413
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,100
He's away, of course.

414
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,022
I tried to telephone him first thing, but
he wasn't where he said he would be, and...

415
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,140
I was thinking, on the train,
should I have brought the children?

416
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,260
Better not.

Nicholas and Emma out of the way.

with Christopher and me down at the farm.

Well, it's piffle! It's no news that
the Prime Minister has been overdoing it.

520
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,100
He's been overdoing it his entire life!

521
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,386
If you want the Daily Mirror to smell
a rat, well, here's the cheese!

522
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,780
Is that funny?

523
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,620
Such a silly thing to say.

524
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,346
Cheese?

525
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,580
This is what Butler and Salisbury
wanted to put out.

526
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,549
Well, I disassociate myself completely.
It misrepresents my professional opinion.

527
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,700
Where are you going?

528
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,506
Fresh air.

529
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,260
This is from President Eisenhower.

530
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,980
"Dear Winston,
I'm deeply distressed to hear

531
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,060
your physicians have advised you
to lighten your duties

532
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,180
I look upon this as a temporary deferment
of our meeting in Bermuda."

533
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,180
Ah.

534
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,511
"Your health is of great importance
to the world."

535
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,581
(HE BABBLES)

536
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,342
Millie.

537
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,381
What do you mean?

538
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,985
Eisenhower.

539
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,060
Eisenhower.

540
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,061
Ike, he never wanted the conference.

541
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,900
He doesn't believe that we can
talk our way to peace with the Russians.

542
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,626
Say it again.

543
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,180
Eisenhower.

544
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,667
And again.

545
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,582
Eisenhower.

546
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,100
Leave that, we haven't finished.

547
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,031
Oh, I'm sorry.

548
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,822
I don't imagine you'd like one of these.

549
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,740
- No, thank you.
- What's your name?

550
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,580
Nurse Appleyard.

551
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,065
What's he calling you?

552
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,700
- Millie.
- Millie.

553
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,110
Yes, I suppose you're in love with him.

554
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,224
This house is normally crawling with Millies,
all busy with their little fantasies.

555
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,942
- I should take this to him.
- I'm sorry.

556
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,420
Don't be embarrassed.

557
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,387
I'm not. But I should take this to him.

558
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,500
SARAH:
Did you ever think of getting divorced?

559
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,840
That's quite a question
to ask your mother.

560
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,583
Sorry.

561
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,387
I did think of not marrying him.

562
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,580
When I finally accepted his proposal

563
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,900
he promised he'd keep it a secret
until I'd told my mother.

564
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,822
Within 5 minutes,
he told his whole family.

565
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,308
I realised then that it was
always going to be all about him.

566
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,510
ON RADIO: And it's Wardle to Hassett
on the fifth ball of this over.

567
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,543
Easily pushed out towards the Pavilion End.
And the umpire's signalling a four.

568
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,620
For those of you who've just joined us
in this second test here at Lords

569
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,427
the sun is shining on a capacity crowd...

570
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,627
RANDOLPH: Hello?

571
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,067
Hello?

572
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,826
Hello?

573
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,627
Randolph.

574
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,180
Good of you to come.

575
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,942
Why are you thanking me
for turning up to my father's deathbed?

576
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,700
How's Eden?

577
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,940
- It's touch and go.
- Well, why don't I know about this?

578
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,020
Why doesn't the party know
the two pillars of government are down?

579
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,500
- The situation is being handled.
- Bugger is it, it's being sat on.

580
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,182
By greasy little
margarine-eaters like you.

581
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,344
- Why is the house so silent?
- Your family are in the garden.

582
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,944
Okay, you can go now.
Enjoy the cricket.

583
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,380
Hello, Randolph. Your father's very tired,
I've just been with him.

584
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,347
Could you wait
until he's slept a little...? No.

585
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,100
Sir, he's too tired
to see anyone at the moment.

586
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,226
- I'd like to be alone with him now, please.
- He needs to rest.

587
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,390
You don't know who I am, do you?

588
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,988
I don't care if you're the Queen of Sheba,
you're not going to disturb my patient.

589
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,671
I'll sit. I shan't say a word.

590
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,703
Has he been asking after me?

591
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,866
Are you Randolph?

592
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,901
Yes, he has.

593
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,180
CLEMENTINE: Marriage is like a garden.

594
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,420
You have to work it through the winter

595
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,340
or you don't get that gorgeous month
of rhododendrons in May.

596
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,864
Or three weeks of... well.

597
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,900
I trust you're appreciating the metaphor.

598
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,260
I've sometimes felt more married to him
than I have to either of my husbands.

599
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,862
- That's silly.
- No, it's not.

600
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,350
There is no hiding from the world
who my father is.

601
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,100
- So when did you get down?
- About an hour or so ago.

602
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,622
He seems quiet peaceful.

603
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,820
Colville was being preposterous as always.

604
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,104
Why? He's just doing his job.

605
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,431
SARAH:
It was simpler when we were children.

606
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,460
But the minute we had our own ideas,
our own lives

607
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,900
and we stopped worshipping him,
everything changed.

608
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,635
- He loves you, he loves all of you.
- No, he loves you because he needs you,

609
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,294
I don't know how much
he needs the rest of us.

610
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,862
Sarah...

611
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,220
- DIANA: So, where did you stay there?
- Nicholas took that time...

612
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,700
The Beverly Hills Carlton Hotel,
oh, Diana it's just marvellous.

613
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,660
It had these hourglass pools,
parties every night.

614
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,540
- Oh, darling, you must come.
- I'd love to.

615
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,500
What are you two wittering on about?

616
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,670
- You, Randolph.
- Are you?

617
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,820
- RANDOLPH: I'm only asking.
- Charles has been there.

618
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,460
He's been more than that,
Christopher's only trying to help.

619
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,180
I'm only asking, I'm only asking.

620
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,620
CLEMENTINE: Thank you, Mrs Lacey.

621
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,620
Mrs Lacey has gone to great trouble
in the last two days.

622
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

623
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,620
Well done for doing your job.

624
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,302
Do you have to be so rude, Randolph?

625
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,700
I think it'll be easier
for everyone if he dies.

626
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,266
Well, Sarah can go off and marry any old
low-life she likes it'll be easier for you,

627
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:29,300
you can move out of Downing Street
you can sell this place, which you hate.

628
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,900
- And you bugger off to the south of France.
- That's a wicked thing to say about your father.

629
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,940
I love my father, it was a wicked thing
to say about you. Get it right, dear.

630
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,180
All the opportunities he's given you, all
the times he's helped to campaign for you!

631
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,624
Not that you needed any help
losing elections, Randolph.

632
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,460
And I suppose cos you've appeared in a
couple of films that no-one's even heard of

633
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,100
that makes you an authority on success.

634
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,540
Sarah received
very good notices for her...

635
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,540
Well, we've all seen the notices
of Sarah in America, drunk in the street...

636
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,420
Be quiet, Randolph.

637
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,260
Brings disgrace on Papa.

638
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,540
My mistakes reflect on me, not on Papa.

639
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,460
You really are thick.
Everything we do reflects on him.

640
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,188
Everything he does
reflects on us, we are...

641
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,229
We're moons to the big planet,
we're one being.

642
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,509
And now with him sick in there,
sick and dying

643
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,026
with him near the end...

644
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,702
with him near the end,
with him near the...

645
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,061
I promised myself I would not cry
in front of you people.

646
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,065
That's enough drink, Randolph.

647
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,940
I'd really like to see you
try and stop me.

648
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,140
- I know you would.
- You never stopped him drinking, did you?

649
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,980
No, you just sit by.

650
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,860
You sit by, that's what you do.

651
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,180
And you watch the disasters unfold
like the lives of these two intellectuals.

652
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,540
- Don't be so foul to Mama.
- Oh, Mrs Soames, shut up, Mrs Soames!

653
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,420
And then you have the audacity to say...

654
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,181
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

655
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,500
Randolph, please, none of this
is Mama's fault, you can't blame her

656
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,180
- Isn't it?
- Oh, Diana, don't.

657
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,100
Because she could have mothered us,
only she was too buy mothering Papa.

658
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,820
He was her surrogate baby.

659
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,548
And how is your psychoanalyst, Diana?

660
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,220
- May I go and visit him?
- Not now, my darling.

661
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,820
Look, here's the proof.
Have you seen the photographs of them?

662
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,300
This one and this one and oh, this one.

663
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,980
The adoring gaze, almost every picture

664
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,220
but, it's the way a mother
looks at her child.

665
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,580
- Sit down, Diana.
- No.

666
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,466
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

667
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,460
- ...children, who we marry...
- You see what you've done?

668
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,500
Sarah's marriage to Vic you dismissed.

669
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,741
You called him a...
"a ridiculous little tinkerbell of a man."

670
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,227
That was the man she wanted to spend
her life with! Who cares what you think?

671
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,340
I don't even know
what "tinkerbell of a man" means.

672
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,020
It means he's a fairy you half-wit.

673
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,940
That's what she said
about the man you loved, Sarah.

674
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,740
- Actually, it was Papa who said that.
- No!

675
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,466
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

676
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,700
Well done for remembering something.

677
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,980
I remember all of it Randolph,
every bit of it and so do you.

678
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,380
Every bit of criticism,
every look of disappointment...

679
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,140
I remember every single day.

680
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,187
- Diana, this is not the time.
- Then when is the time, Sarah?

681
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,507
When?

682
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,740
I've been trying to say
these things for years now

683
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,540
but nobody ever listens to me

00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,620
I don't care what you say about me,
I really don't

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,430
but your father is lying next door
very sick, very sick.

686
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,380
- Have some respect for him.
- She's just defending her baby again now.

687
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,900
And what about everyone else
in this house?

688
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,540
Do you want them to hear all this?

689
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,660
Ooh, I wouldn't worry about them,
they'll love a bit of excitement

690
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,940
they can scribble it in their diaries.

691
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,900
Will you stop fiddling around, Mary.

692
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,660
- They know not to keep diaries.
- RANDOLPH: Of course they...!

693
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,540
Open your eyes!

694
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,180
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

695
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,980
We need to stop this.

696
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,180
I'll go and find Sergeant Murray.

697
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,430
- I think you should leave.
- I know you do.

698
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,900
- Jock will get you a...
- I don't need Jock to get me a bloody taxi!

699
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,911
I think you do.

700
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,540
Ooh, there's quite an audience here.

701
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,100
Sarah, you can come and do your Desdemona.

702
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,260
Randolph, please keep your voice down,
your father is sleeping in the...

703
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,860
- I know where he is!
- DIANA: Randolph.

704
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,066
If you're going back to London,
let me drive.

705
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,547
Tell Papa I love him.

706
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,466
He knows you do.

707
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,310
SARAH: He'll kill himself
if he drives in that state.

708
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,860
- Are you alright Mama?
- Mmm.

709
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,700
Go after them.

710
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,340
DIANA: Randolph, let me take you back.

711
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,540
RANDOLPH: Get a taxi.

712
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,420
Come on darling. Come on, don't be silly.

713
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,180
Get off, get off.

714
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,066
- DIANA: Jock.
- JOCK: Don't let him drive.

715
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,220
Get out of the way!

716
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,504
DIANA: This is ridiculous!

717
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,820
JOCK: Randolph...

718
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,626
Out of the way!

719
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,186
- Get that gate!
- DIANA: Randolph!

720
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,980
(HORN HONKS)

721
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,860
RANDOLPH:
Open the gate, open the bloody gate!

722
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,861
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

723
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,740
Get out of the bloody way!

724
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,229
DIANA: Come on, darling, come on.

725
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,421
- Have you got him?
- That's it, sir.

726
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,347
Yes.

727
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,625
Do you think he heard anything?

728
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,105
I don't think so.
Nurse said he slept through.

729
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,548
They are who they are.

730
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,340
What's the phrase?
"There's a price to pay for greatness

731
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,466
but the great seldom pay it themselves."

732
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,140
- How are you bearing up?
- I wish people would stop asking me that.

733
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,980
Are you hungry? Mrs Lacey's summer pudding
has been shamefully neglected.

734
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,302
I think it was Napoleon who said that there
are three different kinds of courage.

735
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,340
Did he now?

736
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,342
Yes he did and I'm going to tell you
what he thought was the greatest.

737
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,180
He called it the 3-in-the-morning courage.

738
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,465
When everything is dark and cold

739
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,068
and all seems lost.

740
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,069
Winston says Napoleon taught him the
dangers of fighting on more than one front.

741
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,549
A lesson I don't seem to have learned.

742
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,391
You know what he says?

743
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,828
KBO.

744
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,500
"Keep Buggering On".
His answer to everything.

745
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,500
- What else is there?
- Does it never occur to you

746
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,700
that there ought to be something other
than buggering on?

747
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,348
None of us would be here without him.

748
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,887
- And he wouldn't be here without you.
- He'd be here whatever.

749
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:15,826
No, trust me,
he's only flesh and a little bone.

750
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,984
You're his rock, he knows that.

751
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,421
He always has.

752
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,227
MILLIE: "He stood

753
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,946
and heard the steeples
sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.

754
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,180
One, two, three, four

755
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,227
to marketplace and people,
it tossed them down.

756
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,820
Strapped..."

757
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,503
"Noosed, nighing his hour

758
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,021
he stood and counted them, cursed his luck

759
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,271
and then the clock collected in the tower

760
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,863
its strength, and struck."

761
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,946
Brain still works.

762
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,183
I learnt it at school,
but I'm not sure I could do that now.

763
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,061
The box on the desk, my cigars.

764
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,231
I'm not gonna do that.

765
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,980
I don't want a debate.

766
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,980
Good, cos you're not gonna get one.

767
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,548
Get Colville, would you.

768
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,060
Not if you're gonna ask him for a cigar.

769
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,580
Get my secretary. I'm the Prime Minister.

770
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,660
I need to know what's happened.

771
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,060
- Mr Colville.
- Yes.

772
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,664
The Prime Minister is awake,
he wants to speak to you.

773
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,708
Oh.

774
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,542
Thank you.

775
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,180
Prime Minister.

776
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,260
- How are you feeling?
- Get me a cigar, would you?

777
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,506
Of course, sir.

778
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,300
It's very good to see you awake, sir.

779
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,901
Indeed.

780
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,662
Have you, have you rescheduled Bermuda?

781
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,663
- November.
- Ah, good.

782
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,866
Mmm.

783
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,140
But that's after Margate, sir.

784
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,265
Good, that's good.

785
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,301
We need to start work on the speech.

786
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,507
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

787
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,866
- Get me a whiskey, will you?
- Yes, Prime Minister.

788
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,740
Ah, Millie, pass me the ashtray would you?

789
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,100
He's not seriously thinking
of going to party conference?

790
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,907
According to Jock, he's already
drafting the speech for it.

791
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,831
If he is well enough to attend,
it'll be a good time for him to step aside.

792
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,460
How is Anthony? Is he fit to take over?

793
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,020
He's building up his strength.

794
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,580
He very much wants to.

795
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,900
- And there's been nothing in the press?
- Not a peep.

796
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,391
As far as the public is concerned,
Winston is taking a well-earned rest.

797
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,020
Mary, can the children
come up from the farm today?

798
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,507
Of course, Mama.

799
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,187
I want Chartwell to feel like
a family home again.

800
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,345
Somewhere to catch him when he realises
he won't be going back to Downing Street.

801
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,827
What I care about now is peace above all.

802
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,185
A time of peace.

803
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,340
"What I care about now is peace above all,
a time of peace."

804
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,069
- Do we have to do this again?
- Yes, we do.

805
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,311
I've lived a life like a man
who has pursued peace.

806
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,380
- Have you got that?
- Yes, you're a man who's pursued peace.

807
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,028
Like a ferret does a rabbit.

808
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,780
You're looking at me
as if that's not very good.

809
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,347
Well, it's not.

810
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,669
MARY: Mrs J Arthur Rank, please.

811
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,791
Yes, it's Mrs Christopher Soames.

812
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,620
Arthur! Hello, yes, it's Mary Soames.

813
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,180
Arthur, my parents were wondering,
would it be possible for you

814
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,942
to send a film down to Chartwell,
like you used to?

815
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,100
That Hamilton Woman?

816
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,940
No, we've seen that
with him a thousand times.

817
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,190
Do you have anything more recent, Arthur?

818
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,821
CHURCHILL: "My lords, ladies and gentlemen

819
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,587
I am sure you will be relieved

820
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,660
by the news from British Guiana."

821
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,340
I can't hear you.

822
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,420
What?

823
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,700
The Tory party are
a bunch of deaf old folk.

824
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,580
If I can't hear you,
they haven't got a chance.

825
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,100
- I'm sure...
- What?

826
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,826
I'm sure!

827
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,627
Oh, bugger!

828
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,900
Lost my place now.

829
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,501
Where was I?

830
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,507
Just start again.

831
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,106
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen..."

832
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,620
I can't squeeze it, I can't!

833
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,900
Why can't I use my right hand?

834
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,100
Don't shout at me.

835
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,220
I'll shout if I bloody well want to!

836
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,420
If you rely on your right side
to walk and pick things up

837
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,020
then your left side will never recover.

838
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,260
You'll walk like a listing ship.

839
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,140
"A lisping shit"?

840
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,340
A listing ship! Wash your ears out
and your mouth, too.

841
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,342
- Are you this nasty at St. Mary's?
- Yes, I am.

842
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,020
That was good.

843
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,300
Imagined it was you I was hurling.

844
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,220
I tried to imagine it was Herman Goering,
but that didn't make me angry enough.

845
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,185
Well, it was your best yet.

846
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,262
Millie...

847
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,140
You must be careful about
pushing Sir Winston too fast.

848
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,980
Oh, it's not me pushing, ma'am, it's him.

849
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,780
He wakes up every morning with a plan,
he calls it "action this day".

850
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,780
Yes, he would.

851
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,429
He's a remarkable man, Lady Churchill.
That's why he's making progress.

852
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:49,143
He is brave, yes, but this is
not a cavalry charge or a desert.

853
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,944
This is age itself he's up against.

854
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,901
He needs hope.

855
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,266
I've seen it before.

856
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,950
Hope is what makes the difference.

857
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,667
Millie...

858
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,141
my husband's ambition runs people over

859
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,380
and it comes at a cost.

860
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,028
Often to those closest to him.

861
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,780
If he fails and gets low, as only he can

862
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,907
it will not be you who has to pick him up.

863
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,506
You'll be in Australia
with your young man.

864
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,582
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,620
- He must be missing you.
- Oh, John?

866
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,660
No, he's happy, he's on his way.

867
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,180
And when do you follow?

868
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,182
In a month. Although I won't go,
not if Sir Winston needs me.

869
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,304
You must be excited.

870
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,300
Well, it's John that's pushed it, really.
He says it's full of opportunity.

871
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,380
Well, there is opportunity there.

872
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,387
For him.

873
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,620
But I like my job.

874
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,940
I'm proud of the NHS and...

875
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,862
not sure I want to be stuck on the other
side of the world, being just a wife.

876
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,425
I'm sorry, it's...

877
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,311
It's hard to explain.

878
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,263
But the closer it gets to going,
the more I think...

879
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,664
I don't know why
I'm putting his dreams before mine.

880
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,623
You can get that bloody thing
out of here right now!

881
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,869
I could always carry you.

882
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,511
Grandpapa, grandpapa, grandpapa!

883
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,145
(APPLAUSE)

884
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,870
MAN: Well done, well done, sir!

885
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:01,660
Winston, Nicholas and Emma
have been making biscuits all afternoon.

886
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,591
How delicious!

887
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,260
Did you make them yourself?

888
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,861
Yes.

889
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,300
- Who put all the sugar in?
- I did.

890
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,660
You did? Good man.

891
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,260
- And who cracked the eggs?
- Me.

892
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,460
Wow!

893
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,984
Mrs Lacey, you're out of a job.

894
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,622
Come on, if you could all take your seats.

895
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,620
- Oh, God.
- Let me help.

896
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,860
I hope we're not watching
Wuthering Heights.

897
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,109
ALL: No.

898
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,749
Alright everyone, lights out.

899
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,821
Where's Millie?

900
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,748
Jock, can you see where she is?

901
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,780
CHURCHILL: What's this one about, then?

902
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,300
It's about an old clock
which keeps breaking down.

903
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,740
Is it called Winston?

904
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,785
(LAUGHTER)

905
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,180
Miss Appleyard.

906
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,260
The Prime Minister's asking
for you downstairs.

907
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,460
Is something wrong?

908
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,983
No, he wants you to watch the film
with the family.

909
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,944
You can stop working for a moment.

910
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,585
You're one to talk.

911
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,782
- ON FILM: Oh...
- Sorry, darling.

912
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,390
Is it really serious?

913
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,427
Do you think you can fix it?

914
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,740
I don't know, I can try. It'll take hours.

915
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,308
Ambrose, Ambrose wait a minute!

916
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,625
Good night, Lady Churchill.

917
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,830
(HE SINGS INCOHERENTLY
'I'M FOREVER BLOWING BUBBLES')

918
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,067
Oh, God...

919
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,582
What happened?

920
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,140
I need to go to London!

921
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,460
Sir, please, sir, you need
to go back to bed now!

922
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,420
...don't do yourself! I need to go to London,
I need to go, I need to see, to see it...

923
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,221
Just let me help you.

924
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,070
Was I, was I talking rubbish then?

925
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,907
A bit.

926
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:17,310
There is no need to tell my wife.

927
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,581
Nor that defeatist quack of mine.

928
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,021
Growing old is not for cowards.

929
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,340
It's certainly not.

930
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:40,585
Such a strange thing to happen
to a little boy.

931
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,948
Have you nursed many people
at the end, Minnie?

932
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,622
Yes, I have.

933
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,068
What scares me is
getting to the end before I finish.

934
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,100
L'Attaque. What's that one?

935
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,100
That's my colonel.

936
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,460
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is, I've got two

937
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,824
and it beats your captain.

938
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,500
Just keep it still.

939
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,908
L'Attaque.

940
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,900
It's a bomb, so bye bye.

941
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,660
What's next, Jock?

942
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,900
Next is a report on
the safety of helicopters.

943
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,780
Not safe, that's obvious.

944
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,900
- That's what the report's addressing.
- Hmm.

945
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,740
- Use your left.
- No.

946
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,020
L'Attaque.

947
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,860
- That's just a scout.
- Better, Winston.

948
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,666
CHURCHILL: Bye bye.

949
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,940
I will leave a precis of the report
in the box overnight.

950
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,621
Thank you, Jock.

951
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,620
There's no point in rushing succession
with Eden ill.

952
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,780
If that's the case, then you'll have
no choice but to continue.

953
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,460
Quite right.

954
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,540
Circumstances may well convince me

955
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,541
of my indispensability.

956
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,780
L'Attaque!

957
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,701
That's a bomb, bye bye.

958
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,343
- Morning, Rab.
- Jock.

959
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,380
How was Greece? I see you got a tan.

960
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,301
It's difficult being in Eden's company
and not getting a tan.

961
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,026
- When's he due back in England?
- A week or so.

962
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,660
- Ooh!
- Ah!

963
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,831
Outmanoeuvred by a 5-year-old!

964
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,460
- No, use your left hand.
- CLEMENTINE: Use your left.

965
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,902
Left hand, Papa.

966
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,780
That was a silly shot, grandpa.

967
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,820
Be quiet.

968
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,980
RAB:
Will Winston be well enough for Margate?

969
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,105
The party wants a public coronation.

970
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,420
"The King is dead, long live the King",
you know, that sort of thing.

971
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,421
But he's not dead,
he's making good progress.

972
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,580
Some days he's stronger
than others, of course.

973
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,911
He doesn't have to dance and sing,
just pass on the crown.

974
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,950
And there's his pride, Rab, he doesn't
want to be seen in a wheelchair.

975
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,900
CHURCHILL: Foul ball, Nicholas,
take the shot again.

976
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,501
That's not fair!

977
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,980
Ah, here's the real enemy, Nicholas.

978
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,787
I hope you don't think of me
as an enemy, Prime Minister.

979
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,350
I don't think of you at all, Rab.

980
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,940
How's my Foreign Secretary?

981
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,260
- Fighting fit.
- Jolly good.

982
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:29,420
I expect you were disappointed
not to find me ranting in a storm

983
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,387
like King Lear with a lisp.

984
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,460
All I wish is that your health
improves quickly, Prime Minister.

985
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,391
CHURCHILL: I wish that too.

986
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,900
Pick up the ball, Nicholas.

987
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,867
Nicholas, why don't you let grandpa do it?

988
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,588
What?

989
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,110
Oh, alright...

990
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,220
- Prime Minister...
- No, no, no, no, please!

991
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,390
MILLIE: Just let him try.

992
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,108
Get his stick.

993
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,820
Back.

994
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,262
Now...

995
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,302
Look at that, lovely.

996
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,785
Emma's turn now.

997
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,027
Very sad.

998
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,460
I want you to stop this pretence
that you can go on forever.

999
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,900
I have one more task, Clemmy.

1000
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,180
Oh, Winston!

1001
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,060
There's always one more thing.

1002
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,780
I can try to make those terrible bombs
obsolete before I die.

1003
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,066
Everyone else has gone,
I'm the only one left.

1004
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,340
Can't my last victory be one of peace?

1005
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,820
It's time to stop.

1006
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,420
- My darling Clemmy...
- Don't "darling" me.

1007
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,260
I want time with you
while you're still you.

1008
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,740
While I'm still me.

1009
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,460
The children need time with you.

1010
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,060
They're not children anymore.

1011
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,503
They are desperate for you.

1012
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,900
I begged you to retire after the war.
You only stopped because they voted you out.

1013
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,540
The people didn't understand.

1014
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,900
The people were exhausted!
So was I, and I am now.

1015
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,661
Clemmy...

1016
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,261
Clemmy...

1017
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,470
You asked me once
who was in the photograph by his bed.

1018
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,507
The little girl.

1019
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,065
Her name was Marigold.

1020
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,510
It's Marigold's song he's been singing.

1021
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:18,067
Diana taught her the words
and she was so proud of remembering them.

1022
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,509
She died just before her third birthday.

1023
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,789
She'd had a cold all summer.

1024
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,502
What child doesn't have
a summer cold, Millie?

1025
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,502
But...

1026
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,223
it wasn't cold, it was septicaemia.

1027
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,590
And I wasn't there.

1028
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,744
They were at the seaside
with their governess.

1029
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,543
By the time we got to her...

1030
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,550
It was too late to do anything.

1031
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:06,987
Winston and I sat
with her for... two days.

1032
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,265
Neither of us slept.

1033
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,344
We sang nursery rhymes with her
and told her stories.

1034
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,661
He'd never had the time
to tell her stories before.

1035
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,380
At the end...

1036
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,510
she asked me to sing that song.

1037
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,262
And I did.

1038
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,106
But she stopped me.

1039
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,542
She was tired, she said.

1040
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,790
Then... she asked me
to finish it in the morning.

1041
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,345
But that was it.

1042
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,470
Her last breath is in that song.

1043
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,701
We never talk about it.

1044
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,064
We never talk about her.

1045
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,263
(CLEMENTINE WAILS)

1046
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,181
Do you like Henley?

1047
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,270
He was Stephenson's model
for Long John Silver.

1048
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,662
- I bet you didn't know that.
- I did.

1049
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,902
He was my father's favourite poet.

1050
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,426
What does your father do?

1051
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,063
He was a shop steward at the pits.

1052
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:51,588
And he was no fan of yours, not since
you sent the army in on the Welsh miners.

1053
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,146
Well, at least he's got
good taste in poets.

1054
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,905
This one's his favourite.

1055
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,910
He wrote it just before
having his leg cut off.

1056
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,943
It's about hope.

1057
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,388
"Out of the night that covers me"

1058
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,263
"black as a pit from pole to pole"

1059
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,307
"I thank whatever Gods may be"

1060
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,830
"for my unconquerable soul."

1061
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,830
Millie... I need some hope.

1062
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,628
Good, that's good, well done.

1063
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,300
And another, not too fast, you're fine.

1064
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,062
Just keep your weight on me.

1065
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,981
There you go.

1066
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,741
Winston?

1067
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,828
Good.

1068
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,667
Good.

1069
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,790
I'm going to take my hands away now.

1070
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:32,380
Dickens used to walk from his home in Kent
to London almost every week.

1071
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,460
- Did you know that?
- No.

1072
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,062
I did, my dad told me that.

1073
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,420
Her father's a sort
of literary trade unionist.

1074
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,749
- If such a thing is possi... oh!
- Oh!

1075
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,060
Are you alright?

1076
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,220
Yes, I am.

1077
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,663
- Does it hurt?
- No.

1078
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,231
- Let's try slowly.
- Alright.

1079
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,464
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1080
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,064
Here, lean on the stick, that's right.

1081
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,221
Okay, one, two, three, and...

1082
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,311
- Let's get the wheelchair.
- No wheelchair!

1083
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:13,910
I'm not being carried into the party
conference looking like a bloody maharajah.

1084
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,660
EDEN: What was Winston's mood like
when you were last with him?

1085
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,308
RAB: Winstonian, as you would expect.

1086
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,620
But physically,
he knows he can't carry on.

1087
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,980
I mean, he can barely get out of his
wheelchair and pick up a croquet ball.

1088
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,860
I think he'll be relieved.

1089
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,980
You'll have to be firm with him.

1090
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,627
Of course.

1091
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,702
We've waited long enough, Anthony.

1092
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,268
MILLIE: Here you go.

1093
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,060
Jock, bring me an unfinished canvas.

1094
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,980
I want Anthony to think
I've been doing this all afternoon.

1095
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,220
Where shall I hide the wheelchair?

1096
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,260
Put it right here, next to me.

1097
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,220
Get rid of that chair.

1098
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,231
Thank you.

1099
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,380
I didn't know you painted so much.

1100
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,142
My great distraction, Millie.

1101
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,780
Did you know that Turner
painted better the worse his eyes got?

1102
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,109
So there's hope for you yet.

1103
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,700
JOCK: They're here.

1104
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,347
Good luck.

1105
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,980
- Rab.
- Jock.

1106
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,581
Hello, Anthony.

1107
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,543
After you.

1108
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,060
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

1109
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,940
Anthony, my boy

1110
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,590
thank you for driving down, come take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

1111
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,426
Come on.

1112
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,620
It lifts my heart to see you
out and about again, Anthony.

1113
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,949
Thank you, Winston.

1114
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,540
We were very concerned.

1115
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,020
Well, we were concerned about you

1116
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,140
and it's encouraging to see you
not confined to bed anymore.

1117
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,107
July and August
can't have been easy for you.

1118
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:02,660
I did not enjoy July, but in August,
I believe we beat the Australians.

1119
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,780
By eight wickets, I hear.

1120
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,590
For the first time in years,
the Ashes will remain at home.

1121
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,467
Like you?

1122
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,260
- We should talk about Margate.
- Well, yes, of course.

1123
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:22,663
Now, I'll understand if, due to your
grave illness, you wish to step down.

1124
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,820
Margate might be a good time
to make the announcement.

1125
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,700
If that's what you're thinking of doing.

1126
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,540
Winston, that's not
what I was thinking of doing.

1127
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,064
Oh, well, as you were then,
Anthony, you and I.

1128
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:40,420
PM and Foreign Secretary, the best team.

1129
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,660
So in other words, Winston,
you got me all the way down to Kent

1130
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,100
to tell me you wish to continue?

1131
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,828
Beautiful countryside, isn't it?

1132
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,180
He has no intention of resigning at all.

1133
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,380
He even asked if I was going to resign
at Margate because of my own health.

1134
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,620
Did he stand while you were with him?

1135
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,540
- No.
- Well, then.

1136
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,064
What Winston intends to do
is no longer important.

1137
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,622
I thought Anthony
was looking well, if a bit thin.

1138
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:40,983
Clemmy, if I'm wrong
and I can't get through Margate

1139
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,545
then I'm all yours.

1140
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,224
That's my promise.

1141
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,886
If I fall, there's nowhere I want to fall

1142
01:26:51,986 --> 01:26:54,989
except in your arms.

1143
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,660
You've made promises
to me before, darling.

1144
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,547
I... I know, but...

1145
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,705
And broken them.

1146
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,906
But not anymore.

1147
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,345
Margate, then.

1148
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,380
Jock, are all three suitcases in the car?

1149
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,871
Yes they are. We need to get going,
Lady Churchill, it's two hours to Margate.

01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,748
Come in.

1152
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,029
Sir, did you climb the stairs?

1153
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,660
Don't fuss.

01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:58,662
I know, I know it's part of being a nurse.

1155
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,583
Tell me, when are you sailing?

1156
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,140
Er, on Friday. I've got two days
in Yorkshire with my mum and dad.

1157
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,391
Oh, yes, take a brolly.

1158
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,349
I couldn't have got through this
without you, Millie.

1159
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,105
I've written in it.

1160
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,302
"I thank whatever Gods may be

1162
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,941

1163
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,991
I will treasure it.

1164
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:04,666
Well, I hope this very gloomy looking
young man knows how to treasure you.

1165
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,022
He does.

1166
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,227
I hope so.

1167
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,780
Thank you, Mrs Lacey.

1168
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,420
I say with great pleasure that I hope
not to see you again in a long time.

you're saying such grand farewells.

01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,020
but I toned it down when I passed it on.

1174
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,820
Rab suggests you might deliver your speech
sitting on a high stool.

1175

Onward!

Last month, we did not have
quite so big a surplus in our balance...

1178
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,749
but in fact, things were a little better
than I had anticipated.

01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,988
It's certainly of interest
to me, the exchequer.

Oh, switch that off, will you?

01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,148
The Tories, Russians

1201
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,870
even death itself.

1202
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,822
Come on.

1203
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,260
RAB: Working together,
achieving these new settlements

1204
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,067
for public finances,
for our financial services

1205
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,220
and for fairness in Europe
will help us secure...

1206
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,540
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

1207
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,187
...for us all.

1208
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,620
I thought I might just
sum up what I feel...

1209
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:38,191
No-one expects a long speech, if you feel you
can't get through it, just cut to the end.

1210
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,620
...and I look forward over
the coming years to working with you

1211
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,940
to make that happen.

1212
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,587
(APPLAUSE)

1213
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,860
Do you mind?

1214
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,461
Of course.

1215
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,540
And so I have great pleasure
in welcoming to conference

1216
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:59,980
the Prime Minister, and leader
of the Conservative and Unionist Party

1217
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,700
Sir Winston Churchill.

1218
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,586
(APPLAUSE)

1219
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:39,866
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

1220
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,784
had the United States
taken before the First World War,

1221
01:35:02,884 --> 01:35:05,340
or between the wars

1222
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,504
the same interest
and made the same sacrifices

1223
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,949
then there might never have
been a first war

1224
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,431
and there would certainly
never have been a second.

1225
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,688
With her mighty aid,

1226
01:35:23,788 --> 01:35:29,180
I have a sure hope,
there will not be a third.

1227
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,225
(APPLAUSE)

1228
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,900
I'm sure you would be
relieved by the new...

1229
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,342
(HE STAMMERS)

1230
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,702
By the...

1231
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,391
By the news from British Guiana.

1232
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,063
(HE STAMMERS)

1233
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,860
I don't often do that.

1234
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,100
(LAUGHTER)

1235
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,429
Well, not at conference anyway.

1236
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,061
One word personally about myself.

1237
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:49,667
If I stay on for the time being,
bearing the burden at my age

1238
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,780
it is not because of
love of power or office.

1239
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,860
I've had an ample share of both.

1240
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,214
If I stay, it is because

1241
01:37:01,314 --> 01:37:05,013
I have a feeling that I may,

1242
01:37:05,113 --> 01:37:07,340
through things that have happened

1243
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:12,150
have an influence on
what I care about above all else

1244
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:19,660
the building of a sure and lasting peace.

1245
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,307
(APPLAUSE)

1246
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,780
Let us then go forward together

1247
01:37:53,880 --> 01:38:00,740
with courage and composure,
with resolution and good faith

1248
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:04,506
to the end which all desire.
