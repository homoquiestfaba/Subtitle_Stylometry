1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,264
Today, people, we are
privileged to have with us

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,392
a former Labor Cabinet Minister
and leader of the House of Lords,

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,812
a Knight of the Garter
and Seventh Earl of Longford

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,315
who's come to talk to us
about a book he's just written

5
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,567
entitled, "Saints."

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,111
Frank Packenham, Lord Longford,
welcome to the show.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,821
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,908
So many questions to ask you,
such a long and distinguished career,

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,786
but I'm gonna start with the book.
What prompted you to write it?

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,413
As a lifelong Christian
and scholar,

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,584
I've always been interested
in ideas of sanctity.

12
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,462
But more than that,
I think it was probably

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,174
the entirely selfish desire to spend
a little time with my heroes.

14
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,927
- Your heroes?
- Yes, that's what the saints are...

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,264
my heroes, friends,
intercessors.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,393
Interesting. Right,
the time has just gone 2:15.

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,145
The subject is "Saints."
We're gonna take some calls.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,274
David, you're through
to Lord Longford.

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,568
What's your question
about the saints?

20
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,070
Actually, my question
isn't about the saints.

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,780
I want to know how
your esteemed guest

22
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,824
can look himself
in the mirror each morning.

23
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,994
I'm assuming this is
a question about Myra Hindley.

24
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,579
Yes, it is.
How could you rub salt

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,455
in the wounds of
the families like that?

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,958
A man in your position
fraternizing and campaigning

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,334
on behalf of that monster?

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,503
I certainly take exception
to that description,

29
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,006
but I made it quite clear
before coming on the program

30
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,508
that I wouldn't be talking
about Myra Hindley today.

31
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,970
Of course. Next caller is Judy
who's in Sheppey.

32
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,889
You're through
to Lord Longford.

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,640
My call is also
about Ms. Hindley.

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,143
In view of everything
we now know about it,

35
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,687
don't you regret having
supported her all that time?

36
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,857
Once again, madam, I'm afraid I must
decline to answer questions about her.

37
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,985
It's a simple answer,
Lord Longford... yes or no.

38
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,654
Do you regret it?

39
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,587
The Pennine Moorlands,

40
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,673
scene of one of the most intensive
murder hunts of the century.

41
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,884
Police and hundreds
of volunteers

42
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,513
continue their gruesome search
for the bodies of murder victims,

43
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,098
working on a scant tip-off
that the bleak moors

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,435
hide the evidence
of a mass murderer.

45
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,858
And late on Saturday afternoon
they found the body

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,070
of 10-year-old
Lesley Downey,

47
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,280
face down
in a shallow grave.

48
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,369
Five days later,
another body was discovered.

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,705
...been identified as
that of John Kilbride,

50
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,707
the 12-year-old boy
who disappeared

51
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,085
from his Manchester home
nearly two years ago.

52
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,881
I'm standing outside
number 16

53
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,758
Wardle Brook Avenue,
Hattersley,

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,427
where earlier today police
arrested a man and a woman

55
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,305
after finding the body
of a 17-year-old boy,

56
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,558
Edward Evans.

57
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,894
Police have now released
the names of the suspects.

58
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,231
They are Ian Brady,
a 28-year-old clerk,

59
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,693
and Myra Hindley,
his 23-year-old girlfriend.

60
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,032
Hindley, who said that
she had a sore throat,

61
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,535
gave her evidence
in a low, husky voice.

62
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,662
She said that she
had loved Brady

63
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,539
and still loved him.

64
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,750
When she was cross-examined about her
part in the nude photographing session

65
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,919
with the child
Lesley Ann Downey,

66
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,797
she said, "I offer
no defense for that.

67
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,757
It was indefensible
and cruel."

68
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,178
She said she didn't know that Brady
was tape-recording the session

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,264
and that she was ashamed
when she heard the tape played later.

70
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,933
Extra police were
called in to keep the peace.

71
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,270
The parents of other missing Manchester
children were outside the court.

72
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,106
- Hanging's too good for them.
- This was too quick.

73
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,609
He wants to torture them.

74
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,777
A tooth for a tooth
and a life for a life.

75
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,363
...head sank as she heard
the foreman of the jury

76
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,116
speak the word "guilty"
the first time.

77
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,995
"These were three calculated,
cruel and cold-blooded murders,"

78
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,456
was what Mr. Justice
Fenton Atkinson said.

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,667
Sentencing them both
to life imprisonment,

80
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,379
the judge said quietly,
"Put them down."

81
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,316
From time to time,

82
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,485
people are kind enough
to ask me what I consider

83
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,403
to be my greatest
achievement in life,

84
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,239
and I always answer
the same way.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,825
I say, "It is that
I visit prisoners."

86
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,994
Congratulations, Roy.

87
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,829
And if I were to die tonight,

88
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,999
it is the very first thing
I would say to St. Peter

89
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,334
if he were remotely
interested.

90
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,503
Morning, Barry.

91
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,173
But some of my greatest
and most-valued friendships

92
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,009
have begun
with prison visits.

93
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,681
And much of what I've learned,
I owe to prison visits.

94
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,601
Dennis here, for example,
has taught me the workings

95
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,020
of the diesel engine.

96
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,022
Priceless information...

97
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,526
even though I do not drive.

98
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,737
and Michael here
has taught me Gaelic.

99
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,533
And together we have studied
some of Ireland's finest poetry.

100
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,119
And I thank you
for that, Michael.

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,246
And Roy here,

102
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,874
whose release we are
celebrating today,

103
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:36,044
has taught me that it is never too
late to take up something new

104
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,213
and to still master it.

105
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,884
Having never so much as picked
up a brush before the age of 30,

106
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,762
he is this year to be shown
at the Royal Academy.

107
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,645
In fact, I have
an example of that here,

108
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,439
which has just been
presented to me.

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,733
It's a very fine
piece of work.

110
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,945
I think you could've chosen
a rather more attractive subject, Roy,

111
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,655
and you flatter me
a great deal.

112
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,824
Thank you very much.

113
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,291
Might I have a word?

114
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,918
- Yes, of course.
- In private.

115
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,503
Yes, of course.

116
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,132
Excuse me.

117
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:26,261
I just had a phone call
from the governor of Holloway Prison.

118
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,264
So what did
Ann Tree want?

119
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,518
Oh, the mighty Tree.

120
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,605
There's a prisoner in Holloway
who specifically asked to see me.

121
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,815
As long as it's not
Myra Hindley.

122
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,318
As a matter of fact,
it is.

123
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,957
You're not going to go?

124
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,834
Of course.

125
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,461
I can't sit on the board
of a prison-visiting charity

126
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,463
and start drawing lines.

127
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,465
Yes, you can.

128
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,509
Frank, that woman's inhuman.

129
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,512
She's... she's a monster.

130
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,306
She murdered innocent
young children.

131
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,975
We don't even
know how many.

132
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,853
But as a prisoner, she's still
perfectly entitled to be visited.

133
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,355
Yes, but not
necessarily by you.

134
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:24,236
Look, you know I've always
supported your penal work,

135
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,989
but there are some crimes,
some people that are...

136
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,658
What?
Unforgivable.

137
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,952
Oh, come along, you know
what I feel about that.

138
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,538
No human being is
beyond forgiveness.

139
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,499
Condemn people from our armchairs
and what have we become?

140
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,813
Frank, stay behind
a moment, will you?

141
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,316
Yes, of course,
Prime Minister.

142
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,865
I read in the paper
you threw a party for a murderer

143
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,408
in the House
of Lords yesterday.

144
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,035
A released murderer,
Prime Minister,

145
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,454
who's paid his debt to society
and is now free.

146
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,789
Still made
the headlines.

147
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,833
Wrong sort
of headlines.

148
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,879
I understand your charitable
and philanthropic work is important,

149
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,757
but holding this government together
is important to me.

150
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
You've a habit of doing this,
haven't you?

151
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,763
Attracting
unfortunate headlines.

152
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,641
I remember you asking

153
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,227
your country to forgive
the Germans after the war.

154
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,145
They were starving,
Prime Minister.

155
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,439
But so were we.
It was 1947.

156
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,779
There's an endearing
childlike quality about you, Frank.

157
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,741
But no one wants
children in cabinet.

158
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,247
I made you leader of the Lords
on the recommendation of Clem Attlee.

159
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,835
And so far, you've done
little to justify his faith.

160
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,588
But, you have a talent...

161
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,925
Which I will utilize.

162
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,094
And then he came up
with this report...

163
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,096
well, not a report,
more of an investigation.

164
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,682
He wants me to look
into young people nationwide,

165
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,434
focusing on education,
homelessness, criminality.

166
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,604
But you'd do that wonderfully.
I can't think of anyone better.

167
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:26,275
Under normal circumstances, perhaps,
but this is clearly a poisoned chalice.

168
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,944
Half the inquiry would
come under the auspices of Education,

169
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,362
and half under
the Home Office.

170
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,281
Oh, I shouldn't have
come out tonight.

171
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,283
- Don't be silly.
- Love to you.

172
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,827
Look, there's that lady
from "The Sunday Times"

173
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,829
who wrote those lovely
things about you.

174
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,455
Oh?

175
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,541
Do you remember
how much you liked her?

176
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,377
Oh, yes.

177
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,422
Hello.
Very nice to see you.

178
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,967
I'd like you to clear
an afternoon for me

179
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,011
in the next couple
of weeks.

180
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,762
- How's the 21st?
- You have a meeting at 4:00

181
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,139
with the Home Secretary.

182
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,057
- 28th?
- Better.

183
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,976
I can move that one.

184
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,145
Good,
let's go for the 28th.

185
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,156
- What shall I put down?
- Hmm?

186
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,325
Oh, just put "prison visit."

187
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,672
Bernadette Collins?

188
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,800
Susan Davis?

189
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,512
Helen Kroger?

190
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,516
Ethel G?

191
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,267
Myra Hindley?

192
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,992
Susanna Smit?
Rita Williams?

193
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,439
Ms. Hindley?

194
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,401
I do beg your pardon,
madam.

195
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,253
I think it's me
you're looking for.

196
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,130
Myra Hindley?

197
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,307
Got rid of the peroxide
before the trial.

198
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,559
It was blue at the trial
for most of it,

199
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,352
and then red
for the sentencing.

200
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,855
Apparently it
counted against me.

201
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,940
It showed I had
no remorse.

202
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,693
I wasn't aware
of a correlation

203
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,654
between hair color
and contrition.

204
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,948
Nor me.

205
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,783
I'm very pleased
to meet you.

206
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:26,663
Never met a Lord before.
What should I call you?

207
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,874
M'lord?
Your grace?

208
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,294
- You must call me Frank.
- All right. Frank.

209
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,172
They put me in this
table in the corner

210
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,717
'cause it helps protect me
from the lip readers.

211
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,012
So, you specifically
asked to see me.

212
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,514
What can I do for you?

213
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,682
I want to see Ian Brady.

214
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,352
I see.

215
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,354
Although
we weren't married,

216
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,689
we were together for six years,
which I believe

217
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,775
makes us common-law
husband and wife,

218
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,027
and therefore entitled
to see one another

219
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,738
just like
married prisoners.

220
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,491
Well, if that's
what you desire,

221
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,160
of course I will do
all I can to help you.

222
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,913
But I have to say,
even though I'm not your solicitor,

223
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,581
I don't think
it's a good idea.

224
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,416
Why not?

225
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,169
Because whatever it is you wish
to achieve by seeing him,

226
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,505
it will almost
certainly elude you.

227
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,633
If it's private conversation
or intimate contact you're after,

228
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,510
you won't get it.
You'll be surrounded

229
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,595
by prison officers
and guards at all times.

230
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,349
Then there's the question
of public reaction.

231
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,352
Were the press to get hold
of it, they'd have a field day.

232
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,146
It might have a profoundly
detrimental effect

233
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,232
on any future
chances of parole.

234
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,778
Parole?

235
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,947
Lord Longford, have you
forgotten who I am?

236
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,241
They'll never
give me parole.

237
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,951
Why ever not?

238
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,537
As I recall, the judge
made a distinction

239
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,372
between your case
and Mr. Brady's.

240
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,710
Although he sentenced him
for the rest of his natural life,

241
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,046
he made it quite clear that
in your case, it could be reviewed.

242
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,133
Now the average
life sentence

243
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,844
is currently 21 years.

244
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,849
Parole can be applied for
after a third of that time.

245
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,811
So you can make your
first application...

246
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,063
six years from now.

247
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,441
Are you serious?

248
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,401
Perfectly serious.

249
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,695
God.

250
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,488
So my advice would be

251
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,450
that you put some distance
between yourself and Mr. Brady.

252
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,871
I gave that man everything...

253
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:35,292
my heart, my soul,

254
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,002
my life.

255
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,837
Indeed,
if I may say so,

256
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,006
at some personal cost
to yourself.

257
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,176
You're right.

258
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,470
What a pretty smile
you have.

259
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,930
What?

260
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,349
I said
what a pretty smile.

261
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,435
That's the first kind thing
anyone's said to me in months.

262
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,978
It's true.

263
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,856
As a matter of fact,
your entire appearance

264
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,443
and demeanor is quite different
to what I expected.

265
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:05,239
Of course, all I had to go on
was that police photograph.

266
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,868
The Medusa.
That's what I call it.

267
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,246
No one looks their best
at 4:00 in the morning

268
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,665
having been questioned
for nine hours straight, do they?

269
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,376
Five minutes!

270
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,962
So, is there anything
I can send you

271
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,130
that would make things
more comfortable?

272
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,967
Books and music.

273
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,677
Anything in particular?

274
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,471
I like jazz
and the Goons.

275
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,182
Ian and I used
to listen to them a lot.

276
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,851
I'll see
what I can do.

277
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,645
In the meantime, I suggest
you get a family member

278
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,647
to put aside half a pound
a week or so.

279
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,317
- What for?
- When you come out.

280
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,361
You really think
I will one day?

281
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,405
Yes, of course.

282
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,493
When will you come again?

283
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,496
When you ask me.
Prison visitors never visit prisoners

284
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,206
unless they're invited.

285
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,835
Well, you'll hear
from me soon then.

286
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,087
Good.

287
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,675
Delighted to have
met you, Ms. Hindley.

288
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,510
You too, Frank.

289
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,846
Bye-bye.

290
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,236
Anyway, she wasn't at all
how I might've expected.

291
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,740
I've found her charming,
intelligent, attractive even.

292
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,283
Ahem.

293
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,745
A woman that murdered
three children?

294
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:38,290
A woman who came under the spell
of a man who murdered three children.

295
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,043
- That's rubbish.
- I spoke to the prison governor.

296
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,922
She's quite convinced that Myra Hindley
was corrupted by Ian Brady

297
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,050
and to consider them
as equals is a great mistake.

298
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,469
Dada, except that she
procured those children,

299
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,638
knowing exactly what
would happen to them.

300
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,557
Never would've got into the car
without a woman present.

301
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,768
The judge made a clear
distinction at the trial

302
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,270
that Ian Brady was the initiator
of these crimes

303
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,897
and the actual killer.

304
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,983
Myra Hindley was merely a dominated
and corrupted accomplice.

305
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,069
The distinction's irrelevant...
murderer and accomplice

306
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,904
are equally guilty
in the eyes of the law.

307
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:12,241
Killers of this kind almost always
have a prior history of offending.

308
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,451
Myra Hindley had nothing,
not even a blemish.

309
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,412
- and wasn't there a tape?
- what tape?

310
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,623
At the trial. I seem to remember
there was a tape

311
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,709
where one heard the dreadful things
they did to the little girl,

312
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,420
and that it was Myra Hindley's voice
one could hear.

313
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:30,342
- Not Brady's.
- No. What about a swim?

314
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,095
Yes, please, grandpa.

315
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,348
Please, Mommy,
a swim, a swim!

316
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,645
I think
it's clearing up.

317
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,984
"Dear Frank,

318
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,612
thanks again for your visit,

319
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,489
for the books you sent me.

320
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:56,285
I finished the first volume
of your autobiography."

321
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,245
- How old are you then?
- 17.

322
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,663
"It's an interesting life
you have had."

323
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,790
You look younger to me.

324
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,460
"So many conversions...

325
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,421
from English to Irish;

326
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,257
from conservative
to socialist;

327
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,634
from Protestant
to Catholic.

328
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,220
I don't know
if you're aware,

329
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:19,183
but as a teenager I converted
to the Catholic church too."

330
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,852
"Dear Myra,

331
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,647
I had no idea that you had
converted to Catholicism too.

332
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,150
How fascinating.

333
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,902
What a coincidence."

334
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,654
- May I?
- Mmm-hmm.

335
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,742
As a young man, I wasn't
much interested in God.

336
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,577
Quite the opposite.

337
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,079
This one day I was
just overwhelmed

338
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,831
by the sheer pointlessness

339
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,001
of an existence without
the prospect of an afterlife.

340
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:50,339
That's when I realized
that without a religious dimension,

341
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,466
there was little
meaning to life."

342
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,847
How's your spiritual
life now?

343
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:03,352
I don't go to church anymore
if that's what you're asking.

344
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,231
That all stopped when
I started seeing Ian...

345
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,527
Along with everything else
that was good in my life.

346
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,367
It's too powerful...

347
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,787
a magnetlike
personality.

348
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:26,375
He demolished everything
I believed in.

349
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,003
I was obsessed.

350
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,675
Next time you have a moment,
try going back to church.

351
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,302
You might be
pleasantly surprised.

352
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,973
In my experience, it's the prisoners
with the strongest faith

353
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,434
that cope best.

354
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:48,564
Just imagine what Ian
would say to that.

355
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,943
He thinks God is for nutters.

356
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,863
Does he?
Well, I beg to differ.

357
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,449
"Dear Frank,

358
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,743
the Catholic priest that
visits us here is German...

359
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,329
Father Kahle.

360
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,290
He says Mass here
twice a week,

361
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,584
and last week I told him
I might be looking

362
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,627
to find a way back
to the church."

363
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,255
"The report in its entirety,

364
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,341
will cover youth activity..."

365
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,344
"He's given me the divine
office to read every day,

366
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,430
and the Penny Catechism."

367
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,600
"Ah, the Penny Catechism.

368
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,228
You might also consider reading
'The Confessions of St. Augustine,'

369
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,481
which are
particularly good."

370
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,776
"Anyway, Father Kahle
thinks I have made progress

371
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,822
and we are not far away from the day
when I can make a full confession."

372
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,325
"How wonderful.

373
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,035
Be sure to tell me
what day it is

374
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,287
that I might pray
for you myself."

375
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,331
What's that,
Lord Longford?

376
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:51,460
Uh, this is
the much-anticipated

377
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,212
Youth Report
which I'm delivering

378
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,465
- to the Prime Minister today.
- How long have you been working on it?

379
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,842
I've been working
on it for 18 months.

380
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,097
Any further questions?

381
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,393
Very good.

382
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,062
Bye.

383
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,734
Oh, Frank, yesterday I finished
reading St. Augustine.

384
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:21,281
The way he rejected his former life
and sinfulness...

385
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,827
Afterwards, I lay
in my cell unable to sleep,

386
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,038
my head was spinning so.

387
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,751
Every fiber in my body
seems to want to resist this,

388
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,547
yet a part of me cannot deny
it feels so good too.

389
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,177
I just keep hearing
Ian's voice in my head

390
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,305
mocking me for my hypocrisy
and my insincerity.

391
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,184
I wouldn't worry about that.

392
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,156
Lord Longford, the Prime
Minister will see you now.

393
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,200
Oh, thank you very much.

394
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,211
- Prime Minister.
- Sit down, Frank.

395
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,593
I'm gonna come
straight to the point.

396
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:26,013
I want to give Shackleton a run
as leader of the House of Lords.

397
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,851
I see.

398
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,478
I want to thank you for everything
you've done for us, Frank.

399
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,731
You've done a terrific job
over the years.

400
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,443
But you've
reached an age now.

401
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,320
Shackleton's
a younger man.

402
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,158
It... it's nothing to do
with the report, is it?

403
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,994
What report?

404
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,873
The Youth Report,
Prime Minister,

405
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:55,250
that you
asked me to write.

406
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,793
No no no.

407
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,296
Nothing to do with that.

408
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,049
I just want to give
Shackleton a run.

409
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,343
As you know, we're right up
against it now.

410
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,345
Tories have
gained ground and...

411
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,305
you've gotta keep
moving in politics.

412
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,224
Fresh blood,
new faces.

413
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,184
New ideas.

414
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,632
Everyone's down
having breakfast.

415
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,014
Will you join us?

416
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:59,398
Nice pieces in the paper.

417
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,441
Yes.

418
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,068
People are being
very kind.

419
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,446
"The last remaining example
of a politician with principle."

420
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,161
I'll leave the post.

421
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,333
Not another one from Myra Hindley
by any chance?

422
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,670
Because I've noticed she's been
writing to you a lot recently.

423
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,798
Yes.

424
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,343
I've been working towards her return
to the Catholic church.

425
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,347
- Myra Hindley?
- Yes.

426
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,643
Anyway, it's not from Myra,
it's from somebody else.

427
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,211
Lord Longford.

428
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,255
Mr. Brady.

429
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,802
How good of you
not to disappoint.

430
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,806
It's wonderful, isn't it,
when people look

431
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,850
exactly as you imagine?

432
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,103
So this is my competition...

433
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,272
this is who
I'm up against.

434
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,526
Myra's new boyfriend.

435
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,655
She certainly
picks 'em, doesn't she?

436
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,409
I did a little bit of research
before our meeting.

437
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,912
I'd say there's
greater evidence of...

438
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:22,291
mental instability
in your past than mine.

439
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,420
Son and grandson
to military heroes,

440
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,672
you were invalided
out of the army

441
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,966
because of
a mental breakdown.

442
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,052
Was it the full
crack-up, I wonder...

443
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,929
or were you
just a coward?

444
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,641
What can I do
for you, Mr. Brady?

445
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,060
I'd like to find
my way back to God...

446
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,981
Lord Longford.

447
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,025
Will you help me?

448
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:51,069
Why, certainly,
if that's what you...

449
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,031
Don't you fuckin' dare.
You start with that pious mumbo-jumbo,

450
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,533
I will jump across that table
and bite out your tongue.

451
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,828
No. This present visit is
for your benefit, not mine.

452
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,415
I want to tell you
about Myra,

453
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:07,419
who you no doubt believe is sincere
in her religious conversion.

454
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,090
Let me tell you,
that woman...

455
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,884
cares no more about God

456
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:17,221
than she cares about
the piles in my ass.

457
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,849
What she cares about...

458
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,643
is getting out.

459
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:26,021
And she thinks
you'll help her.

460
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,357
But the minute
your back is turned...

461
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,360
she mocks you...

462
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,946
for your silly hair

463
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:37,199
and... and your clothes

464
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,868
and your "self-important
autobiographies

465
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,288
only published because his family
owns a bloody publishing house."

466
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,878
What?

467
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,548
She didn't tell you
she was still writing to me?

468
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,801
No.

469
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,553
Oh dear.

470
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,181
She probably
didn't tell you

471
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,684
she was fucking that little
prison officer either...

472
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,227
a nun.

473
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,319
They do it under the bed
in her cell, apparently.

474
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,073
Four times a day.

475
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,451
She has a very high
sex drive, our Myra.

476
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,373
It's the sort of detail you might
want about your new girlfriend.

477
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,125
She needs it
all the time.

478
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,252
Like a man
in that way.

479
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,922
Like a man
in other ways too.

480
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,259
She's strong.

481
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,430
That came in handy,
as you can imagine...

482
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,018
when they were wriggling
and trying to get away.

483
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,062
Wait, you can't go yet.
I haven't finished with you.

484
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,816
Take my advice,

485
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,110
go back to your
other prisoners...

486
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:59,198
nice, uncomplicated ones
with broken noses

487
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,450
and knuckle tattoos.

488
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,163
Stay clear of Myra
because she will destroy you.

489
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,170
She certainly destroyed me.

490
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,466
And there... there's a thought
you've not had before:

491
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,220
that Myra
egged me on...

492
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:26,099
that without her, none of it
would have happened.

493
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,477
Wait. You're not yet
dismissed!

494
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,230
Listen to the tape,
that's my advice,

495
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,732
if you want to know
what she's really like.

496
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,069
And when you do listen,

497
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,862
bear this in mind...

498
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,615
it was her that insisted

499
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,576
they call us...
"Mommy!"

500
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,038
And "Daddy!"
Not me!

501
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,762
Are you
all right, sir?

502
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,850
Yes, all...
all right, yes.

503
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,110
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.

504
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,535
It's too late for church.
You're going straight to hell!

505
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,917
I'm going to fucking kill you,
you child-murdering bitch!

506
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,052
You fucking bitch!

507
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,871
Myra?

508
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:11,390
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

509
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,984
It has been many years
since my last confession.

510
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,866
It was so beautiful.

511
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,952
I gave my confession.

512
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,332
I told him everything
that had happened

513
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,293
and how sorry I was.

514
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,842
Then he put his hands on me
and gave me a blessing.

515
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,805
Then we went to Mass

516
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,891
and I was given
the Eucharist.

517
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,479
I cried afterwards.

518
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,027
I know it won't
change the past...

519
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,614
bring back those
poor children,

520
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:11,617
but at least I know in the eyes of God
I am forgiven.

521
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,332
Well, if you are
forgiven by God,

522
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,167
who are we to condemn you?

523
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,512
She's done well.

524
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,015
Better than any of us
imagined, frankly.

525
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,101
Father Kahle tells me
their talks are going well.

526
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,979
She's registered to do
an open university degree.

527
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,776
She treats the wardens
and her fellow prisoners

528
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,402
with courtesy.

529
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,905
And you really feel
it's sincere?

530
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,116
It's not some form
of compliance or act?

531
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:56,411
I visited Ian Brady and he
made certain suggestions.

532
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,790
Ian Brady's a psychopath.
I wouldn't believe a word he says.

533
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:03,293
Prison is a relentless,
24-hour experience.

534
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,962
It's impossible to hide.

535
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,547
Who you are,
what you think,

536
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,090
no matter
how hard you try,

537
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,677
it will always come out. Myra Hindley
has, from the very beginning,

538
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,762
been exposed
to extreme provocation

539
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,764
and bullying.

540
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,016
She's never once
behaved in anything

541
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,269
other than the most
exemplary fashion.

542
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:25,357
As a matter of fact,
as a sign of my confidence in her,

543
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,609
there's something
I've done over the years

544
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:30,362
with the better-behaved,
longer-tariffed prisoners

545
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,531
which has always
had good results.

546
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,141
Come on, boy. Good.

547
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,645
All right?

548
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,149
Stay close to me.

549
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,234
I will.

550
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,958
That's it.

551
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,548
Myra.

552
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,677
Here we are.

553
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,555
Come on.

554
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:46,188
Come up here,
on this track here.

555
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,692
I'm tired.

556
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:56,031
Ideally, of course,
I'd take you to the coast.

557
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,075
Or to mountains.

558
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,621
Somewhere in Scotland.

559
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,709
This isn't bad either.

560
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,087
He comes on the pitch!
He tackles...

561
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:18,136
Now, I want you
to try something for me.

562
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,350
Take off your sunglasses.

563
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,738
Now your headscarf.

564
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:53,255
See? No one
recognizes you.

565
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,133
At least there's one benefit
of that awful photograph

566
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,010
with the blonde hair.

567
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,722
How does it feel?

568
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,604
Wonderful.

569
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,443
Well, this is how it will be
for you one day...

570
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,530
walking on the heath...

571
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,868
on your way
to work perhaps...

572
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,247
Or to the shops.

573
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:32,211
Just an ordinary person.

574
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,421
Anonymous.

575
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,300
Free.

576
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,484
Just thought you might
want to see these.

577
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,280
Mmm.

578
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,369
Oh, gracious me.

579
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,375
There's no question
of Myra Hindley

580
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,711
being granted parole. Among those
people who protested

581
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,422
at her action
in taking Hindley out

582
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,175
for one and a half hours
in a local park

583
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,428
was Mr. Bill Palfrey, former chief
constable of Lancashire.

584
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,682
And to let people out
after eight years,

585
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,684
whether it's
a walk in the park,

586
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,310
I think is
a lot of nonsense.

587
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,479
And somebody's living
in a cuckoo-cuckoo land.

588
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,857
It's not the land I've
lived in for 45 years.

589
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:38,652
I don't believe
that this woman is fit

590
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:41,405
to be let loose
on society.

591
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,741
In my opinion, this was the worst
murder this century.

592
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,537
I'm feeling the space
all around me,

593
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,540
the wind
in my hair...

594
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,834
and being able
to see that far.

595
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:58,046
And I'm going to have
to feed on those two hours

596
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,216
because God only knows it's the only
time I'm going to get out of here.

597
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,303
- Now that's not true.
- You've seen the papers.

598
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,930
What politician's going
to grant me parole now?

599
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:11,018
Well, perhaps that's
where I come in.

600
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,897
What can you do?

601
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,940
I can certainly explain
why you were given

602
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,276
the privilege of the walk
in the first place.

603
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,737
Your good conduct
in prison, your...

604
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,822
return to the church.

605
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,949
And as a former
Cabinet Minister,

606
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,702
I imagine I still
have some standing.

607
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,079
Why would you do this?

608
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,999
Because I like to think that
after 40 years of visiting prisoners

609
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,503
I've developed some sort of instinct
about which ones are worth fighting for.

610
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,176
You look surprised. Don't you think
you're worth fighting for?

611
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,179
Yes, of course.

612
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:50,015
So do I.

613
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:54,144
Before I start, there's one question
I'm bound to ask you.

614
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:57,606
Yeah?

615
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,402
Is there anything
about your case

616
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,071
or your personal
circumstances

617
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,989
you haven't told me?

618
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,536
I don't think so.
Why?

619
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:14,164
It's just that I intend to be talking
about you in public a great deal

620
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,625
and it'd be awful
to have any...

621
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,002
un... unpleasant
surprises.

622
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,216
- No.
- Good.

623
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,553
- Time!
- All right then.

624
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:31,306
Having serviced that, I see no reason
why we can't forge ahead.

625
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,851
Are some crimes
so appalling

626
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:37,104
that their perpetrators
should never walk free again?

627
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,940
Or can anyone,
whatever the crime,

628
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,984
be delivered
from evil?

629
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,237
Lord Longford
confronts Lord Hailsham.

630
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:48,407
If you had had the good fortunes
of spending a great many hours

631
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:51,535
in Myra Hindley's company, you would
appreciate how different she is

632
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:54,663
to the inflammatory reports one
reads in the popular press.

633
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:57,833
You reject the idea
that life should mean life...

634
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,793
Yes, it's a totally
un-Christian beastly idea.

635
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,336
Wicked really,
I guess.

636
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:05,090
I'm allowed to have
my opinion about that.

637
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:08,302
Other people think I'm wicked for saying
the opposite, so you know...

638
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,387
They don't think
you're wicked, Frank.

639
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:13,348
They sometimes think
you're a little foolish.

640
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,184
In my experience,
very few women

641
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,269
are real criminals in the sense
that men are.

642
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:20,397
I think you'll find this view supported
by sociologists.

643
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,403
Whatever she has done,

644
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:29,281
she is entitled to be
considered for parole.

645
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,367
Myra Hindley was an innocent
young 18-year-old girl

646
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,954
before she met Ian Brady.
She has now become herself again.

647
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,790
Lord Longford is talking
about parole for Myra Hindley.

648
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,417
When will I get parole?

649
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,252
I am serving
a life sentence

650
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,837
through that monster.

651
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,422
When will I get my parole?

652
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,175
If she comes out,
I'll be up for murder

653
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,885
if I get my hands
on that woman.

654
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,804
I said this to Lord Longford
once and I'll say it again.

655
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,556
She will be
one dead woman.

656
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,643
I mean, she will
be one dead woman.

657
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,437
- Mrs. West, for a minute...
- I want justice.

658
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:03,542
Ms. Billington!
Can I borrow you

659
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,460
for two seconds
for a quick photo?

660
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,629
- Sorry. I'll be right back.
- Thank you so much.

661
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,632
Lord and Lady Longford,
would you like to join the photograph?

662
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,509
- Oh, no...
- Please, sir.

663
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,845
- Oh, hello!
- Just two seconds of your time, sir,

664
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:17,222
- to support your daughter.
- Oh come on, why not?

665
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,891
Lord Longford,
come on!

666
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,393
- Oh, all right, if you say so.
- Thank you so much.

667
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:24,146
- Dada.
- Lady Longford.

668
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:26,356
Hello, Mom.

669
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:30,152
Lord Longford, how does it feel to be
the father of such a famous author?

670
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:33,238
Well, not hugely different
from being the husband of one.

671
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,158
Lord Longford,
on "Brass Tacks,"

672
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,411
you told Anne West that Myra Hindley's
a reformed character.

673
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:42,164
- Yes, that is correct, yes.
- Would you care to comment further?

674
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,499
I haven't changed my view,
if that's what you're asking.

675
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,168
The families
of the victims

676
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,170
have been particularly
upset by this.

677
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:49,838
What do you have
to say to them?

678
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,716
Naturally, I feel the need for sympathy
for the families,

679
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,968
but I also believe
that those of us

680
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,221
without the necessary
qualifications

681
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,139
or experience
in these matters

682
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,183
should refrain
from passing judgment.

683
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,684
So if it were you,

684
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,811
you'd put Myra Hindley
back on the streets?

685
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,022
No, with all due respect,
that is not what I said.

686
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:09,024
And if you had taken
the actual time to read

687
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,859
the article in question,

688
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,237
you'd realize that I was
merely suggesting

689
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,197
that Ms. Hindley
be treated fairly

690
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,074
in comparison
with other prisoners.

691
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:21,995
How could you...

692
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,081
ruin the evening like that?

693
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:27,042
I refuse to just
stand there and watch

694
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:29,753
as you sabotage your own
daughter's achievements

695
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:32,673
by campaigning
for that...

696
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,132
What?

697
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:37,719
That woman.
This... preoccupation

698
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,556
with Myra Hindley...

699
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:44,518
I realize losing your job
was a terrible blow

700
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,229
and you're looking
for something replace it.

701
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:49,481
But not her.

702
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,862
Couldn't you
find someone else?

703
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,240
Something else...

704
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,075
for all our sakes!

705
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:06,164
Yes.

706
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,833
Of course.

707
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,932
I've written
to Rachel...

708
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:25,893
to apologize.

709
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,150
It won't happen again.

710
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:44,453
I thought I'd go down
to the Lords this afternoon.

711
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:54,087
Unless there's something
you need me to do here.

712
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,178
Elizabeth?

713
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,388
No, I don't think so.

714
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,646
There was a subsection
on quality licensing,

715
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,358
and particularly,
the old paragraph B.

716
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,485
And there's the intention
by the government

717
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:20,239
to achieve a measure
of quality licensing

718
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,574
and this will be
generally welcome.

719
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:26,328
That the normal role...

720
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:30,249
the government never
intended to say this

721
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,918
and is now moving
these two amendments...

722
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,014
Look at this one.

723
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,976
She's got bandages on.

724
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,188
Want a better look?

725
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:57,317
Dirty sod!

726
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,403
What a pervert!

727
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,590
- Frank, it's harmless.
- I disagree.

728
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:21,884
Completely harmless.

729
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,929
These things are read by children
at a vulnerable age.

730
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,348
The boys on the bus can't
have been more than 12.

731
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,810
And in our day,
it was just the same.

732
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,480
Nothing like so graphic.

733
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,983
Or as available.
Look at it!

734
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,570
Sexual arousal
is proverbial

735
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:45,532
and if boys grow up thinking
that these kinds of breasts

736
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:50,412
or... or this kind
of submission is normal,

737
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,956
they'll expect it
in later life.

738
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:56,418
I'm afraid I'm with
Marilyn Monroe on this.

739
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,422
When asked what she
thought about sex,

740
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:03,091
she thought
for a moment then said

741
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,135
she felt it was
here to stay.

742
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:09,765
And if it is,
then so is prostitution

743
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,725
and pornography.

744
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,436
I found this book.

745
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:16,438
Studies have been
done in America.

746
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,733
You'd be astonished at the detrimental
effect it has.

747
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,444
If you feel that
strongly about it, fine.

748
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:25,280
As long as it
isn't Myra Hindley.

749
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,749
"Dear Frank..."

750
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,003
"Where are you?

751
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:43,632
Another month passes, and still
I haven't heard from you."

752
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:48,720
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

753
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:50,806
- Just looking.
- Help yourself, sir.

754
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,641
Thank you.

755
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,643
"If I don't hear
from you soon,

756
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,645
I shall have to assume

757
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:59,022
that you no longer
wish to represent me."

758
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,858
I know what these are,
but what's this?

759
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:05,237
- It's an anal stimulator.
- Oh, thank you.

760
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,198
"Recently, I've seen you
campaign against pornography."

761
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,075
Pornography,
it is my conviction,

762
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,411
has increased,
is increasing,

763
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:15,330
and ought
to be diminished.

764
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,375
- This is hardcore.
- And very heavily thumbed.

765
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,088
This would become
freely available

766
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,841
to children if our friends
carried the motion.

767
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:27,843
Is this a show
that is representative

768
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:30,012
of what one gets
in Denmark,

769
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,597
in Copenhagen
at the moment?

770
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,682
Forget this one.

771
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:36,602
"I can only assume it is
because you have lost interest

772
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:38,604
or conviction
in my cause."

773
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:45,027
Do you think pictures of naked girls
can be enjoyable, for instance?

774
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:47,362
You mean at my age? No.

775
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:50,407
Oh, yes.

776
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:56,246
- There's no age...
- What age should they cease to be...

777
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:59,541
you should have to ask the younger
members of the audience that.

778
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,335
Or the middle-aged ones.

779
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:05,047
I'm an elderly man and you'll
have to take that answer from me.

780
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,382
Well, I wish you good luck.

781
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:10,093
I shall remember you
always in my prayers.

782
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:13,764
Yours, Myra."

783
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:21,563
Moors murderer
Myra Hindley

784
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,482
has been caught
trying to escape jail

785
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,442
with her lady
prison officer lover.

786
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:28,403
Scotland Yard have been
investigating an alleged

787
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:30,405
escape plot
in Holloway jail,

788
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:33,575
and already a prison officer
has been charged

789
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,911
and is due to appear
in court on February 1st.

790
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,205
I understand
that Myra Hindley

791
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,582
may also be brought before
the same magistrates

792
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,961
at the same time in connection
with the same offense.

793
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,840
I can't believe
you're going.

794
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,550
Have a heart.
I'm all she's got.

795
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:52,803
She has a solicitor,
hasn't she?

796
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:54,555
You gave me
your word.

797
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:58,100
That woman just tried
to break out of jail.

798
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:01,854
Perhaps that has something to do with
the fact that I stopped visiting her.

799
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,273
Or with the fact that
she's a hardened criminal.

800
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,983
Oh, come along.

801
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,193
You're sounding like
a tabloid editorial.

802
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:12,197
Maybe in this instance, they're right.
Had you considered that?

803
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,949
I'll give you
a ring from London.

804
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:18,745
Hello, Reg. Can we go
to the station, please?

805
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:24,251
Silly man.

806
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:29,131
Hello, Myra.

807
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,260
I'm sorry, Frank.

808
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,139
I just got so bleak.

809
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,683
I thought you'd
given up on me.

810
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:40,976
Nonsense.

811
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,897
Suddenly I had a vision
of the fact that

812
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:47,816
I'm going to be here forever,
without no supporters.

813
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:51,028
Not at all, not at all.

814
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,170
Patricia had this
idea of Brazil.

815
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:11,173
There are these slums
outside Sao Paulo

816
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:14,259
where they're crying
out for help.

817
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:20,057
What's the sense
in keeping us in here

818
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:22,351
when I could be
out there doing good?

819
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,854
That's what I want
to do is good.

820
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:29,358
And instead...

821
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:33,153
I've just made
everything worse.

822
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:35,155
Now I've got
to go to court.

823
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:39,159
The case is going
to get sent down.

824
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,371
We're never going to see
one another again.

825
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:43,872
You never know.

826
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:47,376
Help me, please.

827
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:51,255
Listen, keep praying, Myra.

828
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:54,299
That's the most important thing.
Keep praying.

829
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:58,595
Oh, for pity's
sake, woman.

830
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,873
Order!

831
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,333
We will have silence
in this courtroom.

832
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,751
Quiet!

833
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,504
My view, as an experienced
prison visitor,

834
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:35,674
is that Myra Hindley
is a good Christian woman...

835
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,847
Making a determined effort
to make amends for her past,

836
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,682
and to do good
in the future.

837
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,606
There are those that say you're
under Ms. Hindley's thrall.

838
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,941
How would you
respond to that?

839
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,903
Well, it may
or may not be so,

840
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:59,406
at least the supervising
officer was present at all times,

841
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,451
to ensure that nothing
untoward took place.

842
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:09,124
Myra Hindley,

843
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,251
you are
already the subject

844
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,295
of a life sentence.

845
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,755
And properly so.

846
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:17,508
I am sentencing you

847
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:19,593
to a further 12 months,

848
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:22,513
to run concurrently.

849
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:26,308
I pass it in the hope
that if in future...

850
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,686
and it think it should
be a remote event...

851
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:33,482
people ever consider
you for parole,

852
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:36,777
then the activities
of this case

853
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,948
should be recorded
and remembered.

854
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,450
Take them down.

855
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:48,872
so she's going
to be moved, is she?

856
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:51,375
- Durham.
- Oh, no.

857
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,043
Very predictable,
I'm afraid.

858
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:55,879
I had hoped for somewhere
more progressive.

859
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:59,049
Durham... it couldn't
be worse.

860
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,611
Morning, sir.

861
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,826
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

862
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,911
- Good.
- Thanks, thanks a lot.

863
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,539
- Goodbye.
- See you tomorrow.

864
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:57,274
Well, look who it is.

865
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,027
It's Lord Porn.

866
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,948
I told you to
leave her alone, Frank.

867
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:08,035
But you didn't,
and now look.

868
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:11,955
Half the country has you
earmarked as a lackey,

869
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:14,333
the other as
a gullible fool.

870
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,293
So I'm going
to tell you again,

871
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:19,087
nice and slow

872
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,590
so you don't forget it.

873
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,969
leave...

874
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:28,430
Myra Hindley...

875
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,098
alone.

876
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:35,354
Or she will do to you
what she did to me.

877
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,106
She will destroy you.

878
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:41,193
I can see that for a man
in your circumstances,

879
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,445
it must be comforting
to blame it on someone else.

880
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,989
Are you going to blame her
for your hunger strike too?

881
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,535
My hunger strike is
a legitimate protest

882
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:52,079
against the filthy
conditions here.

883
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,625
Then why didn't you allow me
to make representations

884
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,961
to the home secretary
on your behalf?

885
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,963
'Cause I'm not
completely insane.

886
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:05,884
If I wanted to set my cause
back a decade or two,

887
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:09,596
if I wanted to be
denied all exercise,

888
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,724
if I wanted to have them
piss in my food as well as spit in it,

889
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:16,228
then I'd ask a batty
old pornography campaigner

890
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,897
and Myra Hindley's
whipping boy

891
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,983
to make representations
on my behalf.

892
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:23,193
Thank you.

893
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:26,905
- Now...
- An hysteric.

894
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:29,491
Some of the...

895
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,702
that's what she is.

896
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,955
Are you familiar
with the term

897
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:38,375
in its strict
clinical use?

898
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,794
No.

899
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:46,466
An hysteric
is someone who

900
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:48,302
gives to people,

901
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:52,097
reflects back to them that
which they believe makes them

902
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:55,142
most acceptable,

903
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:57,519
most likeable...

904
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,232
what they think
others want to see.

905
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:06,028
Myra Hindley
is a classic hysteric.

906
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:11,533
It explains why to you

907
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,036
she's a virtuous

908
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:17,831
churchgoing angel,

909
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:20,209
and to her cool prisoners
and dykes,

910
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:24,171
a strong woman
with a soft heart.

911
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,548
And to me...

912
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,595
She was a brutal sadist

913
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,472
and a cruel killer

914
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:36,517
with not an ounce
of remorse in her.

915
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,645
If she is this girl
to you, why did you

916
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,688
insist on her innocence
in the trial?

917
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:47,569
Because I loved her.

918
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:53,534
How could you not love
a girl like that?

919
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,876
Come on, Frank.
Don't look like that.

920
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,962
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

921
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:10,801
I've spoken to the prison governor about
having you reassessed as a mental case.

922
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:13,053
Deny it, Frank. Look me
in the eye and tell me

923
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,597
you weren't a little
sweet on her yourself.

924
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,936
And now you're on
this white charger,

925
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:25,190
riding in to save
his damsel.

926
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:30,362
"Save me,
Lord Longford.

927
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:34,074
Save me."

928
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,003
Elizabeth?

929
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,590
Elizabeth?

930
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:53,177
- Elizabeth?
- In here.

931
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,894
Oh, there you are?
What are you doing?

932
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:05,606
I've been reading
Myra's letters.

933
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,858
I hope you don't mind.

934
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:12,112
Well, there's the fire.

935
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:14,615
Go and burn them.

936
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:18,744
I don't have the stomach
for this anymore.

937
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,832
Oh.

938
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,960
It's just...

939
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,004
the last time
we disagreed

940
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:31,340
so passionately
about anything,

941
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:34,176
was over your joining
the Catholic church

942
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:36,887
and I think we both
agree on that matter...

943
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,931
you were right.

944
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,478
So with regard
to Ms. Hindley,

945
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,814
I thought I'd give you
the benefit of the doubt.

946
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:51,276
So I came into your study,

947
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,737
and read her letters...

948
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,408
And found them
very interesting.

949
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:03,038
And was thinking
how much I'd like to meet her.

950
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,720
Passport and visiting
order, please?

951
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,852
Visiting order?

952
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:27,563
As a member of the House of Lords,
I don't need a visiting order.

953
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:29,064
You should
know that by now.

954
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,316
- Sorry, sir.
- Thank you.

955
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:37,364
Thank you.
Good morning.

956
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:39,867
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

957
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:42,953
- Undo the overcoat, please.
- Yes, of course.

958
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:45,664
- Arms out, sir.
- Stand over there for me.

959
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:48,208
- I see.
- Your arms up

960
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:49,918
with your legs
slightly apart.

961
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,921
Is it really necessary for Lady Longford
to take her coat off?

962
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:55,632
Turn towards me, please.
Thank you.

963
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,926
Ridiculous.

964
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,345
Hardly likely to be smuggling
anything.

965
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,645
Dad, I miss you.
I really really have.

966
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:13,525
I don't understand.
I can only see male prisoners.

967
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,777
That's because they
built the women's prison

968
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,905
into the heart
of the men's.

969
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,449
- Myra Hindley?
- Yes.

970
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,797
There she is.

971
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,802
Oh dear.

972
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:56,235
Be quiet!

973
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,403
Be quiet!

974
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,447
Where's your humanity?

975
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:02,491
Silence!

976
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:05,160
For pity's sake.

977
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:08,330
Hello, Myra.

978
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,091
Myra?

979
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,847
Myra?

980
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,726
- Myra?
- It's okay. She can hear ya.

981
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,562
It's just the medication.

982
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:39,403
Myra...

983
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:42,114
I brought someone
with me.

984
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:44,867
My wife Elizabeth.

985
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:50,789
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

986
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:59,423
I was so enjoying
your book.

987
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:02,718
That...

988
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:05,137
one about
Queen Victoria.

989
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:13,228
But they wouldn't
let me bring it here.

990
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,230
They've...

991
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,816
taken all my books.

992
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:20,736
I'm not allowed them.

993
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,451
They just came...

994
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,494
one day.

995
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:35,959
Men with guns...

996
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:40,797
in a helicopter.

997
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,599
Myra?

998
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,643
What have they
given her?

999
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,020
"The liquid kosh,"
we call it.

1000
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:58,440
It's a mixture of tranqs,
antidepressants and sleepers.

1001
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,943
Most of the new
prisoners go on it

1002
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,570
to cope with the shock
of this place.

1003
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:07,115
She had a particularly
rough welcome.

1004
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:09,868
A lot of the women
in here are mothers, you can imagine.

1005
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,288
People have smeared shit
on the walls of her room.

1006
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:16,959
Pretty much all her food
is tampered with.

1007
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:20,838
The only safe thing
for her to eat is boiled eggs

1008
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:23,507
and sweets in wrappers.

1009
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,513
I like sweets.

1010
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:39,314
It's horrific.

1011
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,986
I had no idea.

1012
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:47,614
How can we do that
to people?

1013
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,995
And you have to get
her off that stuff.

1014
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,497
It's inhuman.

1015
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,460
How long has she been
in prison now?

1016
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,504
14 years.

1017
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:05,007
And the average term
served by a life prisoner?

1018
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,758
12 years.

1019
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,597
And still, she's been given
no prospect of parole.

1020
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,724
No.

1021
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:17,644
You said the trial judge
made a distinction

1022
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,813
between her case
and Ian Brady's.

1023
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:23,317
I quote,
"Though I believe

1024
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,360
Brady is wicked
beyond belief,

1025
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,697
I cannot feel the same
is necessarily true of Hindley

1026
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:30,866
when she is removed
from his influence."

1027
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:34,036
End of quote.

1028
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,954
Really?

1029
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,420
...who between the wars,

1030
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,756
converted more people
to Catholicism...

1031
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,549
How's the Queen Mother
coming along?

1032
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,302
Rather slowly,
I'm afraid.

1033
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:53,847
I've got bogged down
researching something else.

1034
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:55,849
Can you say what?

1035
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,144
Myra Hindley.

1036
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:01,146
What? Why?

1037
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:02,731
...what a meddler.

1038
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:05,359
It seemed to me that
for years I have been

1039
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,362
merrily attacking your father
for supporting her

1040
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,657
without having the slightest idea
of what I was talking about.

1041
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:14,284
- And there you go.
- And?

1042
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:18,080
And I must say
my eyes have been opened rather.

1043
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,250
How much do you
know about

1044
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,961
the nature
of sadomasochistic relationships?

1045
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:26,255
Mercifully, very little.

1046
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:29,466
Isn't it an accepted
psychological fact

1047
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,594
that daughters seek
in their husbands or lovers

1048
01:07:32,636 --> 01:07:35,430
someone who mirrors
their own father?

1049
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:37,516
One of the papers claimed

1050
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:40,602
that Myra Hindley was
abused by her father.

1051
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,855
So it makes perfect sense

1052
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:45,899
that she would then repeat
the pattern with Ian Brady,

1053
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:49,236
who subjected her
to the most appalling cruelty,

1054
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:51,572
beating her,
raping her,

1055
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,699
threatening
to take her life.

1056
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,828
I see. So it's not her fault
she procured children for him?

1057
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,122
She made repeated attempts
to free herself

1058
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:02,124
of him,
running away to London.

1059
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,835
But every time
came back... funny that.

1060
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:08,380
Isn't that the nature
of obsession?

1061
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:12,926
The fear of losing Brady
was greater than anything else.

1062
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:14,678
And you got all
this from?

1063
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,263
The public records' office,

1064
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,515
where I read the original
trial transcripts,

1065
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:21,560
and I spoke to Dorothy Wing,
her former governor at Holloway.

1066
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:24,313
But...

1067
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:28,525
ironically, the thing that finally
persuaded me to offer her my help

1068
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:32,529
was the very same thing
that had so made me

1069
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,364
hate her
in the first place:

1070
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:36,742
the fact that she
is a woman.

1071
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:38,452
Did you know

1072
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:41,163
there have been half a dozen
similar child murders?

1073
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:44,166
The reason none of us
has heard about them

1074
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,877
is because the killers
in each case were men.

1075
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:50,047
And men being sadistic
violent killers

1076
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,840
isn't a story.

1077
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:53,967
Incidentally,
in each case

1078
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:56,803
the men have also
been paroled.

1079
01:08:56,845 --> 01:09:00,265
Note the reason
Myra Hindley is still in jail

1080
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:02,726
and has never been
considered for parole

1081
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,603
is because she
is a woman.

1082
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,605
And for that reason,

1083
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,982
she will always have
my understanding,

1084
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:12,402
if not my sympathy.

1085
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:16,156
So when did you go
to the public records office?

1086
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:20,035
When I said I was
going to the Bodleian.

1087
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,205
And Governor Wing,
when did you visit her?

1088
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:27,251
When I said
I was having lunch with my agent.

1089
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:31,839
So now I must add mendacity
to your many virtues.

1090
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:37,553
And you'd have me
continue my campaign?

1091
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,556
Yes...

1092
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:44,059
and not rest
until she gets paroled.

1093
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:46,812
Have you spoken
to Willie about it?

1094
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:50,858
Whitelaw?
No, not one to one, no.

1095
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,443
Then I suggest you do that.

1096
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,323
What a very good idea.

1097
01:09:59,575 --> 01:10:01,410
I don't think
I've ever loved you

1098
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,245
quite so completely
as I do now.

1099
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,958
- A new high?
- Off the charts.

1100
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,752
Top of the pops.

1101
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,629
Get into bed, woman!

1102
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,299
I've got to get
my dressing gown off.

1103
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,301
I've got to take
my shoes off.

1104
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:21,221
The Home Secretary
will see you now.

1105
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:23,182
Thank you
so much.

1106
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:31,190
- Frank, good to see you.
- My dear fellow.

1107
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,984
- How good of you to see me.
- Not at all.

1108
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:35,485
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

1109
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:38,447
- Sherry?
- You know me too well.

1110
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,574
She's served
almost 15 years, Willie.

1111
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:43,785
It's a scandal she hasn't
been considered for parole.

1112
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:46,121
I know. But as
Home Secretary,

1113
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:49,499
I have to make sure
that public confidence

1114
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:52,878
in the system
is not undermined.

1115
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,006
If you wish to protect
the integrity of the system,

1116
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:58,300
I suggest you stop
allowing it to be ruled

1117
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:00,844
- according to the will of the mob.
- Frank, look...

1118
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:04,640
At least allow her to be interviewed
by a local parole board.

1119
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,518
For me?
What harm could that do?

1120
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:11,563
Couldn't she be moved somewhere better?
Durham is insufferable.

1121
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:14,066
I'll see what I can do.

1122
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:16,318
If anyone deserves
to be in...

1123
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,195
Frank!

1124
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:24,326
You really are a most tenacious
campaigner, you know?

1125
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,036
It's an admirable trait.

1126
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:32,209
And you always pick
the most difficult causes.

1127
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:36,380
Maybe you should take
a back seat for a while.

1128
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:39,842
God knows you deserve it.

1129
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,344
I can't, Willie.
You know what they say:

1130
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:45,681
"Only dead fish swim
with the stream."

1131
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:48,809
Thank you very much.

1132
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:50,644
Thank you.

1133
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:53,814
Goodbye.

1134
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:55,440
There's good news.

1135
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:58,902
Willie has agreed for Myra
to be seen by the local parole board.

1136
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:00,946
And she's going to be
moved from Durham.

1137
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,698
Oh, Frank,
that's wonderful.

1138
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,700
Imagine, if they
find in her favor,

1139
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,952
and the National Board agrees,
that would put

1140
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,996
enormous pressure
on the Home Secretary.

1141
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:12,457
Then the only thing that will stand
in our way will be public opinion.

1142
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,002
So we must keep a lid on this,
because if the press get

1143
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:17,629
even the merest hint of it,
we'll be scuppered.

1144
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:33,562
Fred Harrison?

1145
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:36,106
Top local reporter.

1146
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:46,074
Come on, man, smile.

1147
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:55,125
This is your lucky day.

1148
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,544
You are about to get a story

1149
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:01,673
on the front page
of every paper in the country.

1150
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,682
Word has reached me

1151
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:14,353
that Myra Hindley is
being considered for parole.

1152
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:17,022
I wasn't aware of that.

1153
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:20,192
No, friend, that's what
makes it an exclusive.

1154
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,696
Turn your tape recorder on,
there's a good lad.

1155
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:40,587
Morning, Lord Longford.

1156
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:42,297
Good morning.

1157
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,591
You certainly are
in high spirits today.

1158
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,928
Yes, we are. A bit of a break,
so I believe, for Ms. Hindley.

1159
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,763
Yeah, don't worry.

1160
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,057
Just goes to show,
if you keep persisting

1161
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,351
and persisting...

1162
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:56,854
Hello, Myra. This is the nightie
you wanted.

1163
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:58,397
I couldn't remember
what color you asked for.

1164
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,148
That's great, thanks.

1165
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:02,067
- Now to business.
- Frank...

1166
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,528
I have a friend on the local
parole board

1167
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,698
who tells me that your application
will be considered next month.

1168
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:10,158
If that goes well,
all things being equal,

1169
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,662
- the national...
- Frank, enough.

1170
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,334
The police have
been to see me.

1171
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:25,382
Brady's talked to the press
about the other bodies.

1172
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:27,593
What do you mean,
what other bodies?

1173
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:31,138
Pauline Reade
and the Bennett boy.

1174
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:35,434
He hasn't given them
any details yet...

1175
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:38,729
but he says he knows
where they're buried.

1176
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,690
Before he grabs
the initiative,

1177
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:45,736
I've decided to come clean
and tell them everything I know.

1178
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:51,033
But you know nothing about other bodies.
You told me as much yourself.

1179
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:57,206
What are you saying?

1180
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,209
I'm saying...

1181
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:03,587
that I'm going to give a full confession
to all five murders.

1182
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:10,636
Dear God.

1183
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,846
I asked you specifically

1184
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:16,934
if there was anything
you hadn't told me.

1185
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:19,520
I've staked my name on this,
my reputation.

1186
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:20,729
I know.

1187
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,940
And I would
understand perfectly

1188
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:24,775
if you never wanted
to see me again.

1189
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:30,739
It's what my new solicitor's
suggested anyway.

1190
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,075
Your new solicitor?

1191
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:36,495
He feels... and if I'm honest,
I have to agree with him...

1192
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:41,416
the campaign that you've
conducted on my behalf

1193
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,460
has hurt me
more than helped me,

1194
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,921
and that we should
make this our last meeting.

1195
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,261
I see.

1196
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:55,264
If that's what he feels,

1197
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,850
and you feel.

1198
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:11,446
Goodbye, Frank.

1199
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,551
An hour after first light,

1200
01:17:14,593 --> 01:17:17,888
a police helicopter carrying
Myra Hindley and an armed bodyguard,

1201
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:20,098
landed on the A635...

1202
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,100
the road used
by Hindley and Brady

1203
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:25,604
when they were carrying the bodies
of their victims up to the moors.

1204
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,940
A small group including
Myra Hindley

1205
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:30,234
then inspected
the peat slopes.

1206
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:34,071
Myra, we do know
it's been a long time,

1207
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:35,906
but you know,
are we in the right spot?

1208
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:38,742
Myra, we need to know
if this is the spot.

1209
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,244
Can you be sure, Myra?

1210
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:42,746
Have a look around.
Where in relation to the group?

1211
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:50,045
- I recognize the rocks behind you.
- You certain?

1212
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:52,005
Yes yes, I'm certain.

1213
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,883
Hindley led the police
to areas she and Brady

1214
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:57,261
visited more than
20 years ago.

1215
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:59,263
In a pub two miles away:

1216
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:01,223
Pat Kilbride,
whose son John was murdered

1217
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:03,183
21 years ago.

1218
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,103
He'd come armed with a knife,
but was stopped at a roadblock.

1219
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:08,939
Just want to say...
this here,

1220
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,358
I've come prepared
to kill her.

1221
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,361
She has confessed
that she is guilty

1222
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,321
of participating
in these crimes

1223
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:19,616
so that she would be guilty of the crime
of murder, yes.

1224
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:23,745
Throughout the morning,
friends and relatives arrived

1225
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:25,247
at the Reade family home to pay...

1226
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:28,417
I'm so sorry.

1227
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,794
This is all my fault.

1228
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:33,922
If I hadn't read
her letters

1229
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:36,925
and insisted
on meeting her...

1230
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:41,680
because you'd already
decided to let her go.

1231
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:45,434
As the cortege made its way through
the Courtland area of Manchester,

1232
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:48,604
neighbors stood silently
in memory of Pauline.

1233
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:52,232
Later, her body was interred
at a nearby cemetery.

1234
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,069
More than two decades
after her death,

1235
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:59,781
the family were at last able
to lay their daughter to rest.

1236
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:05,579
I'll call the police.
Get rid of the photographers.

1237
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:08,373
At graveside, the mother
of Lesley Ann Downey,

1238
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,542
yet another child
murdered on the moors.

1239
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:13,462
For Pauline Reade,
the last chapter

1240
01:19:13,504 --> 01:19:15,589
of her tragic life has been written.

1241
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:18,467
John Draper,
ITN, Manchester.

1242
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:38,195
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1243
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,489
It has been some weeks
since my last confession,

1244
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,742
during which time
much has changed.

1245
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:49,498
My actions have
hurt my family...

1246
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,210
my friends, and not to mention
the families of the victims.

1247
01:19:56,964 --> 01:20:00,926
Now I ask God

1248
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,303
for His guidance,

1249
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:07,683
His strength,

1250
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:10,644
and above all
His compassion.

1251
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:16,275
For in His perfection,

1252
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:19,695
he forgives all
His creatures.

1253
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:25,784
I beseech you, Lord,

1254
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,121
forgive me.

1255
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:34,501
And give me strength

1256
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:39,256
to follow your
immaculate example...

1257
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:44,928
so that I might put aside
my personal hurt...

1258
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,895
and forgive this woman.

1259
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:36,813
Shh.

1260
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:39,149
Go on, sit.

1261
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:43,612
You're all right.
Shh.

1262
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:45,280
Shh.

1263
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:47,324
What's the matter
with you?

1264
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:49,910
Gonna get real fucking angry
if you don't hurry up.

1265
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,495
What's that look for?

1266
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:53,205
If you don't shush,

1267
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,458
I'll have to shut
your mouth for you.

1268
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,627
And I'll forget myself,

1269
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:02,130
and I'll hit you
once more.

1270
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:05,342
Will you stop it?

1271
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:08,470
Stop it.
Stop it.

1272
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:44,965
So many questions to ask you,
such a long and distinguished career,

1273
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:46,675
but I'm gonna start
with the book.

1274
01:22:46,717 --> 01:22:48,385
What prompted you
to write it?

1275
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:50,679
As a lifelong Christian
and scholar,

1276
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:54,516
I've always been interested
in ideas of sanctity.

1277
01:22:54,558 --> 01:22:57,561
But more than that,
I think it was probably

1278
01:22:57,603 --> 01:23:01,398
the entirely selfish desire
to spend a little time with my heroes.

1279
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,192
Do you have a favorite?

1280
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:05,569
A favorite?
Hey, what a question.

1281
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:10,365
I commend you for distilling
so succinctly such a complex subject.

1282
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,785
Hey, Myra, I think your
Frankie boy is on the radio.

1283
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:16,038
- Lord Porn.
- Dismas of Calvary,

1284
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:17,915
the thief crucified
next to Jesus.

1285
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:21,919
I've always been drawn
to outcasts

1286
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,922
and people on
the fringes of society.

1287
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:28,050
And St. Dismas,
having spent most of his life

1288
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,718
as a violent criminal,

1289
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,056
the miracle of his repentance
at the end on the cross...

1290
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:36,767
Yes, I think he would
have to have my vote.

1291
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:38,435
Interesting.

1292
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:41,730
The time is coming up
to 20 past 2:00.

1293
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,649
We're gonna take
some calls.

1294
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,735
David, what's your
question about the saints?

1295
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:48,862
I want to know how
your esteemed guest

1296
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,822
can look himself in
the mirror each morning.

1297
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,575
I'm assuming this is
a question about Myra Hindley.

1298
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:56,453
How could you rub salt
in the wounds of the families like that,

1299
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:58,247
campaigning on behalf
of that monster?

1300
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:00,415
I certainly take exception
to that description,

1301
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,751
but I made it quite clear
before coming on this program

1302
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:05,629
that I would not be answering questions
about Ms. Hindley today.

1303
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:09,758
Of course. Next caller is Judy
who's in Sheppey.

1304
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,094
My call is also
about Ms. Hindley.

1305
01:24:12,135 --> 01:24:14,763
In view of everything
we now know about it,

1306
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:17,391
don't you regret having
supported her all that time?

1307
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:21,019
Once again, madam, I'm afraid I must
decline to answer questions about her.

1308
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:23,981
It's a simple answer,
Lord Longford... yes or no.

1309
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:26,817
Do you regret it?

1310
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,829
Not at all.

1311
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:40,122
As a matter of fact,

1312
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:42,958
I consider my visiting
Myra Hindley,

1313
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,586
and indeed all
the other prisoners

1314
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,880
I visited
for over 50 years,

1315
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,923
to be one of the great
blessings of my life.

1316
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:52,801
Now perhaps we could
get back to the subject of saints.

1317
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:54,303
Well, hasn't she
betrayed you?

1318
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:56,138
She's ruined
your good name.

1319
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,348
She's taken all of
the hard work you did for her

1320
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,142
and thrown it
back in your face.

1321
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:04,813
Um... yes.

1322
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:07,900
Perhaps there's some
truth in that.

1323
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,070
Forgiving her
has proven difficult,

1324
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:13,822
very difficult.

1325
01:25:13,864 --> 01:25:15,657
Not for what
she's done to me...

1326
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:17,659
that's neither here
nor there...

1327
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:21,538
but for the terrible
crimes themselves.

1328
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:28,128
Forgiveness is the very
cornerstone of my faith.

1329
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:31,840
And the struggle
to deepen my faith

1330
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:36,136
is my life's journey.

1331
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:38,805
In that respect,

1332
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:43,352
she has enriched
my spiritual life beyond measure,

1333
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,688
and for that I will always
be grateful to her.

1334
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:57,199
If people think that
makes me weak or mad,

1335
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,034
so be it.

1336
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,745
That is the path
I am committed to...

1337
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:08,210
To love the sinner
but hate the sins...

1338
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:13,924
To assume the best in people
and not the worst...

1339
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:19,888
To believe that anyone,
no matter how evil,

1340
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:23,559
can be redeemed,

1341
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,395
eventually.

1342
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,902
Right. The time is
coming up to 2:20.

1343
01:26:33,944 --> 01:26:36,738
Lord Longford is with us
for the next couple of hours.

1344
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:40,576
And our switchboard looks
like it's about to explode.

1345
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:43,370
Next caller,
Lionel in Seven Oaks.

1346
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:55,215
Look at you!

1347
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:58,927
Which prison were
you at today?

1348
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:02,514
Carlisle.

1349
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:07,311
The train was delayed
coming back, I'm afraid.

1350
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:08,937
Snow on the tracks.

1351
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:10,397
Carlisle.

1352
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:13,775
You must be mad.
You're too old for this.

1353
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:16,445
I'm going to get rid
of all the requests

1354
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:18,572
that aren't
local from now on.

1355
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:22,951
- Oh, look.
- What?

1356
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:26,538
This one's from Myra.

1357
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:43,889
Hello, Frank.

1358
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,140
Oh, there you are.

1359
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:48,143
Hello.

1360
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:52,648
Goodness.
How well you look.

1361
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:55,692
Rubbish.

1362
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:57,736
My hair is falling out

1363
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:00,030
and I'm dying
of emphysema.

1364
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:03,992
Well, you still look
wonderful to me.

1365
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:05,994
Well, you're blind.

1366
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,747
Nearly, yes.

1367
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:15,045
Frank, the reason why I've
asked to see you today...

1368
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:19,925
I made up my mind
that if there was one thing

1369
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:23,595
I was going to do
before it was too late,

1370
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:27,933
it would be to apologize
to you in person.

1371
01:28:29,393 --> 01:28:33,272
Those are terrible
things I did to you...

1372
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:39,611
Lying to you like that.

1373
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:42,322
I'm sorry.

1374
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:58,547
I couldn't tell you
everything, Frank.

1375
01:29:02,092 --> 01:29:05,554
In prison, you never
tell anyone everything.

1376
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,770
And your full
confession before God...

1377
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:19,067
Was that a lie too?

1378
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:22,070
I'm trying, Frank.

1379
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:25,824
I'm really trying to know
the God that you know.

1380
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:32,331
But if you'd been
there that night

1381
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:36,376
on the moors
in the moonlight

1382
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:41,089
when we did the first one,

1383
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:44,760
then you'd know that evil

1384
01:29:44,801 --> 01:29:47,763
can be a spiritual
experience too.

1385
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:01,652
You know we only missed it
by a few weeks.

1386
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:06,782
- What?
- The death sentence.

1387
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:10,494
They abolished it while
we were still on remand.

1388
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:12,829
Looking back, don't you think
it would have been

1389
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,915
better for everyone
if they'd just hung us?

1390
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:17,501
Certainly not.

1391
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:20,629
Only God has the right
to take human life.

1392
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:23,882
Would he have not wanted to give
the families that comfort?

1393
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:27,386
None of us knows
the true purpose

1394
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:29,888
of our lives on Earth.

1395
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:32,808
Besides...

1396
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:35,310
had you been hanged,
I would never have had

1397
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:38,272
the privilege
of getting to know you.

1398
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:46,196
You really believe that,
don't you?

1399
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:59,459
It must be rather
a nice place to be.

1400
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:01,170
Where?

1401
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:03,755
Inside your head.

1402
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:08,635
Oh, I'm not so sure
about that.

1403
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:16,393
A fine pair we are then.

1404
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:18,937
Yes.
