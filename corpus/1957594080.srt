1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:04,859
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:17,711
("Requiem in D Minor" by Mozart)

3
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:25,935
- Taking in the Barnard?

4
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,098
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

5
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,422
- [Leo] It's impressive work, isn't it?

6
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:32,985
- Yeah, managed to take pop
art to a new level of banality.

7
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,152
- Now, Miss Cole, be kind.

8
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,331
They're struggling artists.

9
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,503
They do suffer so for their art.

10
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:43,698
- Yes, and pass it on to the consumer.

11
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:46,252
- Well, I hope you'll be more
charitable in your review.

12
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,085
- I will.

13
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:51,090
- You know, I was thinking
that maybe next week

14
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,990
at the opening you could come
and meet some of my artists,

15
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,390
and then maybe you might--

16
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,622
- Lose my objectivity.

17
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:01,801
No, you wouldn't want that, would you?

18
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:02,634
- No.

19
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,978
My, you are too young and too
beautiful to be such a cynic.

20
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:11,984
- [Jennifer] Julian Jons,
wasn't he convicted of murder?

21
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:14,567
- Now that is quite remarkable.

22
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:18,285
- But I thought he, you know.

23
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,873
- Oh no, he's back at work.

24
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,821
In fact, he's putting on a show for me.

25
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,855
- Here, a show?

26
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,742
- In the fall.

27
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,885
- Are they all like this?

28
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,802
- He's entering a different period.

29
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,000
- He peed on the bed again.

30
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,749
- [Jennifer] Just being territorial.

31
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,010
Maybe you should get another boyfriend.

32
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,355
- Why doesn't he pee on your bed?

33
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,695
Why am I so lucky?

34
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:05,862
- Must relate to your particular odor.

35
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,834
- I'm not the one with a
particular odor, thank you.

36
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,550
You know, I thought
when we had him neutered

37
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,160
that he'd give up all
this male aggression.

38
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,078
You know, he doesn't have any balls.

39
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:17,163
He should behave accordingly.

40
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,445
Ew.

41
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,612
- Julian Jons.

42
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:26,093
- Julian Jons, that name rings a bell.

43
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,707
Did I have sex with him?

44
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:32,471
- He's some artist who killed
his model in the early '80s.

45
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:33,304
- No shit.

46
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:37,221
- Yeah, he was put away in an asylum,

47
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,804
but he's out again and working.

48
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:44,581
- Well, that's our legal system for you.

49
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,914
- Please, may I?

50
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,019
In his organization of material,

51
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,727
he gives voice and substance

52
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:06,641
to his deep primal urges.

53
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,764
- Do we have any ammonia?

54
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,097
- Yeah, I guess.

55
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,659
(upbeat electronic music)

56
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,492
- [Man] I'll just have one
more, then I'll be done.

57
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:21,325
- Okay.

58
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,795
- [Woman] It's dark, just a little bit.

59
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,138
- [Woman] Some champagne, yes.

60
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,167
- Miss Cole.

61
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,000
- Oh, hello.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,700
- I'm so glad you could make it.

63
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,132
- It's a quick sale.

64
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:58,582
- Well, thanks to you and
your very gracious article.

65
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,850
- Oh, I was just being honest.

66
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,600
- Mr. Rourke shares your opinion.

67
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,290
Samuel, this is Jennifer Cole.

68
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,777
She's the young lady who helped inform

69
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:11,686
your excellent purchase.

70
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:12,929
- Miss Cole, a pleasure.

71
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:13,762
- Thank you.

72
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,264
- [Samuel] I found your
review most insightful.

73
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,597
- You did?
- Yes.

74
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:22,305
- [Jennifer] Is Mr. Jons
gonna be here this evening?

75
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:25,076
- [Leo] Oh, Julian, no
he's a very private person.

76
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:27,741
He's not really one for crowds.

77
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,235
(glass clinking)

78
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,236
I'd like to get this
speech out of the way.

79
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,688
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome.

80
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,872
I hope you've all taken
a tour of the gallery

81
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:43,122
and had the opportunity to
be dazzled by the variety

82
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:46,976
of talents bursting upon
the art scene today.

83
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,497
We here at the Bennini
like to keep an open eye,

84
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:53,979
an open heart, and an
open pocketbook for works

85
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:56,290
of vision and talent.

86
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,616
We're proud to present
Visions of the Millennium.

87
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:00,966
(applauding)

88
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,841
- Excuse me, you're Jennifer Cole,

89
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,020
the famous art critic for the weekly.

90
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,853
- Yeah.

91
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,306
- Or should I say the
famous junior art critic?

92
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,699
John Barnard, the artist
whose work you find

93
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,453
so derivative and undistinguished.

94
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,427
- Excuse me.

95
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:18,202
- No, excuse me for offending
your elevated sensibilities

96
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,684
with my, what'd you call it?

97
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:23,210
My well-orchestrated vacuities.

98
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,663
My talent for the nondescript.

99
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:27,170
- You didn't have to memorize your review.

100
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,569
I'd have sent you one.

101
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,381
- [John] You think this
Julian Jons character

102
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,025
is a real find, do you?

103
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:35,240
Deviant has-been spilling
his fucked up perversions

104
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,400
all over the canvas.

105
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,767
- Mr. Barnard, you know,
it's unfortunate your work

106
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,303
isn't as rude and obnoxious as you are.

107
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:43,192
At least then you could leave
some kind of an impression

108
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,025
on the viewer.

109
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,758
- Oh, I see, you're repressed.

110
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:47,841
- Huh?

111
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,002
- You know what you need?

112
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,149
A big, thick, stiff one between the legs

113
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,323
to open up your critical faculties.

114
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:54,156
- Yeah, you're right.

115
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,434
- You do.
- I do.

116
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:59,332
(speaking in foreign language)

117
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:02,343
- And especially in
these hard fiscal times.

118
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,282
- If you're as impotent
as your paintings--

119
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,546
- Oh, that's a good one.
- You're not gonna be

120
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,629
much help to me, are you?

121
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:14,748
- We need to support the
emerging artist and (coughing).

122
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,927
Because, excuse me, without our support.

123
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,805
Would you pardon me?

124
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,878
Julian, what a nice surprise.

125
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,582
I thought we agreed you were
going to stay out of sight

126
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:39,582
for a while.

127
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,816
- You sold the Anna.

128
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,066
- Yes, and congratulations.

129
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,438
The buyer is sponsoring your next show.

130
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,188
I was gonna call you.

131
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,397
- I thought we agreed that you'd wait.

132
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,947
Who's the buyer?

133
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,204
- He's a Mr. Rourke, and he's on the board

134
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,084
of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art.

135
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,209
You know what this could mean for us?

136
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,306
Listen, Julian, all you
have to do is lay low

137
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,929
and keep working.

138
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,688
We've got a marketing
strategy all laid out.

139
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,258
Just don't screw it up.

140
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:19,091
We want to capitalize
on the sense of mystery.

141
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,160
Julian, you're a great artist.

142
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,750
Your work stands tall on its own,

143
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,704
but you know you've got
a certain notoriety too,

144
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:34,546
and if we can make that work for us.

145
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,521
That's the name of the game, isn't it?

146
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,354
- Yeah, I guess it is.

147
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,658
- Make sure he goes out the back way.

148
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:26,227
- He's been gone since 1985,
and now suddenly he's back

149
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:29,181
producing radically different
work of enormous quality.

150
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,014
Where's he been?

151
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:30,847
What happened to him?

152
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:31,680
Where's he going?

153
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,083
I mean, there's a thousand
questions about him.

154
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,532
That isn't even a good reproduction.

155
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,592
In person, the colors are just so vibrant.

156
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,612
They really kind of pull
you into the canvas.

157
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,537
- I got a good feel from
your review that you were

158
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,817
getting sucked into something.

159
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,658
- Anyway, I wanna do an
in-depth interview with him.

160
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,947
I think he wants the attention.

161
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:55,089
- But how do you even know it is Jons?

162
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,315
The style looks very different.

163
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:59,391
- Because I saw him for a moment.

164
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:01,777
Oh, come on, it's gonna
be a great story, Sherman.

165
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,525
This forgotten young
artist back from the grave.

166
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,823
- Alright, angel, I guess
he's worth checking out.

167
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,490
Just keep me posted.

168
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,813
- I don't understand why you
won't give me his number.

169
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,632
It's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

170
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:23,888
- It's gallery policy.

171
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,221
- Oh, it is not.

172
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,128
You'd give me the number
of any one of these artists

173
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,922
in a second.

174
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,841
- Mr. Jons values his privacy.

175
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:35,314
- [Jennifer] Bollocks.

176
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,494
- If there's a message you'd
like to leave for him--

177
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,437
- There's a feature
article for this gallery.

178
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,520
Feature.

179
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,353
- Feature.

180
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,503
- Will he get this?

181
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,503
- Of course.

182
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:58,423
(dramatic orchestral music)

183
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,994
- Nice work, Julian.

184
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,234
- Never should've given
you a key to the studio.

185
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:07,420
- I've brought someone
I'd like you to meet.

186
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,512
Julian Jons, your
benefactor, Samuel Rourke.

187
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,262
- Pleasure, Mr. Jons.

188
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,076
I see, a little dirty.

189
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,559
Well, that's magnificent.

190
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,892
Is that Anna 15?

191
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,451
- 15, 16, I don't count 'em.

192
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,460
- Exciting news, Julian.

193
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,339
Mr. Rourke has a proposition for you.

194
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,779
- Really?

195
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,995
- Yes, I'd like to have a
portrait done of a lady friend.

196
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,476
- A portrait, well, you
wanna call a photographer.

197
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,055
(laughing)

198
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,706
- That's really good, Julian.

199
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,545
You're a funny man, isn't he Bennini?

200
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,388
- I only paint what I choose to paint.

201
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,791
- Don't misunderstand, Julian.

202
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,782
Mr. Rourke doesn't expect
you to change your style.

203
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,709
- No, not at all.

204
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,649
I just want you to use
her for inspiration,

205
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,882
and I'm sure she will inspire you.

206
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,899
- I don't use models, you know that.

207
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,194
- But it's commission, Julian.

208
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:07,002
- I don't do commissions.

209
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:09,954
- I can assure you, Mr.
Jons, the terms will be fair.

210
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:10,878
- I don't care!

211
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,216
I don't care about the terms!

212
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,296
I don't use models.

213
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:14,603
I don't need models.

214
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:17,020
I have all the images I need.

215
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,224
- He'll come around.

216
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,701
I'll talk to him.

217
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,103
- He's an artist.

218
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,936
One has to make allowances, right?

219
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:39,886
- The Annas are fine, Julian.

220
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:42,353
I mean, they're wonderful.

221
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,458
You just can't go on painting
the same thing forever.

222
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,125
You have to move on.

223
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,330
So you paint this girl.

224
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,096
Do whatever you want.

225
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,095
Give her four eyes, three
tits, and a nose in her navel.

226
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,595
I mean, who cares?

227
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,803
- I'm afraid.

228
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,983
- Afraid of what?

229
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:22,623
Seven years ago, you were a different man.

230
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,624
(laughing)

231
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:29,740
- [Samuel] That's very
good, Bennini, I like that.

232
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,477
- Julian, Mr. Rourke has
someone he'd like you to meet.

233
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:38,217
- Hello, Julian, may I introduce
you to Kristi Anderson?

234
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,363
- Mr. Jons, I really love your work.

235
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,196
- Hello.

236
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:47,421
- Don't stare at him, baby,
like he's one of his paintings.

237
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,841
She has beautiful eyes, doesn't she?

238
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:51,758
Bewitching.

239
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:03,822
- [Jennifer] He has to
come out sooner or later.

240
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,322
- How do you know?

241
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,705
You know, I really
don't see the attraction

242
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,896
of all this for you.

243
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,174
- I can work this into a major article.

244
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:14,250
I mean, I could get national exposure.

245
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,486
(snoring)

246
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,569
Don't start, it's my job.

247
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:22,754
- It's your job to sit
here on stakeout all day

248
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,377
waiting for some homicidal nutcase?

249
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,938
You know, if you're trying to get laid,

250
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,977
I can think of an easier way to do it.

251
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,634
- It's not just the fact
that he's painting again.

252
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,616
It's the fact that he's painting her,

253
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,271
the woman he destroyed.

254
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:38,761
I mean, that's just such a classic image.

255
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,928
The tortured romantic haunted
by his dreams, nightmares.

256
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,943
I don't know.

257
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:50,104
- Some guy carves up his
girlfriend a few years ago.

258
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:52,233
Now he's working it out in visual therapy.

259
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,440
That's his problem.

260
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,273
What does that have to do--

261
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,106
- Shh.

262
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,488
Okay, you stay here.

263
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:10,071
(ominous orchestral music)

264
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,988
- What are you doin' here, huh?

265
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,304
- Nothing.
- What do you want?

266
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,652
- Nothing.
- You're lying.

267
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,476
You're following me, why?

268
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,479
Who sent you?
- I'm not, nobody.

269
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,329
I'm an art critic.

270
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,114
My name's Jennifer Cole,
I'm with Arts Weekly.

271
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:07,947
- So what is it?

272
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:08,860
- I want to talk to you.

273
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,465
- About what?
- About your work.

274
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:12,420
- My work speaks for itself.

275
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,313
- [Jennifer] We want to do
an interview with you to go

276
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:16,730
with the opening of the show.

277
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,998
- So I'm good copy now, is that it?

278
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,337
The world wants to know.

279
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:27,837
- Yeah, I want to know.
- You want to know.

280
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:37,582
I like your eyes.

281
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,068
- [Jennifer] What were her eyes like?

282
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,651
- End of interview.

283
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,876
(gasping)

284
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:05,811
- Jennifer, you scared the shit out of me.

285
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:07,407
Well, what happened?

286
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,292
Did you talk to him?

287
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,708
- Just drive, okay?

288
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,458
- [Carrie] What am I, your slave?

289
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,419
(ominous orchestral music)

290
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,163
- Well?

291
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:43,276
- Turn around.

292
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:48,053
- What, are you lookin' for my best side?

293
00:22:50,956 --> 00:22:52,658
- No, that's not it.

294
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:53,491
Get up.

295
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:56,593
Here, have a seat.

296
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,290
Get up here.

297
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:34,959
(clearing throat)

298
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:38,031
- Come on, I thought we were having lunch.

299
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,448
- Listen to this.

300
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:44,076
Anna, the victim's eyes were
gouged out with a pallet knife

301
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,929
after strangling her to death.

302
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,626
In an especially grizzly touch,
the blood was then applied

303
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,658
to the canvas of a painting whose subject

304
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,962
was Miss Richardson herself.

305
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:52,795
- Jennifer.

306
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,094
- Miss Richardson's involvement
with another artist,

307
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:57,787
Paul Jackson, is said to
have triggered the incident.

308
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:00,380
The defendant, a hot, young
artist who exploded on the

309
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,368
New York art scene, is being
held in custody without bail.

310
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:07,399
He is scheduled to undergo
psychiatric examinations today.

311
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:08,232
- Wow.

312
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:11,153
- [Jennifer] Hold on one second.

313
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:11,986
Wait here.

314
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:18,820
- [Carrie] We said Thai, remember?

315
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,070
- Yeah, I know.

316
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,768
Okay, let's go.

317
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,333
- [Carrie] Oh, you're ready now?

318
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,412
Is that my shirt?

319
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,676
- No, not anymore.

320
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,575
So how did you get in
contact with Mr. Jons?

321
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,518
Do you know him from New York?

322
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:47,350
- No, I'd read about him
in the papers of course.

323
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,175
It's a tragic thing.

324
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,491
It haunts him still.

325
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,362
He loved her terribly.

326
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:55,195
- [Jennifer] Terribly.

327
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,431
- But no, it was just
a lucky circumstance.

328
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,052
I was down at the annual art fair

329
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:06,742
this winter in San
Francisco, and there it was.

330
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:10,492
Anna 14, shining like
a jewel in a dung heap.

331
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,057
Then, as everyone should
know, I brought him to town

332
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,796
and set him up in a studio.

333
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:21,707
- Where is that, the studio?

334
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:25,707
- Miss Cole, Julian is
an intensely private man.

335
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,584
He's scarred and he's fragile.

336
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:31,583
He needs to feel secure.

337
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:35,452
I can't breach that security
no matter how valuable

338
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,959
the resulting publicity might be.

339
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,209
You understand.

340
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:42,699
Oh, hello.

341
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:47,464
Miss Cole, this is my niece, Naomi.

342
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,131
- Your niece, hello.

343
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:54,914
- If you'll pardon me a moment,

344
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:57,414
my day seems to be filling up.

345
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:08,110
(ominous orchestral music)

346
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,486
- [John] Aw, you didn't have to steal it.

347
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:38,311
You could've just asked me for my number.

348
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,247
- Do you live here?

349
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:41,639
- I'm here to pick up a check.

350
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:44,148
You'll be happy to know my
undistinguished painting

351
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,488
sold at a very distinguished price.

352
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:47,321
- It's a miracle.

353
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:50,194
- Yeah, well some people
still recognize quality.

354
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,861
I recognize quality.

355
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:30,740
(mysterious orchestral music)

356
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:08,779
- Mr. Jons?

357
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,194
- Let's get started.

358
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:35,194
Who are you?

359
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,952
Oh, great, it's the little spy.

360
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,526
- Yeah, well, we didn't
finish our conversation.

361
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,554
- [Julian] I'm afraid you can't stay.

362
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:48,637
- Oh, what are you?

363
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:49,470
Ow.

364
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,342
You have a very strong grip.

365
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,273
- Comes with wrestling
with the muses I guess.

366
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:06,333
How'd you find me?

367
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,250
- I'm very resourceful.

368
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,514
- [Julian] What do you want?

369
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:14,514
- Oh, right.

370
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,186
Your work.

371
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:22,962
- [Julian] Spit it out.

372
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,277
- Okay, years ago in New York,
your work was very rational

373
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,230
and controlled, very.

374
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,869
And now there's a sense that it's.

375
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:43,116
It's a very powerful sense of,
well, violence and brutality.

376
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,074
- Please, spare me the psychobabble, okay?

377
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:53,637
I've had enough of it for one lifetime.

378
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:57,804
- I'd like you to explain in
your words the connection.

379
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:01,840
I mean, you know, as a critic--

380
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,507
- As a critic, you
shouldn't even speculate.

381
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:11,795
Stick with what you see.

382
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:26,567
This is what I paint.

383
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:32,108
That's all.

384
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,871
Like being in the seventh
circle of hell, huh?

385
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,990
- [Jennifer] It's her, isn't it?

386
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,823
Anna.

387
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,898
- The woman I loved, yeah.

388
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,731
- Julian?

389
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:05,565
- You can just go ahead and get changed.

390
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:10,914
Oh, I have to go.

391
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,164
I'm being paid.

392
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:20,648
- Do you think it would be
possible to talk later, you know?

393
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,136
- Do you know the expression
curiosity killed the cat?

394
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:29,969
- Mm hm.

395
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,685
- What did you do to your eyes?

396
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:46,594
- Well, you know I thought
maybe it would make them

397
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,427
look more interesting.

398
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,837
- Interesting?

399
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,896
It's frightening.

400
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,528
Hold still.

401
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:04,782
- Too much, huh?

402
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:06,115
- Just a little.

403
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:31,894
Later, yeah?

404
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:56,459
(ominous orchestral music)

405
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,220
(thudding bass music)
(crowd chattering)

406
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,970
Scotch rocks, please.

407
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:47,240
- There you go.

408
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:15,002
- I don't know what to say.

409
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:20,751
- I'm sure you got plenty of
questions in your notepad.

410
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:25,793
- Why'd you kiss me?

411
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:28,220
- That's an easy one.

412
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,150
Your lips were directly in my path,

413
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,817
and you painted your
eyes to attract me, so.

414
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,160
- This is not the most professional way

415
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,852
to conduct an interview.

416
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:41,378
- Why don't we just forget the interview?

417
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,295
- We should forget the whole thing.

418
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,177
I wish you would stop doing that.

419
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:52,092
- Miss Cole, I kissed you
because I was supposed to.

420
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,772
Did you find the experience so unpleasant?

421
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:58,471
- Well, so glad you two
could finally get together.

422
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,082
Perhaps we can hope for another

423
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,499
favorable article, Miss Cole.

424
00:35:04,784 --> 00:35:05,867
- Hi, Julian.

425
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:10,971
Fine, thanks, how are you?

426
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,218
Keeping fast company, I see.

427
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:16,950
Hi, Jen, how's life among the frigid?

428
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,494
Great, great.

429
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:21,394
Listen, you watch out for her, old man.

430
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:25,737
She's beautiful, but she's
got a stinger in that tail.

431
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:29,288
Just don't try doggy style,
you know what I mean?

432
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:32,121
Come on, Leo, I'll get us a table.

433
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:38,677
- Guess you can't always
trust your instincts, huh?

434
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,631
- Well, yes, Barnard is charming,

435
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:44,269
but there's a buyer for
every painting, Miss Cole.

436
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,395
You two have a nice evening.

437
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,145
- [Jennifer] You too.

438
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:59,581
Are you okay?

439
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:02,081
- Yeah, it just keeps me calm.

440
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:07,912
- Good.

441
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,585
- Nice place.

442
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,879
- Yeah, belongs to my dad.

443
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:34,071
He's living in Europe now,

444
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:37,738
so it's just me and my
roommate Carrie here.

445
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,838
Do you want a drink, tea or something?

446
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:03,121
Don't look at those.

447
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,925
- I'm no critic.

448
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:07,092
- I just do them to relax.

449
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,235
- You relax too much.

450
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:21,432
- You know, I used to paint rationally.

451
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,275
Very controlled, as you say.

452
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:33,311
But now I just paint with
brutality and violence

453
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,544
like I'm in some fuckin' frenzy.

454
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,639
(door slamming)

455
00:37:57,551 --> 00:38:00,968
(light orchestral music)

456
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:26,871
- That crazy artist, I cannot believe it.

457
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:28,536
- Believe it.

458
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:31,125
- Jack the fucking Ripper.

459
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,408
This is not a joke, Jenny,
he's a dangerous man.

460
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,926
Do you know how many
unsolved murders there are

461
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:35,759
in this town?

462
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,631
- What about the jerk you
were out with last night?

463
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,837
He could be a serial
killer, you don't know.

464
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,597
- But you do know, that is the point.

465
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:43,124
You know what you're
getting into bed with.

466
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:45,052
- Christ, Carrie, please.

467
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:47,523
I mean, that was a long time ago.

468
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,604
Just lay off, will you?

469
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:50,894
- You know what, you're right.

470
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:51,735
I'm sure you're gonna be safe.

471
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:55,735
I'm sure it's probably
out of his system by now.

472
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm sorry, but this does
not look anything like him.

473
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,176
- You saw him?

474
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:20,094
- Of course, I saw you
from the window, tramp.

475
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:20,927
- Pervert.

476
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:40,351
- Okay?
- Yeah.

477
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,874
- So why do I collect art, Jennifer?

478
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:48,336
Well, I've been acquiring
things all my life,

479
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:51,453
companies, buildings, people.

480
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:53,628
I spent my whole life making money.

481
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:54,461
- Yeah.

482
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,812
- Now it doesn't seem to be enough.

483
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:01,479
Something's missing.

484
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:06,313
- So art serves as a
compensation for that.

485
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:09,146
- Well, I sympathize with artists.

486
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:12,807
We're on the same wavelength, you know?

487
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:16,974
Create, build, acquire, it's
an expression of power you see?

488
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:22,470
- Why the particular
interest in Julian Jons?

489
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,974
- Why not?

490
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:28,141
He's very much like me,
single-minded, obsessed, haunted.

491
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,749
You could say I've been
waiting for Julian Jons

492
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:35,916
to come along.

493
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,577
What is your particular interest
in Mr. Jons if I may ask?

494
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,848
- I think he's a very talented individual.

495
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:47,765
- Yes, he certainly is.

496
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:12,219
♫ I sit alone in front
of all I'll ever known

497
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:16,191
♫ Painting days and painting time

498
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:19,081
♫ Hangs near this funny rhyme

499
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:23,248
♫ By the window waits for wind to blow

500
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:29,575
♫ The world's a theater, a place I play

501
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:33,357
♫ Words are heard and never read

502
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,389
♫ I'm trying to rip them from my head

503
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:41,166
♫ And endlessly I'm watching my parade

504
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:44,012
♫ My hat hangs near the crosstown train

505
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:48,501
♫ The crosstown park and mindless rain

506
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,084
♫ Way down Strawberry Lane

507
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:57,285
♫ Way down Strawberry Lane

508
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,302
♫ Way down Strawberry Lane

509
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:09,012
♫ Way down Strawberry Lane

510
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:21,333
- Oh, how's that dynamite article coming?

511
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,500
- It's coming.

512
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:26,680
Yeah, I'm thinking about it right now.

513
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:11,241
(mysterious orchestral music)

514
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:34,834
Julian?

515
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:47,366
Julian?

516
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:10,431
Is Julian here?

517
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:14,325
- You mean J?

518
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:24,800
I wanted to apologize
for my jerky behavior.

519
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:30,235
I've been a jerk, haven't I?

520
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,706
- I'm sure you can't help it.

521
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,549
- Listen, I'm sorry for
tricking you into coming here,

522
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:37,026
but I had a very good reason.

523
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:38,609
- I expect you did.

524
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:40,974
- First.

525
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:46,654
My phone number.

526
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:57,345
Now you can call me whenever you want to.

527
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:01,867
And second, I'm interested
in painting you.

528
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:04,056
- Are you?

529
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:05,919
- Yes, I am.

530
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:11,602
I think you have the kind of
body that would lend itself

531
00:47:11,602 --> 00:47:13,352
well to a nude study.

532
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:17,924
I'm an artist too, you know.

533
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:24,521
If I had painted Anna, a
beautiful and sensuous woman,

534
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:30,431
that's exactly what she would've been.

535
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,348
Beautiful and sensuous.

536
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,290
Not a bunch of limbs and a torso.

537
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:41,914
Oh God, what is the attaction here, huh?

538
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:43,805
What is it?

539
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:46,442
I mean, let's face it.

540
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:50,328
We're dealing with a
paranoid schizophrenic here.

541
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:51,948
The man's a pro.

542
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:56,757
He starts his career off
as a disciple of Matisse,

543
00:47:56,757 --> 00:48:01,387
and then seven years and
a fuckin' murder later,

544
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:03,672
he's Edvard Munch.

545
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,839
I mean, look at how he signs his name.

546
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:10,209
- He uses his left hand.

547
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:11,985
I think he's superstitious.

548
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:14,215
- That's just the point.

549
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:17,230
He never used to sign
his paintings at all.

550
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,313
And what about that left hand?

551
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:21,796
- What about it?

552
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:24,110
- Well, surely you're aware, Miss Cole,

553
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,610
that Julian Jons was a lefthanded painter.

554
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,784
And we know that this was
executed by a right hand.

555
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,107
Or was that superstition too?

556
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,305
- What exactly is your point?

557
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:43,638
- Figure it out.

558
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:46,823
I was there, too, you know.

559
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,740
I knew Anna Richardson.

560
00:48:49,615 --> 00:48:51,586
- [Jennifer] Did you?

561
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:54,550
- I was young and naive then.

562
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,828
I've matured since then.

563
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:58,495
- What was she like?

564
00:48:59,517 --> 00:49:00,881
- What are you like?

565
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:03,396
What is Jennifer Cole like?

566
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:05,188
Are you adventurous?

567
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:09,309
You ever make love on
a waxed hardwood floor?

568
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:13,476
Get up enough speed, pretty
soon you're hydroplaning.

569
00:49:16,768 --> 00:49:20,651
It's a bad idea, you know, you and Julian.

570
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:24,294
A critic should never fall for an artist.

571
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,544
Conflict of interest, babe.

572
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:41,605
- What was it like in the hospitals?

573
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:46,208
- You mean the asylum.

574
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:49,471
That's what it was, an asylum.

575
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:51,971
Here, will you hold this down?

576
00:50:02,408 --> 00:50:05,908
It was a retreat from the world basically.

577
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:10,924
There's no time, there's no life.

578
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,081
- Did you paint while you were in there?

579
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:13,914
- What, like Van Gogh?

580
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:15,997
Was I a visionary madman?

581
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:18,179
No.

582
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:26,787
- When did you start
painting right handed?

583
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:30,954
You know, all your earlier
work was with your left.

584
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:36,078
- My left hand has blood on it,

585
00:50:39,902 --> 00:50:42,569
so it's lost the right to paint.

586
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:48,492
- It's amazing.

587
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:52,659
I mean, you know, you paint
just as well if not better.

588
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,186
- You want to hear
about the murder, right?

589
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:06,353
- [Jennifer] No, not if you
don't want to talk about it.

590
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:14,540
- Well, I'll tell you what I remember.

591
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,623
I remember her voice
turning wild like an animal,

592
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:24,871
like nothing I've ever heard.

593
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,288
I remember blood.

594
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,550
I don't know whose, hers or mine.

595
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:41,191
Everything else is all just a dream.

596
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,624
I mean, I reach out for it to grab it,

597
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:48,541
but it just slips away.

598
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:55,583
All that's real to me is the scream.

599
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,286
I hear that every night.

600
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:57,215
- Sometimes you just scare me.

601
00:52:58,664 --> 00:52:59,497
- Yeah.

602
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:32,450
- [Sherman] Well, let me try
and put this delicately, Jen.

603
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:36,569
There's talk that you're shacking up

604
00:54:36,569 --> 00:54:39,377
with this Julian Jons character.

605
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,960
- [Jennifer] That's ridiculous.

606
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:47,419
- You were seen together.

607
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,493
- I'm interviewing him.

608
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:51,576
I'm getting his thoughts.

609
00:54:56,725 --> 00:55:00,939
- Your personal life
is your personal thing,

610
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:04,189
but there are questions of ethics here.

611
00:55:06,196 --> 00:55:09,079
- I'm a professional,
I know what I'm doing.

612
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,923
- Jennifer, Jennifer,
artists are funny people.

613
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:15,922
They feed off their own obsessions.

614
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:19,775
You can't separate them from their demons.

615
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,275
You shouldn't try.

616
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,187
- I know what I'm doing.

617
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,166
- Hope you do.

618
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:40,562
(eerie music)

619
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:51,097
Artists are funny people.

620
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:55,233
They feed off their own obsessions.

621
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:58,733
You can't separate them from their demons.

622
00:56:01,468 --> 00:56:03,613
- A critic should never
fall for an artist.

623
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:05,615
- Glad you two could finally get together.

624
00:56:05,615 --> 00:56:08,032
(laughing)

625
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,532
Is he a good fuck?

626
00:56:41,672 --> 00:56:45,339
(dramatic orchestral music)

627
00:56:56,555 --> 00:56:57,388
- Hello?

628
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:02,988
Hello?

629
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:10,416
Hello?

630
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:21,980
I just wanted to talk
about Anna Richardson.

631
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,939
- Anna Richardson, hmm.

632
00:57:26,939 --> 00:57:30,356
Anna Richardson, how do I know that name?

633
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:33,316
- You said you knew her.

634
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,101
- Well, I did.

635
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,804
Anna knew everybody.

636
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:40,762
She'd just jump from one artist to another

637
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:43,137
like a hungry flea.

638
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:46,018
I mean, I was young and naive then.

639
00:57:46,018 --> 00:57:50,185
I told you that, but I did
manage to satisfy her desires

640
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,196
on one occasion.

641
00:57:55,196 --> 00:57:58,089
- But she was in love
with Julian, wasn't she?

642
00:57:58,089 --> 00:58:00,591
- Anna was in love with Anna.

643
00:58:00,591 --> 00:58:02,341
There was no contest.

644
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:07,187
Listen, I'd love to invite you in, but...

645
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:11,071
- Your Leo's niece.

646
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:13,331
- Right.

647
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,243
Jennifer, come join us.

648
00:58:22,788 --> 00:58:24,288
- Some other time.

649
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,786
(dramatic orchestral music)

650
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:23,424
(screaming)

651
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:26,057
- The fuck are you doing?

652
00:59:26,057 --> 00:59:28,819
- Cut your hair or don't come back here.

653
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,902
Get the fuck out of here.

654
00:59:37,183 --> 00:59:40,016
(water splashing)

655
00:59:52,963 --> 00:59:53,956
Remind me.

656
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:55,153
My medication's almost gone.

657
00:59:55,153 --> 00:59:57,320
I need to get it refilled.

658
00:59:58,924 --> 01:00:01,174
- Can we stay here tonight?

659
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:04,598
- [Julian] Here, why?

660
01:00:04,598 --> 01:00:06,775
- Well, 'cause my editor
says that I shouldn't be seen

661
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:07,608
with you in public.

662
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,858
It's unethical.

663
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:13,656
- Well, ethical or not,
there's no food here, so--

664
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:15,073
- I'm not hungry.

665
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:21,943
I just would like to stay
here with you tonight.

666
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:31,139
- I don't want to stay here.

667
01:00:34,638 --> 01:00:37,782
- Maybe you don't want me to stay here.

668
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:38,615
- Come on.

669
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:39,448
- What?

670
01:00:42,913 --> 01:00:45,985
Do think it would offend her?

671
01:00:45,985 --> 01:00:46,881
- Oh, please.

672
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:51,048
- Well, she's always with
you, even when you're with me.

673
01:00:52,123 --> 01:00:52,956
- Stop it.

674
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,876
- She cheated on you, Julian.

675
01:00:57,876 --> 01:00:59,543
She didn't love you.

676
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:03,013
- I'm not gonna discuss Anna with you.

677
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:04,184
You didn't know her, alright?

678
01:01:04,184 --> 01:01:05,138
- You won't discuss it--

679
01:01:05,138 --> 01:01:06,409
- No, and you couldn't understand it.

680
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:07,692
- Oh, I couldn't?

681
01:01:07,692 --> 01:01:09,242
She's dead for Christ's sake, she's gone.

682
01:01:09,242 --> 01:01:10,075
- Shut up!

683
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:15,556
Jennifer.

684
01:01:15,556 --> 01:01:19,139
(ominous orchestral music)

685
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:38,530
- To the portrait of Kristi
and the new Julian Jons show.

686
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,971
- Yes, and to the genius of Jons.

687
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:45,160
And when do I get to
look at this masterpiece?

688
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,004
I'm curious to see what I paid for.

689
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,421
- Tomorrow, stop by the loft.

690
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:00,163
(laughing)

691
01:02:15,226 --> 01:02:18,554
- They told me that the
painting was finished.

692
01:02:18,554 --> 01:02:20,721
I'd really love to see it.

693
01:02:39,244 --> 01:02:41,161
Is this how you see me?

694
01:03:00,406 --> 01:03:01,239
- Anna.

695
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:06,638
("Requiem in D Minor" by Mozart)

696
01:05:21,657 --> 01:05:25,240
(ominous orchestral music)

697
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:38,562
(shouting)
(glass shattering)

698
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:43,001
- Jenny, Jenny.
- What?

699
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,020
- He's outside.
- Who?

700
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,914
- [Carrie] Maybe we
should call the police.

701
01:05:46,914 --> 01:05:49,164
(knocking)

702
01:06:03,507 --> 01:06:07,590
- Excuse me, lady, who's
got the $15 for the cab?

703
01:06:09,772 --> 01:06:12,189
- Will you take care of that?

704
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,531
- I warned her.

705
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:21,448
I warned her, didn't I?

706
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:43,766
She was with me last night.

707
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:49,502
She came to see the painting.

708
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,016
I slept with her.

709
01:06:57,802 --> 01:06:59,052
I was drinking.

710
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:09,335
I feel asleep, or I passed out.

711
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:15,245
This morning,

712
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,483
she was in the bathroom.

713
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:34,982
Her eyes.

714
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:41,114
(ominous orchestral music)

715
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:45,210
- He can't stay here.

716
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,837
- Maybe he imagined the whole thing.

717
01:07:46,837 --> 01:07:47,990
- [Carrie] Did he imagine the blood?

718
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:50,029
- It was his own blood.

719
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:50,862
He was drinking.

720
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:52,445
He's on medication.

721
01:07:56,988 --> 01:07:58,566
I should go over to his place and see if--

722
01:07:58,566 --> 01:07:59,683
- Are you nuts?

723
01:07:59,683 --> 01:08:01,433
Let the cops do that.

724
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:06,756
You're not going over there by yourself.

725
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:15,234
(ominous orchestral music)

726
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:17,574
Keys.

727
01:08:51,244 --> 01:08:52,299
- Hello?

728
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:53,716
- I'm right here.

729
01:09:14,968 --> 01:09:17,468
Oh my God, look at this place.

730
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,253
- No, she was here.

731
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,305
She was right here.

732
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:33,958
- I don't know, maybe you
dreamt the whole thing.

733
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:43,271
I could get that refilled for you.

734
01:10:43,271 --> 01:10:46,271
You get some rest, and I'll do that.

735
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:09,638
You know, I'm beginning
to think that there was

736
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:10,772
a body up there.

737
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:12,234
- Right, but we couldn't see
her because she was painted

738
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,322
to blend in with the tile floor.

739
01:11:13,322 --> 01:11:14,929
- She wasn't dead.

740
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:16,606
Someone's trying to fuck with his mind.

741
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:17,959
- Who is Paul Jackson?

742
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:18,792
- Who?

743
01:11:20,785 --> 01:11:22,691
Paul Jackson, I don't know.

744
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:23,676
- Didn't he have something to do with

745
01:11:23,676 --> 01:11:25,812
that model getting killed?

746
01:11:25,812 --> 01:11:27,390
Remember, you read it
to me from that article

747
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,390
that day in your office.

748
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:38,846
- Just get those things
and meet back at the loft

749
01:11:38,846 --> 01:11:39,804
in an hour.

750
01:11:39,804 --> 01:11:40,971
- Okay.
- Okay.

751
01:11:52,994 --> 01:11:54,019
- Hello.
- Hello.

752
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:56,586
- I don't have time
for an interview today.

753
01:11:56,586 --> 01:12:00,086
- No, I wanted to return something to you.

754
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:03,187
Did you lose this?

755
01:12:03,187 --> 01:12:05,094
That's yours, isn't it?

756
01:12:05,094 --> 01:12:06,559
- It was.

757
01:12:06,559 --> 01:12:08,960
I gave it to someone as a gift.

758
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,793
- Who?

759
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,416
- Look, I really don't
have time for this today.

760
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:14,558
We're moving things around
for the new Julian Jons show,

761
01:12:14,558 --> 01:12:15,819
and we're all very excited,

762
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:17,074
but we're very much under the gun.

763
01:12:17,074 --> 01:12:17,907
- Yeah, I should imagine so.

764
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:21,824
What are you gonna call
it, Visions of Madness?

765
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:26,563
I mean, insanity is a
very good selling point.

766
01:12:28,438 --> 01:12:30,856
Is that what this is all about?

767
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,034
You're gonna capitalize
on Julian's instability.

768
01:12:34,034 --> 01:12:38,201
Make sure he comes off as
crazy whatever that takes.

769
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:42,005
It is a good way to drive
up the prices I suppose.

770
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:43,967
- Always the cynic.

771
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:48,036
The reality is I sold the
entire collection outright

772
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:49,284
weeks ago.

773
01:12:49,284 --> 01:12:50,117
- Did you?

774
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:54,987
Does this person know who he's getting?

775
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:06,234
Can you explain this to me,

776
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:09,233
why he has Paul Jackson's medication?

777
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:13,400
- Ah, Paul Jackson, it's
another of Julian's aliases.

778
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:15,793
- [Jennifer] He would
use the name of the man

779
01:13:15,793 --> 01:13:18,164
that caused him to kill his girlfriend?

780
01:13:18,164 --> 01:13:22,144
- Well, Julian always did have
a penchant for the macabre.

781
01:13:22,144 --> 01:13:23,352
- I wonder what the Chicago Museum of Art

782
01:13:23,352 --> 01:13:25,252
will think of all this.

783
01:13:25,252 --> 01:13:27,434
- Now, wait just a second.

784
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:29,324
Now, let's not be too hasty.

785
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:31,092
- You know, I don't
care what kind of a scam

786
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,509
you've got going.

787
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:36,933
I just want to know who this man is.

788
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:52,308
- The real Julian Jons is dead.

789
01:13:54,156 --> 01:13:56,489
Yes, it was three years ago.

790
01:13:57,705 --> 01:14:00,756
He came to me after he left the hospital.

791
01:14:00,756 --> 01:14:02,294
He was looking for help,

792
01:14:02,294 --> 01:14:05,774
and I offered to take a look at his work.

793
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,705
But he didn't have any.

794
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:09,434
And I offered to support him

795
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:13,046
in exchange for exclusive representation.

796
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:15,046
But he couldn't produce.

797
01:14:15,968 --> 01:14:18,053
There was nothing left.

798
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,970
Anna had taken his genius with her.

799
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:25,634
A month or so later he was gone.

800
01:14:25,634 --> 01:14:26,930
- He killed himself?

801
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,763
- Yes, he died a complete unknown.

802
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:36,549
So when I came across Anna
14, I knew it was a fake.

803
01:14:37,924 --> 01:14:41,674
A very good fake, and
a very profitable fake.

804
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:44,507
- And Paul,

805
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:50,637
is he in on this?

806
01:14:50,637 --> 01:14:53,554
- No, he really thinks he's Julian.

807
01:14:58,867 --> 01:15:01,125
I'm not a psychiatrist.

808
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:04,316
I don't know how to explain it.

809
01:15:04,316 --> 01:15:06,934
- But he isn't a murderer.

810
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:08,524
- Not as far as I know.

811
01:15:08,524 --> 01:15:11,622
I mean, he assumed Julian's
name and personality,

812
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:14,779
and he may have assumed his
homicidal tendencies too.

813
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,282
I mean, time will tell.

814
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:18,932
But now, this is all off the record.

815
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:23,099
I will deny it publicly
with the greatest vehemence.

816
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,279
- Hi.
- Hey, you okay?

817
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:32,631
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

818
01:15:32,631 --> 01:15:33,521
- Here's your folder.

819
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:34,354
- Thanks.

820
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:35,852
Do you have any cash?

821
01:15:35,852 --> 01:15:37,435
- [Carrie] I don't.

822
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:57,050
- Seven years ago, Julian
killed Anna Richardson

823
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:01,561
because she was in love with Paul Jackson.

824
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:08,850
Julian went to an asylum,
and Paul disappeared.

825
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:18,764
And then last year you
turn up in San Francisco,

826
01:17:20,873 --> 01:17:25,040
signing your paintings as
Julian Jons, but Julian's dead.

827
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:27,692
He killed himself.

828
01:17:30,965 --> 01:17:32,715
Are you Paul Jackson?

829
01:17:33,596 --> 01:17:35,751
- What in the hell are you talking about?

830
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,092
- Were you there?

831
01:17:37,092 --> 01:17:38,413
Did you hear her get murdered?

832
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:41,141
That's why you say that
you hear her screaming

833
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:43,042
in your head all the time.

834
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:45,082
- Yeah, I was there.

835
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:46,751
I killed her.

836
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:50,918
- On the medication, it says
your name's Paul Jackson.

837
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,753
- [Julian] It's an alias.

838
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:02,132
- Do you really believe that you are him,

839
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:06,520
or are you just fucking with everybody?

840
01:18:07,994 --> 01:18:10,113
- I am who I say I am.

841
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:11,780
- You're a murderer.

842
01:18:12,712 --> 01:18:14,978
- Yes, I'm a fucking--

843
01:18:14,978 --> 01:18:16,061
- Murder me.

844
01:18:16,061 --> 01:18:18,160
Here, come on, do it.

845
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:18,993
Stick my eye out.

846
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:20,826
Come on, do it, do it.

847
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,970
- I'm no killer, huh?

848
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:28,781
I'm no murderer?

849
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:43,487
How 'bout this, huh?

850
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:44,737
What about her?

851
01:19:02,777 --> 01:19:06,709
- Hello, Miss Cole, what
a pleasant surprise.

852
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:08,517
What's the matter?

853
01:19:08,517 --> 01:19:10,152
Julian, are you up to
your old tricks again?

854
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:11,235
- I have to call the police.

855
01:19:11,235 --> 01:19:13,676
- No, you're not calling the police.

856
01:19:13,676 --> 01:19:14,509
It's too soon for the police.

857
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:17,055
And don't you move, just stay there.

858
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:17,888
Back up.

859
01:19:19,615 --> 01:19:20,837
Now, first things first.

860
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:22,825
Give me the pen.

861
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:24,658
That's right, the pen.

862
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:29,429
Leo told me you had it, now give it up.

863
01:19:32,032 --> 01:19:32,865
That's it.

864
01:19:38,531 --> 01:19:39,864
Oh, that's cute.

865
01:19:41,352 --> 01:19:42,269
Pick it up.

866
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:44,212
Pick it up!

867
01:19:57,607 --> 01:19:58,440
Thank you.

868
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,570
Very clever of her, Julian, isn't it?

869
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,099
- He's not Julian.

870
01:20:02,099 --> 01:20:05,670
- How very perceptive of you, Miss Cole.

871
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,821
You know, I made that same
observation at the opening,

872
01:20:09,821 --> 01:20:14,340
which is precisely why I
have to protect my interests.

873
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,923
You see, he must die as Julian.

874
01:20:18,586 --> 01:20:20,630
You can follow that, can't you?

875
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,047
I knew you could.

876
01:20:23,008 --> 01:20:27,801
It's just you poor thing,
you're unfortunate enough

877
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:31,384
to be in the wrong
place at the right time.

878
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:34,311
(laughing)

879
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:37,112
So you see when the cops get here, well,

880
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:40,810
they're gonna have two bloody murders

881
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:43,893
and one very ghastly looking suicide.

882
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:47,474
Paul.

883
01:20:49,176 --> 01:20:53,766
Paul, do you know what's
like when a gun goes off

884
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,849
through the roof of your mouth, Paul?

885
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:05,115
It spackles your brains
on the fuckin' wall.

886
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:08,175
Kind of like a Jackson Pollock, you know?

887
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:11,112
That may be worth more down
the road than that goddamn

888
01:21:11,112 --> 01:21:14,261
stupid fuckin' Anna
series I bought from you.

889
01:21:14,261 --> 01:21:15,450
(laughing)

890
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,367
- Jen, what's goin' on?

891
01:21:25,016 --> 01:21:27,255
(gunshot banging)

892
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:29,422
(gasping)

893
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:48,407
- I was waiting for Anna
outside Julian's loft.

894
01:21:48,407 --> 01:21:50,175
I heard her scream.

895
01:21:50,175 --> 01:21:51,258
I ran inside.

896
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:57,016
I watched him gouge her eyes out.

897
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,640
I couldn't even move.

898
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:13,890
I could've saved her,
but I was just frozen.

899
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:24,809
And I turned and started
walking, and I ever stopped.

900
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:30,978
I just kept on walking.

901
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:00,267
- Hello, excuse me.

902
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,362
Need you to come with us
and give us a statement.

903
01:23:11,647 --> 01:23:15,314
(dramatic orchestral music)

904
01:23:55,893 --> 01:24:00,015
♫ Will I speak to you tomorrow

905
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:04,182
♫ Just keep screamin' the
same old line as before

906
01:24:07,913 --> 01:24:11,067
♫ You won't listen to what I'm sayin'

907
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:15,342
♫ You wanna make sure
that there's no surprise

908
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,092
♫ To you anymore

909
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:22,685
♫ And I know you mean it when you say it

910
01:24:22,685 --> 01:24:25,314
♫ That you really want to end it

911
01:24:25,314 --> 01:24:29,481
♫ But it's plainly not
as simple as you say

912
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,011
♫ I'm trying not to get too distant

913
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:36,878
♫ But your story's too inconsistent

914
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:41,045
♫ And you deny it and
you lied to me every day

915
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:47,991
♫ Painting pictures and pretending

916
01:24:47,991 --> 01:24:52,158
♫ Dreaming of a world
that can never ever be

917
01:24:55,833 --> 01:25:00,000
♫ Making it fit your story ending

918
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,631
♫ Peace be on your ashes cast to sea

919
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:06,982
♫ I hope you find your secret

920
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:11,149
♫ Peace be on your ashes cast to sea

921
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:29,636
♫ I guess you'll miss the coming new year

922
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:34,029
♫ You said you hated them anyway

923
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:36,993
♫ Ain't nothin' new

924
01:25:36,993 --> 01:25:40,890
♫ Same old reruns on TV

925
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:45,181
♫ Same old sun goin' down every day

926
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:48,681
♫ Goin' right down on you

927
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:54,095
♫ Painting pictures and pretending

928
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:58,262
♫ Dreaming of a world
that can never ever be

929
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:05,912
♫ Making it fit your story ending

930
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:10,972
♫ Peace be on your ashes cast to sea

931
01:26:10,972 --> 01:26:12,947
♫ Hope you find your secret

932
01:26:12,947 --> 01:26:17,114
♫ Peace be on your ashes cast to sea

933
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:42,503
♫ Is it so much better where you're goin'

934
01:26:42,503 --> 01:26:45,334
♫ You can tie shoes, nearly all you know

935
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:49,501
♫ And now the reaper
gonna be your only prayer

936
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:03,568
