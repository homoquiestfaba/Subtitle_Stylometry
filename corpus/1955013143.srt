her place of origin,

Date of birth or if
Ulrika's even her real name,

96

that she trusts no man

is a former Soviet prison.

With a long shot,

107
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,944
Now, the problem with that
is, other than Grigori,

108
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,546
She's completely paranoid
about all men.

109
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,381
I mean,
her psych evaluation says

110
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,417
That it's
almost pathological,
unresolved paternal...

112
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,753

started knocking at her door.

114
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,589

about women?

115
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:56,957
Oh, her hate is unisex.

116
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,492
She thinks women are weak

117
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,027
And underestimates them.

118
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,595

who we go with.

119
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,796

we could get them out

Without blowing their cover
or getting them killed,

128

need to think outside

00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,315
But time is money.

183
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,452
Mae-Lin Fong,
explosive ordnance disposal,

184
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,722
Qualified
multiengine pilot.

185
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,089
I also play piano.

186
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,459
Then you turned
self-styled techno-anarchist,

187
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,695
Blew up what you
described at the trial

188
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,331
As a "crooked
Wall Street bank."

189
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,099
Sentenced to 15 years.

190
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,701
[Mouths words]

191
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,002
What does a Chinese girl

192
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,771
Know about
making bombs, anyway?

193
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,974
[Faking accent]
Oh, the Chinese
invented gunpowder.

194
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,343
[No accent]
Or did they not
teach you that

195
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,377
In the trailer park,
sugar tits?

196
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,751
Kathryn Morgan,
Marine-Corps-qualified
scout sniper.

197
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,386
10 years for shooting up
your boyfriend's truck

198
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,221
While he and
his mistress were in it.

199
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,222
Shocker.

200
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,058
Not that great of a job.

201
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,059
You missed.

202
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,861
If I wanted them dead,

203
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,163
I would have
only needed two rounds.

204
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,766
I was just teaching
that cheap bastard
a lesson.

205
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,170
Cassandra Clay,
part of the pilot program

206
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,372
To prove that women
can serve in combat.

207
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,875
Ranger school, then Delta.

208
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,911
You were even given command
of your own little unit.

209
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,213
A real old G.I. Jane...

210
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,852
Until you lost half
your team in Afghanistan,

211
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,987
Attacked your C.O.

212
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,290
25 years
for nearly killing him.

213
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,525
You broke his arm,

214
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,361
Broke his legs,
one in four places,

215
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,832
Broke three ribs,
which resulted
in puncturing his lung.

216
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,134
You squashed
his eye socket.

217
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,837
Look, I can't
take credit
for all of that.

218
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,806
He was also
hit by a truck.

219
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,207
When you threw him
into it.

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,175
And then
at your court-martial,

221
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,778
Not one peep of why.

222
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,947
I couldn't recall.

223
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,817
Saving the best
for last?

224
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,120
Raven.

225
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,057
I'm not gonna tell
your real name,

226
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,559
Agency courtesy and all.

227
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,095
That, and I'd crush
your fucking throat.

228
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,000
You've seen
everybody's dirty laundry.

229
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,269
I think it's time
they see yours.

230
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,272
You see,
Raven was one of us.

231
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,942
We taught her how
to seduce and kill,

232
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,011
And she did it well,
very well,

233
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:01,949
Until she started moonlighting
as a hit woman for hire.

234
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,818
Private sector
paid good.

235
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,020
We might have
turned our backs on that,

236
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,056
But then you
killed one of ours.

237
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,358
That paid even better.

238
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,160
You're all pieces of shit...

239
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,497
But today you're
lucky pieces of shit,

240
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,399
Because Uncle Sam
wants you.

241
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,369
Uncle Sam must be really
fucking desperate.

242
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,004
The President's daughter

243
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,974
Was kidnapped
by an Amazonian she-bitch,

244
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,376
And she has her hostage
in some castle

245
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,478
In the backwoods
of Shit-hole-istan,

246
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,347
And she wants us
to prop her up
as new head of state.

247
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,849
We're gonna tell her
go to hell.

248
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,451
First, we need
to get Elise back,

249
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,054
So this is the reason I'm
putting this team together.

250
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:45,058
Kat, long-range
interdictions,
communications.

251
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,094
Mei-Lin, explosives.

252
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,362
Raven,
close-quarters wetwork.

253
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:53,400
Clay, tactical training
and command.

254
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,204
You get in, grab the girl,
get out. Simple.

255
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,909
Just the four of us?
No backup?

256
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,510
Right.

257
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,611
Simple.

258
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,513
Sounds like
a suicide mission.

259
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,448
Well, that's why
we're sending in
you four.

260
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,884
Oh lovely.

261
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:11,985
What's the job pay?

262
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,487
We've been authorized

263
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,323
To give each of you
a full Presidential pardon.

264
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,993
And even you, Raven,

265
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,430
With potential to be
reinstated in your
previous positions.

266
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,100
Of course, that's gonna
depend on the success
of the mission.

267
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,069
How does that sound,
Captain?

268
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,106
What happens
if we say no?

269
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,242
Well, if you say no,

270
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,977
Then you go
back to your hole,

271
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,578
And you serve
the maximum sentence.

272
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,148
We might even put
a few more charges
on top of that,

273
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,117
Depending on how vindictive
the President feels

274
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,987
When his daughter
comes home in several
small packages.

275
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,658
So what's it gonna be,
ladies?

276
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,530
When do we start?

277
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,433
We already have.

278
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,551
[Crying]
[clang]

279
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,262
I brought you
some food, hon.

280
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,041
[Snaps fingers]

281
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,413
Did the cook
char your chicken?

282
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,020
May not be
a state dinner,

283
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:57,390
But it's more than
virtually every resident
here eats in a day.

284
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,758
You shouldn't waste it.

285
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,495
The United States
doesn't do any negotiations.

286
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,433
For the masses, no,

287
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,001
But for you,

288
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,471
The rules are different,

289
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,307
And there's
virtually no price

290
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,643
Your father wouldn't pay
to get you back.

291
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,146
What makes you think
that he won't bomb you

292
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,748
Even farther
to the Stone Age
if something happens to me?

293
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,085
[Chuckles]

294
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,155
So educated,
yet so naïve.

295
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,524
The bullying Americans

296
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,261
Invading
another poor nation
for revenge?

297
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,307
Not in an election year.

298
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,112
The exit!

299
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,613
Now!

300
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,448
Silly girl.

301
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,749
[Chuckles]

302
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,791
Step away,
or she's dead!

303
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,194
Try anything funny,

304
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,195
And I'll slit
your throat!

305
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,196
Go ahead! Slit my throat!

306
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,131
I give you permission!

307
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,333
I am not
fooling around here!

308
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,401
Neither am I.

309
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,402
Shut up!

310
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,836
I swear I'll do it!

311
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,605
Do it!
Shut up!

312
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,308
Killing me
is the only way
out of here! Do it!

313
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,475
Shut up!

314
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,112
How disappointing.

315
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,717
I promised not to harm you,
not yet,

316
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,388
But you do understand
that insolence cannot
go unpunished.

317
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,761
Someone else has to be
punished in your place.

318
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,431
No! Let me go!

319
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,865
Stop! No!

320
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,567
No. Please.

321
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,170
[Speaking
Slavic language]

322
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,807
Please. No.

323
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,176
[Sobbing]

324
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,578
[Kiss]

325
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,649
You remember this

326
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,384
Next time you try
anything foolish, bitch!

327
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,457
[Exhales]

328
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,427
[Sighs]

329
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,209
Feel free.

330
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,320
No, uh,
changing rooms?

331
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,121
Bashful, are we?

332
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,661
You want to unhook
the back?

333
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,447
[Sighs]

334
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,850
Ladies.

335
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,453
Better than
prison jumpsuits,
isn't it?

336
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,727
We put together
something special
for each of you

337
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,363
That suits
your individual tastes.

338
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,900
It's German-made,

339
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,770
Blaser R93 bolt action
sniper rifle.

340
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,574
Shoots a .338 Lapua Magnum
with a five-round load,

341
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,743
Comes customized
for you, Kat,

342
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,611
With a Harris
bipod attachment,

343
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,747
And a 4-by-32 tactical
milled out scope,

344
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,816
With a ballistics computer
built into the optics.

345
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,922
Hmm.
Twin Glock 19.

346
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,959
Can shoot
nine-millimeter parabellums

347
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,227
In a 14-round clip.

348
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,263
Just the way
I remember them.

349
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,531
Come to me, girls.

350
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,735
Triggers aren't
broken in.

351
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,871
These aren't mine.

352
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,774
Your originals
are in my office.

353
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,642
I had them made
into paperweights.

354
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,511
No problem.

355
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,980
I'm sure I'll find
a way to break these in.

356
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,715
I'm sure you will.

357
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,485

360
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,425
Proximity
and radio frequency
switches

361
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,294
And next-generation
Semtex,

362
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,562
Moldable, concealable
and undetectable

363
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:32,965
To all current
bomb-sniffing tests.

364
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,933
Anything else?

365
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,370
What?
No toys for me?

366
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,806
Ah, well, anyone can tell
you're a purist,

367
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,010
So we figured
the best thing with you
was to keep things simple.

368
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,981
M-1911A1 .45 Colt.

369
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,884
Old-school gun
for an old-school girl.

370
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,591
Woman. I meant woman.

371
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,734
Would you pull
your shirt up for me?

372
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,802
What is that?

373
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,738
It's a universal
access number.

374
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,640
You get into trouble,
you dial this number.

375
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,842
Any phone in the world,
it will ring back here.

376
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,945
This chip is undetectable
to any metal detector.

377
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,950
This may sting.

378
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,652
[Thunk]
Ahh!

379
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,019
Fuck.

380
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,088
What happened
to old-school
memorization?

381
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,457
[Thunk]
Shit!

382
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,795
[Thunk]

383
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,366
[Thunk]
Unh!

384
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,969
Ladies,
your carriage arrives.

385
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,578
[Engine bangs]

386
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:52,912
That piece of shit?

387
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,349
[Engine bangs]

388
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,489
Hey, you be kind
to Lula, huh?

389
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,023
"Tajikistan
Motoring Press"

390
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,394
Named her
car of decade.

391
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,363
Heh. What decade?
The eighties?

392
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,098
[Shushes]

393
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:16,703
I am Vez,
number one in import,
export to Ganzar.

394
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,104
You're a smuggler.

395
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,373
So was Han Solo.

396
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,713
The important thing
is that he says

397
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,581
He can get you
into the Citadel.

398
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,650
How?
I have man on inside

399
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,519
Who will vouch for you.

400
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,987
He's second cousin
to third sister's
husband,

401
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,457
But I know him
like first cousin

402
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,426
To second sister's
husband,

403
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,462
And for right price,
he looks other way.

404
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,063
Any more questions?

405
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,932
Yeah.

406
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,701
What's to stop us
from splitting the moment
we hit the road?

407
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,103
You mean, like
the micro-explosive
that's implanted

408
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,472
Subdermally
in your carotid

409
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,973
When you were
all knocked out?

410
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,744
Are you serious?
No.

411
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,845
We don't
need insurance.

412
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,112
Look at you.

413
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,616
This is what you
were built for.

414
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,487
Road to Citadel
is swarming with patrols.

415
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,622
Is best to go local.

416
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,760
Ohh! Oh, my God!

417
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:16,028
What is that?
It smells like yak piss.

418
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,997
No, no, no,
is not yak.

419
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,965
Is goat.

420
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,470
Do you really
trust this guy?

421
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,404
As much as I trust you.

422
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,876
So what do we do
with Ulrika?

423
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,546
Leave her. The brass
wants to ask her
a few choice questions

424
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,148
Before they shove her
into a dark, deep hole.

425
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,885
Sorry to ruin your fun.

426
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,687
Elise is the objective.

427
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,089
Rescue her,
and you're free.

428
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,526
The clock's ticking.

429
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,160
Hey, I driver.

430
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,062
I no porter.

431
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,686
VEZ: You have
song in America.

432
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,588
Is a Christmas song.

433
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,789
Is very stupid song.

434
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,725
Is, uh, Adolf reindeer
with red nose.

435
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,026
You know
this song, huh?

436
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,829
Is about
mutant, uh, reindeer

437
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,131
With
a bioluminescent nose.

438
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,233
He's outcast.
He's freak.

439
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,969
All of the reindeer,
they make fun of him...

440
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,539
So let's pretend we're
real military again,

441
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,741
Chain of command
and everything.

442
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:35,975
Let's rescue
Princess Peach,

443
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,276
Let's get our pardons,

444
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,946
And let's just never
see each other again.

445
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,852
Fine by me.

446
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:51,591
Kat, run the crypto check,
pretty please.

447
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,595
Charlie 2-3,
this is Foxtrot 1-2.

448
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,764
Crypto check. Over.

449
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,699
Why are we slowing down?

450
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,133
It's Ulrika's patrols, eh?

451
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,636
VEZ: Don't worry.
I handle it.

452
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,040
No, no, no, no.

453
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,542
We keep it cool,
all right?

454
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,743
We can't risk them...

455
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,244
We can't risk them
calling us in.

456
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,046
Guns away.
Hide your face.

457
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,925
[Speaking
Slavic language]

458
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,160
[Speaking
Slavic language]

459
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,696
Merchandise.

460
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,664
Merchandise?
Mm.

461
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,099
Open it.

462
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,577
Hey. Heh heh.

463
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,824
See? Merchandise.

464
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,059
Oh.

465
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,763
I'm going to need
to sample your merchandise.

466
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,798
[Chuckles]
No, no, no, no, no.

467
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,299
You... You don't
want this, eh?

468
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,602
These women,
they're good for
housework only, eh?

469
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,372
They have,
eh, disease.

470
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,908
Make your dick
fall off.

471
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,211
Just a blow job, then.

472
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,680
[Chuckles]

473
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,759
I like this one.

474
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,360
Do you wanna
give me a blow job?

475
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,266
I asked you
a question!

476
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,802
RAVEN: Here's
your fucking answer.

477
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,070
Oh, shit!

00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,987

00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,188
KAT: I got this.

480
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,721
Good shot.

481
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,156
Yeah.

482
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,693
It's Clay.

483
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:18,230
What's going on?

484
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,498
Encountered hostiles.

485
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,033
Our transpo is
out of commission.

486
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,369
We lost Vez
and the contact.

487
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,137
Recommend
we abort mission.

488
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,939
That's a negative.

489
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,376
I repeat...
Our ride is shit-canned,

490
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,911
And we have no leads.

491
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,445
The mission is fucked.

492
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,514
Strongly recommend
we abort.

493
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,183
In less than 24 hours,

494
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,786
Care packages with bits
of the First Daughter

495
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,154
Is gonna
start showing up
at Pennsylvania Avenue.

496
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,992
You're smart.
Just find another way
to get in.

497
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,393
Use your
feminine charms.

498
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,028
Charlie 2-3 out.

499

[Sighs]

500
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,838
Looks like
we're walking, ladies.

501
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,489
Talk about
your shit-holes.

502
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,458
They haven't
had a functioning
government

503
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,893
Since
the Soviet Union.

504
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,128
One can
hardly expect them

505
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,830
To maintain
infrastructure.

506
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,165
Cool guns.

507
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,199
Thanks.

508
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,368
American, yeah?

509
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,203
Come to save us?

510
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:32,371
Not exactly.

511
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,807
I love America.
You guys all have

512
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,409
The best stuff,
the best movies,
even have same gun.

513
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,812
Hey, we got it, kid.

514
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,380
You don't look
like Army.

515
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,582
We're not.

516
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,185
You're mercs, aren't you?
I knew it.

517
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,955
I'm Lexi. You should
let me join up with you.

518
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,490
I'll help you,
and then you bring me

519
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,525
Back to America
with you. Deal?

520
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,864
Look, kid,
we're not nice women.

521
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,999
We're not gonna have
some fun adventure.

522
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,369
We gotta
do some very bad things
to some very bad people,

523
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,272
And it's no place
for a teenager.

524
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,307
I can take it.

525
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,376
I got skills to pay bills.

526
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,244
Hah! Hah!

527
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,181
Be gone, kid!

528
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,949

529
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,118
[Chuckles]

530
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,486
Was that
really necessary?

531
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,221
Unless you
want to be responsible

532
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,156
For that girl's life,
yeah, it was.

533
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,524
Contact HQ.

534
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,160
Let Mona know that we
made our way into town.

535
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,628
I would have
shot her ass.
Yeah, I know you would.

536
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,964
Oh, shit!
My sat-phone.

537
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,500
Lexi!
Lexi!

00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,136
Ready or not,
here I come!

539
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:49,115
Shit.
You take the doors. We meet
around back.

540
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,116
Shit.

541
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,994
Oh, come on!

542
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,330
You guys are
making this boring!

543
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,868
That cheeky little bitch.

544
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,472
You almost had me.

545
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,008
Too bad I'm just
too good for you.

546
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,412
I could have eaten
for a month

547
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:23,115
With what I would
have made from that.

548
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,552
We'd like to help,
but, uh, we need this.

549
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,955
That was
some nice work, though.

550
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,623
So can I join up?

551
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,625
Go back to being a kid.

552
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,363
Okay, but you'll never
get into the Citadel,

553
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,697
Not without me.

554
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,167
That is why
you're here, right?

555
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,169
Ulrika?

556
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,436
What do you know about it?

557
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,438
I know that
ever since yesterday,

558
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:47,573
Security has been
tighter than ever.

559
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,942
Something big
is going on.

560
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,378
Ulrika's going to be
very cautious.

561
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,314
Fortunately,
I have an idea.

562
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,387
All right, kid.
What do you got?

563
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,723
Every week, Ulrika sends
a truck to the port,

564
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,993
And, every week,
that truck comes back,

565
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:10,662
Always on
the same day, today.

566
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,064
What's inside?

567
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,400
Don't know.
Sometimes guns,

568
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,402
Sometimes medicine,

569
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,604
But always valuable,

570
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:22,074
And I know
exactly what route
they take.

571
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,075
Lexi...

572
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,979
You want to be
on the team?

573
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,639
I still think you guys
should have let me
use a bigger charge.

574
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,383
All right, Annie Oakley,
you're up.

575
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,363
Target has
been diverted.

577
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,162
Were you gonna
use that piece
of shit on me?

578
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,533
Keeping body count
to a minimum.

579
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,203
You're no fun, Clay.

580
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,707
What are
you gonna do?

You know what?

583

Pull that trigger,
I open a vein.

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,227
"Thank you for saving
my ass, Mei-Lin."

585
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,228
My pleasure, Raven.

That's Japanese, bitch.

588
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,134
Same shit.

589
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,642
[Whistles]
Wow.

590
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,610
What kind
of missiles
are these?

591
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:39,845
ICBM.

592
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,213
Which is?
Which is?

593
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,115
Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile

594
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,684
With a minimum range
of more than
5,500 kilometers.

595
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:50,122
Primarily designed for
nuclear weapons delivery.

596
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:53,825
Well, I guess I
know what to get you
for your birthday.

597
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,695
We could put this

598
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,165
On my Christmas list.

599
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,799
We're not
taking that, Raven.

600
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,470
And we're not keeping
those either, Mei-Lin.

601
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,572
Where you gonna put em?

602
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,876
Well, looks like we found
our calling card.

603
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,246
So let's
get into character

604
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,848
And start calling.

605
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,122

00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,600
Ulrika.

608
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,734
What?

609
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,469
They've found us.

610
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,256
Lose something?

611
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,266
Thank you for returning
my shipment.

612
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,535
You've earned
30 seconds of my time.

613
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:13,539
I suggest you use it
to persuade me
not to shoot you.

614
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,640
Absolutely.

615
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,908
We could have kept
this bad boy

616
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,410
And sold
what was inside,

617
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:19,711
But that would
be peanuts

618
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,647
Compared to what
we have to offer.

624
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,308
You broker the deal.

625
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,842
We split the ransom.

GRIGORI:
Checking identity online.

627
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,249
See how easy it is

00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,584
To change Wikipedia?

629
00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,918
Shut up!

630

Fannie Pong,
confirmed.

631
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,824
Your offer is enticing.

632
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,261
Now explain why it
makes sense to me to not
just kill you now

633
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,829
And keep all the ransom
for myself?

634
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,964
Well, that's an option,

635
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:16,435
But you'd be missing out
on a very lucrative
partnership.

636
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,271

the introductory offer.

See, we're good
at acquiring high-value
packages like this.

We just hate the paperwork.

Well, you've come
at a very inopportune
time for me.

00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:35,487
I'm not sure
I want to take on
new distractions.

If you don't want
the easy payday,

will be interested.

let you give such

as effective as

That's a difference

Brains,
not thick-headed muscle.

661
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,486
But I could keep pushing,

662
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,655
Because I know
you'll flinch first.

663
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:48,627
But it's so rare to meet
such industrious women...

664

more exciting if I, um,

Only I know
the code to these.

716
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,237
Call me paranoid.

717

[Beeping]

718
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,783
Okay.

719
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:32,751
Ow!

[Beeps]

721
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:48,900
What is this?

722
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,369
Business,
in a sense,

723
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,271
The oldest
business.

724
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,873
Prostitution.

725
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,374
Every woman
under my care

726
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,243
Are required
to perform so.

727
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:02,380
Money can only
buy a man's loyalty
for so long,

728
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,716
So if you really
want to control them,

729
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,819
Control
the choice pussy
in the region,

730
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,354
And the rest
is easy.

731
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,690
Well, you better hope
the choice pussy

732
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,158
Keeps getting
themselves locked up.

733
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,159
[laughs]

734
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,761
Well, of course.

735
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:16,962
Sooner or later,

736
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,264
Every woman winds up
in my prison.

737
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,132
[Footsteps scuffling]
Ah.

738
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,702
Here we are.
A new resident.

00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,737

00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:33,178
Says you killed
her sister.

743
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,681
Ah, yes,

744
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,649
The chambermaid
from yesterday.

745
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:41,186
Oh, Grigori did
make a mess of her.

746
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,721
And then to just
dump the body

747
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:45,023
On the side
of the river, ooh.

748
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,664
When Grigori
is done with her,

749
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:55,366
She'll be
as obedient
as a poodle.

Stick to the plan,

756
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,163
We can't save her.

757
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,832
Elise is
the mission.

758
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:29,434
I don't know
who the bigger bitch is,

759
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:30,802
You or her.

760
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,350
I want to be up front
with you, Ms. Clay.

761
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,887
I don't trust you.

762
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:57,829
So why did you
let us in?

763
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:01,466
Well, never let it
be said that I put
paranoia before profit.

764
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,170
Well, look.

765
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,905
Listen,
if you're too busy,

766
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,074
Why don't you just
email me your schedule,

767
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:11,009
And we can do this
another time.

768
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,978
We haven't even gotten
to know each other yet.

769
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:26,391
Your accent, American.

770
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,928
Your posture, your poise,

My Army days
are long gone.

Dishonorable
discharge.

774
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:43,141
Go on.

775
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,451
I had 20 good men
underneath me

776
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,121
And a prick
of a C.O.

777
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:59,224
He said that women
in combat were a joke...

778
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,327
So he would
give us missions

779
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,262
That were more
and more complicated,

780
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:05,797
Hoping that
I would fail,

781
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,465
And every time
I succeeded,

782
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,168
It just really
pissed him off.

783
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,972
One day, he tasked us
with clearing

784
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,307
A cave complex
in Waziristan.

785
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,110
Well, we walked in,

786
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,545
And we were looking
at a hundred fighters.

787
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:24,916
That was the beginning
of 14 hours of hell,

788
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,920
At the end
of which I was one
of the lucky ones.

789
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:30,421
I only caught
two bullets.

790
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,092
Come to find out

791
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,863
My C.O.
was intentionally
withholding intel.

792
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,364
11 good men died

793
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,900
Because he
couldn't stand to see
a woman in charge.

794
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:47,939
So when I got
out of the hospital,

795
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,975
I put him in one.

796
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,409
Heh.

797
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:54,345
I knew there was something
I liked about you, Clay.

798
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,455
Your boss lady
says we should make
ourselves at home.

799
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,304
At home, I...

800
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,406
I never liked
to drink alone.

801
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,917
We are part
of an elite sorority,

802
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,353
Women that have earned
the command of men.

803
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:41,559
So tell me, how did
you earn yours?

804
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,328
My father.

805
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:48,199
He was a great
military leader,

806
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:53,471
But he would never
have given me the power
like he would a son,

807
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:57,075
So I shot him in the eyes,
and I took it.

808
00:47:57,108 --> 00:48:00,011
But then I realized

809
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:03,681
Staying on top,
that's a challenge.

810
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,316
Very true.

811
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,253
Everyone wants
to steal your power,

812
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:12,557
So I've learned
to distrust everyone.

813
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:16,928
So forgive me
for asking, Clay.

814
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:20,098
Why, of all days,
did you come today?

815
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,567
Well, we didn't have
the bomb yesterday.

816
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,335
Perhaps.

817
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,940
Perhaps there's
more to it than that.

818
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,377
I don't know
what to tell you.

819

[Chuckles]

820
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:38,049
Well, I can easily have
my men make you tell me,

821
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:41,152
But for a kindred spirit,

822
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:44,322
I prefer
a different approach.

823
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,203
Hey, there, fellas.

824
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,040

that never heals

will attract at least
one rescue attempt,

And here you are
right on schedule.

834

Be truthful with me,

835

And I'll be lenient,

836
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,639

that wasn't.

may have faith in you,

lost faith in them.

01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:25,494
Hey, Elise,

1261
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:27,763
You sure you don't want
to be part of the team?

1262
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,501
You'd be a great addition.

1263
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:35,871
Somebody's gotta
make sure you guys
get your pardons.

1264
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,840
We have to go. Come on.

1265
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:43,412
Hell of a job, Clay,
you and your team.

1266
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:47,716
Got another
assignment for you,

1267
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,185
If you're interested.
Heh.

1268
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:51,287
[laughs]

1269
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,724
Maybe tomorrow.

1270
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,726
I owe these ladies
a drink.

1271
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,862
Damn straight.

1272
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:02,498
Gotta be ladies night
somewhere in this place.

1273
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:03,632
Adios.
