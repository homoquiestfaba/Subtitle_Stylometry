1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,075
An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan...

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,077
was delivered dead|on arrival today--

3
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,656
The Centers for Disease Control.

4
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,658
Are we dealing with an epidemic?

5
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,694
Whatever the carrier,|we know that it's not the water.

6
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,264
We don't believe|that it's airborne.

7
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,334
One, two, three, four--

8
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,729
Strickler's Disease|was first diagnosed two years ago.

9
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,235
We're no better off now.

10
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,812
I needed you|to see this for yourself, Dr. Tyler.

11
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,551
It's the same|at every hospital in the city.

12
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,555
For the lucky ones,|it's a lifetime in leg braces.

13
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,294
Most of these kids|won't make it.

14
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,946
We need your help.

15
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,482
Strickler's Disease|came to New York...

16
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,451
like a thief in the night,|threatening to steal...

17
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,922
an entire generation of our children|from before our eyes.

18
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,324
Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director|of the Centers for Disease Control--

19
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:01,094
The killer was cunning.|It was deadly.

20
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,232
Neither a cure|nor a vaccine could be found.

21
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,501
We at the CDC|had to contain it...

22
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,304
before it could spread|beyond Manhattan Island.

23
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,740
So we went after its carrier,|the common cockroach.

24
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,410
Or rather she did.

25
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,012
Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason|that there hasn't been...

26
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,416
a new case of Strickler's|in this city for six months.

27
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,418
Dr. Susan Tyler.

28
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,420
Dr. Susan Tyler,|Professor of Entomology...

29
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,422
at the New York State University.

30
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,958
Thank you, Peter.

31
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:35,128
I don't think I need to tell you|New Yorkers just how resilient...

32
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,632
the common cockroach is.

33
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,969
Since it has proven to be|virtually immune to chemical control,

34
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,204
we had to find|a new avenue of attack.

35
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,675
So, with the aid of genetics labs|across the country,

36
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:53,981
we recombined termite and mantis DNA|to create a biological counteragent,

37
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,618
a new species to be|our six-legged ally...

38
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,154
in wiping out|the roach population.

39
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,626
We call it|the "Judas" breed.

40
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,830
Once in contact with|the Judas' secretions,

41
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,900
the common roaches|were infected with an enzyme...

42
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,836
which caused their metabolism|to go into overdrive.|- Come on, Susan!

43
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,039
You're missing it.|- No matter how much|the common roaches ate,

44
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,041
every last member|of the nest...

45
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,544
starved to death|within a matter of hours.

46
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,046
I hope someone's taping this.

47
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,048
This announcement's been|a long time coming,

48
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,150
ladies and gentlemen.|- Coming home.

49
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:34,388
The Strickler's outbreak|has officially been contained.

50
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,191
The epidemic is over.

51
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,193
Hey, Susan.|Honey.

52
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,329
Any other questions?|- Dr. Mann, what did this victory|mean to you personally?

53
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,199
It means that I can|move on to other projects with the, uh--

54
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,669
Our 15 minutes are gone.

55
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,539
And personally, um,|it's where I met my wife.

56
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,411
What is this? Is this|some kind of Catholic guilt thing?

57
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,747
We don't even know|what the impact is of what we did.

58
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,749
The impact is that...

59
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,886
a lot of kids will be running around|next year because of you.

60
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,888
A lot of kids.

61
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,958
Maybe we get lucky.

62
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:14,595
Maybe a couple|of them'll be ours someday.

63
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,597
Oh, a couple, huh?|- Mm-hmm.

64
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,600
Oh, okay.|We're not rushing things.

65
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,102
I didn't want to overtax you.|It's been a hard year.

66
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,905
It's been a great year.

67
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,511
Oxfords.|Seven and a half.

68
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,714
Black.|Leather soles.

69
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,383
Funny, funny shoes.

70
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,386
Funny, funny shoes.

71
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,257
Funny, funny shoes.

72
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,459
Funny, funny shoes.

73
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,461
Funny--

74
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,109
CDC.

75
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,778
CDC.

76
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,549
Hey, Boss,|welcome to disease land.

77
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,785
Tuck it in.|- All right. All right.

78
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,787
Are you sure this is yellow fever?

79
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,490
What, are you ignoring your pages now?|-Listen, l--

80
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,261
Okay, these two cops|saw the broken scaffold,|and then the paint mess here.

81
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,763
And then they looked|through that cellar window.

82
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,765
Go ahead.|Take a look.

83
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,311
Pleasant, isn't it?

84
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,314
Couldn't let 'em out|until you gave me the okay, so--

85
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,317
Roughly, there were|three dozen people trapped in here.

86
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:34,154
We got bacterial samples reading off|the scale, though nothing's airborne.

87
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,123
We got a Reverend Harry Ping.

88
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,293
Preacher, if you can imagine that.|He ran this place.

89
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,228
Well, there's|no sign of him.

90
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,798
Oh, have you had lunch?|- Uh-huh.

91
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,467
Try to keep it down|when you see this, okay?

92
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:54,041
Piece of shit|on the ceiling. Hmm?

93
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,210
Figure that one out.|- Here you go, Josh.

94
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,679
The subway?

95
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,381
You know what? l-l--|This is what I love about my job.

96
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,984
I get to travel,|see the world...

97
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,153
and meet new exotic cultures.

98
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,823
It's-- It's all bacterial,|but hey, what the fuck, right?

99
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,459
Thanks a lot, Miguel.|- Board up every exit.

100
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,662
If this leads to the subways,|I don't want anything to spread.

101
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,698
Quarantine everything.

102
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,254
What's going on, Remy?

103
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,756
Oh, I'm just...

104
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,026
commemorating|my sad moments.

105
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,397
So, we're at this|great restaurant.

106
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm thinking, finally,|a fucking gentleman.

107
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,902
I go to the ladies' room.|I come back.

108
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,771
I catch the schmuck slipping|a half-ounce of sedatives into my drink.

109
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,907
What a pervert.

110
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,876
This city is full of perverts.

111
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,480
You don't know who|anybody is anymore.

112
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,549
Jesus, I look like shit.|- Hey, guys.

113
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,285
You the bug lady, right?

114
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,253
We're here to deal.

115
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,891
When you pick them up,|you should pick 'em up by|this front vein on the wing,

116
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,060
'cause it's the strongest part|of the wing.

117
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,062
See, that way|you don't break it.

118
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,566
Now, let's see what else|you have in here. Oh, look.

119
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,235
What do we have here?|- Swallowtail?

120
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,738
Excellent.|- How come you like bugs so much?

121
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,177
Just imagine that|you're one of them.

122
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,113
What, eating furniture and stuff?|That's gotta suck.

123
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,049
No, no, no.|Now, don't judge them too quickly.

124
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,786
These guys were building castles|while dinosaurs were still|wimpy little lizards.

125
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,292
Now, say you're him.

126
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,461
He's what we call a soldier.

127
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,331
Now, there is no way|that you would ever quit fighting,

128
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,700
no matter how badly injured|you were.

129
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,702
It would be|a battle to the death.

130
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,808
But most insects don't kill...

131
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,810
unless their territory is invaded.

132
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,213
You'd just stun|your prey up here.

133
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:17,451
And then you drag it|all the way down through here to there,

134
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,287
into what is kind|of like a pantry.

135
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,157
Will he eat it alive?

136
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,860
Yeah. They're not really squeamish|about those kind of things.

137
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,563
This is the nest.|It's the heart of the colony.

138
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,865
The big enchilada.

139
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,536
Why?|- Well, if anything were|to happen to the nest,

140
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,538
the entire colony|would die out.

141
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,439
I'd just bail and start my own.

142
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,341
Well, you couldn't do that.

143
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,878
See... that big guy there?|Next to the queen?

144
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,880
Wait. Look over there.

145
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,984
He's the king. And out of all the nest,|he's the only fertile male.

146
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,020
He got a good deal.

147
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,722
Yeah.

148
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,692
It's a simple structure|designed for their survival.

149
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,628
It's perfectly balanced,|and it's very beautiful.

150
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,597
Whatever peels|your banana, lady.

151
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,667
So, you wanna buy|the butterflies, or what?

152
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,336
You know what?

153
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,338
You guys have done a really good job.|So, how about five bucks?

154
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,340
That's your best?

155
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,542
I'm gonna show her the weird bug.|- Costs a dollar just to look.

156
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,878
It's a really great bug.|Got it on the subway.

157
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:21,215
We kind of broke it a little.|- Okay. My best offer.

158
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:25,552
Ten bucks for everything,|plus a specimen jar,|some tweezers and some mounts.

159
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,554
Deal.

160
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:31,291
Are you crazy? This is the best.|This is our meal ticket.

161
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,428
Come on.|Bug's almost dead anyway.

162
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,777
It's yours.

163
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,047
You gave 'em ten bucks.|- They're from Alphabet City.

164
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,384
There's much worse things|they could be selling.

165
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,888
Oh, no. Your papers.|Help me get the window.

166
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,223
Susan. Push.

167
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,959
h, come on.|- Oh, I hate this window.

168
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,729
Okay, on three.|One, two, three.

169
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,905
Who the hell do you think you are,

170
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,907
putting my two officers|on quarantine?

171
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,943
Listen to me, Captain.|Those two, they go home,

172
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,445
they kiss their wives,|they kiss their kids,

173
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,447
and I'm the one with|a full-blown epidemic--

174
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,983
Come on, Chuy. We have to make dinner.

175
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,452
Dinner.|I don't care.

176
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,454
I do care!|Jesus, God, I hate cops.

177
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,524
They make the worst coffee.

178
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,560
Shiny wire.|Still giving you a hard time?

179
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,162
As always.|- Don't stare.|People look back if you stare.

180
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,164
It's not polite.

181
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,135
I can't believe this.|- What?

182
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,772
I spend an hour in the field.|I get a weekend's worth of crap.

183
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,175
Oh, speaking of that.|That turd that I took to the lab?

184
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,180
I found these in it.

185
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,783
What are they?

186
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:06,119
Buttons.|- Buttons?

187
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,355
-Maybe they needed fiber.

188
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,483
Sorry.

189
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,355
Wow.

190
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,359
Oh, my God.|You're just a baby.

191
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,929
Oh, my God.

192
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:07,574
The transfer|of recombinant genetic material...

193
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,512
from termites and mantis|into Judas breed will allow|rapid enzymatic change--

194
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,284
...insuring 100% sterility|in all Judas females--

195
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,989
...utilization|of a suicide gene--

196
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,662
...leading to a life expectancy|of 120 to 180 days.

197
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,407
Hmm.

198
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,799
Not too little...

199
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,668
and not too much.

200
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,144
You rub it in.

201
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,280
Around and around.

202
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,282
Like this, huh?

203
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:38,285
Let the leather take it.

204
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,057
Funny shoes.

205
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:47,027
Aieee.|Mr. Funny Shoes.

206
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,038
No one is there.

207
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,040
It's empty.

208
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,811
Chuy, listen to me.

209
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,681
They have Jesus|on the cross,

210
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,185
but that is not|a holy place.

211
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,722
Can you call me back tonight?

212
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,192
Thanks, Officer.

213
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,894
Cops are on it.

214
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,896
Good.

215
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,999
Well, they said--

216
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:30,170
Can you do me a favor and hold off|working at night for awhile?

217
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:34,041
I can't do that. I was actually|thinking I had to get back--

218
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,777
Susan, someone broke into|your office, okay?

219
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,012
I'm sorry about you losing a specimen,

220
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,182
but let's try and get|our priorities straight.|- This is not just a specimen.

221
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,551
I did a pH test,|and there are only two species...

222
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,553
that match what I found.

223
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,256
Now, one of them|is a leaf cutter ant in the Amazon.

224
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:53,227
The other one|we released here three years ago.

225
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,733
You said--

226
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:05,405
Y-Y-You said the ones we released|only had a life span of six months.

227
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,075
We engineered them|to be sterile adults.

228
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,544
The Judases were not supposed to last|past one generation.

229
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:14,414
So what happened?|- The one I examined today was a baby.

230
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:17,885
They were designed to die.|They are breeding.

231
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:29,930
I shine them good.

232
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:37,738
Chuy, Black Lincoln.|Chuy?

233
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:41,074
Black Lincoln.|This one.

234
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:43,076
Chuy,

235
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,078
pay attention, please.

236
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,999
This is where|you found the bug?

237
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:08,469
Yeah, man.|But they changed the lock.

238
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,274
You sure you haven't|seen one of those?

239
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:17,311
No. What is it?

240
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:21,315
It's an ootheca. It's kind of|a fancy name for an egg case.

241
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:25,152
There's probably more,|like, weird bugs inside of it.

242
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,321
No way.|I see one of those, I puke.

243
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:37,131
Here you go.

244
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:40,501
Here.|- Hold on.

245
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,203
Is there money to be made|on this egg thing?

246
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:45,806
Sorry.|- Dealing days are over. Vamonos.

247
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,675
These egg things look nasty.

248
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,844
Thought you liked|finding nasty things.

249
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,347
Well, what if we go find these things.|She'll pay us, right?

250
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,449
Is that all you think about?

251
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,525
Come on.

252
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,250
This bug.|What does it look like?

253
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,263
Did you hear that?

254
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:17,297
How deep does this go?|- Let's see.

255
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,239
Let's take a look.

256
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,580
You see anything?|- Not yet.

257
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:39,119
Shit.

258
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,155
I dropped it.

259
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:44,591
I can't reach it.

260
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,827
Let me try.|My hands are smaller.

261
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:07,447
Just leave it.|- Well, no. Wait.|I think I'm almost there.

262
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,794
How much you think the bug lady'll|give us for this egg thing?

263
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:22,796
At least a 20 spot.

264
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:07,241
Jesus!

265
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:10,511
Fucking moles!

266
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:13,013
Hey! Got any change?|- Get a job, scag.

267
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,716
Hey, kid!|Get the hell off the tracks!

268
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,018
Hey, how about a quarter?|- Get off my tracks!

269
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,020
|That's where he is. Long John.

270
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:22,022
|That's where he is. Long John.

271
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,024
Don't be talking to the moles.

272
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:28,529
They messed up.|- Hey, moles! Eat my long john!

273
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:32,032
Look, I already told you|this is CDC business.

274
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:35,202
And I'm telling you that|those lockers are MTA business.

275
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,938
Okay, we'll-- we'll pay for the lock|that we broke, Officer.

276
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,140
I mean, whatever we can do--|- Lady, who am I talking to now?

277
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,876
You or him?|- You're talking to me, okay?|You're talking to me.

278
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:45,946
All we wanna see is--

279
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,782
See what? That's|the old maintenance bridge, buddy.

280
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:50,784
This insect|that we are looking for--

281
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,886
Look, man. Your lady want a bug...

282
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:56,490
or it's eggs, or whatever she wants,|that's fine by me.

283
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,492
But it's like|Swiss cheese down there.

284
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:02,396
Tunnels in, tunnels out,|old tracks.

285
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,066
You go messing around, break your neck,|and it's my ass on the line.

286
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:09,770
Lace-up shoes. Black. Nine West.

287
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,639
Chuy, finish your sandwich.

288
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,808
It's good.|It's chicken.

289
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,578
Penny loafers. Eleven.

290
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,913
Double E.

291
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,288
Hey.

292
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,093
He's really good at that.|- Oh, yes.

293
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,163
He imitates anything.

294
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,665
Doesn't he go to school?

295
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:44,004
He doesn't need school. He's special.

296
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:47,641
What you making there?|Is that a superhero?

297
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,145
Mr. Funny Shoes.

298
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:54,014
He knows everything|about shoes.

299
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,483
Hey, I'm talking to you.|- No, you're talking at me

300
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,485
You come back with|the proper permits.

301
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,621
Maybe we'll have a conversation.|- Great. We'll do lunch.

302
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,656
Yeah, I look forward to it.

303
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,461
Uptown.

304
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,463
What happened?

305
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,132
Napoleon is alive and well|and working for the MTA.

306
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,134
We have to get down there.

307
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:16,537
He wants a permit?|I'll give him a real special one.

308
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:39,159
Ah, what's that?

309
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:54,675
Is that the egg thing?

310
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:59,046
Give me a hand.

311
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:02,583
Oh, man, that smells.

312
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,679
I can hear the bugs inside.

313
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:36,717
Come on. Cut it.|She's gonna give us at least 40 bucks.

314
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:58,572
What's up?

315
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,574
I think there's|a guy down there.

316
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,851
Oh, shit.

317
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:16,457
Oh, shit!|It's got me!

318
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:23,330
Help! Oh, God, please!|Please, help me!

319
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,937
Alex!

320
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:48,522
A philosopher named Hobbes|once wrote that,

321
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:52,126
"Life, by its very nature,|is nasty, brutish and short."

322
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,661
An ant would put it|more succinctly:

323
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,697
Can I eat it|or will it eat me?

324
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:59,800
It's this kind of simplicity...

325
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,836
that governs the phylum insecta.

326
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,510
Hello?

327
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:11,512
It's me. I got the permits.|- You did?

328
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:14,047
We're going down|first thing tomorrow.|- Okay, that's great.

329
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,383
Listen, honey, I-I gotta go right now.|I'll call you later.

330
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,752
...or of cellular phones,|- Okay.

331
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:21,388
as my distinguished colleague|can tell you.

332
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:26,493
So, you think your little Frankenstein|has got the better of you?

333
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,762
I was hoping|you could tell me.

334
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:31,899
I really need to find|some answers, Walter.

335
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,901
Dear Susan,

336
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:39,506
is it answers you want from me,|or is it absolution?

337
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,876
You still think|making the Judases was wrong?

338
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:47,047
Three years ago,|I would've called it unforgivable.

339
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:53,720
But I have two grandchildren who are|alive today probably because of you.

340
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:56,890
It would be a tad hypocritical...

341
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:59,526
for me to pass judgement.

342
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:01,562
That's not an answer, Walter.

343
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:04,898
It's not an easy question.

344
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,802
But as to the Judases,

345
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,738
I think it's likely|some survived.

346
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:16,944
Evolution has a way|of keeping things alive.

347
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,447
But they all died in the lab.

348
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:26,253
Yes, Susan.|But you let them out... into the world.

349
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,225
The world's a much bigger lab.

350
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,332
Funny shoes.

351
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:58,465
Yeah.|- Hi, Peter. It's Remy.

352
00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:01,802
Yeah, hi.|-Is Susan there? I need to talk to her.

353
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,437
How you doin'?|- Fine.

354
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,472
Huh?|- It's really important.

355
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,474
Yeah, sure.

356
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,377
What are you doing?

357
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:45,546
What do you got there?

358
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,748
Where?|- Right down there. In your hand.

359
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:51,685
Nothing.|- Oh, are we testing it?

360
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,420
Maybe.|- Mm-hmm.

361
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,025
Are we testing it?|- Uh-huh, maybe.|I don't know. Could be.

362
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:00,661
It's Remy.|-Oh, good. Okay. So give me the phone.

363
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:03,430
Come on. Come here.

364
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,200
Give me the phone.

365
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,669
Are we testing it?|Can you hold on, Remy?|- Yes.

366
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,809
Hey. What's up?

367
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,283
They found what?|- At the water filtration plant.

368
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:26,220
What's going on?|- Okay, I'll be there in,|in about 20 minutes.

369
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,355
Okay. Bye.|- Okay. Bye.

370
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:34,128
How long you got?

371
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:36,130
Patience.

372
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,774
We'll just try again.

373
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:51,145
Try again.

374
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,718
You know, sometimes these things|can be wrong.

375
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:05,425
That's okay.|I gotta go, okay? Bye, babe.

376
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,230
Susan, we got|the subway thing today.

377
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:13,734
Yeah, I know. I-I'm just gonna have|to meet you there when I'm done.

378
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,769
Wait.

379
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:19,072
When you're done from what?

380
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:33,587
Uh, boots, toys, uh, beer bottles,

381
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,357
body parts,|cocaine-filled condoms,

382
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,660
uh, little baby alligators.

383
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,663
Shit, you wouldn't believe|the stuff I'd seen.

384
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,832
Yep.

385
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:48,302
They flush 'em down.|We fish 'em out.

386
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:52,005
But this thing.|We didn't know what this was.

387
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:54,641
We were thinking about throwing it away,|but then I remembered Remy.

388
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,778
Jeremy plays bass in my band.

389
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:00,814
Ah.|- Anyway. So, uh--

390
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,358
Yep. I remember|Remy says to me,

391
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,661
"If it's got more than four legs,|it's not a mammal."

392
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,966
It's a lobster, right?

393
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:28,509
My father saw me stay in bed,

394
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,080
he'd go get the pitcher|of cold water, and whoosh!

395
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:38,719
I tell you,|that's some alarm clock.

396
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,708
Wow.

397
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:07,614
How big did you say these bugs are?|- Come on. Hurry up.

398
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:10,217
You know, my shift's almost over.|I need my beauty sleep.

399
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:13,854
Man, if I'm blowing off|my Saturday, then so are you.

400
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:16,423
Yeah. It looks like somebody|requested you for overtime.

401
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:21,728
Come on. Hurry up.|Let's find these things.

402
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:24,698
We've got a long way to go.

403
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:34,041
All right.|Watch your step there.

404
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:37,077
We've got burrows going|down seven stories here.

405
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,580
No shit?|- Oh, yeah.

406
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:42,216
It's five stories down, partner.

407
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:44,585
You fall, I don't wanna|come back and pick you up.

408
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:48,722
Okay, it's all yours.|Go ahead.

409
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:55,095
It's 48 hours anyway.|I can't wait that long.

410
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,397
It's 48 hours. Now listen,|you got something to write with?

411
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,134
Yes, yes. I write it.|- You gotta write this down.

412
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,136
Come on. Here's the case number.|It's two-seven--

413
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,838
Wait a sec. Two, seven.|Yes, two-seven--

414
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:07,508
Eight-three.|- Eight-three.

415
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:10,978
All right. You got that?|- What does this mean, case number?

416
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:14,815
It means I deal with you|in 48 hours, okay?

417
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:39,273
Mr. Funny Shoes.

418
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,466
Chuy!

419
00:46:56,884 --> 00:47:00,621
Hi, Doc.|Susan sent you some homework.

420
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:25,045
Chuy?

421
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:29,049
Chuy?

422
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,592
Chuy?

423
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:50,270
Chuy?

424
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,108
Chuy?

425
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,781
People actually|do live down here?

426
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:03,083
Yeah, man.|The mole people.

427
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,120
This section was pretty popular|all the way to Fulton Street.

428
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:10,524
Tweeked-out crackheads,|dopeheads, shitheads, mental cases.

429
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:13,060
Then suddenly, poof!|All gone.

430
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:16,363
Rumors got started.|Someone found a couple of stiffs.

431
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:19,199
Yeah, they make up|some crap about a killer.

432
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,201
Overcoat Slim, Long John.

433
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:25,739
Now, down here is the land of talk.

434
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:28,642
The wildest version|goes the farthest.

435
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:32,946
Hold it right here.|You got it? I see--

436
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:37,317
What's this? Look!

437
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:40,621
The organs are...|perfectly formed.

438
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,661
They were functional.

439
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:51,298
I'm guessing here,|and, of course,

440
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:55,769
they don't have a, uh,|a complete specimen, but--

441
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:57,738
What do you think it is?

442
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,643
This thing...|is not just some random mutation.

443
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:06,747
It's a highly evolved|soldier caste,

444
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,183
formidable killer.

445
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:12,352
It couldn't have developed|in a vacuum.

446
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:16,356
It's part of a colony.

447
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,413
This way, this way.

448
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:41,415
Should have stayed|at the office.

449
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:44,017
How much longer do we have to go?|- Keep looking around.

450
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,053
It's the size of your palm.

451
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:49,690
Aw, man. Take a whiff.

452
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:53,527
God, it smells like acid.|- No. It's ammonia.

453
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:03,604
Hey, guys.

454
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:06,573
Huh?

455
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,111
There's some weird shit here.

456
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,614
What kind of weird shit?

457
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,252
Lots of it.

458
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:34,101
God!

459
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:37,304
Man!

460
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,242
Go ahead and ask him. Ask.

461
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,549
What the-- You seen anything|like this before?

462
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:51,952
Why're you asking me if I've ever seen|some shit like this before?

463
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:54,588
Do I look like I've seen|some shit like this before?

464
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:57,591
Hell, no, I ain't never seen|no shit like this before!

465
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:01,962
Who the fuck would wanna climb up|these walls and hang one of these?

466
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:05,632
Must've been a big|elephant-ass motherfucker.|I don't know who the fuck--

467
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:09,770
The Delancey Street station|will be closing in five minutes.

468
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:12,606
Please find alternate routes|to your destination.

469
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:21,882
Carlito?|Yeah?

470
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:14,101
Oh, come on, Peter.|Hurry up.

471
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:59,413
Um, do you have the time?

472
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,417
Sir, the time?

473
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:42,456
Oh. You know, my father always|wanted me to become a dentist.

474
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,591
I said, "No way.

475
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:49,029
I'm not gonna spend my life|looking into people's open mouths.

476
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:52,599
What could be worse|than that, right?

477
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,869
Oh, man,|I've never been this deep.

478
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:58,205
This is the old|Armory Station.

479
00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:01,775
Hey, they built it|around the turn of the century.

480
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,178
It's been closed for decades.

481
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:07,147
Yeah, I guess we covered everything.|- Hey, look.

482
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:10,451
You got your shit.|I'm happy for you.

483
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,853
Let's get the hell|outta here, huh?

484
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:15,355
Hey, Josh, I want a full team|in here by 6:00 tonight.

485
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:17,357
All right.

486
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,293
Oh, shit!

487
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:22,296
What the fuck?|- No, don't!

488
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:25,632
Look what the fuck you did, man!

489
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:28,302
You see the size of that thing?

490
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:54,661
Peter, are you all right?

491
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,830
It's okay, Josh.

492
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:59,867
It's okay.|I think I'm okay.

493
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:05,839
Get the hell off me.|- Yeah, I think he's okay too.

494
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:08,008
How am I gonna|get you back up?

495
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,177
I don't know.

496
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:13,213
See a way up?

497
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:15,215
No.|- Shit.

498
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:18,018
There is no way up.

499
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:28,262
Oh, man, that's gonna work!|- Do you know a better way up?

500
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:30,964
Hey,

501
00:55:31,064 --> 00:55:33,967
show that to the station manager.

502
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:38,539
Tell him Leonard said he's gonna|have his bubble-butt if he don't|have someone down here in ten--

503
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:40,874
Wait a second.|I can't find my way back alone.

504
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:43,977
Look, look, look.|Just go back the same way we came.

505
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:46,947
Wait, wait.

506
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:49,283
All right.|- Take the first tunnel to the left.

507
00:55:49,383 --> 00:55:52,052
Then go to the fourth, right?|Then right, right, left, right?

508
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,390
Left, fourth-- Peter, can I just|stay here and help you guys back up?

509
00:55:56,457 --> 00:55:59,293
Toss the glow-sticks down|and just go, Josh, please.

510
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:01,895
Just keep headin' up.|You're gonna get there.

511
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:04,631
Hurry!|- All right, all right! I got it.

512
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:50,063
Help me!

513
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:53,834
Help! Please, help!

514
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:56,837
Help! Please!

515
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:59,540
Help!

516
01:03:38,852 --> 01:03:41,789
Piece of shit.

517
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,791
This is really weird.

518
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,226
We should've seen some|track bunnies by now.

519
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:50,230
What are they?|- Track bunnies. Rats.

520
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:52,499
They're usually around.

521
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:55,235
They big?|- You damn right.

522
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:23,397
Could you just knock it off, please?|Knock it off.

523
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:26,200
Hey, I sing when I'm nervous.|- Yeah.

524
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:28,435
Turn these lights back on.

525
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:32,406
What?|- You said the cables are still alive.

526
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:34,908
Oh, man.|- Maybe we can rewire them.

527
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:37,010
There you go again.

528
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:40,013
What?|- How are you gonna rewire all of this?

529
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:43,851
You need a whole crew|down here to do that.|- What is your problem, man?

530
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:47,187
Do you need a memo|every time you take a shit?|- Oh, don't go there.

531
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:52,559
You better be careful|how you speak to people.

532
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:07,107
Josh?

533
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:10,444
He wouldn't be|comin' from there.

534
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:21,054
Manny, what the hell|are you doin' here?

535
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:22,856
Hurry.

536
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:25,793
The lady needs help.

537
01:05:29,463 --> 01:05:31,965
Hey, honey, we're coming!

538
01:05:32,032 --> 01:05:34,301
Oh, Jesus, please hurry.

539
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:36,637
Please. Come on!

540
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:59,560
Oh, no! It's coming!

541
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,629
What the fuck is that?|Come on. Get her, man!

542
01:06:02,696 --> 01:06:05,732
Get her!|What the fuck is that?

543
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,469
What the fuck--|- Go!

544
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:19,113
Look there! There! There!|The car! The car!

545
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,587
Close the door!

546
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,090
Close the fuckin' door!

547
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:54,047
What the fuck was that?

548
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:06,393
Come on. Here. Here, here, here!|- Just wait a minute!

549
01:07:06,427 --> 01:07:09,463
Fuck it! You wait a minute!|I wanna make sure!|- It's not dead.

550
01:07:09,563 --> 01:07:11,932
Yeah, well, it's gonna be!|Very soon, lady!

551
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:37,257
There it is.|Drag it out.

552
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:39,426
There it is!|- Drag it out!

553
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:01,348
You better tell me...

554
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:04,518
what the hell's|goin' on around here.

555
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:19,399
Oh, man.

556
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:27,541
Okay, Leonard. Okay.

557
01:08:27,641 --> 01:08:30,978
It's gonna be fine.|You'll be fine.

558
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:33,747
Okay.

559
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:36,150
You just stay calm.

560
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:38,152
Okay, there we go.

561
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:41,155
Everything's gonna be okay.

562
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,824
Ah, Christ.

563
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:52,399
Josh will be here soon.|He'll bring us some help.|- You're dreamin', man.

564
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:54,835
If your boy was comin' back,|he'd have been here by now.

565
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:57,404
They got his ass, man.|They ate his ass, man.|- We don't know that.

566
01:08:57,504 --> 01:08:59,673
And if you think there's not|another one of those things out there,

567
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,509
what has been puttin'|that shit all over the walls?

568
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:05,546
Listen, Leonard.|If you keep on screaming like that,

569
01:09:05,612 --> 01:09:09,083
we're gonna meet|the rest of its family.

570
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:13,220
Manny?|Manny, be careful.

571
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,355
It-It's dead.|- No, no, no.

572
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:17,691
I emptied two clips|into that thing and it kept comin'.

573
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:21,261
Wait, wait a second.|Help me turn it over.

574
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,500
Peter, these are lungs.

575
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:29,736
What the hell is she talkin' about?

576
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:34,875
Biology 101. You know,|insects don't have lungs.

577
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:38,812
That's what limits their size.|- The secretions are the same.

578
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:41,115
Oh, God

579
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:45,619
When I increased|the Judas's metabolism, I must|have sped up its breeding cycle.

580
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,622
I mean, we're talking tens,|hundreds of thousands of generations.

581
01:09:48,722 --> 01:09:51,625
I mean, who knows how many mutations.|- Listen, l--

582
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:54,394
I just don't fuckin' get this.|How could the--

583
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:57,297
How could the Judas|evolve into this?

584
01:09:57,397 --> 01:10:00,768
Think generations, not years, okay?

585
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:04,972
It took only 40,000 generations|for apes to turn into humans.|- So?

586
01:10:05,072 --> 01:10:08,709
We changed its DNA, Peter.|I mean, we don't know what we did!

587
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:11,011
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!|Wait a minute! Hold on!

588
01:10:11,111 --> 01:10:14,515
If that thing has|been around, how come--|How come nobody's ever seen it?

589
01:10:16,183 --> 01:10:18,185
I think we have.

590
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,164
Sometimes an insect will evolve|to mimic its predator.

591
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:35,769
A fly can look like a spider.

592
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:39,440
A caterpillar|can look like a snake.

593
01:10:41,442 --> 01:10:44,511
The Judas evolved|to mimic its predator.

594
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:50,717
Us.

595
01:10:51,985 --> 01:10:54,054
Nobody up there knows about this?

596
01:10:54,154 --> 01:10:58,158
Nobody would.|Not until it's too late.

597
01:10:58,225 --> 01:11:00,294
These things can imitate us.

598
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:03,630
They can infiltrate us|and breed a legion before|anyone would even notice.

599
01:11:03,664 --> 01:11:06,867
How--|How could you do this?

600
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,303
How--|How could you do this?

601
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:13,340
You-You take something|and you-you make it like a man.

602
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,843
A man who's not a man, he's a--|- Manny!

603
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:18,679
He's a thing!|- Manny!

604
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,247
That steals my child!

605
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:23,083
Manny, you tell her,|'cause she don't give a goddamn.|- Hey, hey, hey.

606
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:25,486
Your kid's gone.|- Hey, shut up.

607
01:11:25,519 --> 01:11:28,088
My leg's chewed up all over!|- Shut up, will ya? Shut the fuck up!

608
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:30,524
And they're both talkin'|about insects with lungs!|- Shut up!

609
01:11:35,863 --> 01:11:38,499
Oh, shit!|They're everywhere!

610
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:44,705
Manny, get over here!

611
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,389
It's the blood!

612
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:06,226
The smell of the blood|is driving them crazy!|- Oh, shit!

613
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:10,531
We have to cover the scent!

614
01:12:10,564 --> 01:12:13,000
Manny, give me your razor.|Give me your razor!

615
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:29,950
Here. Take it.|Rub it on the windows.

616
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:32,052
Anywhere where there's cracks.|- Wha--

617
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,621
Just do it!|- What?

618
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:42,629
Oh! What the--|Ah! What is it?

619
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:45,732
Scent glands. Insects use them|to identify themselves.

620
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,768
Here. Rub it|all over yourself.

621
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,637
They won't attack you|if they think you're one of them.

622
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:54,575
Manny!

623
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:26,807
It worked.

624
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:39,219
Do you mind if--

625
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:41,789
Go ahead.

626
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:44,958
Manny, give me your lighter.

627
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:48,796
Look.|This is where we are.

628
01:13:48,862 --> 01:13:51,031
Now, these tunnels|may lead to the surface.

629
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:53,333
Yes.|- If we can get...

630
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,970
this car moving,|we might be able to make it.

631
01:13:57,004 --> 01:13:58,539
What--

632
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:00,741
What do you mean, might?

633
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,412
I mean, probably.

634
01:14:05,512 --> 01:14:07,314
But even if they do,

635
01:14:07,347 --> 01:14:11,919
th-this thing's been down here|rotting for half a century.

636
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:14,421
How do you know it'll move?|- Listen to me. Listen.

637
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:19,960
This car is a CR-17|from Coney Island.

638
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:22,930
Believe me, it was made to last.

639
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:26,433
Now, Manny,

640
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:30,537
there's a track relay switch|in this room here.

641
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:33,707
You switch the tracks.|That'll get us going.|- Yes, I'll try.

642
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,576
I'll try.|- Do.

643
01:14:35,676 --> 01:14:37,411
There's a fuse box|down the tracks.

644
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:40,914
If I can rewire it,|I can juice up the whole system.

645
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:42,916
Leonard, man.

646
01:14:43,016 --> 01:14:45,853
Look at yourself, l--|- I'll do it.

647
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:49,590
Hey, if you talk me through it,|I'll go out there.|- All you've gotta do is--

648
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:53,961
No, no, no, no.|I'll go. I'll go.

649
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:57,698
Why? I know much more about|what's out there than you do.

650
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:06,573
You're right.

651
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,576
You understand the creature, and, uh,

652
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:14,381
Leonard knows the subway, so--

653
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:18,419
so this is the way|it's gotta be.

654
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:21,121
Whatever happens, it's Manny and me.|- Why?

655
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:24,124
You two have gotta stay on this car.

656
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,262
You gotta get back up.

657
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:32,099
You gotta undo this.

658
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:35,869
So, I'll go.

659
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:39,106
We'll go.

660
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:41,075
Yes.

661
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,467
I have to put|this on you now.

662
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:16,810
They mimic us.|We mimic them.

663
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,153
Ah, Peter, Peter.|Peter, look.

664
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:30,290
You'll find two wires--

665
01:16:30,357 --> 01:16:32,893
one green, the other blue.

666
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,331
Okay.

667
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:41,668
Man, this-this shit|can't be sanitary.

668
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:43,804
Take it off.

669
01:16:43,837 --> 01:16:46,740
No, man. Leave it on.|Leave it on.

670
01:17:06,693 --> 01:17:09,496
Don't touch it.

671
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,865
Try not to sweat.

672
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:14,368
They sense chemical changes.

673
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:17,838
Oh, okay.

674
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,042
Okay, I'll-I'll|try not to sweat.

675
01:18:31,178 --> 01:18:33,113
Chuy!

676
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:39,620
Susan, he's in.

677
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:41,922
He just needs to find the switch.

678
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,758
Good.

679
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:19,660
Green. Blue.

680
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,995
Green, blue.|Green, blue.

681
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,008
Shit.

682
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:32,232
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh--

683
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:36,103
Oh, shit.|Oh, shit.

684
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:39,873
Oh, shit.

685
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:10,571
Chuy!|Chuy!

686
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:15,309
Chuy, it's me.

687
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:18,879
Come on, Manny.|What's takin' you so long?

688
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:21,815
Do these subway tracks|lead to the regular train tunnels...

689
01:21:21,915 --> 01:21:24,852
at Grand Central and Penn Station?

690
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:27,454
Yeah, yeah.

691
01:21:27,521 --> 01:21:30,624
Well, they'll use them|to migrate out of the city.

692
01:21:30,691 --> 01:21:34,661
After that, they'll set up|colonies anywhere they can.

693
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,204
Now, every specimen|we've seen has been female...

694
01:21:44,304 --> 01:21:47,674
because a male would be a lighter color|and it would have no wings.

695
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:50,711
And if they are holding true|to the Judas's spawning pattern,

696
01:21:50,811 --> 01:21:54,615
the nest will have|only one fertile male.

697
01:21:54,648 --> 01:21:58,786
Now, if we could catch|that male and kill him,

698
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:01,522
then the females|won't be able to breed...

699
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:04,058
and the whole generation|could die out.

700
01:22:06,126 --> 01:22:08,195
Where the hell is the male?

701
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:11,198
Chuy. Chuy.

702
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,535
Chuy, come here.

703
01:22:14,635 --> 01:22:17,037
Come here. Come here.

704
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:21,608
Friends.

705
01:22:21,675 --> 01:22:24,178
Come here, please.

706
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:44,198
Oh, goddamn it!|He must be in trouble!

707
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:49,036
He must be in trouble!|- Shh, shh. Wait. Listen.

708
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,909
Oh, Jesus!|- I'm goin' out there.

709
01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:00,280
You stay here.

710
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,217
Listen.|If the car starts,

711
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:06,720
I'll meet you|at the end of the platform.

712
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,892
Chuy?

713
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:39,653
Oh, my God.

714
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:53,834
Oh, Manny.

715
01:24:03,944 --> 01:24:05,879
Chuy.

716
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:39,012
Yes! Yes! CR-17 from Coney Island!|Goddamn it!

717
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,872
Oh, shit!|Goddamn it!

718
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:13,514
Goddamn! Shit!

719
01:25:25,759 --> 01:25:28,729
Leonard!

720
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:33,667
Get away! Go away!|I'm bleeding!

721
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,036
Found a way out, on a dumbwaiter.|- Go away!

722
01:25:36,103 --> 01:25:38,038
Peter, I'm bleeding.|Go away!

723
01:25:38,105 --> 01:25:40,040
I can't stop it.

724
01:25:40,107 --> 01:25:44,044
I can't stop it. They'll be here soon|- Where's my wife?

725
01:25:44,078 --> 01:25:46,847
Go away.|- Where's Susan?

726
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:49,183
Where's Susan?|- She went to get Manny.

727
01:26:02,096 --> 01:26:04,465
Susan. Shh.

728
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:08,035
They haven't seen us yet.|Don't move.

729
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:19,780
Peter, go!

730
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,602
Oh, my God.

731
01:26:47,174 --> 01:26:49,276
Leonard?

732
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:37,725
Come on, Chuy.|- Hurry!

733
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:40,360
All right, come on in.|That's all right. That's a good boy.

734
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:43,163
No, no, it's all right.|Shh. Stop. Stop it.

735
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,232
It's okay. It's okay.|All right, Peter.

736
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:48,635
Come on. Get in. Get in, Peter.|Come on. Chuy, shh! Stop it!

737
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:50,671
Stop it! Shh!

738
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:59,213
Get in, get in, get in.

739
01:27:59,313 --> 01:28:03,150
Peter, what are you doing?|- I gotta stop them here.

740
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:05,619
Oh, no.|Peter, don't do this!

741
01:28:05,686 --> 01:28:08,222
Peter! No! No!

742
01:28:08,322 --> 01:28:10,991
Oh, Jesus!|Don't! No!

743
01:28:11,058 --> 01:28:13,527
Chuy! Chuy! Stop it. Stop it.

744
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:24,438
Train! Oh!

745
01:28:24,538 --> 01:28:28,041
We're here! Help!

746
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,256
Watch it.|Go on. Go on.

747
01:29:16,323 --> 01:29:19,393
Get out! Hurry! Go!

748
01:29:55,362 --> 01:29:57,331
Fuck you!

749
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:11,625
Look out!

750
01:33:48,362 --> 01:33:50,264
Chuy?

751
01:33:50,364 --> 01:33:52,299
Chuy?

752
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:55,269
Chuy?

753
01:34:10,951 --> 01:34:12,886
Chuy?

754
01:34:21,395 --> 01:34:23,597
Oh, God.

755
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:25,599
It's the male.

756
01:34:30,637 --> 01:34:32,139
No!

757
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,944
You will not hurt him!|No! Turn around!

758
01:34:39,313 --> 01:34:41,215
Turn around!

759
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:19,253
Come on.|Come on. Come on.

760
01:36:42,669 --> 01:36:45,072
Police and emergency crews|continue to work...

761
01:36:45,172 --> 01:36:49,043
in the aftermath of tonight's explosions|on the Lower East Side.

762
01:36:52,112 --> 01:36:54,848
Hustle up! Team leader!

763
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:21,041
We swept the area twice.

764
01:37:21,075 --> 01:37:23,410
It's burned.

765
01:37:23,477 --> 01:37:26,313
Nothing could have|survived down there.

766
01:37:27,414 --> 01:37:29,917
What about one of us?

767
01:37:38,992 --> 01:37:40,994
I'm sorry, Susan.

768
01:37:42,896 --> 01:37:44,898
I really am.

769
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,615
Shiny wire.

770
01:38:44,024 --> 01:38:47,061
Mountain boots. Ten.

771
01:38:47,161 --> 01:38:49,163
Brown.
