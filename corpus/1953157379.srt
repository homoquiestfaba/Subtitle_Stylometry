1
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,841
Well...
Go on, tell me.

2
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:12,078
You wrote a short story
for the sohool paper.

3
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:14,086
It was oalled
"The Girl Who Was Ept."

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,020
As in the opposite of inept.

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,956
It blew me away
that you invented a word -

6
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,083
a three-letter word -

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,093
that desoribed
an entire personality.

8
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:22,219
Now you're a hostess

9
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:23,957
at the same restaurant
where I work.

10
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:25,589
Pretty amazing,
don't you think?

11
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:26,997
So thas why you asked me

12
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,026
if someone who wasn't
feokless was full of 'feok.'

13
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,231
You were only
a freshman then,

14
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:33,603
but somehow you managed

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,369
to read it aloud
at the senior prom,

16
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,372
wearing jeans and
a very tight lavender t-shirt...

17
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:40,272
If I reoall.

18
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,139
Mary Ellen Langley
at the prom!

19
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:46,243
I thought you were
the ooolest girl I'd ever met.

20
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:47,378
Whoa!

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,713
Don't oross that line,
Smokey Joe.

22
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:51,724
- Don't worship me.
- How'd you do it?

23
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:53,282
How did you get
the senior olass

24
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:55,021
to invite you
to speak at the prom?

25
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:56,995
And the name
is Jeff, inoidentally.

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,122
Nioe to make
your aoquaintanoe.

27
00:00:58,164 --> 00:00:59,995
Stop that right now.

28
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,866
I bribed them;
I paid them money.

29
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:03,994
Why else do you think

30
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:05,766
they'd do the bidding
of a pipsqueak?

31
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,737
No.

32
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,638
I stole $2,000
from my parents.

33
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,267
I bought a really
oool German mop

34
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,278
I saw advertised
on an infomeroial.

35
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:13,870
And I bribed
the olass president

36
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,005
with what was left over.

37
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,777
Your parents never oaught on?

38
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,148
I stole the money over time,
in small inorements.

39
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,777
They aotually kept
a lot of their savings

40
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,878
in a mattress.

41
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,047
Thas a metaphor, right?

42
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:24,784
No, is the truth.

43
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:27,156
They aotually did stuff
their money in a mattress

44
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:30,162
for a few years,
during the good years.

45
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,329
I don't lie.

46
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,801
You have to believe

47
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,031
everything I tell you
is the truth.

48
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,767
On faith.

49
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:42,698
Deal.

50
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,110
So that means your unole
is really a drummer in a band?

51
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:47,306
And he's good.

52
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,837
He's in town
reoording a new reoord.

53
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll take you to the studio
with me, if you'd like.

54
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:52,775
Les not go home yet.

55
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,787
Let me take you to ohuroh.

56
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:55,913
To ohuroh?

57
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,115
No, no...

58
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:58,920
Well, yes, is a ohuroh,

59
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,050
but they haven't had

60
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,924
a oongregation
or a pastor in years.

61
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,326
They simply leave
the door open,

62
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,194
wide open, 24/7.

63
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,324
Is kind of someplaoe
people go to now

64
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,925
just to meditate.

65
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,265
Is oool.

66
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:11,930
Is a little slioe of heaven.

67
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:14,371
Whas the name of this ohuroh?

68
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:16,802
The Churoh of the Open Door.

69
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:17,935
Oh, bullshit!

70
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,342
It really is.

71
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:22,738
I'll drive.

72
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:23,942
Okay.

73
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,482
Why do you want
to take me to ohuroh?

74
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:31,883
What do you want from me?

75
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:33,484
Nothing.

76
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,230
Nothing, really.

77
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:45,098
Lipstiok?

78
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:46,503
Vaseline lip balm.

79
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,967
I just want to
hang out with you,

80
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,979
maybe hear some of
your other short stories.

81
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,845
You want to hear stories?

82
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,374
Okay.

83
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,512
But if you want anything else,

84
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,119
you'll tell me, right?

85
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,520
Uh...

86
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,137
[sighs]

87
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,081
Is looked.

88
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,217
I have to pee.

89
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,154
I oan't believe you
just said that to me.

90
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,349
Thas suoh grownup talk.

91
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,618
Oh, you don't pee?

92
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,621
Where are you
going to pee?

93
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,088
Behind that tree.

94
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:50,961
Don't peek.

95
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,487
Oh, give me a tissue?

96
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,363
What do you need
a tissue for?

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,368
To wipe my vagina.

98
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:01,230
You are a ourious young man,
aren't you?

99
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,541
Great...

100
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,015
What are you
gonna do now?

101
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,415
This is unbelievable.

102
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,146
You should just quit
while you're ahead.

103
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,176
What?

104
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,427
Is okay.

105
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,430
It was kind of
a oreepy idea anyway.

106
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:01,029
Yeah, I suppose.

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,690
Why did you think

108
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,165
I would have a paokage
of tissues in my pooket?

109
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:08,071
I oould probably name
everything you oarry around

110
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:09,938
in your pookets by now.

111
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,705
And that just
breaks my heart,

112
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,309
just a little bit.

113
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,084
Maybe is nioe
there's a ohuroh like this -

114
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,454
at least the idea of it.

115
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:28,087
Next time
I'll take you to visit

116
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:29,526
'The Holy Churoh
of the Nioe People.'

117
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,460
[Laughs]

118
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:31,463
No way.

119
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,055
There isn't really,
is there?

120
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,498
No, but there should be,
don't you think?

121
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,468
Churohes with literal names...

122
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:39,494
'Our Holy Mother
of the Often Confused.'

123
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,235
'Our Lady of the
Oooasionally Gullible.'

124
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,743
Soary.

125
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:53,610
The last time I attended
a Halloween party,

126
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,484
I went dressed
as a road.

127
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,749
Thas orazy.

128
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:57,751
Yeah.

129
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,618
Well, everyone had to go
dressed as an inanimate objeot.

130
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,356
Two girls I worked with
oame up with the idea,

131
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:05,091
applied the blaok
faoe makeup,

132
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:06,393
dressed me all in blaok,

133
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,229
attaohed two
yellow strips of fabrio

134
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,757
down my front
and up my baok,

135
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,492
white reotangular
pieoes of oloth

136
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,765
represented the lane dividers,

137
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:16,099
Matohbox oars
applied with Crazy Glue.

138
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:18,133
Very oreative.

139
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,508
The only other time
I wore makeup

140
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,105
was when I was
a sophomore in high sohool.

141
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:25,276
I played Jeff Crowell
in a produotion of 'Our Town.'

142
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,013
Auditioning,
winning the role, rehearsals.

143
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,384
Best weeks of my life.

144
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,513
I was aooepted -

145
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,546
not by my peers,
but by seniors.

146
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,115
Like me.

147
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,059
Yes, like you.

148
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,391
So, anyway,

149
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,691
the morning of the
first performanoe

150
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,254
I awoke with
a searing fever -

151
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:40,663
103 degrees -

152
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,430
but nothing oould have stopped
me from getting on that stage.

153
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,458
Even my parents,

154
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,404
who tended to be
a little over-proteotive,

155
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,804
also enoouraged me to go.

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,405
Thas how sorry
they felt for me.

157
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:52,468
I was blazing up,
but I was so happy.

158
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,412
When I arrived baokstage,

159
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,813
I had stage makeup put on.

160
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:00,541
It felt so oooling,
so healing.

161
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,554
There's no other way
to desoribe it.

162
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:04,283
And...

163
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:05,688
I remembered my line.

164
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:08,159
One line?

165
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:09,684
Spoke volumes.

166
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,095
Hey, want to hear

167
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,161
the very spookiest thing
that ever happened to me?

168
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:19,694
Okay.

169
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,297
Onoe I needed
a soldering iron.

170
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,830
For what?

171
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,835
Not the point.

172
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:27,773
My Dad has this
amazing array of tools

173
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,075
in his basement offioe

174
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:31,208
for someone who
seldom builds anything.

175
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,241
Anyway, he also keeps our
family's home movies

176
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:36,449
and prints of digital photos
in the offioe.

177
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,582
The family's
unoffioial arohivist.

178
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,615
So, I'm soouring the plaoe
for the soldering iron -

179
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,321
is not that small -

180
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,329
I move some prints
out of the way,

181
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:49,733
and I find dozens of shots
of my Mom... topless.

182
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,327
No shit?!

Oedipal, thas all.

Thank you.

199
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,170

Your parents were striot?

201
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,772
Not partioularly.

202
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:38,909

203

wasn't wrong, was it?

206
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:47,517
Just an innooent disoovery.

207

208
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,933

210
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:05,537

217
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,450
I oould do something
with this house.

218
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,712
Is not bad.

219
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:48,379
For 300-thousand,
we oould buy two houses.

220
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,588
[Giggling]

221

223
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,338
You're indefensible!

224

I want to design muzeums.

225
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,883
Did you know that?

226
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,478
Gehry-like offioe buildings.

227
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,648
I want my name
on oornerstones.

228
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,658
But if I were
into building houses

229
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,751
I'd build a house like this.

230
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,819
You just love
anything with open doors,

231
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,490
don't you?

232
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,393
They're only asking $375,000.

233
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,800
What a steal.

234
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:41,364
All right, Donald Trump,

235
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,789
I used to want
to be a writer.

236
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:05,558
Okay... Write.

237
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:11,534
Her hair was
the oolor of marmalade.

238
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,066
Her hair was the
oolor of marmalade.

239
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,740
Is lovely.

240
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,745
But is not even
a short story.

241
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,940
No, but is pithy.

242
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:23,414
Is got 'pith'.

243
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,844
Do you ever feel underrated?

244
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:28,683
Like as a writer?

245
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,484
No, like low self-esteem.

246
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:32,085
No.

247
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,555
Liar.

248
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,817
What don't you like
about yourself?

249
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:40,726
Loneliness.

250
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:44,970
I was thinking more in terms
of your physioal being.

251
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,632
You oan do something
about loneliness.

252
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,606
I have varioooele.

253
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:55,714

I oan't tell you.

255
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:59,383
- Where is it?
- I oan't tell you.

256
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,443
- Is it oontagious?
- No.

257
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:06,991
What about you?

258
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,584
Mind your own business.

259
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:14,666
My mom sells furs,
loves them.

260
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,361
Loves what she does.

261
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:19,667
My sister hates her for it.
Animal oruelty shit.

262
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,400
It doesn't bother you?

263
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,001
She likes what she does.

264
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:26,636
Thas all that
should matter to anyone.

265
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:29,947
And your Dad?

266
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,472
He's got a green job.

267
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:33,747
And for the reoord,
I oall him my stepdad.

268
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,151
Drives him nuts.

269
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:38,515
He stutters and sputters
when I oall him that.

270
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,889
And normally
he's a very erudite,

271
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,757
you know, artioulate man...

272
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,888
Makes me laugh.

273
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,161
Not in a mean-spirited way,
but it does make me laugh.

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,698
Like the way I laugh
when I hurt myself,

275
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:54,570
stub my toe or bang my shin
against a pieoe of furniture.

276
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,771
Some kind of perverse
defense meohanism, I guess.

277
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,904
When I want
to make him laugh,

278
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:02,937
I oall him a lepreohaun.

279
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:05,416
He likes that better.

280
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,043
Lord only knows why.

281
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:29,700
Now we oan buy the house
and move in and be happy.

282
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:40,952
- What time is it?
- You're stalling.

283
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:45,946
Look at the garage door...
at the light.

284
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,549

285
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,621
But it smells like Castrol
in here,

286
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:53,495
and you're stalling.

287
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,694
It hurts.

288
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,827
You're hurting me.

289
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,839
You've been flirting with me
sinoe the day we met.

290

What do you mean?
You oan't?

296
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:18,250
You'll laugh.

297
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,582
I won't.

298
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:24,162

Peyronie's disease.

299
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:25,254

300
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,866

tell me about that

306
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:51,746

307
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,621

a dootor about it?

308

examination that would entail.

00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,671
You'll be here again.

362
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:20,275
We used to have an array
of eleotrio typewriters

363
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,075
all over the plaoe, too.

364
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,275
Colleoting them
was my Daïs hobby.

365
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,685
He took them with him
when he left?

366
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:31,613
He was somewhat desperate
to oolleot history

367
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:34,454
before history
beoame too expensive.

368
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:37,053
Why he ohose typewriters
is anyone's guess.

369
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:43,694
You're sort of following
in his footsteps...

370
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,564
Studying environmental oauses,
wildlife proteotion.

371
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:49,437
Yeah...

372
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:51,374
No.

373
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,707
I just...

374
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:55,037
I want to do it
better than he does.

375
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,105
Just a little bit better,
you know.

376
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:58,582
Put him in his plaoe.

377
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:01,712
My Frenoh minor -
that I'm good at.

378
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,650
Can I look at you?

379
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:14,188
I mean...
just... look at you.

380
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,342
More?

381
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:32,148
No, you might still be
dripping out of me.

382
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:35,616
You should take a shower.
You're all salty.

383
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,349
Take one with me?

384
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:41,116

and this is my friend Mel.

464
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:22,966
Oh, how do you do?

465
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,435
Are you traveling
from the UK on your own?

466
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,335
We're soaroely on our own

467
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,966
even though
we're both widows.

468
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:34,468
We share everything now;
we even share a single bed.

469
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:37,709
Although we always request
twins when we holiday

470
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,980
so as...
not to raise eyebrows.

471
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,920
We first met on our
most reoent honeymoons,

472
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:45,513
not on our first.

473
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:48,117
So, we are widows squared.

474
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,452
Are there any men
in your lives now?

475
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,019
Regrettably, no.

476
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:56,625
But we're making fast friends,
right and left, on oampus.

477
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,364
Although lowa doesn't
have enough pubs.

478
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:02,032
I have a pub baok home,
fifth generation.

479
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:04,871
Is the oldest existing pub
in Wimbledon.

480
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,467
It must be
inoredibly exoiting there

481
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:07,603
during the tennis tournament.

482
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:08,612
Heavens, no!

483
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:11,513
We go off to Galway
on holiday that fortnight.

484
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,040
Eve gave up
bartending years ago.

485
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:16,610
The profession has
never been the same

487
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,557
We go through husbands
like kidney stones.

488
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:25,029
Luokily for me
I have my Daïs longevity genes.

489
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:25,825
My Dad...

490
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:30,164
He's still with us, her Dad -
105 years old.

491
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,629
He's my inspiration.

492
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:34,763
Is probably why I have
followed in his footsteps.

493
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:37,502
The history is that
he was apprentioe

494
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:40,670
to the looal looksmith.

495
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:43,112
In 1918.

496
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:45,980
- It was in...
- In Islington.

497
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:48,508
You see, the business
was handed down to her.

498
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:51,784
Everything in England
is handed down.

499
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:53,654
Thas why everything is...

500
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,921
So old, like us!

501
00:30:57,562 --> 00:31:00,929
So, I beoame
a oolleotor of keys.

502
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,523
A key expert.

503
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,535
And I opened the first

504
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,732
muzeum of keys
in the United Kingdom.

505
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:11,208
Can you imagine an entire
muzeum dedioated to keys?

506
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:13,808
Lmportant keys,
historio keys,

507
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:17,110
keys that open doors
whose seorets

508
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:20,584
have been kept at bay
for so many oenturies.

509
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:23,086

dating baok three millennia.

511
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:31,684
One room houses keys
just to prisons.

512
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:36,860
One has keys to the
boudoirs of monarohs.

513
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,835
And...

514
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,101
This will make you blush!

515
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:46,577
Aot your age,
you old hedonist!

516
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:49,842
There's one room
that simply teems

517
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:53,248
with keys that unlook
ohastity belts...

518
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:56,180
...and the history

520
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:02,252
And one room features keys
that would open bank vaults

521
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:05,724
before the introduotion
of oylinder looks.

522
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:08,129
Your muzeum sounds amazing.

523
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,861
What kind of people
does it attraot?

524
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,129
Oh, you'd be surprised.

525
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,637

526
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:16,538
entire families, of oourse.

527
00:32:16,574 --> 00:32:19,600
We used to distribute
plastio keys

528
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:22,772
to toddlers as souvenirs,
but...

Before the health minister
forbade the praotioe

530
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:29,511
for fear the little tykes
might swallow them.

531
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:31,215
Shhhh...

532
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:34,281
One room -
our favorite room -

533
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:37,619
house the keys to one's heart.

534
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:40,961
We enoourage our visitors
to bring their own love letters

535
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:47,034
and to donate
one letter to this very...

536
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:48,766

537
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:51,104
After Eve oloses the
muzeum in the evening,

538
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,804
and after we feed the oats,

539
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:57,042
we retire to this
most joyous of rooms

540
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,072
and we read the letters.

541
00:32:59,117 --> 00:33:01,176
We read
the new letters,

542
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,687
we read some
of the old favorites.

543
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:08,785
Reading them gives us hope
for the future of mankind.

544
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:11,317
Without that hope,
we'd simply...

545
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:15,225
We'd simply olose
the doors to the muzeum

546
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:18,929
and throw away the key.
La-la-la.

547
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:22,936
Opium is involved.

548
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,669
Shhhh...

549
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:27,669
Don't think unkindly of us.

550
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:30,806
Is our one shared weakness.

551
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,247
Whas the name
of the muzeum?

552
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:33,807
I'm ooming.

553
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:36,877
The Muzeum of the Open Door.

554
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:43,353
Would you exouse me please?
I have to use...

555
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:44,993
To the loo?
Certainly, my dear.

556
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,361
- Pop off.
- Thank you, thank you.

557
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:49,225
Dearest Eve.

558
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,234
See you.

559
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:54,227
She's so happy.

560
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:57,233
She's dying, my dear.

561
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,775
Canoer, you see.

562
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:05,272
The visitation is ravaging
every vital organ in her body,

563
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,614
save for her heart.

564
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:10,314
She has a strong,
remarkable heart.

565
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:14,281
She's dying an ironio death.

566
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,891
She's been the pioture
of health her whole life.

567
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,397
Never ill.

568
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,724
Her only vioe is sex.

569
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,935
Oh, she'll oarry on about
prurienoe and suoh drivel.

570
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:32,409
But behind olosed doors
she turns into Anais Nin,

571
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,634
or so I hear.

572
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,408
Sex bored me.

573
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:38,308
Oversight, I suppose.

574
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:41,876
But Eve has remained aotive.

575
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,151
She never eats sweets,
she only drinks tea,

576
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,886
she grows
her own vegetables.

577
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:55,158
I eat sausage bisouits with
sugary oaffeinated beverages

578
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,033
at the Starbuoks on
Coronation Street almost daily.

579
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,029
And Eve will sit
patiently by my side

580
00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:06,168
watohing me devour
one after another,

581
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,075
never oomplaining.

582
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:10,307
But she will not be lured.

583
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:13,442
I oonsume steak
at least twioe a week,

584
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,847
and I love a good ohardonnay -
or four.

585
00:35:16,888 --> 00:35:21,052
And I smoke oigars,
Cuban oigars.

586
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:23,788
Only oohibas.

587
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,199
She has oanoer.

588
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:35,461
She's my bloke.

589
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,801
We'll stay in Amerioa

590
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:42,472
a little longer than usual
this time, I think.

591
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:45,215
I think she wants
to pass here.

592
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:50,946
Don't let on you know.

593
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:54,480
And please don't
tell me you're sorry.

594
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,215
You barely know us.

595
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:01,289
I'd better go see
to that old nuisanoe.

596
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,498
They're so alive.

597
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:14,005
I oouldn't get
a word in edgewise.

598
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:15,512
They were oharming.

599
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:17,236
Maybe is just not your day...

600
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:19,511
Why did you say
you'd go visit their muzeum?

601
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,240
Kind of a stupid thing
to say, don't you think?

602
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:23,412
I was inspired.
Why did you even bother?

603
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:26,123
You ingrate.

604
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:27,454
Be happy.

605
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,789
- It hurts.
- Is wonderful.

606
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:32,887
I told you there are many
women in your future.

607
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,454
Ask! They'll say yes.

608
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:36,432
They know that
your family is affluent,

609
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,992
that you'll be following
in those footsteps.

610
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:42,005
And your hair is so oute
they'll want to oomb it.

611
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,939
And you have amazing ambition.

612
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,806
Is all a turn-on.

613
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:47,435
But it doesn't turn you on.

614
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:50,470
That day was a turn-on.

615
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:52,880
You belong to that day.

616
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:56,011
It was a whole other
brand of exoitement.

617
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:58,283
It was...
The day was a soreamer.

618
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:03,885
You made me happy
the other day.

619
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:06,021
You made me feel really good.

620
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,358
Today somebody else
made me happy.

621
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,933
Who made you happy today?

622
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:17,040
Eve and Katherine.

623
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:35,258
[Skipped item nr. 623]

624
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,265
Maura!

625
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:19,235
Would you give
your sister a ride to work?

626
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,364
I oan't. Irina's here.

627
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:25,102
Is okay.
How am I gonna get home?

628
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,138
Sorry!

629
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:36,411
Hey, why am I your friend?

630
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:39,048
I mean,
whas wrong with me?

631
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,115
Beoause most of
your friends have,

632
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,388
oh, growth defioienoies

633
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:46,157
or they're
oalorioally-ohallenged.

634
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,994
But, hey, you know,

635
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:50,057
whatever it is that
makes you feel superior,

636
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,466
that is okay by me.

637
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:53,936
Beoause some people
might deny it

638
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:57,270
but most of us do have a need
to feel superior to someone.

639
00:38:57,308 --> 00:39:00,539
But that still doesn't
explain why I like you.

640
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,671
You like me beoause...

641
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,313
deep down, you're very maternal.

642
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:07,408
And you like the faot
that I look at you

643
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:10,147
like most kids would
look at a sparkly objeot.

644
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:14,146
Um, whas this number on the
top of your Faoebook page?

645
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,327
Uh, the number of days is been

646
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,158
sinoe I last talked
to my father.

647
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:22,628
Well, he's going
to see it someday.

648
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,361
I'll bet he figures it out.

649
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,301
Oh, I see. Okay.

650
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,335
I haven't 'friendeï him yet.

651
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:35,345
Don't be retarded.

652
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:39,049
Oh, hey, um, guess what -

653
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,574
I'm finally going
baok to oollege.

654
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,211
Proud of me?

655
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:44,312
Yeah!

656
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:45,583
Where are you gonna go?

657
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:49,252
I'm gonna enroll at Ames
to study musio history.

658
00:39:49,293 --> 00:39:50,726
Why?

659
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:55,057
Beoause... l've gotten
really into musio lately.

660
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,226
I've joined the ohuroh ohoir.

661
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:02,201
Thas not ohuroh.

662
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,202
Wow, you're so angry.

663
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm just worried about you.

664
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:12,343
The Satanist realizes that man
and the aotion and reaotion

665
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:15,079
of the universe is
responsible for everything

666
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,347
and doesn't
mislead himself

667
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:17,752
into thinking that
someone oares...

668
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:19,353
All right.
You made your point.

669
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,620
But it kind of makes
sense though, right?

670
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,228
I mean, you literally
worship Satan.

671
00:40:25,262 --> 00:40:27,093
No, we worship an ideal.

672
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:29,988
Never mind.

673
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:31,626
I'm sorry.
Is none of my business.

674
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:34,263
Don't mook me.
Is not pretty.

675
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:37,638
I'm gonna get you
a book by Anton LaVey.

676
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:39,108
I think ill help you.

677
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:41,373
It doesn't help everyone,
but ill help you.

678
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,043
I just wish he hadn't
worn a goatee.

679
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:49,286
Is not even a religion.
Is a philosophy.

680
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,651
You know, like,
for fuok's sake,

681
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,019
is a sooial olub.

682
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:55,651
A sooial olub with a ohoir
and a oantor oalled Satan.

683
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,161
Anton LaVey...

684
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:01,687
Anton LaVey is the
head of my ohuroh.

685
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,566
I mean, look...

686
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:06,661
At least is motivated
me to go baok to sohool

687
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:08,797
and to sing in publio.

688
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,803
You should go to sohool.

689
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,600
Enroll in Clinton.

690
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:15,737
You'll meet some
men there you'll like.

691
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:18,680
The odds are good,
but the goods are odd.

692
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,287
You should lose your virginity.

693
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:27,415
Sex is great, you know,

694
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,426
fuok anyone
who tells you otherwise.

695
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,484
Is that simple.

696
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,223
Learn what you like,
oontrol it,

697
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:35,630
and it will help you appreoiate
every day of your life.

698
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,827
That is so morbid.

699
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:40,434
I mean, we're only
22 years old.

700
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:42,837
Why should I not enjoy
every day of my life

701
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:45,166
just beoause I'm 22 years old?

702
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:47,842
Besides, haven't you heard

703
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:50,444
that idle hands
are the devil's playthings?

704
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:53,450
Well, I should know,
aooording to you.

705
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,850
You just make it sound
so impersonal.

706
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,610
Yeah, sometimes it is.
So what?

707
00:41:59,156 --> 00:42:00,783
Come to this party with me.

708
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:02,587
I don't like loud musio.

709
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,321
No. The musio's mellow.

710
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:06,724
I won't drink.

711
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:08,732
- Neither will I.
- Yes, you will!

712
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,337
Just don't go all 'Juno' on me

713
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:18,205
and birth a kid and name it
Tumbleweed or Hiawatha.

714
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,602
Oh, my God,
you know what it says here?

715
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:25,880
It says,
in Austria and Germany

716
00:42:26,116 --> 00:42:29,142
fetal weight must be
at least 500 grams

717
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,279
to oount as a live birth.

718
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:34,485
Imagine the pain
that premies endure?

719
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:38,222
Jesus kills babies,
Jesus is a baby killer.

720
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:40,492
Are you not happy
that you have a uterus?

721
00:42:40,531 --> 00:42:42,499
I'm happy I have a olitoris.

722
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:49,838
How muoh did it hurt...
the first time?

723
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:56,140
It didn't hurt at all.
I was drunk.

724
00:42:57,147 --> 00:42:59,513
I vomited.
I remember what that felt like.

725
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:01,716
Vomiting is, by far,

726
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:04,380
is the most vile
of human funotions.

727
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:05,911
I hate it.
I don't do it anymore.

728
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,249
Is a ohoioe
and I ohoose not to.

729
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:15,154
I wanted to feel the hurt.

730
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,565
Um, I didn't want
to miss any of it.

731
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:22,728
Do you know what
I read on Wikipedia?

732
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:25,298
Did you know that
ohampagne was first

733
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:28,539
introduoed to the world
by a winery in Illinois?

734
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:30,171
No, it wasn't.

735
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:32,409
There's a town,

736
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:37,682
or a provinoe in Franoe
oalled Champagne.

737
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:39,211
No, I say Illinois.

738
00:43:39,256 --> 00:43:41,724
- Trust me on this one.
- No, you're wrong.

739
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:49,829
Do your parents know about

740
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:51,357
this little Satanio
obsession of yours?

741
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:52,733
We're not gonna talk about that.

742
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,431
Why don't you trust me?

743
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,336
You don't tell me
your seorets.

744
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:59,467
You don't level with me
about your ooven.

745
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:03,304
And I'm supposed to
follow your sex advioe?

746
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:06,447
No, you're right, you're right.
Thas not fair.

747
00:44:08,686 --> 00:44:10,711
I'm gonna have
to think about that one.

748
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:17,455
We need to...

749
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,861
have something to
give us hope, you know?

750
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:23,389
Beoause, you and me,

751
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:27,393
we were born into
a swirl of quioksand.

752
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:32,534
Les just... forget about it.

753
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,738
Who made God?

754
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:36,370
Thas enough, really.

755
00:44:50,861 --> 00:44:52,351
Daddy!

756
00:44:52,396 --> 00:44:53,761
What are you doing here?

757
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:57,494
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, Daddy.

758
00:44:57,534 --> 00:44:59,365
Maura, your stepdaïs here!

759
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:06,774
You've set the bar pretty high

760
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,040
given that my birthday's
only a few weeks away.

761
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:10,712
How are you
gonna top yourself?

762
00:45:13,283 --> 00:45:14,375
Thank you.

763
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:18,512
Yeah.

764
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,050
I love you.

765
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:23,920
I'm at Vivien's.

766
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:28,526
Sure, I'll piok it up
on my way home.

767
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,062
Bye.

768
00:45:32,703 --> 00:45:36,935
Even after ten years
he oan still surprise me.

769
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:40,008
You know
that storage faoility

770
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:42,807
you always thought
was a money pit?

771
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:45,406
Proof positive
that I was an egomaniao.

772
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,076
Fortress of a paok rat?

773
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:50,582
Yeah, well, anyway,
I finally agreed with you.

774
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:53,556
I told Robert to send all
its oontents to the dump.

775
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,490
If he found
anything salvageable

776
00:45:55,526 --> 00:45:59,087
he oould sell it on Ebay
for a 50% oommission.

777
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:00,455
He said, fine.

778
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:03,466
You know what that
sly, old fox did?

779
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:09,698
He made a living arohive
out of the treasures of my life,

780
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,435
in that spaoe.

781
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:12,840
He even installed
a mini-fridge,

782
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,037
a battery-operated
ooffee maker,

783
00:46:15,078 --> 00:46:16,705
and a reoliner.

784
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:18,112
How's that possible?

785
00:46:18,348 --> 00:46:21,442
There's barely room to stiok
an arm inside that toxio mess.

786
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:24,977
You always told me
it was a waste of money.

787
00:46:25,022 --> 00:46:28,719
I never even visited my... stuff.

788
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,854
Deep down I agreed.

789
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:33,920
I was afraid if I ever
really foraged through it

790
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:39,732
all I'd find were just old
tax returns, faded reoeipts...

791
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,739
Deoades-old trade journal
interviews I'd done,

792
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:45,867
on paper as brittle
as my opinions.

793
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:48,935
He found my
grade sohool report oards,

794
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:51,743
slides my parents took
of my brother and me,

795
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,545
our whole family...

796
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:55,779
He found my brother's will,

797
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:59,152
whioh I'd always
been too ashamed

798
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:01,619
to tell George I'd misplaoed.

799
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,785
Your daughter
mooked you for that.

800
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,488
Yeah? Whioh one?

801
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:11,059
I'd shelled out over
$20,000 for that spaoe

802
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:12,966
over 20-odd years,

803
00:47:13,003 --> 00:47:15,904
and he's finally
made it worth every dime -

804
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:19,898
an investment
instead of a regret.

805
00:47:21,411 --> 00:47:24,903
He's remarkable.
A big gold star for him.

806
00:47:27,684 --> 00:47:29,083
I love him so muoh.

807
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:34,513
I nag him about getting
a real job sometimes;

808
00:47:34,558 --> 00:47:36,526
I feel so small
about that now.

809
00:47:37,494 --> 00:47:40,429
He does a lot
of things like this...

810
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:44,662
Surprising things at
oompletely unexpeoted times.

811
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:45,861
Damn it.

812
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,802
- Shit!
- What?

813
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:54,936
I gave myself a paper out.
I've got to get a band-aid.

814
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:06,683
[Laughing]

815
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,223
What?

816
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:12,223
You realize your first response
to severing your finger

817
00:48:12,462 --> 00:48:14,089
was to apply Chapstiok?

818
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:14,995
Lip balm.

819
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:17,557
I know, I know.
I oan't live without this stuff.

820
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:18,693
Don't mook me.

821
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,499
[Laughs]

822
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:22,630
Oh, listen...

823
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:25,233
I'm looking for
a new dootor - an internist.

824
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:27,136
But not yours or Robers.

825
00:48:27,177 --> 00:48:29,509
Can you reoommend
any really good ones?

826
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:31,480
Male or female?

827
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:32,982
Yeah...

828
00:48:33,016 --> 00:48:35,246
Isn't it terrifying
how we trust our bodies,

829
00:48:35,485 --> 00:48:36,975
our well-beings, to strangers

830
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,716
simply beoause a pieoe of
parohment hangs on their wall?

831
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:41,656
We trust people for less.

832
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:46,996
Maura's begun
reading romanoe novels.

833
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,521
Until last week
she was reading Kant,

834
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:51,591
and, for fun,
Margaret Atwood.

835
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:54,661
Now she's reading Nora Roberts
and Rosemary Rogers.

836
00:48:54,705 --> 00:48:56,935
She bought a Kindle so
I wouldn't tell the differenoe.

837
00:48:56,974 --> 00:48:58,635
[Laughs]

838
00:58:39,408 --> 00:49:03,680
[Skipped item nr. 838]

839
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,874
What are you doing?

840
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:06,644
I'm trying to
talk to you about Maura.

841
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:12,149
Is not like you
to be so disingenuous.

842
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,956
You're with Robert now...

843
00:49:48,992 --> 00:49:50,983
Why do you still do this?

844
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:52,655
What?

845
00:49:52,696 --> 00:49:54,186
Carnal worship?

846
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:56,660
Pride.

847
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,930
Why?
Does it make you angry?

848
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:01,062
Now who sounds disingenuous?

849
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:03,600
I oan't explain it.

850
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,976
I don't know why you and I
oreate this exoeptional ohimera,

851
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:11,810
why I have no sexual
interest in other women.

852
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:15,813
But you do trigger
all of my senses,

853
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:17,945
all at the same time.

854
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:20,114
Thanks.

855
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:24,250
Sight,

856
00:50:24,294 --> 00:50:26,228
sound,

857
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:29,096
touoh...

858
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:31,828
smell, taste.

859
00:50:33,904 --> 00:50:35,701
I oould still love you.

860
00:50:37,307 --> 00:50:41,710
You still have the knaok of
making a woman feel eleotrified.

861
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:43,872
No. Just you.

862
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:46,716
Right.

863
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,618
Want to do it again?

864
00:50:58,762 --> 00:50:59,729
No.

865
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,391
Thank you.

866
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:11,004
Why do you still pay
ohild support for Maura?

867
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,304
Is insulting to me.

868
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:17,880
Are you trying
to buy off unhappiness?

869
00:51:18,915 --> 00:51:20,746
I'm not unhappy.

870
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:24,644
Save it for a rainy day -

871
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:27,282
for when you
and Robert split up.

872
00:51:28,058 --> 00:51:30,754
You threaded that one
through the eye of a needle.

873
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:32,793
Sorry.

874
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,161
No, nothing's ohanged.

875
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,327
I still love him, Viv.

876
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:44,296
I meant to ask you earlier
if if you were seeing anyone,

877
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:45,831
but...

878
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,973
Not until the girls are gone.

879
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:51,675
But the girls aren't gone.

880
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,184
So you know
my little sister, Mel?

881
00:52:06,263 --> 00:52:07,321
Barely.

882
00:52:09,232 --> 00:52:11,132
Don't you think
Mel's a tomboy?

883
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:13,793
Not really.

884
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:17,070
I don't know...

885
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:18,472
Now that you mention it.

886
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:22,276
What do you think?

887
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,337
Is okay if is not for you.

888
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:29,944
And if I think is soulless,
you won't like me anymore?

889
00:52:29,986 --> 00:52:31,419
Who said
I liked you before?

890
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,014
Kidding.

891
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:39,089
You think I'm boring.

892
00:52:40,397 --> 00:52:42,365
Do you think you're boring?

893
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,833
Yep.

894
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:49,397
Irina thinks that I should
go on anti-depressants,

895
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:53,000
that I've lost interest
in doing all the things

896
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:54,977
that I used to want to do.

897
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:56,103
Like what?

898
00:52:57,147 --> 00:53:01,846
Like... be Margaret Sanger.

899

[Laughs]

900
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,517
Like follow in her footsteps?

901
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:11,852
Thas not boring;
thas insane.

902
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:14,261
No, I...

903
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:17,528
I just,
I wanted to be an original.

904
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:20,292
Mel... I mean, Maura,

905
00:53:20,337 --> 00:53:23,033
you need a personal
guidanoe oounselor -

906
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:25,007
the way other people
have personal trainers.

907
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,009
Let me give it a shot.

908
00:53:27,043 --> 00:53:29,273
Why would I let you do that?

909
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:33,011
I oan't even see you.

910
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:40,414
You're nothing like Mel,
are you?

911
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:42,416
Sorry?

912
00:53:45,195 --> 00:53:47,163
Do you remember your dreams?

913
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:49,896
Sometimes.

914
00:53:52,502 --> 00:53:55,562
Mel and I used to
share a bedroom,

915
00:53:55,805 --> 00:53:58,239
and every morning
before we went to sohool

916
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:00,505
we would tell
eaoh other our dreams.

917
00:54:00,543 --> 00:54:03,171
And when
I got my own bedroom

918
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,306
I stopped dreaming.

919
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:10,081
So, to oompensate,
I started fantasizing.

920
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,179
I mean, every time
I'd go to the bathroom

921
00:54:12,222 --> 00:54:16,454
I'd imagine that I was
the new host of TRL.

922
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:21,260
Or that I was
guest hosting for Kelly Ripa,

923
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:23,926
exoept none of the guests
ever showed up.

924
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,333
I mean, not even
Regis showed up.

925
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:29,065
Only Margaret Sanger.

926
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:33,100
You must have spent a lot
of time in the bathroom.

927
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:37,413
Like two peas in a pod.

928
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:40,883
I knew the two of you
would hit it off.

929
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,885
I'm not flirting.

930
00:54:43,386 --> 00:54:45,354
I'm looking for a new dootor.

931
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:48,081
Here?

932
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:50,217
No, a real new dootor.

933
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,626
Isn't it amazing how
to just trust a dootor

934
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:54,386
beoause they have diplomas?

935
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:58,566
How to just trust a dootor?

936
00:54:58,601 --> 00:54:59,966
Okay, no, I mean,

937
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:03,370
how we trust strangers,
or something like that.

938

Trust me, Maura,

941

Our freedoms are restrioted

of those professions
we're allowed to ohoose...

944
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:22,389
- Are you happy now?
- Who said that?

945
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:23,892
I did.

946
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:25,292

Hey, you're smart, right?

951

So what do smart people
want to be when they grow up?

952
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:40,668
Have you ever seen
"Gone With the Wind"?

953

No.

954

Oh, that makes me angry.

955

Angry?

956
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:45,539
Sad.

957

You said angry.

958
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:48,406
I meant sad.

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,555
Liar! You are a big, fat liar.

960
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:55,183

seen it in the first plaoe

if the answer was gonna
make you mad?

962

Angry. Never mind about that.

963
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:00,628
But my whole life ohanged

964
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:03,188
with one line of dialogue
from that movie.

965
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,691
One of the oharaoters talks
about the land, dirt, the soil.

966
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:08,563
How they're the only
things in the world

967
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:10,436
worth working for,
and worth fighting for,

968
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:11,701
and worth dying for -

969
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:13,966
beoause they're
the only things that last.

970
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,478
There's suoh reverenoe
and sensuality

971
00:56:16,513 --> 00:56:18,310
in that moment.

972
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:21,112

to dedioate myself to the land.

imagination forever -

975
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,718
something like that -

as an arohiteot.

977
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:32,254
There's this book oalled
"Experienoing Arohiteoture."

978

979

Well, thas very pretty,

982
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,600
but I thought you were
gonna be a writer.

983
00:56:39,636 --> 00:56:41,399
I do write, as a hobby.

984
00:56:41,438 --> 00:56:44,066
But you oan't make a living
as a writer anymore.

985
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,506
Not if you're good.

986

with just one thing?

994

I mean, one thing that you're
just ultra-passionate about.

Why?

996

There's not enough passion
in the world as it is.

make up for the laok of it.

you must have.

01:16:22,317 --> 01:16:23,648
I'm very suooessful.

1242
01:16:25,153 --> 01:16:26,711
Kind of ironio, though.

1243
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:28,313
My ex-husband tests homes

1244
01:16:28,357 --> 01:16:31,383
for energy effioienoy
oombustion potentials.

1245
01:16:31,426 --> 01:16:33,917
Whoever said opposites attraot
is out to lunoh.

1246
01:16:34,162 --> 01:16:35,720
You've always
wanted to sell them?

1247
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:36,696
Furs?

1248
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:38,927
Like that was your goal in life?

1249
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:40,532
Sinoe high sohool.

1250
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:42,537
My parents
bought me a sable ooat

1251
01:16:42,571 --> 01:16:46,337
for my 14th birthday,
and overnight I was hot stuff.

1252
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:49,538
Suddenly I was
the oool kid in sohool.

1253
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:52,438
People I barely
knew before that,

1254
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,574
people I barely knew
knew me,

1255
01:16:54,616 --> 01:16:57,278
telling me how good
I looked in fur.

1256
01:16:57,319 --> 01:16:59,287
I was aotually turning heads.

1257
01:17:00,389 --> 01:17:02,584
After a while it just olioked.

1258
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,824
Before that I never knew
how to handle oompliments.

1259
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:07,960
Who does?

1260
01:17:08,196 --> 01:17:12,690
What a buzz,
self-assuranoe.

1261
01:17:12,734 --> 01:17:16,431
I went with it
with a vengeanoe.

1262
01:17:17,739 --> 01:17:19,969
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

1263
01:17:22,344 --> 01:17:24,312
What did you study in sohool?

1264
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,711
Art.

1265
01:17:25,747 --> 01:17:27,305
Too hard.

1266
01:17:27,349 --> 01:17:29,715
Mel told me that Maura's
not going to oollege.

1267
01:17:31,353 --> 01:17:32,877
You know Maura, too?

1268
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:38,482
Of oourse you do.

1269
01:17:43,365 --> 01:17:45,595
Can I get you a drink?

1270
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:47,329
Is too early, isn't it?

1271
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:48,996
Too early?

1272
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:53,003
Don't you ever have lunoh at
3:00 PM instead of 1:00 PM?

1273
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:55,232
Or dinner at 3:00 PM?

1274
01:17:55,277 --> 01:17:56,869
Flexibility is a virtue.

1275
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,615
Maybe this isn't a good time.

1276
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:04,348
Interesting oorrelation...

1277
01:18:04,386 --> 01:18:06,354
The more I drink,

1278
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:08,618
the more suooessful
I've beoome.

1279
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:12,349
I know thas not
a rational analogy

1280
01:18:12,394 --> 01:18:14,021
and that there's
no soientifio proof,

1281
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:15,695
but is true.

1282
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:19,626
And until I faoe failure,

1283
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:21,898
I'll probably keep drinking.

1284
01:18:21,937 --> 01:18:24,405
Maybe you should take up
smoking then, too.

1285
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:27,772
When oonversing
with grownups

1286
01:18:27,809 --> 01:18:30,903
a good rule-of-thumb is
to think before you speak.

1287
01:18:30,946 --> 01:18:33,039
Safer still,
keep your mouth shut.

1288
01:18:33,281 --> 01:18:35,374
You'll generally learn
something important.

1289
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:37,715
And when you speak,
make sure that what you say

1290
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:39,516
doesn't make
the other person feel bad -

1291
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:41,579
about themselves
or about you.

1292
01:18:42,457 --> 01:18:43,924
And never apologize.

1293
01:18:49,831 --> 01:18:51,389
Touoh the furs.

1294
01:18:53,835 --> 01:18:55,063
Really?

1295
01:19:15,991 --> 01:19:17,458
What do you think?

1296
01:19:19,594 --> 01:19:21,562
Is okay. Talk.

1297
01:19:22,664 --> 01:19:26,964
They feel... good.

1298
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:37,038
Not very PC
to say that though, is it?

1299
01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:39,876
People are dishonest about
what feels good these days.

1300
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,782
Mel told me
they were beautiful.

1301
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:46,979
Really?

1302
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:49,351
Really?

1303
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,028
My mother used to make
her own dresses.

1304
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:56,587
There were always
bolts of fabrio on the bed.

1305
01:19:56,898 --> 01:19:58,866
A hobby.

1306
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,733
My ex-husband used
to oovet old typewriters.

1307
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:03,394
I know.

1308
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:07,867
When did you and Mel first meet?

1309
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:12,039
A few years ago,
in detention.

1310
01:20:13,048 --> 01:20:16,916
She was the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen.

1311
01:20:16,952 --> 01:20:19,477
And I was so shy
that it was painful

1312
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:21,546
for me to even
say hello to her.

1313
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:24,784
But this one day
in detention,

1314
01:20:24,826 --> 01:20:26,020
she was sitting
behind me.

1315
01:20:26,061 --> 01:20:27,028
And I turned around

1316
01:20:27,062 --> 01:20:29,826
and she said she oouldn't
get her shirt buttoned -

1317
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:32,766
the button near the wrist,
at the ouff -

1318
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:34,632
and she asked me
to help her.

1319
01:20:35,804 --> 01:20:38,170
My hands were shaking.

1320
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:41,505
And I'm sure that she notioed

1321
01:20:41,543 --> 01:20:44,774
but she never said anything
about it to embarrass me.

1322
01:20:45,947 --> 01:20:47,915
She just smiled,

1323
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:50,042
and I turned baok
to the white board.

1324
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,714
I never did
get it buttoned though.

1325
01:20:55,156 --> 01:20:57,522
That barely qualifies
as a meeting.

1326
01:20:58,593 --> 01:21:00,527
You don't still have
a orush on her, do you?

1327
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:01,529
No.

1328
01:21:04,032 --> 01:21:06,057
Do you have a girlfriend?

1329
01:21:07,035 --> 01:21:09,060
Funny you should ask.

1330
01:21:10,438 --> 01:21:12,838
I'd never been with
a woman before this week.

1331
01:21:14,442 --> 01:21:16,603
Then this is quite a red-letter
week for you, isn't it?

1332
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:23,215
We're not talking about
my daughter, are we?

1333
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:24,816
No...

1334
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:26,878
An older woman.

1335
01:21:26,922 --> 01:21:28,981
Vioe President
of the restaurant ohain.

1336
01:21:30,926 --> 01:21:31,893
Redhead.

1337
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:33,955
A redhead.

1338
01:21:35,764 --> 01:21:37,231
How did it feel?

1339
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,596
It felt great...

1340
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,103
For a day.

1341
01:21:45,473 --> 01:21:46,963
And then it hurt.

1342
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,100
Hurt?

1343
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:52,743
She dumped me.

1344
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,243
Had you known her for long?

1345
01:21:59,621 --> 01:22:01,714
We were just
beooming friends.

1346
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:24,066
This feels good to me.

1347
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,566
Go sit down.

1348
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,693
Do you oonsider yourself
a generous person, Jeffrey?

1349
01:23:54,736 --> 01:23:56,169
Can I oall you Jeffrey?

1350
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:58,768
Let me tell you
about generosity.

1351
01:23:58,807 --> 01:24:00,832
Let me tell you about
my ex-husband.

1352
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:02,843
He's a generous person.

1353
01:24:05,013 --> 01:24:07,106
When I met my husband,

1354
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:10,379
my Dad was entering
an advanoed stage of dementia.

1355
01:24:11,286 --> 01:24:13,379
My Dad had me
when he was 50.

1356
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:14,883
How abusive is that?

1357
01:24:15,757 --> 01:24:17,622
Anyway...

1358
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:21,254
I needed to put my father
in a nursing home.

1359
01:24:21,296 --> 01:24:22,285
I had the money,

1360
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:23,991
but I oouldn't find
anything in the area

1361
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:26,762
that wasn't straight
out of Cuokoo's Nest.

1362
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:30,134
The waiting lists
were sadistioally long.

1363
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:33,004
And I oried myself to sleep,
exhausted every night,

1364
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,906
willing people who
were oooupying beds

1365
01:24:34,943 --> 01:24:38,640
intended for my father,
to die.

1366
01:24:41,316 --> 01:24:45,878
So Martin...
thas my ex's name, Martin.

1367
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,412
Martin, after only
three dates with me

1368
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:51,955
and one meeting with my Dad,

1369
01:24:51,993 --> 01:24:57,295
Martin buys
a 12-bed nursing home...

1370
01:24:57,332 --> 01:24:59,425
For my father.

1371
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:02,101
Martin bought it
and he still owns it

1372
01:25:02,137 --> 01:25:03,900
and is going to
be mine someday,

1373
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:06,168
I don't know how
a bed beoame available

1374
01:25:06,207 --> 01:25:07,435
in suoh a short time,

1375
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:10,200
but we got my Dad in there
in less than a week.

1376
01:25:10,245 --> 01:25:14,079
The morning we were to move
my father into the home,

1377
01:25:14,115 --> 01:25:17,915
the ambulanoe we'd booked
to piok him up was late.

1378
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,783
It plowed into a snowbank.

1379
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:22,781
No shit.

1380
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,258
So we waited,

1381
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:27,727
the three of us,
for another bus.

1382
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:34,460
And while we waited...

1383
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:37,865
Martin bathed my father...

1384
01:25:37,906 --> 01:25:41,398
and ohanged
my father...

1385
01:25:41,442 --> 01:25:43,467
and wiped my father.

1386
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:45,940
The day I met Martin

1387
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,949
he told me he would
always take oare of me.

1388
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:51,975
But most people break
promises and vows.

1389
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,215
Values and intentions

1390
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:58,749
are sideswiped
with abjeot oarelessness

1391
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:00,818
as easy as one might
step on an ant,

1392
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:03,353
so, I didn't put
muoh stook in it.

1393
01:26:05,133 --> 01:26:08,102
Until that day...

1394
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:12,835
On that day I knew Martin
was the real MoCoy.

1395
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:16,236
So...

1396
01:26:16,277 --> 01:26:19,303
I was able to put up
with his dallianoes,

1397
01:26:19,347 --> 01:26:21,747
with his ambivalenoe
towards my vagina,

1398
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:23,910
with his lip-looked kisses,

1399
01:26:23,952 --> 01:26:28,514
Just beoause he was kind
to my father...

1400
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:33,159
To a man, to a stranger,
to my father.

1401
01:26:34,462 --> 01:26:37,863
For a man who knew he'd be
dead by the time I turned 30

1402
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:39,992
and went ahead
and had me anyway.

1403
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:46,868
Generosity oan be
a freaky thing.

1404
01:26:46,908 --> 01:26:48,170
I'd have been pissed.

1405
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,139
Why?

1406
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,148
Did I say something wrong?

1407
01:26:56,784 --> 01:26:57,808
Well...

1408
01:26:57,852 --> 01:27:00,150
I'm about to put
your penis in my mouth,

1409
01:27:00,188 --> 01:27:01,553
and you have
the presenoe of mind

1410
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:03,450
to oritique my personal life.

1411
01:27:04,826 --> 01:27:06,293
Bad form.

1412
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,491
What shall I do now?

1413
01:27:44,832 --> 01:27:46,197
I'm sorry.

1414
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:47,934

Whas wrong?

1417
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:43,051
How oan you
make love to him?

1418
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:54,125
Daddy?

1419
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:03,903
Beoause he's the best lover
I've ever had.

1420
01:29:06,447 --> 01:29:09,177
And part of me
wants him baok.

1421
01:29:11,953 --> 01:29:14,319
And part of me wishes I'd
never had you and your sister

1422

beoause I think thas
what soared him away.

1423
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:19,321
I hate that last part, honey,
but is there.

1424
01:29:26,934 --> 01:29:28,424
I lost my virginity.

1425
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:31,637
How do you feel about that?

1426
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:35,042
Is that really all you have
to say to me?

1427
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,172
Whad you say to Mel

1428
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:39,577
when she told you
she lost hers?

1429
01:29:39,614 --> 01:29:40,979
She never told me.

1430
01:29:41,015 --> 01:29:43,040
As far as I'm oonoerned
she's still a virgin.

1431
01:29:44,952 --> 01:29:47,386
I oan't deoide whether or not
I was raped.

Are you hurt?

I don't want to remember
any mistakes I made.

1435

I think you
might know him.

1436
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:02,062
He works with Mel.

1437
01:30:05,106 --> 01:30:07,472
I don't want to make
it any worse for you.

1438

We oan take measures.

1439

His father is a lawyer;
he'd rake me over the ooals.

1440
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:16,540
I want to put it behind me.

1441
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:20,418
A misadventure...

1442
01:30:20,455 --> 01:30:23,015
A oaloulated risk.

1443
01:30:23,057 --> 01:30:26,083
A olassio example
of trust gone awry.

1444

I want to go
far away from here.

1445
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:33,296
I want to olose my eyes

a random spot on the globe
and go there...

1447
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,095
And when I arrive

1448
01:30:37,138 --> 01:30:38,628
I want to meet
a wonderful man

1449
01:30:38,673 --> 01:30:41,369
and I want him
to make love to me.

1450
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,234
Thas all I want.

1451
01:30:46,347 --> 01:30:48,315
I want you
to have that, too.

1452
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:55,519
I'm okay.

1453
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:58,252
I'm still gonna go to the
gyneoologist tomorrow though.

1454
01:31:01,028 --> 01:31:02,791
Were you ever raped?

1455
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:04,793
No.

1456
01:31:06,734 --> 01:31:09,202
But I had sex
when I didn't want to have it,

1457
01:31:09,237 --> 01:31:11,137
but even then it was
still out of love.

1458
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:15,602
What oan I do
for you now?

1459
01:31:16,711 --> 01:31:18,269
Tonight?

1460
01:31:29,056 --> 01:31:31,286
I wish I oould tell you
it was something dramatio,

1461
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:33,225
like...

1462
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:35,058
I began to drink like a mop

1463
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,690
when I first disoovered
your father's seoret.

1464
01:31:37,732 --> 01:31:40,565
But I knew
before we were married.

1465
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,834
And he made me feel
like I was proteoted,

1466
01:31:46,073 --> 01:31:48,166
and thas the worst thing that
oan ever happen to a woman,

1467
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,575
the worst thing,
the worst.

1468
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:53,645
You know what impressed
me the most about Daddy

1469
01:31:53,681 --> 01:31:54,841
on our first date?

1470
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:57,846
He never asked my age;
it never mattered to him.

1471
01:32:01,489 --> 01:32:04,583
And I drank through both
pregnanoies from time to time.

1472
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:05,717
And I don't oare,

1473
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,728
and I won't harbor
any guilt over that.

1474
01:32:14,302 --> 01:32:16,099
Who was he?

1475
01:32:16,137 --> 01:32:17,604

that sex was great.

1477

It is.

Look, I figure I've got about
ten thousand days left.

oonstant attention.

1482
01:32:38,693 --> 01:32:41,218
Years...
are ephemeral.

1483

The oonoept of a year is beyond
most people's oapabilities,

1484
01:32:44,131 --> 01:32:46,565
but a day -
24 hours -

1485
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:48,501

thing in the world.

what you did yesterday,

to oook for me.

How dare you?!

1589
01:37:51,572 --> 01:37:52,800
Calm down.

1590
01:37:55,776 --> 01:37:57,471
What about Mel?

1591
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,107
She was amused

1592
01:38:01,148 --> 01:38:05,084
by a very stupid,
pitiful boy.

1593
01:38:06,754 --> 01:38:08,619
Vivien makes
her own ohoioes,

1594
01:38:08,656 --> 01:38:11,090
and I respeot
all of her ohoioes.

1595
01:38:12,593 --> 01:38:15,084
You're an overaohiever,
aren't you?

1596
01:38:16,463 --> 01:38:17,623
A permanent reoord

1597
01:38:17,665 --> 01:38:20,828
flashing with
extra-ourrioular exoellenoe.

1598
01:38:20,868 --> 01:38:22,563
Advanoed plaoement aohievements,

1599
01:38:22,603 --> 01:38:25,504
mentoring those
younger than yourself.

1600
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:27,507
But don't you think
thas sad?

1601
01:38:28,475 --> 01:38:30,136
I think thas sad.

1602
01:38:30,177 --> 01:38:32,168
You're all over the map.

1603
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:34,043
You've got no foous.

1604
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:37,050
You've left yourself no room.

1605
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:46,982
You're a reoipe
for utter medioority.

1606
01:38:47,027 --> 01:38:49,120
You've obviously
no sense of obedienoe,

1607
01:38:49,163 --> 01:38:51,063
no grasp of insight,

1608
01:38:51,098 --> 01:38:52,998
you've had
no guidanoe whatsoever.

1609
01:38:53,033 --> 01:38:55,627
Did you know that Mel
buys her Mom her liquor?

1610
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:57,136
Not all of it.

1611
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:58,263
Stop him.

1612
01:38:58,505 --> 01:39:00,803
Is not your fault entirely,
my friend.

1613
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:02,672
And get that look
off your faoe.

1614
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,734
What look?

1615
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:05,802
The look that says,
"I'm a viotim."

1616
01:39:05,846 --> 01:39:07,677
Would you like to stay?

1617
01:39:07,715 --> 01:39:09,876
Is possible,
is appropriate.

1618
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:11,817
I'm not going to
humiliate her like that.

1619
01:39:11,852 --> 01:39:13,149
Really?

1620
01:39:13,187 --> 01:39:15,519
Maura, would you like
to desoribe for our friend

1621
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:17,285
the punishment at hand?

1622
01:39:17,524 --> 01:39:21,153
Or to desoribe
how you're feeling now?

1623
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:25,154
How you'll feel later,
afterwards?

1624
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,632
Would you?

1625
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:27,656
Mel?

1626
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,194
I think you should stay.

1627
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:33,900
Daddy, don't. Please.

1628
01:39:33,941 --> 01:39:36,910
She'll reoeive
a glass of brandy first.

1629
01:39:36,944 --> 01:39:40,243
It will help
with her breathing later.

1630
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,046
This is a big, fuoked-up
praotioal joke, right?

1631
01:39:58,232 --> 01:40:00,666
Go upstairs, Maura,
and prepare yourself.

1632
01:40:02,036 --> 01:40:03,094
Now.

1633
01:40:03,137 --> 01:40:05,105
Not yet. Please, Martin.

1634
01:40:08,108 --> 01:40:09,803
Get out.

1635
01:40:11,245 --> 01:40:12,872
Get out, Jeff.

1636
01:40:12,913 --> 01:40:14,938
Please.

1637
01:40:14,982 --> 01:40:16,347
You don't want to be here.

1638
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,882
Is going to hurt.

1639
01:40:24,992 --> 01:40:26,357
Don't hurt her.

1640
01:40:28,996 --> 01:40:30,088
Please.

1641
01:40:57,624 --> 01:40:58,716
One more date, Mel,

1642
01:40:58,759 --> 01:41:00,386
and all of this
would have never happened.

1643
01:41:20,681 --> 01:41:22,410
[Belt snapping]

1644
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:25,743
Where did you get this thing?

1645
01:41:25,786 --> 01:41:27,083
Did you have to buy it?

1646
01:41:27,121 --> 01:41:29,282
No, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

1647
01:41:29,323 --> 01:41:31,154
Is on loan...

1648
01:41:31,191 --> 01:41:33,182
From my barber shop...

1649
01:41:33,227 --> 01:41:34,751
Really.

1650
01:41:55,249 --> 01:41:59,049
You love putting on a show,
don't you?

1651
01:41:59,086 --> 01:42:00,917
We didn't make light of it.

1652
01:42:01,722 --> 01:42:04,054
They're my daughters,
you're my wife.

1653
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:06,787
I gave him an opening;
he didn't take it.

1654
01:42:07,427 --> 01:42:09,987
You shot him down
right from the start.

1655
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:14,091
You're drawn to flamboyance
like a moth to a flame -

1656
01:42:14,134 --> 01:42:16,796
like Robert
with your new shrine.

1657
01:42:16,837 --> 01:42:19,101
If you were going to do
something for the girls

1658
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:21,198
you'd have quietly
consulted an attorney.

1659
01:42:22,376 --> 01:42:23,468
Show's over.

1660
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:30,941
Why were you orying earlier?

1661
01:42:33,387 --> 01:42:35,355
You soared me to death
over the thought

1662
01:42:35,389 --> 01:42:38,847
that I might be
hurting you in some way.

1663
01:42:38,892 --> 01:42:41,292
I thought you might
pass out.

1664
01:42:44,264 --> 01:42:46,494
You know what
it reminded me of?

1665
01:42:46,733 --> 01:42:49,099
Fourth grade, Tenoh Phillips.

1666
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:50,501
The sohool bully.

1667
01:42:50,737 --> 01:42:55,106
Yes, his name
was aotually Tenoh.

1668
01:42:55,142 --> 01:42:59,272
I don't know how,
but at age eleven,

1669
01:42:59,313 --> 01:43:03,249
he knew I might be gay.

1670
01:43:03,283 --> 01:43:05,843
I keep meaning
to look him up

1671
01:43:05,886 --> 01:43:07,148
one of these days

1672
01:43:07,187 --> 01:43:12,056
and ask him how he knew
I was different at age eleven.

1673
01:43:12,092 --> 01:43:16,529
Anyway, he would torment me
from dawn until midday sun.

1674
01:43:16,763 --> 01:43:18,788
The threats he would
make were paralyzing.

1675
01:43:18,832 --> 01:43:20,857
I beoame so anxious...

1676
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:24,997
I wet my pants
running home from sohool onoe...

1677
01:43:25,038 --> 01:43:28,166
running from
imaginary footsteps.

1678
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:31,541
Still, he was gonna kiok my ass.

1679
01:43:31,778 --> 01:43:34,269
So, sinoe I knew it was ooming,

1680
01:43:34,314 --> 01:43:37,545
sooner or later, I summoned...

1681
01:43:37,784 --> 01:43:40,014
I don't know, not oourage,

1682
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:44,285
but some sort of perverse form
of mental self-preservation.

1683
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:46,019
And I sought him out.

1684
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:47,890
I oried in his faoe.

1685
01:43:47,928 --> 01:43:51,955
I soreamed at him
and I begged the sohool bully -

1686
01:43:51,999 --> 01:43:54,058
by reputation if not by deed -

1687
01:43:54,101 --> 01:43:56,569
I begged Tenoh Phillips
to beat me up.

1688
01:43:56,803 --> 01:44:00,295
I was almost lusting for it.

1689
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:04,436
But he wouldn't do it.

1690
01:44:04,478 --> 01:44:10,815
He just turned...
and walked away.

1691
01:44:12,352 --> 01:44:15,321
The worst thing about
that moment was that,

1692
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:18,449
he gazed into my eyes

1693
01:44:18,492 --> 01:44:24,192
with a look of utter boredom.

1694
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:29,861
I was trembling
and hyperventilating and...

1695
01:44:29,903 --> 01:44:31,962
It would have made anyone
who witnessed the event

1696
01:44:32,005 --> 01:44:34,200
think I was going
to have a stroke.

1697
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:39,209
My gym teaoher, Mr. Davis,

1698
01:44:39,246 --> 01:44:41,077
he witnessed it.

1699
01:44:41,114 --> 01:44:45,210
And the next day
he took my under his wing.

1700
01:44:45,252 --> 01:44:46,617
He was straight as an arrow,

1701
01:44:46,853 --> 01:44:48,480
married to another teaoher
from the high sohool,

1702
01:44:48,522 --> 01:44:49,489
the drama teaoher.

1703
01:44:49,523 --> 01:44:51,354
They took me to plays -

1704
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:54,485
dramas, not musioals -

1705
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,257
to muzeums.

1706
01:44:56,296 --> 01:45:00,995
Sometimes even asked me to
out olass to take me to lunoh.

1707
01:45:02,402 --> 01:45:08,238
I was his pitiable protégé,
and...

1708
01:45:08,275 --> 01:45:13,508
He was... my friend.

1709
01:45:14,414 --> 01:45:17,110
God, he saved me.

1710
01:45:17,884 --> 01:45:19,146
But more than that,

1711
01:45:19,186 --> 01:45:21,518
he taught me
how to proteot someone.

1712
01:45:23,423 --> 01:45:27,655
I wanted to be that guy,
for you.

1713
01:45:27,894 --> 01:45:30,988
I wanted to be
that guy in your life.

1714
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:53,283
My dad used to take
me to baseball games

1715
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,344
all the time.

1716
01:45:54,388 --> 01:45:56,288
Little league games,
major league games,

1717
01:45:56,323 --> 01:46:00,020
trips to Florida
to spring training oamp.

1718
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,961
He thought if I had a son
it might oome in handy.

1719
01:46:02,996 --> 01:46:04,156
Silly.

1720
01:46:04,197 --> 01:46:06,165
Well, I like baseball,

1721
01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:08,429
so you messed that up.

1722
01:46:11,471 --> 01:46:15,567
It was silly o'olook
in the morning

1723
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:17,941
when I arrived today.

1724
01:46:17,978 --> 01:46:19,377
I never thought
I'd find you anywhere

1725
01:46:19,413 --> 01:46:21,438
but under your blanket
at that hour.

1726
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:24,710
I heard you and Mom.

1727
01:46:24,951 --> 01:46:26,714
I oouldn't sleep.

1728
01:46:28,622 --> 01:46:30,112
Mother tells me

1729
01:46:30,157 --> 01:46:33,058
your reading habits
have shifted of late -

1730
01:46:33,093 --> 01:46:35,084
romanoe novels.

1731
01:46:35,128 --> 01:46:38,188
They're easier.
Less time-oonsuming.

1732
01:46:38,231 --> 01:46:40,461
Why is your time
suddenly so oompromised?

1733
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:44,527
I used to worry all the time,

1734
01:46:44,571 --> 01:46:47,267
and now I worry even more.

1735
01:46:47,307 --> 01:46:50,140
So, I had to make time
for the additional worry.

1736
01:46:50,177 --> 01:46:51,474
Thas why.

1737
01:46:53,647 --> 01:46:54,978
Mother, Vivien...

1738
01:46:55,015 --> 01:46:56,380
why do you have
a different name for Mom

1739
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:57,974
every time you refer to her?

1740
01:47:01,988 --> 01:47:05,219
Henry James, Fitzgerald,
they're also romanoe novelists.

1741
01:47:05,258 --> 01:47:08,352
But you know that already,
don't you?

1742
01:47:09,996 --> 01:47:12,430
Is killing me
to have to impose

1743
01:47:12,466 --> 01:47:16,664
some unoomfortable formality
in oonversing with my daughter.

1744
01:47:22,342 --> 01:47:25,175
I saved someone's life
this week.

1745
01:47:25,212 --> 01:47:26,509
What are you talking about?

1746
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:30,383
I was aooompanying a friend

1747
01:47:30,417 --> 01:47:32,510
from Children's
Emergenoy Servioes

1748
01:47:32,552 --> 01:47:34,452
on a house oall.

1749
01:47:34,488 --> 01:47:38,254
He was returning two young
ohildren to their parents.

1750
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:41,454
I took one look at the squalor

1751
01:53:26,947 --> 02:46:58,203
[Skipped item nr. 1751]

1752
02:46:58,203 --> 01:47:45,031
[Skipped item nr. 1752]

1753
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:46,396
And I wept.

1754
01:47:46,433 --> 01:47:48,526
You gotta stop weeping so muoh.

1755
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:53,534
I asked my friend
to stop at a Home Depot

1756
01:47:53,573 --> 01:47:58,135
so I oould get
a smoke alarm and a...

1757
01:47:58,178 --> 01:48:01,614
oarbon monoxide deteotor.

1758
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:06,085
As soon as I aotivated them,
the C.M. Deteotor went off.

1759
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:07,279
The levels in that house

1760
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,810
would have killed
those kids by morning.

1761
01:48:09,055 --> 01:48:10,545
So thas four lives.

1762

You're a hero.

1763
01:48:13,727 --> 01:48:16,753

1764
01:48:16,796 --> 01:48:18,821
you're proud of me,

1765
01:48:19,065 --> 01:48:22,159
or merely stating a faot.

1766
01:48:35,482 --> 01:48:40,715
I so want to impress you,
I so want to be your father.

1767
01:48:40,754 --> 01:48:43,655
I'm a very
goal-oriented person.

1768
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:49,720
I had no one to set goals for
before you and Mel oame along.

1769
01:48:51,097 --> 01:48:53,531
There's no expiration date.

1770
01:48:53,567 --> 01:48:55,762
I'll never give up.

1771
01:48:55,802 --> 01:48:56,860
Never.

1772
01:48:58,638 --> 01:49:01,732
Give me just
a little more leeway.

1773
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,541
Is almost 7:30.

1774
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,878
We've been together
almost the entire day.

1775
01:49:15,522 --> 01:49:17,251
Wasn't so bad, was it?

1776
01:49:21,795 --> 01:49:23,626
See you later, Dad.

1777
01:49:23,663 --> 01:49:24,755
You bet.

1778
01:50:45,478 --> 01:50:46,775
Sooot over.

1779
01:50:52,519 --> 01:50:53,781
Whas wrong?

1780
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:58,485
I'm embarrassed.

1781
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,987
I never...

1782
01:51:02,228 --> 01:51:03,855
I never know
what to say to you,

1783
01:51:03,897 --> 01:51:05,364
and you never talk.

1784
01:51:07,934 --> 01:51:09,731
Well, stop orying.

1785
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:11,259
Okay.

1786
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:14,672
I'm sorry.
I never have fuoking tissues.

1787
01:51:18,778 --> 01:51:19,904
Here.

1788
01:51:21,281 --> 01:51:22,373
Thanks.

1789
01:51:22,649 --> 01:51:24,344
Hey...

1790
01:51:24,384 --> 01:51:26,750
I think I want
to go baok to sohool,

1791
01:51:26,786 --> 01:51:30,017
but I think I also want
to go to Europe first.

1792
01:51:30,256 --> 01:51:31,655
Where?

1793
01:51:32,792 --> 01:51:33,884
Ireland.

1794
01:51:35,395 --> 01:51:37,625
You saved those issues
of National Geographio

1795
01:51:37,664 --> 01:51:39,894
Dad used to oherish,
didn't you?

1796
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:46,500
But I don't want to leave Mom.

1797
01:51:46,539 --> 01:51:47,938
Maybe I should take her.

1798
01:51:49,843 --> 01:51:51,572
What about Dad?

1799
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:57,807
I think I want
to meet his... partner.

1800
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,388
I met him.

1801
01:52:02,422 --> 01:52:03,650
Whas he like?

1802
01:52:06,559 --> 01:52:07,958
He's into sports.

1803
01:52:09,562 --> 01:52:10,654
He's overweight.

1804
01:52:10,697 --> 01:52:12,392
No!

1805
01:52:13,333 --> 01:52:14,960
He's a bit of a prima donna

1806
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:16,798
but he oan be funny about it.

1807
01:52:18,304 --> 01:52:20,067
He's not very ambitious,

1808
01:52:20,306 --> 01:52:23,070
but he loves
everything about Dad.

1809
01:52:23,309 --> 01:52:25,072
I mean,
he spoils Dad rotten.

1810
01:52:26,579 --> 01:52:28,410
Whas he look like?

1811
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:31,811
Vinoe Vaughn.

1812
01:52:35,321 --> 01:52:38,484
Does he have
any kind of a job?

1813
01:52:38,525 --> 01:52:39,549
No.

1814
01:52:41,995 --> 01:52:44,964
I saw them
playing oatoh one morning.

1815
01:52:46,332 --> 01:52:49,028
They woke up early

1816
01:52:49,068 --> 01:52:52,435
and they did
yardwork together

1817
01:52:52,472 --> 01:52:54,702
and then they started
playing oatoh.

1818
01:52:55,909 --> 01:52:57,774
Were they any good at it?

1819
01:52:57,811 --> 01:52:59,108
I oouldn't tell.

1820
01:53:01,347 --> 01:53:03,338
On the...

1821
01:53:03,383 --> 01:53:06,978
On the seoond night I was there
I oouldn't sleep.

1822
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:10,512
So I walked down to the kitohen
in the middle of the night,

1823
01:53:10,557 --> 01:53:13,492
and Robert oame downstairs.

1824
01:53:13,526 --> 01:53:17,895
And he oooked me
an egg-white omelette.

1825
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:21,799
And Dad oame down too,

1826
01:53:21,835 --> 01:53:24,668
to keep me oompany...

1827
01:53:24,704 --> 01:53:28,470
Or to keep Robert oompany.

1828
01:53:28,508 --> 01:53:30,135
I oouldn't ever deoide

1829
01:53:30,376 --> 01:53:32,469
whioh option
I preferred to believe...

1830
01:53:36,082 --> 01:53:40,041
Dad helped me with
my homework that weekend.

1831
01:53:41,988 --> 01:53:45,014
And he and Robert
threw a oooktail party

1832
01:53:45,058 --> 01:53:47,151
and introduoed me to everyone.

1833
01:53:47,393 --> 01:53:50,021
This was all
in one weekend?

1834
01:53:50,063 --> 01:53:53,794
Yeah. I felt suffooated.

1835
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:56,932
I wanted Mom.

1836
01:53:59,939 --> 01:54:02,169
Do you know
I used to do dope?

1837
01:54:02,408 --> 01:54:03,670
Bullshit!

1840
01:54:08,982 --> 01:54:11,041
Well, not anymore.

1841
01:54:11,084 --> 01:54:14,576
Nor do I blow ooke,
or drop aoid,

1842
01:54:14,621 --> 01:54:17,055
take amphetamines,
opiated hash...

1843
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:18,785
Oh, my God! Stop!

1844
01:54:18,825 --> 01:54:20,986
My ears are bleeding.

1845
01:54:21,027 --> 01:54:25,123
You know, I remember
one night I had to meet someone

1846
01:54:25,164 --> 01:54:28,429
to go buy... pills.

1847
01:54:29,869 --> 01:54:33,134
It was 1 AM,
and I took Mom's oar.

1848
01:54:34,841 --> 01:54:36,206
And it was winter

1849
01:54:36,442 --> 01:54:37,807
and the roads
were just enorusted

1850
01:54:37,844 --> 01:54:40,210
with this layer of blaok ioe.

1851
01:54:42,115 --> 01:54:45,141
And I was high
before I even left the house.

1852
01:54:46,586 --> 01:54:49,146
I pioked up my stuff.

1853
01:54:49,188 --> 01:54:55,718
But on the way home
I smashed the oar...

1854
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:57,753
right into a tree.

1855
01:54:59,866 --> 01:55:01,094
Head on.

1856
01:55:03,002 --> 01:55:06,699
I was fine, but I was high.

1857
01:55:07,874 --> 01:55:10,502
So I just left the oar there

1858
01:55:10,543 --> 01:55:12,841
like it was a parking spaoe,

1859
01:55:12,879 --> 01:55:15,712
and, um...

1860
01:55:15,748 --> 01:55:18,581
...started walking.

1861
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:21,985
And I remember
the streets were deserted.

1862
01:55:22,021 --> 01:55:24,046
I was so tired.

1863
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:26,058
I just walked home,

1864
01:55:26,092 --> 01:55:28,925
walked up the stairs,
and passed out.

1865
01:55:30,697 --> 01:55:33,723
And then the oops oame.

1866
01:55:33,766 --> 01:55:35,597
Where was I?

1867
01:55:35,635 --> 01:55:38,126
Asleep... in bed.

1868
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:40,537
They asked Mom
if the oar was hers

1869
01:55:40,573 --> 01:55:42,666
and told her where it was.

1870
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:46,076
And then Mom
oame into my bedroom...

1871
01:55:46,112 --> 01:55:49,013
And I was dead to the world

1872
01:55:49,048 --> 01:55:50,811
but I guess I displayed
enough signs of life

1873
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:53,216
that they deoided
I would survive.

1874
01:55:53,252 --> 01:55:55,015
And they just
let me sleep it off.

1875
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:59,183
I was 15.

1876
01:56:01,527 --> 01:56:03,290
It should have been
a wakeup oall,

1877
01:56:03,529 --> 01:56:05,019
but it wasn't.

1878
01:56:07,533 --> 01:56:09,763
Drugs took the edge off.

1879
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:14,637
They sent all my
usual miseries paoking.

1880
01:56:14,674 --> 01:56:17,768
And without them, I...

1881
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,710
just stopped talking
to everyone.

out of taking me in.
