1
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:11,677
The umbrella in the drink
is not the strongest chick magnet.

2
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:14,263
It attracts a certain kind of woman.

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,474
They're called men.

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,610
You are at the apartment for a month
and you still haven't asked katie out.

5
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,890
- What are you waiting for?
- She come off the break-up with Ben.

6
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:27,052
Before I make my move,
I wanna be sure she's ready to move on.

7
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:28,798
I need a clear sign,

8
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:32,698
like a flashing neon sign saying,
"Go for it, Mark."

9
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:38,287
Waiting on a clear sign from a woman...
Do you even like sex?

10
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,766
Oh my god. You guys
are not gonna believe this.

11
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,175
Katie's ex is here

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,760
and he's with another woman.

13
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,845
And a hot one too.
Good for him.

14
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,001
I mean... that bastard.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,524
Katie broke up with him three weeks ago.
It's dating etiquette.

16
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,523
You're not supposed to be seen in public
with someone else for at least a month.

17
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,518
- How could that girl over Katie?
- Katie's way cuter.

18
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:13,531
Did you see those cheap rhinestones
glued on her nails?

19
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,590
With breasts like that,
I don't care if she has arms.

20
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:22,858
I mean... that bastard.

21
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,660
Not good.

22
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,504
- Katie's on her way right now.
- This will devastate her.

23
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,589
I'll call and tell her to go
someplace else.

24
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,051
- Too late.
- Hey, guys.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,280
Order me a beer.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

26
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,409
- What's the hurry?
- I've been on the D train for 45 min.

27
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,891
Passed "hurry", coming up
on "get the hell out of my way".

28
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,469
You know what?
The bathrooms here are terrible.

29
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:47,347
There's a great one around the corner...
They play soft jazz. Let's go.

30
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,345
What is wrong with you people?

31
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:01,704
I didn't expect to see you here.

32
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:06,041
But I figured we were bound
to run into each other sooner or later.

33
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,878
We're both adults,
so it's cool, right?

34
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:13,283
Totally cool.
Are you kidding?

35
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,888
- Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you.

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,937
- Looks like we dodged a bullet.
- Just one little thing.

37
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,563
You know what's funny?
We dated six months,

38
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,148
we shared secrets,

39
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,818
bared our souls, and we just broke up
and you're already out with some tramp.

40
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,279
I'm sure you're very nice.

41
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,734
But you know what?

42
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:39,296
If you can move on, so can I.

43
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,922
Maybe I'll go out with the first guy
that I see.

44
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,078
Hot wings.

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,665
- Wanna go out tonight?
- Totally.

46
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,043
Stay. I'm making a point.

47
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,109
And the point is that I am moving on
from you.

48
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,363
Love the nails!
Moving on, jerk.

49
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,099
There's your sign. Go after her.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,299
Not you!

51
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,224
-- Room-A-Team --

52
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,545
VO: pluch, -Ori-

53
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,795
www.sub-way.fr

54
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,264
Shooting star.

55
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:45,718
Naked lady.

56
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,773
Katie's moving on.
She's ready to start dating again.

57
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:55,942
- It's my chance. I'm gonna ask her out.
- Great.

58
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,571
I'll help.
Pretend I'm katie and ask me out.

59
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,818
- What? Why?
- You know how you are around girls.

60
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:05,995
You get nervous, stammer and then
you throw in random spanish words.

61
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,371
I do not.

62
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,667
That's why we practice. You're in denial
about the holes in your game.

63
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,211
This is important.
Now ask.

64
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,546
Fine.

65
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,887
I was just...

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,851
- You didn't even let me finish.
- Be forceful. Go.

67
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,479
We've been living
together for a while now...

68
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,007
Boring.
I got a ton of guys to pick from.

69
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,526
Sweep me off my feet.

70
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,028
Do you want to get a drink?

71
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:41,224
- Dinner?
- I'm washing my hair.

72
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,328
- Concert?
- I'm drying my hair.

73
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:45,910
Come on.
You're killing my confidence.

74
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:49,955
Sorry. I always wanted to know
what it was like to play hard to get.

75
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,169
You're ready.
Now go ask Katie out.

76
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,254
- Thanks.
- Call me.

77
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,833
Why is there a mattress
in the hallway?

78
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,977
We're having a ben purge.

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,590
I'm getting rid of everything
that reminds me of Ben.

80
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,629
- It's like, I'm cleansing my life.
- It's a benema.

81
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,081
Great. I'll help.

82
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,620
- That was mine.
- Sorry.

83
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,622
That was a gift from my mom, jerk.

84
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:38,491
It feels so good to be starting fresh.
It's kind of exciting.

85
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:41,480
- I'm back out there.
- Anyhoo,

86
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,454
I thought maybe we could...

87
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,305
You know, with the benema and all,

88
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,974
we could, you know,

89
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:51,564
grab a drink.

90
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,172
It'd beloco.

91
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,035
I have to go get a mattress.
They're having a midnight madness sale

92
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,901
over at club bed.
You wanna come with me?

93
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,029
That would be no problema, senorita.

94
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:06,323
I'll go grab my purse.

95
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,304
They're serving wine at a bed store.

96
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,229
Fancy.

97
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,923
Guess they wanna get you drunk
to get you into bed.

98
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,037
Thanks for coming with me.

99
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,928
- I don't know that much about beds.
- I'm great in bed...

100
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,807
Great with beds!
You know. I know a lot about beds.

101
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,541
- Cheers.
- To moving on.

102
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,895
To moving on.

103
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,631
So you wanna hop into bed?

104
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:42,985
Sure.

105
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,022
This one seems nice.
What do you think?

106
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:52,870
Here. Sit by me.

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,012
I wanna see what it feels
like to watch tv in bed.

108
00:06:56,137 --> 00:07:00,359
Never thought I'd be here in bed
drinking wine with Katie Bowman.

109
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,295
Look at me in bed drinking wine
with Mark Fletcher.

110
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,529
It's crazy.

111
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,026
Loco loco.

112
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,137
I like this one.
I could get used to this

113
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:11,895
me too.

114
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,041
So listen,

115
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,896
- I was thinking...
- Check out that bed. Great.

116
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,466
I'm gonna go get something.

117
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,577
<i>Have you asked Katie out yet?</i>

118
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,951
I was about to,
but I spilled some wine.

119
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,945
You smuggled wine into a bed store?

120
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,088
You dog.

121
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,423
- So how's it going?
- It's a minor setback,

122
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:43,803
- but it's going really well.
- That's great.

123
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,757
You're not speaking
any spanish, are you?

124
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,569
I used to think
she was only into guys like Ben but

125
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:55,367
- I start to think I could be her type.
- Of course you're her type.

126
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:58,060
Repeat after me:
"I am Katie's type".

127
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,478
I am Katie's type.

128
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,939
- Again.
- I am Katie's type.

129
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,525
Good. Now go get her.
Make me proud.

130
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:07,672
Call me.

131
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,471
I am Katie's type.

132
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,118
I am Katie's type.

133
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,827
- Guess what?
- You bought a bed?

134
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,204
- I have a date.
- With who?

135
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:22,841
With me.

136
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,539
I turn away for two seconds
and katie is on a date with a guy

137
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,387
who looks like me,
dresses like me...

138
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:34,888
Thom, he is me.

139
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:38,412
I see.
He's your clone.

140
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:43,147
- In a matter of speaking.
- Or he could actually be your clone.

141
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,983
- He couldn't.
- Stranger things have happened.

142
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:47,904
They haven't.

143
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:52,156
This is terrible. I've actually missed
my chance with Katie with me.

144
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,492
Look on the bright side:
it means you are Katie's type.

145
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,411
What use is that?
What if he marries her?

146
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,272
Awesome.
Then it's not just a passing fancy.

147
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,835
Maybe this goes deeper.
Maybe there's only a certain

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,961
amount of sex in NY for people
who look like me,

149
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,171
and he's been taking all of it.

150
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,924
That would explain a lot.

151
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,218
Those evil clones.

152
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,184
He is not a clone.

153
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:16,456
Right.

154
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:17,926
Of course.

155
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:19,612
Not a clone.

156
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,487
- You finally beat me at something.
- I play a lot while I'm at home.

157
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,324
The silver lining to long-term
unemployment.

158
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,246
Chill, man.

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm a little tense.

160
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,677
Cause Katie's on a date?
Don't worry.

161
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:48,879
She'll be back any minute complaining
about what a loser he is.

162
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,959
I found a winner!

163
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,376
Oh my god.

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,176
Eric is amazing!

165
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,370
- See?
- So you like him?

166
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,057
He's such a great guy.
It's nice to talk to a guy

167
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,058
without thinking he wants
to get you into bed,

168
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,602
especially since he's a bed salesman.

169
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,812
Bed salesman...
It's a good angle.

170
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,358
Everybody be here tomorrow night.
Eric is cooking us dinner.

171
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,318
Have you seen my lucky bra?

172
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,487
Wait. Lucky bra?
Why would you need that?

173
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,323
All bras are lucky.

174
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,527
They get to hold breasts all day.

175
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,053
It's for me.

176
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:23,080
I like to feel pretty
even if no one is gonna see it.

177
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:27,501
And pretty equals confident
equals sexy equals bed.

178
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,154
He's not trying to get me into bed.

179
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,887
Buying a girl a bed
to get her into bed.

180
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,182
It's so simple.

181
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,675
You guys, stop eating.
Eric is cooking us dinner.

182
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,406
I know.
Just loading up in case it sucks.

183
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,536
- He's a mattress salesman after all.
- And a chef.

184
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,331
A chef who works at a mattress store.

185
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,210
Maybe he'll make us a sheet cake.

186
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,436
Or pigs in a blanket.

187
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,495
Wait.

188
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,305
Run through it.

189
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,855
- You smell nice.
- Thank you.

190
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,733
Great place!

191
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,901
- Oh my.
- Told you.

192
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,246
Eric, you remember Mark
from the store?

193
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,015
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

194
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,376
- Im hope.
- Nice to meet you.

195
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,045
I understand
you're a mattress salesman.

196
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,126
Do people need new mattresses often?

197
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,337
Sleep is very vital
for long life and health.

198
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:56,048
Rough game though,
tough to make a living.

199
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:58,133
Not really. I own the store.

200
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,079
He has four locations.

201
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,058
Any more like you at home?
They can be ugly. I don't care.

202
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,462
I'm more of an artist.

203
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:11,938
I'm an actor. I act.
I like to feed the soul.

204
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,440
I like to feed myself.

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,987
- You two kinda look alike.
- I noticed that at the store.

206
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,840
There may be a slight resemblance.

207
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,368
Who knows? Maybe we are related.
My dad was a traveling salesman.

208
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,789
Funny, my mom's a whore.
What's for dinner?

209
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,085
I thought I'd bake a chick

210
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,380
with a garlic de provence sachet
and a nice three-pepper risotto.

211
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,371
This is a nightmare.

212
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,636
I could take it when she was dating ben.
He's nothing like me, but this guy?

213
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:47,307
He's more successful, more compelling,
more interesting version of me.

214
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,518
I think he might sleep
with both of 'em.

215
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,832
- Do you have any white pepper?
- White pepper.

216
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,124
You mean salt?

217
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:18,422
I mean white pepper.
The risotto won't be the same without.

218
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,384
Eric wants some
white pepper... fetch.

219
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,886
I really appreciate it,
little brother.

220
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,168
No problem.

221
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,850
You wanna come with me,
to make sure I get the right thing?

222
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:34,563
I would, but the risotto keeps sticking,
and I need katie's help to stir.

223
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,225
Seriously, do you have a cousin?

224
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,111
He could be stupid or in jail.
I really don't care.

225
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:48,493
It's open.

226
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,038
Thom, this is a nightmare.
What are you doing?

227
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:55,250
Enjoying my new 7 foot big screen tv.

228
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,899
That's the same Tiny TV
you've always had.

229
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:00,589
Not through
this high-powered telescope.

230
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,077
David hasselhoff's
coming out of the ocean

231
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,802
and he looks like a giant
attacking Los Angeles.

232
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,231
- So how's it going with the big dinner?
- Horrible.

233
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,581
Eric sent me out
to get white pepper.

234
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:14,856
He's making a three-pepper risotto

235
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:18,106
and roasted chicken with
an herbs de provence sachet.

236
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,192
Sounds delicious.

237
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:21,858
It doesn't.

238
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,571
It sounds pretentious
and high in sodium.

239
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:29,283
So this guy's on your home court
and he's playing his game.

240
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:32,112
He's a chef and he's making dinner,
so you gotta get back there

241
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:35,496
- and start doing what you're good at.
- Right! You're right.

242
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,210
What am I good at?

243
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,880
I got it. Math.
You're great at math.

244
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:45,717
There's no one that's faster
at quadratic equations than you.

245
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,253
Challengin to an olympics of the mind
and wowing Katie

246
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,490
with my knowledge of coefficients
is no match

247
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:54,689
for a jerk-faced chef bed salesman.

248
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,117
Mark, this guy may look like you,
but he's not you.

249
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:02,859
Everybody has something that makes them
unique and she needs to see that.

250
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,319
So you get back there,

251
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,406
and you find your own version
of a a three-pepper risotto.

252
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,200
OK. I'll do it.

253
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,080
Take your time. Don't force it.

254
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,249
- Got it.
- And save me some of that chicken.

255
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,427
- That chicken was so damn good.
- Do you eat those crumbs on your chin?

256
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,474
- Thanks, Eric.
- Thanks.

257
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,893
- Not the same without the pepper.
- Please.

258
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:38,733
Your dinner was great.

259
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,522
And so was your hard-to-believe story

260
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,275
about how you lost your watch on the top
of mount Everest...

261
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:45,870
I have bad luck with watches.

262
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,613
Last year I lost one
when I was swimming the English channel.

263
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,816
Mark, didn't you almost drown
on the log ride at wave town?

264
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,379
- Please let us help with the dishes.
- We insist.

265
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,320
The good news is:
he hasn't had sex with her yet.

266
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:09,593
If he had, he wouldn't
be working this hard.

267
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,571
- That's a relief.
- But if they do last,

268
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,058
they're going to have
gorgeous babies.

269
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,672
Who's up for some video games?

270
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,941
Can anybody even move after Eric's
incredibly fattening gut bomb?

271
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,528
Few more meals like that, we will have
to take down walls to get us out.

272
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,823
It was only 380 calories per serving.
It's very healthy.

273
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,993
Healthy and delicious,
just like you.

274
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,126
Maybe you two want some alone time.

275
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,670
They seem really comfortable doing stuff
in front of everybody.

276
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:49,275
I'm sorry. We're being rude.
Eric came to meet all of you guys.

277
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,093
You should get to know him.
He could be around a while.

278
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,179
Let's hope so.
How are you with fish?

279
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,337
- That's next time. And I eat a brag.
- You don't.

280
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,935
My salmon recipe was featured
in "yummy light cooking" magazine.

281
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:04,636
You know what?
Let's box.

282
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,303
I love this game.

283
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:09,194
- Care to take me on, champ?
- Love to.

284
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:13,131
- Watch out. I'm pretty good.
- Me too.

285
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,023
- You are good.
- I play a lot.

286
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,207
Keep your left up, Mark!

287
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,647
- Care to take it down a level?
- No, I got you right where I want ya.

288
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,879
- Dude!
- I didn't mean to hit below the belt.

289
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,884
- No rough stuff down there, please.
- Only if it's by special request.

290
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,224
Sorry. I'm sorry,
it was an accident. Are you okay?

291
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,476
I just got hit in the face.

292
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,228
Again, really sorry.

293
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,147
What's with you? You've been
a jerk to me since I got here.

294
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,774
I got you pepper.

295
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:51,277
You just hit the mattress king
of Brooklyn.

296
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:55,073
And I apologized already,
your highness.

297
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:59,685
You think this is funny?
I'm shooting my commercial tomorrow.

298
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,033
I'm gonna have black eyes.
I'm gonna look unrested.

299
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,957
That's death for a mattress salesman.

300
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,420
Mark's an actor and he looks like you.
Maybe he could do it.

301
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,548
- I'm really very good.
- You think anybody could replace me?

302
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,092
- Please.
- Calm down, it was an accident.

303
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,327
An accident?
You wanna know what wasn't an accident?

304
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,471
Was me killing myself
cooking for all you guys,

305
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,753
just so I could get Katie into bed.

306
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:24,436
Great! I just said that out loud.
That's probably not gonna happen now.

307
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,900
- Is it?
- I think you should leave.

308
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,068
Back to my place.

309
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,780
I am liking this guy more and more.

310
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:45,582
How's it going?

311
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,668
You okay after
Eric's little meltdown?

312
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:55,049
Sorry you're not gonna go off and live
happy ever after in mattress kingdom.

313
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,010
It's for the best.

314
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,430
At least I didn't date him for a year
before I found out he was crazy.

315
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,352
That's something.

316
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:03,892
So listen...

317
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,651
You were saying how you're ready
to start dating again.

318
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,568
You were right.
I jumped in too soon.

319
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,924
I'm not so sure about that.

320
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,656
I really have
a broken man-picker.

321
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,548
I can't pick men.

322
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,371
Sure there have been a few bad apples,
but you can't just give up.

323
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,459
I'm not giving up,
I'm just giving my man-picker a rest.

324
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:33,630
Don't give it too much of a rest.
You have to use it or lose it.

325
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:38,301
- It's just that Eric was such a Jerk.
- A good-looking jerk.

326
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,805
I probably would have jumped
at the first guy who asked me out.

327
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,963
- Of course you would have.
- Night, mark.

328
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,033
She's resting her man-picker...

329
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,682
Tired of sleeping alone,
or just tired?

330
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,088
I'm the mattress king of brooklyn,

331
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:20,372
and I've got exclusive
VIP Passes for you

332
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:23,972
to club bed...
New york's hottest mattress destination.

333
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,731
Step behind the velvet rope,

334
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:29,185
pour yourself a glass of wine
and experience a...

335
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,507
Cut!

336
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,149
What's wrong?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:10,00
