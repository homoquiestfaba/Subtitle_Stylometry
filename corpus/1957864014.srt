2
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,887
- I can examine
more of his blood.

3
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,303
It's not going to tell
me anything I don't know.

4
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,270
- Maybe not.

5
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:07,550
We've come at this from
every way imaginable.

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,517
- I'm not sure what
else we can learn.

7
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:13,418
- Maybe we should put him
back in his environment.

8
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:17,801
- That would come with risks.

9
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,736
- He heals very rapidly.

10
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,533
He uses a hundred
percent of his strength.

11
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:29,744
Humans typically tap out at 65%.

12
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,678
He's a superhuman, the
only one of his kind,

13
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:35,336
we need to find out what
makes his DNA different

14
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,855
at any cost.

15
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,343
- We have the woman who
fought off a polar bear

16
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:44,104
to save her son.

17
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,210
And the woman who lifted a
car to save her daughter.

18
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,178
- Sounds like you like moms.

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,493
- We have their DNA, Dr. Trask.

20
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,668
- Those were isolated situations

21
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,878
caused by life
threatening circumstances.

22
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,708
We cannot reproduce them
in the lab, we have tried.

23
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:07,092
- We could place cameras
throughout the woods.

24
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,854
Maybe we'll learn something
from his environment.

25
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,580
Maybe it's his surroundings

26
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:15,549
that will secrete the uric
acid purines that we can study.

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,108
- This is Dr. Trask,

28
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,008
prepare to deploy
subject, Ax Grinder.

[dramatic music]

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,013
- Wow, you know, a
weekend in the woods,

31
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:35,016
I was skeptical at first, but
I think it's a great idea now.

32
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:37,191
- Oh, it's gonna
be a mega blast.

33
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:38,882
- Do you have something in mind?

34
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,229
- You'll find out.

35
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,575
- You're naughty, aren't you?

36
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:42,748
- You're naughty.

37
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,167
- Guilty is charged.

38
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,755

[dramatic music]

41
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,167
- I'm starting to think
you had an ulterior motive

42
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,720
for bringing me here.

43
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,998
- Oh, you're starting
to figure it out.

44
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:26,999
- Tell me.

45
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,588
- It's awkward, I don't
wanna talk about it.

46
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,901
But okay, you know how
we've been best friends

47
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:32,764
since we were little kids.

48
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:33,592
- Yeah.
- And we've

49
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,869
been through some.

50
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:38,079
Well, I wanna be more
than just best friends.

51
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:39,391
- What do you mean?

52
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,255
- You know what I mean.

53
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,431
- Maybe, but I'm not gonna
make it easy for you.

54
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:45,777
Catch me if you can.

55
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:48,642
[dramatic music]

56
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,872
- Come on, I've got
big plans for us.

57
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,874
- Okay, you caught my interest.

[van engines revving]

59
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:41,789
- Home sweet home, buddy.

60
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:48,831
- Tell you what you gonna
change yourself, all right.

61
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,280
- There's all your stuff.

62
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:54,561
- Let's get outta here, man.

[both laughing]

67
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:38,432
- Hold there.

68
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,538
- Oh God, you scared
the out of us.

69
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,435
- From the looks of it,

70
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,368
I scared the clothes
off you as well.

71
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,682
- Excuse me, can we
help you with something?

72
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:49,167
- Do you know about
these here woods?

73
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,731
- I know that people like
to come to these woods

74
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:53,343
to hook up in private.

75
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,864
- These woods belong to him.

76
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,556
- Oh, of course you would say

77
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,490
that the woods are
claimed by a man.

78
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:04,527
- Yeah, haven't you heard of
mother nature, she's not a man.

79
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,219
- Consider yourself warned.

80
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,015
- Warned about what?

81
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,361
- Apricot, he was leaving.

82
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:14,503
- Tell us, who are you
gonna warn us about?

83
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,748
- 15 years ago, Freddy Palmer

84
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,544
went on a killing spree
in these very woods.

85
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,961
And then it all went quiet
for a very long time.

86
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,412
Some say that he's part of

87
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,241
some sort of
scientific experiment,

88
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:33,418
but whatever the
reason, he's back now,

89
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,351
has been for a few years.

90
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:38,043
And he's more
dangerous than ever.

91
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,735
He has no heart.

92
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,426
He has no soul.

93
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,326
He just kills and
kills and he enjoys it.

94
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,158
- Okay, we get it, crazy
psycho killer with a knife.

95
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,816
[laughing]

96
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,438
- It's not a knife.

97
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,579
It's an ax.

98
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,099
And he'll grind
you with that ax.

99
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,793
And he might even eat you.

100
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,314
- Okay, we get the memo, bye.

101
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:09,936
- Nice to see you.

102
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,114
- What a creep.

103
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,667
- Yeah.

104
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,532
What if he was right
about Freddie Palmer?

105
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,603
- Definitely not.

106
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:23,192
I mean, we would've totally
heard about this on Twitter.

107
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,953
[dramatic music]

108
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,271
- Let's go set up.

109
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:38,241
[dramatic music]

110
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,553
- Run.

111
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,383
[dramatic music]

112
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,645
[Apricot screaming]

113
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,545
[dramatic music]

114
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,730
- Freddy just killed two people.

115
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:55,077
Are we really okay with this?

116
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,597
- We're looking at
an extension to life,

117
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,221
the cure for every known
major disease, cancer.

118
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:02,912
It's a trade off.

119
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,397
Are you not on board
with this, Dr. Sanders?

120
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,020
Because you were the
one who suggested

121
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,677
we returned him to
his environment.

122
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,540
What did you think
was going to happen?

123
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:11,887
- I don't know.

124
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:14,752
I guess I just didn't
really think it through.

125
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:17,927
- Are you having second
thoughts, Dr. Sanders?

126
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,378
- No.

127
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,517
- Are you sure?

128
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,761
Should I be concerned?

129
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:27,592
- No, not at all, Dr. Trask.

130
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:30,422
- Good.

131
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:33,287
[dramatic music]

132
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,228
- Judge Bias, I
need to talk to you.

133
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,885
- You don't have an appointment.

134
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,266
- You ruled against me.

135
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,233
- It was just
yesterday, I remember.

136
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,890
- Come on, we're neighbors.

137
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:51,720
- You opened a band
rehearsal center

138
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:53,618
next to a mental
health facility.

139
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,413
You were bound to
run into some issues.

140
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,935
- You ruled that my bands
can't play past 8:00 p.m.

141
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:03,076
Most musicians don't even
wake up until sundown.

142
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,215
That's not even fair.

143
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:06,918
- What do you hope to achieve

144
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,909
by coming to my office
without even appointment?

145
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,498
- Oh, if I make an
appointment, will that help?

146
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,086
- No.

147
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,089
- You know, no
evidence was provided

148
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:19,264
that our music has any
effects on the nuts next door.

149
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,715
- Really, the nuts?

150
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,200
- Oh, the mental
patients, whatever.

151
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:26,237
- Judge Bias, I thought
we had an appointment.

152
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:27,065
- We do.

153
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,757
Destiny here was just leaving.

154
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,861
- Destiny.

155
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,346
- Destiny's my name

156
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,728
and managing band is my game.

157
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,419
- Melinda Day, nice to meet you.

158
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,734
- I'm not giving up on this.

159
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,218
- Oh, I know you won't.

160
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,016
- Are you sure that it's
okay to meet now Judge Bias?

161
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,121
- Yes, it's fine.

162
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,995
And you know when no one's
around, call me Sandy.

163
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,712
I mean, we're friends, I've
told you this a million times.

164
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,265
- I'm here on an
official request.

165
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,611
So I was going more formal.

166
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,095
- All right, what
is it, Melinda?

167
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,580
- Well, Sandy, you know the
program I've been working on?

168
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,721
- The one that puts
criminals in the woods.

169
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,077
- You know, no one
gets rehabilitated

170
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,758
sitting in a jail cell, right?

171
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,104
I'm looking at working on them,

172
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,450
fixing them with proven methods

173
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:08,762
out in a camping environment,

174
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,764
where they can become
one with nature.

175
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,731
- I love your passion, Mel,

176
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,767
but have you really
thought about this?

177
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,425
- I'll only use
non-violent criminals.

178
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,702
We've talked about this.

179
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,704
I thought I had your support.

180
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,499
I'm ready to do
this first trial.

181
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,914
- I know what I said, but.

182
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,020
- "The eyes of the Lord
searched the whole earth

183
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,435
in order to fully
strengthen those

184
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,333
"whose hearts are
committed to him."

185
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:30,335
- Are you using the Bible on me?

186
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,269
- Chronicles 16:9.

187
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,513
- All right, okay, we'll do it.

188
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,377
But I'm really going
out on a limb here.

189
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,620
So I get to pick the subjects.

190
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,346
- You can't force
them to volunteer?

191
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,186
- No, but I can reduce
their sentence by a year

192
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,350
and they will jump
at the chance.

193
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,732
- I can't thank
you enough, Sandy.

194
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,872
- What does your sister
think about all this?

195
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,608
- You're not going out
into the woods's for a week

196
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:54,152
with a bunch of
deranged criminals.

197
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,430
- First of all, they're
non-violent criminals,

198
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:57,846
they're not deranged.

199
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,814
- I'm not letting
you do this, Melinda.

200
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,885
- You can't stop me, Belinda.

201
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,784
It's a great program.

202
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,544
- You won't be safe.

203
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,891
- "Submit yourselves
therefore to God,

204
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,618
"resist the devil and
he'll flee from you."

205
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:14,000
- Don't quote scripture to me.

206
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,726
- There'll be a correction
officer with me at all times.

207
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,245
She's very strong.

208
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,315
- A woman?

209
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,490
- All four subjects
will be woman.

210
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,216
I won't be in any danger.

211
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,495
- Right, because woman
can't possibly be dangerous.

212
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,910
You hear me, Lizzy Borden?

213
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:31,362
- Lizzy Borden was never
convicted of any crime.

214
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,398
- I don't get you, Melinda.

215
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,331
You say you believe
in family support

216
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,333
and then you take
advice from some psychic

217
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:38,990
over your own sister.

218
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,234
- That's not true,
Claire just offers

219
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,614
a different take on things.

220
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,858
- She belongs in a circus.

221
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:46,239
She's a fake.

222
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,517
- I think she's touched by God.

223
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,874
- I'm coming with
you on this trip,

224
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:52,003
even if I have to take off work.

225
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,591
- That's not an option.

226
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,523
I'll be fine.

227
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:56,697
I'm a hundred percent positive.

228
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,045
Do you think I'll be safe
on this trip, Claire?

229
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:05,051
- I see a stranger, a
dark stranger, a man.

230
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,605
- I don't understand, a man?

231
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,607
I'm only going on
this trip with women.

232
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,474
- The spirits need more
rewards for more clarification.

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,587
All right, I'm seeing more now.

234
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,350
There's a strong woman fighting,

235
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,387
she's fighting for her life.

236
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,323
By a river, by a stream,

237
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:40,258
is there a body
of water involved?

238
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,089
- Lakes, my corrections
officer's name is Lakes.

239
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,195
- Lakes is fighting
for her life.

240
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,199
- Is she fighting one
of the test subjects.

241
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,272
[dramatic music]

242
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,722
- Lakes is fighting a man

243
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:58,621
a man with a mask on.

244
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,111
[dramatic music]

245
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,186
That is all I can see for today.

246
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,567
- Are you sure she
was fighting someone?

247
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,362
Maybe you picked
up something else.

248
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,746
[dramatic music]

249
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,336
- Can't you postpone this trip?

250
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,854
- It's my life's mission.

251
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,857
Everything I've done in my
career has led me to this.

252
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,376
- You better bring protection.

253
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:32,378
- Protection.

254
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,832
- Or someone else,

255
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,490
someone else other than
someone named Lakes.

256
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,424
Who names their kid?
After a body of water?

257
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,944
- I'm not bringing a
weapon, that's not who I am.

258
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:48,395
- Well, then you
better have a way out.

259
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,088
- We're dropped off for a week,

260
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,744
no contact with outside world.

261
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,989
- Don't you think
that sounds dangerous?

262
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,406
- No, I think it's
bold, innovative.

263
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:01,719
I certainly wouldn't
call it dangerous.

264
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,031
[dramatic music]

265
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:06,758
[sings in foreign language]

266
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:18,322
[Cassie screaming]

267
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,357
- Oh, I'm so sorry,

268
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,394
I didn't mean to actually
press the button.

269
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,017
I hope I never have
to press the button.

270
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,260
I'm sure I won't.

271
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:28,573
So this is a remote device
that can send a shock

272
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,093
through the ankle monitors
you're all wearing.

273
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:33,544
There's a smart chip
located in the strap,

274
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,615
so please don't tamper with it.

275
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,066
And this is Lakes.

276
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,000
She'll be joining us this week
as your corrections officer.

277
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:44,900
And she'll explain more about
the rules and the monitors.

278
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,868
- I don't anticipate any
trouble from any of you.

279
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:48,869
But I'm more than qualified

280
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,630
to deal with trouble
if it appears.

281
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,394
In addition to Melinda
holding the switch

282
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,500
that will trigger
your ankle bracelets,

283
00:16:58,534 --> 00:16:59,684
it will also make a loud sound

284
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,399
if you go outside the
radius of five blocks

285
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,883
of this location.

286
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:04,023
- Five blocks?

287
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,025
How are we supposed to
know how far five blocks is

288
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,923
in these disgusting woods?

289
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,614
- The alarm will
make a slight sound.

290
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,858
Then a loud sound, if
you pass five blocks.

291
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:12,892
So you'll know.

292
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,390
And if you don't make it
back into the safety radius,

293
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:18,589
within 30 seconds,
you'll receive a shock

294
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,315
10 times as strong as
the one Cassie felt

295
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,937
in our demonstration.

296
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:25,078
Should be enough to render
any of you unconscious.

297
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:26,424
Any questions?

298
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,185
- I got a question.

299
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,600
Did your parents really name you

300
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,085
after a body of water, Lakes?

301
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:36,226
Oh.

302
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:41,232
- I forgot to mention, I
also carry a shock button.

303
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,372
- Oh, it's messed up.

304
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,478
- What if we have to take
these off for some reason?

305
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:46,720
- If you try to take them off,

306
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,584
you will receive
the maximum shock.

307
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,484
- We're out in the woods,
what if something happens?

308
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,002
- You can hear the traffic.

309
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,935
We're not that
far from the road.

310
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,144
Melinda has a cell phone

311
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,560
and I can get to the road
in the case of an emergency.

312
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,389
It's hard to get
reception out here.

313
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,910
But we don't anticipate
any emergencies,

314
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,774
so long as everyone cooperates.

315
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,434
- So I think you'll
all get the setup.

316
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,195
So as long as you don't run away

317
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,853
and everyone participates
in the exercises,

318
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,855
everything will be fine.

319
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,753
- And we'll get a
year off our sentence.

320
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:20,961
- Yes.

321
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:24,241
But what I really wanna do
is to help you, all of you.

322
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,381
- A year off our
sentence is a good start.

323
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:30,039
- Let's get situated with
our sleeping situation

324
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,214
and then we can start
a first exercise.

325
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,249
Follow me.

326
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,943
[dramatic music]

327
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:49,222
"Here I am, I stand
at the door and knock.

328
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,708
"If someone hears my voice
and answers the door,

329
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:55,366
"then I'll come in and
eat with that person

330
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,988
"and they with me."

Revelations 3:20.

332
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:02,994
- It's scripture,

333
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:04,203
she's quoting scripture.

334
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:09,484
- She's quoting scriptures to
a bunch of sinners, awesome.

335
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,417
- Speak for yourself,
I was framed.

336
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:14,213
- Two of you will stay
in the cabin with me.

337
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,008
And two of you will stay
in the tent outside.

338
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,838
- I claim the cabin.

339
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,253
- It's a reward system.

340
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:23,946
So the two of you who do the
best at the exercises each day,

341
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,707
get to stay in the
cabin at night.

342
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:28,917
We'll begin our
exercises inside.

343
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:29,745
[all screaming]

344
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,643
- Who are you?

345
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,575
- Who are you?

346
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,577
- Unhand me you ruffian.

347
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,269
- Ruffian, dude's a
good judge of character.

348
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,891
- Nobody's been staying here.

349
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,377
- It's owned by the state.

350
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,862
We're gonna use it now
and I have a permit.

351
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,726
- All right, fine.

352
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,593
If you have a permit, I'll be
on my way, but you should too.

353
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,627
- Why?

354
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,769
- It's not safe in these woods?

355
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,185
Freddy Palmer is back.

356
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,118
He'll kill you all
if you stay here.

357
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,466
- Who's Freddy Palmer?

358
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:05,988
- 15 years ago, Freddy Palmer
killed a bunch of folks

359
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,127
in this here woods.

360
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:11,339
It all started with a young
woman jogging through the woods.

361
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:14,134
[dramatic music]

362
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:24,455
[victim screaming]

363
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,944
- Fuck you, asshole.

364
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,430
[laughing]

365
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:36,605
[victim screaming]

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,470
[dramatic music]

367
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:08,879
Thank you, you saved my life.

368
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,551
[birds chirping]

369
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:31,073
[dramatic music]

370
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,869
[victim moaning]

371
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,465
- What the fuck?

372
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,747
- Who the fuck are you?

373
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:53,510
Ah, fuck.

374
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,444
[victim screaming]

375
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,240
[dramatic music]

376
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:06,074
[victim moaning]

377
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,561
[dramatic music]

378
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:21,054
[birds chirping]

379
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,919
[dramatic music]

380
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:06,686
- And then he killed them all.

381
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:10,449
- No, no, no, this can't be
the place, it can't be here.

382
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,071
- It's the place
where Freddy killed?

383
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:14,453
- No, no it wasn't Freddy,
it was one of the campers,

384
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,456
some Blanche, my cousin
was one of the victims.

385
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,871
She drowned my cousin.

386
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:21,080
I can't stay here.

387
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:22,495
- Do you really wanna go, Jenna?

388
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,083
- Yes, I'm freaking out.

389
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:26,119
- Take a breath, a deep breath.

390
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,051
Another one.

391
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,159
If you need to
go, we all must go

392
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:33,437
and no one's gonna get any
credit from this program

393
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,094
or a reduced sentence.

394
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:36,243
But if that's what
you really want.

395
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,924
- It's not what
she really wants.

396
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:39,891
- Jenna?

397
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,447
- I think I'll be okay.

398
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,346
- You won't be okay,
you'll be dead.

399
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,589
You'll all be dead.

400
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,384
- You're not helping Mr.

401
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:50,523
- Joe.

402
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,767
- Joe, do you think it can
give us a little space?

403
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,665
We could really use our privacy.

404
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,425
- If you don't leave
right now, Joe,

405
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,427
I'll kick your up
and down these woods.

406
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,708
- Lakes, I think you could
handle this more appropriately.

407
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:04,399
- Fine, I will go,

408
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:08,334
but not because I'm
afraid of this here goon.

409
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,508
But remember, you'll all be.

410
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,165
- All be killed, we got it.

411
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
- All right.

412
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,998
- Let's go inside.

413
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,864
We could really get to know
each other a little bit better.

414
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:41,194
I want us to all share a
little bit about ourselves.

415
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,644
Why are we here?

416
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,094
Who are we?

417
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:45,198
I'll start.

418
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:48,581
I'm Melinda, we can go
by just first names here.

419
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,687
I'm a social
worker, as you know,

420
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,793
and I look for the
best and everyone.

421
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:58,764
I'm very religious and I believe
I'm here to do God's work.

422
00:25:58,798 --> 00:25:59,798
So who's next?

423
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,529
- Remember the two who
participate the most,

424
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,979
get to spend the
night in the cabin.

425
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,740
- I go by Topper, I'm
the top of my gang,

426
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,501
well I was until I got busted.

427
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:13,917
- What you get busted for?

428
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:16,229
- It's none of your
fucking business.

429
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:19,612
- We don't curse here or make
others feel uneasy, Topper.

430
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,648
- Drugs.

431
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:21,682
What did you think?

432
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:23,720
- I'll go next.

433
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:25,342
I don't wanna sleep in a tent.

434
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,930
My name is Marilyn,

435
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:30,623
I was falsely accused of
blackmail, so I'm here.

436
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,074
- Is that all you
wanna share, Marilyn?

437
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,108
- Probably.

438
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:36,698
What about you, Jenna?

439
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,251
Do you feel up to sharing yet?

440
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,253
- Yeah.

441
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:43,843
Jenna here, bank robbery.

442
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,811
Well, I was just
a lookout, no gun.

443
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:47,778
So I qualified for the program.

444
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:51,402
- You wanna tell us
about your cousin?

445
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:54,682
- She was like an
older sister to me.

446
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:56,476
She looked out for me.

447
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,963
And if she was murdered
in these woods,

448
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,587
I don't know where, I mean,

449
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,658
it wasn't something
I wanted to ask.

450
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:10,421
But if that crazy guy is
right and it did happen here,

451
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,669
I don't know, I mean, do I
stay if it happened here?

452
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,913
- It happened 15
years ago, right?

453
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:20,673
- Yeah, I was just a kid.

454
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,571
She made an impression.

455
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,263
- Do you stab
lingering feelings?

456
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:26,196
- I don't know.

457
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,301
I miss her sometimes,

458
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,166
after all these
years, is that weird?

459
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,789
- No, not at all, Jenna.

460
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:34,860
Is there anything else?

461
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,033
- I don't think so.

462
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:44,524
- I'm the whore, did
you'll figure that out?

463
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,837
- No need to be ashamed
of sex work, Cassie.

464
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:49,322
- Well, I shouldn't be
in jail for it either.

465
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:50,427
- I fully agree.

466
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,394
And that's why by
staying here a week,

467
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,534
you'll serve no prison time.

468
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:56,226
- I guess, as long
as I don't get killed

469
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,056
by a crazy guy with an ax,
it will all be roses, right.

470
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:01,921
[dramatic music]

471
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:20,940
- Joe, you need to
be more careful.

472
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:41,616
- We're gonna split up into
two groups and do some hiking.

473
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,722
In this exercise, I
want you all to talk

474
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,596
about what you would do
differently in your life,

475
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,762
if you could change one
thing, just one thing, a redo.

476
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,696
Marilyn and Topper,
you'll go with Lakes

477
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,181
and I'll get notes from
her on what you talk about.

478
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,838
The others come with me.

479
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:57,736
- Pretty easy to see

480
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,565
who'll be sleeping
in the cabin tonight.

481
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,603
[dramatic music]

482
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,371
- Anyone need to rest?

483
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,199
- We can keep walking.

484
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:14,234
- I'm good.

485
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:18,204
- I think we should at
least keep hydrated.

486
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,387
Isn't it beautiful out here?

487
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,493
- It's okay.

488
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:32,736
- I think it's a perfect place

489
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,462
to run through
our next exercise.

490
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,056
- If I could change anything,

491
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,992
I would've talked my cousin
out of her camping trip.

492
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:49,477
You know, the one
that got her killed.

493
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,411
- That's an understandable
thought, Jenna,

494
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,516
but not very realistic.

495
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:55,794
You couldn't have known

496
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,244
that something was gonna happen
to her on that camping trip.

497
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,006
And you would still
end up a bank robber.

498
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,699
- The lookout, I
was the lookout.

499
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,702
- Come on, there must be
something you could have changed.

500
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:10,015
Maybe a relationship
you could have avoided.

501
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,191
- Kevin Tracks.

502
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,400
I should have stayed
clear from Tracks.

503
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:20,163
I knew the second I met
him, but never again.

504
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:22,510
- He led you down a
path of bad decisions.

505
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:23,544
- Yeah.

506
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,376
Yes, that's a hard yes.

507
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:29,241
- So if you were to meet someone

508
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,415
who might be a bad
influence on you again.

509
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,833
- I treat 'em like
country music.

510
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,075
- And this Tracks fellow,

511
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,457
have you managed to get him
completely out of your life?

512
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,321
- Yeah.

513
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,460
- Completely out?

514
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,775
And there's no right
or wrong answer.

515
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,364
Either way, you get the
year off your sentence.

516
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,021
So just be honest with yourself.

517
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:57,131
- Well, I would say he's not
completely outta my life yet.

518
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,514
- You're supposed to be sharing.

519
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:02,930
Don't all talk at once.

520
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,897
- How much longer
do we need to hike?

521
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,830
I'm getting sweaty, I hate that.

522
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:09,591
[Marilyn crying]

523
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:10,869
- What the hell, Topper?

524
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,216
Are you okay?

525
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,011
- My ankle, I hurt my ankle,

526
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,564
I don't think I
can walk anymore.

527
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:17,392
- Your ankle?

528
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,566
You landed on your ass.

529
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,223
- Well they both hurt.

me to kiss your ass?

532
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,227
- And my ankle.

533
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,369
- What were you
thinking, Topper?

534
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,473
Oh, hell no.

535
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,341
I need to go look for her.

Can you walk on your ankle?

537

go look, I can wait here.

here in the shade

559
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:55,067

What thing in your life would
you change, if you could?

567
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,952
- I would trust people less.

568
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,023
- That's good.

569
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,404
Go on.

570
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:25,270
- Well, I trusted that
cop who busted me.

571
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:30,930
I even asked him if he
was a cop and he said, no.

572
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,173
They have all these shootings

573
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,867
and politicians sleep with
whoever they want to me.

574
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:39,594
I get arrested just one trick.

575
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,526
It's not fair.

576
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:45,221

trust your clients too much,

how they represent themselves

578
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,569
and you would change that?

579
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:52,193
- Well, I didn't exactly
have the greatest childhood.

580
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,714
Took me a long time to
learn to trust people.

581

Never again.

- Where'd you grow up?

583
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,203
- I was born in Germany.

584
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:05,620
I had a military family, moved
around a lot, blah, blah.

585

- Where's Topper?

586
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:09,383
- I lost her.

587
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,005
- And you couldn't
hear her monitor.

588
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,086
- I think she must
have found a way

589
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,112
to remove it or
silence it or both.

590
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:21,671

I know there's reception there

596
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,223
and we can call in
Topper's escape.

597
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:58,915
We can spend the night here,

598
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,573
but the judge might make
us come back tomorrow.

599
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:04,679
- Does that mean we spend 24
hours in these disgusting woods

600
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:07,372
and still don't get
a reduced sentence?

601
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,374
- I don't know exactly
what that means.

602
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:12,170
I didn't expect for someone
to escape on the first day.

603
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,901
- Cassie and Jenna will
spend the night in the cabin.

604
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:23,733
Marilyn and I will spend
the night in the tent.

if we share the bed?

me, I'm not touching you.

mean to joke about.

robber with no sense of humor.

past our window.

with her name, Lakes?

to go check it out?

back and he's killing.

someone to pick us up.

out of here, do you?

right here in these woods.

it's the best idea

don't even know where to go.

Locked you up, beat you.

788
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:09,541

I've never met you.

he knew where you lived.

797

him more successfully now.

DNA will be active.

started, no witnesses.

something happened to her

before we could make the call.

definitely killed her.

get away, he'll kill us.

will hold or I mean,

he won't get
through the windows?

you two hide behind a tent.

Hit him with a rock or a stick

00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:59,088
[bracelet alarm blaring]

889
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:03,265
[dramatic music]

890
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,704
No, no, no, please
no, please no.

891
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,259
[Jenna gasping]

892
00:55:33,088 --> 00:55:35,918
[dramatic music]

893
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:43,719
- [Dr. Trask] Only one left,
then no more witnesses.

894
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:46,204
- When do you
wanna retrieve him?

895
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,275
- We can do that any time.

896
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,554
I'm sure he'll be done
by the time we arrive.

897
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:58,044
- I see that the final living
subject is Cassie Johnson.

898
00:55:58,078 --> 00:55:59,148
She was a prostitute.

899
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,703
She might be very resourceful.

900
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,877
Perhaps we should wait until
he's finished with her.

901
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:08,675
- Do you have a fondness
for whores, Dr. Sanders?

902
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,814
- Why do you ask that?

903
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:11,102
Now I didn't say
I wanna meet her,

904
00:56:11,126 --> 00:56:13,162
I said we should wait
until she's dead.

905
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,268
- Is that how you
like your whores?

906
00:56:15,302 --> 00:56:17,063
You like them when they're dead.

907
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:18,927
That's how you like
to play with them.

908
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:23,725
- That is completely
inappropriate, Dr. Trask.

909
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:26,866
- Do strong women
threaten you Dr. Sanders?

910
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,213
Is that why you prefer
them to be dead?

911
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:33,493
- I don't like this
line of inquiry at all.

912
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:36,393
- You need to relax Dr. Sanders.

913
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,291
We've known each
other for a long time.

914
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:39,603
You need to have some fun.

915
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:40,880
We can go get 'em right now,

916
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,582
I'll make sure the whore
doesn't bother you.

917
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:43,952
I'll see to it personally.

918
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:50,924
Jones prepare the van
and Smith come in now,

919
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:52,961
I know you're right
outside the door.

920
00:56:58,725 --> 00:57:01,694
Smith, I'll be accompanying
you to the woods, all right.

921
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:02,798
- Yes, Dr. Trask.

922
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,111
- You know, I like that
you chose the name Smith.

923
00:57:05,145 --> 00:57:07,182
It's not your real
name, I know that.

924
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:09,296
It shows me though that
you're a man of simple means.

925
00:57:09,322 --> 00:57:10,322
Am I right?

926
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:14,431
- Dr. Trask, this is
making me uncomfortable.

927
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:17,468
- She does that to everybody.

928
00:57:17,503 --> 00:57:19,505
- Do you like my legs, Smith?

929
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,578
- I don't know,
I guess so, yeah.

930
00:57:23,612 --> 00:57:26,822
- Is that why you position
yourself right outside the door?

931
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,479
- Oh, no, no, no Doctor.

932
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:30,930
- Then are you a spy,
listening to our experiments,

933
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:32,103
reporting back to someone?

934
00:57:32,138 --> 00:57:33,139
- No Dr. Trask.

935
00:57:33,173 --> 00:57:34,737
- Then why do you wait
right outside the door?

936
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:35,842
Because Jones doesn't do it.

937
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:37,523
It has to be about
my legs, come on.

938
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,386
- Oh, okay, I like your legs.

939
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:44,426
I mean, I like you, you're
attractive Dr. Trask, I'm sorry.

940
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:46,773
- You are very, very sorry.

941
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:48,119
Now go get the van ready.

942
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:50,328
- Yes, Dr. Trask.

943
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:52,710
- For Freddy.

944
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:55,575
[dramatic music]

945
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,457
- I don't usually take
clients this early.

946
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,769
- Do you know who I am?

947
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:17,666
- I wouldn't be
much of a psychic

948
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,703
if I didn't know who you are.

949
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:22,913
I know your face,
Melinda, Belinda.

950
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:26,019
- I'm not like my
sister, you can't con me.

951
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:27,676
- So then why are you here?

952
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,265
- If you're psychic,
you know why I'm here.

953
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:33,061
- Is it to gimme your
cousin Tiffany's number?

954
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:35,546
She's a real hoochie coochie.

955
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,237
- Oh, what a waste of time.

956
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:38,272
- Sit.

957
00:58:43,727 --> 00:58:46,246
I know you're worried
about your sister.

958
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:48,248
Believe it or not,
she's my friend too.

959
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:50,216
- She had a lot of faith in you.

960
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,081
- And you don't have faith
in much of anything, do you?

961
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:56,567
Except your sister.

962
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,121
- So what do I do?

963
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:02,262
- You need to go find her fast.

964
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:05,024
- Okay, I will.

965
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:07,751
- You haven't heard from her?

966
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:09,546
- No, her signal's
getting weaker.

967
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:13,239
- Do I owe you something?

968
00:59:13,273 --> 00:59:15,759
- I'll settle for your cousin
Tiffany's phone number.

969
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,001
- Why?

970
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:21,247
- Well, she's cute and the
true reason I cannot say.

971
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:24,422
- Okay, I'll text
you her number.

972
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:27,287
[dramatic music]

973
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:33,570
I'm worried about Melinda.

974
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,262
She said she'd call at 9:00
a.m. every morning to check in.

975
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:37,228
- Have you tried calling her?

976
00:59:37,263 --> 00:59:39,610
- Yes, no response.

977
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:40,818
- I tried calling her too,

978
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:43,165
but maybe she doesn't have
a reception where she's at.

979
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,304
- I have a bad feeling.

980
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,515
- Have you been speaking to
your sister's so-called psychic?

981
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,448
- I don't believe
in that crap either.

982
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:53,451
Something's telling
me something is wrong.

983
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:55,453
- So you haven't gone
to see her psychic.

984
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:56,282
- I did.

985
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:57,317
Come on, just tell me

986
00:59:57,352 --> 00:59:59,054
where the rah, rah, get
outta jail free group is

987
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:01,252
and I'll go check
them out myself.

988
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:03,289
- Okay, well that
wouldn't be appropriate.

989
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,325
And they don't get
outta jail free,

990
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,845
okay, one year off
their sentence.

991
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,366
- Melinda can make us believe
in anything, can't she?

992
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,713
- She gives you hope when
there just isn't any.

993
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,647
- Come on, doesn't
your gut tell you

994
01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:18,338
that something went wrong?

995
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,996
Her and one other officer
against four criminals.

996
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:22,584
- Nonviolent criminals.

997
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:26,243
- I'm not leaving
until you do something.

998
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:29,039
- You're just as
stubborn as she is.

999
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:31,973
Fine, I'll call the park ranger

1000
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:34,458
to go check things out.

1001
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,220
[dramatic music]

1002
01:00:59,483 --> 01:01:01,288
- Park Ranger Amanda
Briggs, identify yourself.

1003
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:02,417
- I'm so glad to see you.

1004
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,832
I need to help everyone is dead.

1005
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:04,695
- Who's dead?

1006
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,592
Identify yourself.

1007
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:07,053
- I couldn't stop
him, he's a psycho.

1008
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,537
- You need to relax
and identify yourself.

1009
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:09,527
- How do you want me to relax,

1010
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:10,988
if you're pointing a
taser at me and a killer

1011
01:01:11,012 --> 01:01:12,092
could come out in
literally any minute.

1012
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:13,255
- Sit on the ground now

1013
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,153
and put your hands
behind your back.

1014
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:15,568
- Why won't you listen to me.

1015
01:01:15,602 --> 01:01:16,602
- Now.

1016
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:23,990
Now, what's your name?

1017
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,612
- Cassie Johnson.

1018
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:27,166
I'm part of that test group.

1019
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,271
- The one with the prisoners,
camping for the week.

1020
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:30,445
- Yes.

1021
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:32,240
Melinda was our leader

1022
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:36,451
and one of us got away or
who knows, maybe got killed.

1023
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:39,281
And then Melinda went
to call for help.

1024
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:41,318
She couldn't give
reception at the camp.

1025
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,528
- Did you hear from
Melinda after she left?

1026
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:47,186
- No, some crazy guys
showed up in a mask

1027
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,878
and he killed Lakes and
then he killed Marilyn

1028
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:52,501
and probably killed Jenna too.

1029
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:54,262
- Was that the rest
of the prisoners?

1030
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:55,677
- Everyone got killed.

1031
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,197
And we need to get outta
here before he finds us.

1032
01:01:58,231 --> 01:01:59,716
- Is that blood on your shoe?

1033
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,857
- I hit him with an ax.

1034
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:03,823
- Did you kill him?

1035
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:04,790
- No.

1036
01:02:04,824 --> 01:02:06,757
He got up and killed
Marilyn right after,

1037
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:08,276
and then he followed
us to the camp

1038
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,211
and my guess is, killed
Jenna there as well.

1039
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:13,522
- I'll call for backup.

1040
01:02:13,557 --> 01:02:16,629
[cellphone ringing]

1041
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,874
Hi Judge Bias, I'm
near the campsite now.

1042
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:21,151
- Did she find Melinda?

1043
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,084
- No, just someone
named Cassie Johnson.

1044
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:24,233
- She's one of the subjects.

1045
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:25,569
Does she know where Melinda is?

1046
01:02:25,603 --> 01:02:27,858
- She says that when one of
the prisoners tried to escape,

1047
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:29,066
that Melinda went
to call for help.

1048
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,723
They don't get cell
reception near of the camp.

1049
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,000
And Judge, the prisoner
says that someone

1050
01:02:32,024 --> 01:02:33,404
has tried to kill everyone else.

1051
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:35,027
- Jesus.

1052
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:36,338
Well go check it out.

1053
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:37,730
- I was just about
to call for backup.

1054
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,169
- I'll call for your backup.

1055
01:02:39,203 --> 01:02:41,447
Go investigate the
camp, don't wait.

1056
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:42,801
- But Judge, that's
not procedure.

1057
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:45,865
- If Melinda is in danger,
she needs to be found, go now.

1058
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,728
- But Ma'am.

1059
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,557
- You owe me a
favor, do you not?

1060
01:02:48,592 --> 01:02:50,318
- If Melinda's in
there, I'll find her.

1061
01:02:54,943 --> 01:02:56,255
- What are you doing?

1062
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:57,774
- Show me the bodies.

1063
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,327
- But we can't go back there.

1064
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:01,916
- I could always tase you in
the leg and go look myself.

[dramatic music]

1066
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,905
- Can you uncuff me at least?

1067
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,010
- Just keep walking.

1068
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:29,460
- No, I can't walk with
my hands behind my back.

[birds chirping]

1070
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,401

1071
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:40,230
- No, come on.

1072
01:03:40,264 --> 01:03:41,264
- Do it.

1073
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:46,167
- Are you into
bondage, Ranger Ricks?

1074
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,076
I'll let you do anything,
if you let my hands go free.

1075
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,101
- Just keep walking.

1076
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,248
- Ah, seriously, I can't
walk with these handcuffs on.

1077
01:03:58,282 --> 01:03:59,732
Like, have you ever tried it?

1078
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:00,733
- Get up.

1079
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,079
- No, I'm staying down here

1080
01:04:02,114 --> 01:04:03,874
unless you wanna
explain why you tased

1081
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,393
an unarmed handcuffed hooker.

1082
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:11,917

I have a weapon.

1083
01:04:13,056 --> 01:04:14,402
No shenanigans.

1084
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,059

many 1960s comic books.

1089
01:04:57,445 --> 01:05:00,275

here, no sign of a death.

01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,943
- Well, I didn't see what
happened to Lakes here.

1091
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:04,348
Marilyn just told us
that she saw her killed.

1092
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:06,903
- What did you actually
witness yourself?

1093
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,249
- I saw him kill Marilyn,

1094
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,492
it was right here
where we're standing.

1095
01:05:10,527 --> 01:05:12,046
- How was she killed?

1096
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,185
- It was an ax.

1097
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:14,669
- The same one you used on him?

1098
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,361
- Yes, I guess I
must have set it down

1099
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,708
after we thought he was dead.

1100
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:22,998
- Does look like a body might
have been dragged from here.

1101

- Yeah, he dragged
the bodies away and,

1102
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:29,511
God he doesn't pleasure
himself with the bodies,

1103
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:31,030
that's disgusting.

1104
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:32,238
- Some killers are cannibals.

1105
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:34,413
- Oh, oh that's worse.

1106
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:37,519

was another killing.

Where did that happen?

1108
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:43,767

Do I look like someone
who would hurt anyone?

- What's down the hall?

1120
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:45,001
- The bedroom.

1121
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,312
- Show me.

1122
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:48,314
- Go look at it
yourself, Ranger Rick.

think I did this,

- Now.

I found the body of Melinda
Day, she's been murdered.

Have a seat.

01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:47,546
- It's bad news, isn't it?

- I'm afraid so.

- Just say it, Melinda's
dead, isn't she?

1142
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:52,896
- She was murdered.

01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:56,658
- Why'd you ever let them
try that fucking experiment?

1144

- I'm so sorry.

1145

- You know it's painful.

1146
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,872
I should never let her try it.

fault, Belinda.

1148

Look, it was her program, okay.

1149
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,673
It was her passion,
she wanted to do this.

You know her, you know
what she was about.

- I don't really know right now.

It looks like one
of the subjects.

- You mean one of the prisoners?

1155

- One of the prisoners escaped,

go find reception.

the other prisoners.

- Apparently so.

- So what happens
to the prisoner now?

1162
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:40,219
- I'm not quite sure.

1163
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:43,740
She was a non-violent
prisoner and she just snapped.

1164

- So insanity, plea?

1165
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:47,675
- Possibly.

1166
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:49,066
But I just think there's
more to this story

to put out an elephant.

I'm judge Sandy Bias.

- And I'm the queen of England.

1184
01:09:47,148 --> 01:09:49,230
- I'm hoping that you'll tell
me what happened at the camp.

1185
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:52,257
- I already told everyone,
who wouldn't listen.

1186
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,845
Freddie Palmer the psycho,
killed everyone, except for me.

1187
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,365
The only one who got away.

1188
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,541
- They found Melinda's body,
and she was a friend of mine.

1189
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:03,613
- Yeah, I don't know what he
did with the other bodies.

1190
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:06,581
- Your defense attorney
is a public defender

1191
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:09,722
whose case rests on
convincing a jury

1192
01:10:09,757 --> 01:10:10,999
that Lakes was in on it,

1193
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:14,071
that she freed the prisoners
and one of them killed Melinda.

1194
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:16,878
But that's just speculation.

1195
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,569
- Yeah, I'm not going
to lie about that story.

1196
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:19,905
I already told the PD that.

1197
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:21,389
It was Freddy Palmer.

1198
01:10:21,424 --> 01:10:23,529
- Freddy Palmer is a myth.

1199
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:25,048
It's like Bigfoot.

1200
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:27,050
You're gonna argue that
Bigfoot killed everyone?

1201
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:30,847
- Well, if Bigfoot did
it, then yes, I would.

1202
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:32,780
In fact, I actually
thought I saw Bigfoot

1203
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:34,782
at one point near the cabin.

1204
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:35,897
- Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

1205
01:10:35,921 --> 01:10:37,440
- Well, it wasn't Bigfoot okay.

1206
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:38,762
It was Freddy Palmer
who did the killing.

1207
01:10:38,786 --> 01:10:41,409
Just forget about Bigfoot, God.

1208
01:10:41,444 --> 01:10:43,239
- The murder weapon was found.

1209
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:46,069
The ax that killed Melinda
has your DNA on it.

1210
01:10:46,103 --> 01:10:48,865
- Yeah, I used the
ax to kill Freddy.

1211
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:50,246
- Then where's Freddy's body?

1212
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,730
- He didn't die, okay.

1213
01:10:51,764 --> 01:10:53,249
We just thought I killed him.

1214
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:54,560
- So you imagined it?

1215
01:10:55,389 --> 01:10:57,253
- I know what you're
trying to do, all right.

1216
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,392
And it won't work.

1217
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:00,497
- I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

1218
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:01,671
I have a hard time believing

1219
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:04,087
that you killed
everyone by yourself

1220
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:07,263
and hid all the bodies so
well that they can't be found.

1221
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:10,714
- Right, and no jury
will believe that.

1222
01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:12,854
- I don't believe
you killed Melinda.

1223
01:11:12,889 --> 01:11:14,649
Her blood was found on you.

1224
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:16,996
- Yeah, she fell on me.

1225
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:18,757
Ranger Rick saw that.

1226
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,069
- Your DNA is on
the murder weapon.

1227
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:23,865
Melinda's blood is on
you and you had a motive.

1228
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:26,212
So why don't you
let me help you.

1229
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:28,214
- I am done talking
to you, okay,

1230
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:30,216
you can talk to my
crappy public defender

1231
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:31,804
