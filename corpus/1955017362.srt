1
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,020
<i>This informant, paid by police,{\i}
<i>using taxpayers' dollars...{\i}</i>

2
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,730
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

3
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,740
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm...

4
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,990
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

5
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,870
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

6
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,540
whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.

7
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,510
Mr. Rodman...

8
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,380
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

9
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,710
in choosing what he planted...

10
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,220
as he did
in choosing his attorney...

11
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,220
but, lately, the only variation
that l'm hearing in your argument...

12
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,640
is the name of your client.

13
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,430
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates...

14
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,520
but you're not
gonna convince me...

15
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,070
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

16
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,700
Furthermore, there is no sacred protection
of property rights in our country.

17
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,500
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre of plants...

18
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,120
that farm can be seized...

19
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,730
and that farm can be sold.

20
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,650
What the hell is that?

21
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,590
You can tell a Iot about somebody
from this stuff.

22
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,680
lt's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

23
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,600
- A fishing rod.
- What do you think they want?

24
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,640
Depends what state they're from.

25
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Uh... Arizona.

26
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,660
Arizona.

27
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,690
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

28
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,000
Or am l being cynical?

29
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,320
Mark... l'm gonna miss you.

30
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,930
Thank you for aIl your hard work.

31
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,780
Hi. How are you today?

32
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,200
You've got a daughter. Why is it important
to get a handle on this drug problem?

33
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,670
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

34
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,210
- But l'm planning on being back here as much as l can.
- How do you feel about -

35
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose...

36
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,210
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

37
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,210
- [ Gordon ] I got it.
- You got it, babe.

38
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,040
l'm cooI, man.
You just don't teIl any jokes.

39
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,250
- "Don't teIl any jokes"?
- Don't tell jokes. It's a giveaway, Ray.

40
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,390
- lt's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke, it's a giveaway.

41
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,690
- Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is? You are too uptight, man.

42
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,890
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

43
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,960
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

44
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,260
- Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

45
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,110
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

46
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,900
Can l get it?
Can l get it?

47
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,100
- Oh, baby, can l say it?
- Say it. lt's show time.

48
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,200
<i>[ Ray ] We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.{\i}
<i>We have a 2:00 appointment.{\i}</i>

49
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,910
<i>He's right down the hallway{\i}
<i>in the back room.{\i}</i>

50
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,180
<i>Thank you.{\i}</i>

51
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,300
<i>[ Ruiz ]{\i}
<i>Come in. Hey, fellas.{\i}</i>

52
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Come on, you guys.
Get him talking. Get him outside.

53
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,680
<i>How you doing?{\i}</i>

54
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,130
<i>- I'm well. How are you?{\i}
<i>- I'm good. Pretty good.{\i}</i>

55
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,770
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

56
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,570
You guys ever bought
a quarter ton before?

57
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,820
- No?
- l don't think so.

58
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,690
lt's a big fucking deal, all right?

59
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,830
lt's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

60
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,980
How many peasants is that gonna take?
You'd have a line from here to Mexico City.

61
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,480
You say show up at a time, we show up
at the time and we're fucking sitting here.

62
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,590
- Sure l can't offer you something to drink?
- l can offer you a joke.

63
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,850
You want to hear a joke?
l got a joke, l got a joke. Come on, bro.

64
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,780
lt's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
l'm gonna tell you a joke.

65
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,760
All right, why are hurricanes
named after women?

66
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,140
- I don't know.
- Because when they arrive, they're wet and wild.

67
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,440
When they leave,
they take your house and your car.

68
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,360
- lt's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

69
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I chuckled. Damn.

70
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,900
- FelIas... that's us.
- Yo.

71
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move untiI they get Ruiz outside.

72
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,000
l told you there was
nothing to worry about.

73
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,260
l got another joke.

74
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,850
- Come on, man. Please.
- Just one more. Relax.

75
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,350
A guy goes, gets a tattoo
put on his penis.

76
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,860
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

77
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,650
- Tattooed on his penis?
- Yeah. The words "yes" and "no."

78
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,450
So, his wife says, "HoId it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house -"

79
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,650
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

80
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,570
What the fuck is going -

81
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,910
Shit! Agent down!

82
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,780
Get in there now! Go!

83
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,690
D.E.A.!

84
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,940
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

85
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,430
Go. Shit.

86
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,920
Shit! Fuck!

87
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,180
Shit. Motherfucker.

88
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,870
- l think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, l think so too.

89
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,010
Don't fucking move! Get your hands - Move!

90
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,420
Get out, you son of a bitch!
Get out!

91
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,640
<i>Is this what{\i}
<i>they wear to go to sIeep...{\i}</i>

92
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,640
<i>or do they hang out like this{\i}
<i>the whole time?{\i}</i>

93
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,900
- That would be their sleep attire.
- lt's Iike a smoking jacket.

94
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Ηe's gonna be smoking in a minute.

95
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Okay, who's the father of Greek tragedy?
Anyone? Anyone?

96
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,070
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
Ηis trilogy? The Oresteia.

97
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,870
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone -
l mean, can anyone stop the Seth machine?

98
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,040
- No.
- That's correct. Score.

99
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,590
And "tragedy" is closed out.

100
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,180
But wait.

101
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,300
- ls he her husband?
- Yes.

102
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,110
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

103
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,730
Yeah.

104
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,440
- What are you doing?
- Just watch.

105
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,260
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

106
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,390
What is this, like freebase?

107
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,930
Not "Iike." lt is.

108
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,810
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

109
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,390
Hold it. Hold it.

110
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,300
See?

111
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,170
Now you see.

112
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,490
Oh, how - Oh, they're doing great.

113
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,330
Look at how cute they are.

114
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,830
- Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

115
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,880
Little Tiger, l hope.

116
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,630
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

117
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,590
So will his bank balance.

118
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,670
- My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

119
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,010
- Helena, you never order duck.
- l know, I know.

120
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,760
lt's not me who ordered it.
lt's somebody else.

121
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,120
Well, he or she
has very good taste.

122
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,290
- l love duck, don't you?
- lt's delicious. Do you want some, Nan?

123
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,260
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- lt's such a fatty bird.

124
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,030
There's good cholesteroI, and there's bad
cholesterol, which is confusing to me.

125
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,230
- Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

126
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,640
lt's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

127
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,900
- You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

128
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,700
l'm European.
l say that to my doctor.

129
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,670
"l'm European.
l'm allowed to drink red wine."

130
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,110
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when l was pregnant.

131
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,080
- A glass a week.
- After my amnio...

132
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,010
he said, "Okay, now you can go
and have a glass of red wine."

133
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,700
l had two.

134
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,950
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

135
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,690
- Thanks a lot.
- Can l bring the bag in the back with me?

136
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,270
- No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

137
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,560
- Give me the putter.
- All right.

138
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,730
ln you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

139
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,570
Put this down here, okay?

140
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,160
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

141
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,410
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

142
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,210
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

143
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,250
Okay.

144
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,850
<i>Until you officially take over{\i}
<i>the Office of National Drug ControI Policy...{\i}</i>

145
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,130
<i>under no circumstances will you speak{\i}
<i>to the press unprotected...{\i}</i>

146
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,140
<i>without going through this office...{\i}</i>

147
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,600
or having someone in the room.

148
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,930
There are a lot of interests
in this town.

149
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,790
Right now, they're scared of you.

150
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,460
The reason they're scared of you:

151
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,790
Technically, you have veto powers
over their budgets, so think about that.

152
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,270
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen...

153
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,610
each with a specially
prepared question.

154
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,080
They're questions designed for one thing -
to make them look smart.

155
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,760
lf you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

156
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,200
lf you treat them
with utter humiIity, they will.

157
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,790
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

158
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,790
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China...

159
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,250
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

160
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,340
Also, one month from today, you will
give your first official press conference.

161
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,140
ln it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

162
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,150
<i>Judge, I just want{\i}
<i>to be cIear about one thing:{\i}</i>

163
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,600
<i>l am not a partisan person,{\i}
<i>l am an issue person.{\i}</i>

164
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,310
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me...

165
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,280
l will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues...

166
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,060
the most important of which,
in my opinion, Mexico.

167
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,660
l know everyone that you're going to meet.
l know what they want and why.

168
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,990
lt is important
that they Iike you.

169
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,330
lt is not important
that they like me.

170
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,000
That is why l can help protect you.

171
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,830
Like you protected Landry?

172
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,170
I see where you're going with that.

173
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,340
lf l could say one thing:
Basically, a guy like Landry is so autocratic...

174
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,920
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

175
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,510
<i>There's a political component to this job{\i}
<i>that the general didn't have any patience for.{\i}</i>

176
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,480
General, Bob Wakefield.

177
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,890
- Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

178
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,360
Jeff, you want to excuse us for a minute?

179
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,310
Yes, sir.
l'll be right outside.

180
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,990
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

181
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,570
You've done a fine job, General.

182
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,200
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
is in better shape
than when you found it.

184
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,040
l'm not sure l made
the slightest difference.

185
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,340
l tried. l really did.

186
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,500
l think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

187
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,920
l plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

188
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,380
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

189
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,930
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

190
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,390
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

191
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,190
This is a tough enough job.
l plan on focusing on this.

192
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,440
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out...

193
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,740
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

194
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,540
He said, "When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of..."

195
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,950
open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

196
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,520
And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of...

197
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,590
"open the second letter."

198
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,920
Well, soon enough,
this guy found himself in a tight place...

199
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,720
so he opened the first letter, which said,
"BIame everything on me."

200
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,190
So, he blamed the old man.
lt worked like a charm.

201
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,300
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of...

202
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,200
and he opened the second letter.

203
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,500
lt said,
"Sit down and write two letters."

204
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,910
Yeah.

205
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,250
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

206
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,050
- lt's a brown Ford Explorer.
- lt was here. lt's been stolen. l want to file a report.

207
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,260
A report will not help you
find your car.

208
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,810
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

209
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,610
- You call this man... and he'll find your car.
- l don't get it.

210
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,480
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

211
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,650
The police will telI him.

212
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,320
Why will they teIl him,
and they won't telI us?

213
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,160
Because we pay him, stupid.

214
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

215
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,330
Es correct.
Es correct.

216
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,000
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

217
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,830
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

218
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,380
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

219
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,170
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

220
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,770
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

221
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,170
- Javier Rodriguez.
<i>- Sí.{\i}</i>

222
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,500
<i>Bien.{\i}</i>

223
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,610
<i>I would say one thing{\i}
<i>to you, Judge...{\i}</i>

224
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,070
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

225
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,740
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities...

226
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,280
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

227
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,740
We in the legal drug business - Merck and Pfizer
and the rest of my very important clients -

228
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,620
realize that we're not fighting a war here
with a traditional winner and loser.

229
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,520
l don't know that
you can win this war.

230
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,830
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs...

231
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,690
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs -

232
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,790
- lf you reduce that to 10, that's a great improvement.
- Right.

233
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,890
l'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement...

234
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,680
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

235
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,970
Can l get a scotch and soda, please?

236
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,440
The price of coke
and heroin has dropped...

237
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,990
but purity has increased.

238
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,020
AIl this law enforcement has reaIly achieved
is that kids get better stuff cheaper.

239
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,240
Education, rehabilitation, prevention -

240
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,450
that's not significant to these reporters.

241
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,650
- Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

242
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,190
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

243
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,490
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

244
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,960
- l look forward to working with you in the future.
- WeIl, call me.

245
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,460
l have a good bill on treatment-on-demand.
l could use your help.

246
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,000
- WonderfuI. Look forward to it. Thanks, Senator.
- Okay. Great.

247
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,310
lf a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth...

248
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,010
- l'll do a story on it.
- Right.

249
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,810
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

250
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,770
l don't care who's president.
l don't care who the members of congress are.

251
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,570
l don't care who you have to deal with.

252
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,690
lf you're independent and you use that
bully pulpit right, that's where your power is.

253
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,190
lt's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

254
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,510
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

255
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,630
Addicts don't vote.

256
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,220
What the hell are you doing here?

257
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,800
You like your view?

258
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,870
- TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

259
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,000
Ηope it's all good
because this is as good as it's gonna get...

260
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,620
for a long, long time, Eduardo.

261
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,330
Look, l'm a legitimate businessman.

262
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,150
- l've got tuna boats. l'm a fisherman.
- Shut the fuck up!

263
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,860
- Check it out!
- Shut the fuck up!

264
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,760
- Fucking can it, bitch!
- You can't come in here like that!

265
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,630
- l want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

266
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,850
lt's cool, man.

267
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,450
- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- lt's cool.

268
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,700
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep -

269
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,180
- that's capital punishment in some states, right?
- Yeah, down in Texas.

270
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,080
- They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

271
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
We've got him making
the deal on tape.

272
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,000
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

273
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,540
- We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

274
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,960
No, no, he's fucked.

275
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,070
l only see one way
out of this predicament.

276
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,770
You make us believe
you got a boss, Eddie.

277
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,570
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

278
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,610
No.

279
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,530
No, that's a death sentence.
l'd never make it to the trial.

280
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,490
Look, we're gonna protect you.

281
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,890
- Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

282
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,540
That's a big word
for a fisherman.

283
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,630
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

284
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,920
l know another big word.

285
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,330
lmmunity.

286
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,970
Take it easy, will you?

287
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,980
What's going on in here?

288
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,140
- We have a warrant to search your premises.
- What?

289
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,190
Carl!

290
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,440
My husband!

291
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
- Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl!

292
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,820
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

293
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,660
- David, come here!
- Ma'am, l have a search warrant.

294
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,490
He'll be back.

295
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,910
Where are they taking Daddy?

296
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,270
Ηe'll be all right.

297
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,960
Ηe's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

298
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

299
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,300
- l don't understand what's going on.
- He'Il be alI right.

300
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,970
- What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

301
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,400
lt's okay, sweetheart.
lt's okay, baby.

302
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
Ah.

303
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,130
Well... is this a surprise or what?

304
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,300
An honor.
Thank you.

305
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,630
- Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

306
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,550
- How are you?
- Good trip. l'm good. l just can't believe this.

307
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,310
- What's Washington like?
- What's Washington like? lt's like, uh -

308
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,480
lt's like Calcutta;
surrounded by beggars.

309
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

310
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,070
and they don't say
"please" and "thank you."

311
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,530
<i>So, we put the case{\i}
<i>before the arbitration panel...{\i}</i>

312
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,030
none of whom have any expertise.

313
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,030
"Superfund" is just one of those words.

314
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
People stop paying attention.

315
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,540
- lt's frustrating.
- lt's so frustrating.

316
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Did you meet the president?

317
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,130
Honey, your father
knows the president.

318
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,170
lt just so happens -
that the president of the United States...

319
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,180
my new boss,
the leader of the free world...

320
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,920
has penciled me in
for a little face time.

321
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,770
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

322
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,560
Caroline.

323
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
l'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

324
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,860
lt's great.
lt's great, Daddy.

325
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,090
lt's just amazing, that's all.

326
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,240
Arnie, thank God.

327
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,620
Helena, l am so -

328
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,870
Please tell me
what's going on here.

329
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,880
What is going on? They came into the house.
They just took him away.

330
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,550
They searched my home.

331
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,450
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

332
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,890
First of alI, CarI is not here.

333
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,390
The D.E.A. has got him.

334
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,560
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment...

335
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,060
which will probably be tomorrow.

336
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,060
So here you are wasting your time.
AIl right? Are you with me?

337
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,610
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

338
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,240
over the telephone.

339
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,530
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

340
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,410
- What is he charged with, Arnie?
- l don't know.

341
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,210
But under no circumstances
am l gonna talk about it here. Okay?

342
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,170
Now, you go home...

343
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,920
and you be with your son.
All right?

344
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Miss?

345
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,600
Can l have a Budweiser?

346
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,860
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

347
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,510
Can you give me a cigarette?

348
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,090
<i>AlI l'm saying -{\i}
<i>What I'm - What I'm saying is...{\i}</i>

349
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,590
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

350
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,090
We alI look at each other
and nod with these -

351
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,890
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

352
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,270
Responses -
Not reaI responses.

353
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:48,070
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles.

354
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,610
Surface bullshit.

355
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,780
Do l ever just say...

356
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,610
"Hey... l'm uncomfortable in this crowd."

357
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,120
l don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either.

358
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,450
"l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because -"

359
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,290
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

360
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,290
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

361
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,290
Iike our parents seem
and their parents before them.

362
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,630
l'm sorry that l have to be the one to say this,
but it's fucking bullshit.

363
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,470
- For instance?
- l know you jack off to Caroline every night...

364
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,640
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

365
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,470
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

366
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,480
Because what is that convention?

367
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,850
We're this random collection of self interests,
and all of a sudden we decide...

368
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:32,520
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisIe to Noah's Ark?

369
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,320
Actually, for your information,
when l jerk off...

370
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,820
l'm not just thinking about Caroline,
l'm thinking about you with Caroline.

371
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,070
- So, how about that?
- Baby -

372
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,420
That is what l'm talking about -
sarcasm.

373
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,670
Always fucking sarcasm.

374
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,340
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that...

375
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,840
people will think
that you are weak...

376
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,010
or they won't Iike you...

377
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,680
or whatever it is
you think will happen, but -

378
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,460
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

379
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,360
Wh-What?

380
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,160
Because you are so fucking right.

381
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,700
- l'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

382
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,070
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

383
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,160
Why don't we...

384
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,000
change this thing,
this sociaI pattern?

385
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,750
Why don't we be different?

386
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,340
- Yeah.
- But then why are you even talking about it?

387
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,670
But we're making it, like, from now on.

388
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,420
You're like,
"Why don't we do something?"

389
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,930
- Why don't you do something?
- That's what l'm saying, Seth.

390
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,430
- You do it yourself -
- l'm saying if you knew it, you wouldn't even say it.

391
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,430
Vanessa, l'm serious, l feel fucked up.

392
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,230
lt's a social pattern, you know?

393
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,570
Spence, baby, are you all right?

394
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,610
He's fucking bIue.
He isn't breathing.

395
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,780
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

396
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,160
- Wait -
- What the fuck do we do?

397
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,620
- Uh - Oh, God -
- Fuck!

398
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,630
- Somebody call a doctor!
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

399
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,050
No, he's a research -
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

400
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,970
- What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

401
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,300
Call your dad!
Ηe's a neurosurgeon!

402
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,470
l can't call my dad!
lt's 3:00 in the morning!

403
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,600
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something!

404
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,370
No, he can't die on the floor!
Ηis parents are in Barbados!

405
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,040
Move! Move!

406
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,200
Go!

407
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,020
Okay, nobody has anything
on them, right?

408
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,960
Fuck!

409
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,860
l'm on the board
of my son's school.

410
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,770
l have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

411
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,570
l think l have a right to know
if my husband is a legitimate businessman.

412
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,230
Of course he is.

413
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,030
l've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

414
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,580
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

415
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,790
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A....

416
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,730
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

417
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,230
Carl is very, very good
at his business.

418
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,610
Which is smuggling
illegal drugs into this country.

419
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,160
- They're whispering. They're whispering.
- l know.

420
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,660
- Can't hear it. - l know. The fucking
bug's too far away from the room.

421
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,080
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

422
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,120
They're saying something.

423
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,710
Sounds like they're conspiring
to conspire.

424
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,710
l can feel the lies vibrating
from their home.

425
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,630
l don't think she's in on it, man.

426
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,350
Come on, l dream about this.
l have actual dreams about this.

427
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,520
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

428
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,270
- White people. Hey.
- White people. l know, l know.

429
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,980
But l don't think she's in on it, man.

430
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,190
She knows Arnie Metzger.

431
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,820
So does half of San Diego.

432
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,700
- You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

433
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,870
- l got -
- l love it. l love it when you do this.

434
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:59,870
- How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got - l got 12 bucks.

435
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,540
- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

436
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,130
- Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

437
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,440
<i>- How old are you?{\i}
<i>- Sixteen.{\i}</i>

438
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,680
Live with your parents?

439
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,250
Yes.

440
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
Parents still together?

441
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,370
Yes.

442
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,060
Do you work?

443
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,730
l voIunteer.

444
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,530
l read to blind peopIe,
one day a week for two hours.

445
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,240
ln school?

446
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,820
Yes.

447
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,250
Private?

448
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,920
Yeah.

449
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,560
How are your grades?

450
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,010
- l'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

451
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,970
l get A's. All A's.

452
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,890
You do?

453
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,050
What else do you do?

454
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,930
l'm a National Merit Finalist.

455
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,020
l'm on the Ηi-Q Team
and the Math Τeam.

456
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,770
l'm in the Spanish Club.
l'm a Thespian.

457
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,940
l'm vice president of my class.

458
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,210
l'm on the volIeyball team.

459
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,630
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

460
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,440
Carol.

461
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,690
Oh, sweetie.

462
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,420
You okay?

463
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,000
lt's okay.

464
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,600
<i>Caroline, how welI{\i}
<i>did you know this boy that overdosed?{\i}</i>

465
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,490
Ηe didn't hang around us.

466
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,290
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

467
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,990
l'm not part of that group.

468
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,250
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

469
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,670
Ηe's a friend.

470
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,600
Ηe's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

471
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,060
Ηe definitely had a few beers, but...

472
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,350
it's not like he wanted to drive.

473
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,360
We just didn't know what else to do.

474
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,430
lt wasn't my pot.

475
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,120
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

476
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,630
Alone.

477
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,590
- l think she's lying.
- Me too.

478
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,880
So let's ground her,
clip her wings.

479
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,220
School, scheduled activities.
That's it till further notice.

480
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,020
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment.

481
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,400
But don't you think spending the night
in jail is punishment enough?

482
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,230
l mean, we've all had our moments.

483
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,450
- Lord knows, l tried every drug there was -
- l don't want to hear about that.

484
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,360
You experimented
when you were in college.

485
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,410
Shall we take the quotes off experiment
and call it what it was?

486
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,740
- This is different.
- Why?

487
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,830
Because she's 16 years old!

488
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,750
l think she needs to find out
for herself, on her own.

489
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,420
- We have to allow her room to figure out -
- You want to give her room?

490
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,980
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

491
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,590
l am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this kind of behavior...

492
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,890
because we do not.

493
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,870
- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want to push her away.

494
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,730
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

495
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,510
How long have you known about this?

496
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:01,460
How long have you known?

497
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,190
Six months.

498
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,230
...Francisco Flores.

499
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,060
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

500
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,560
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

501
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,230
Our case against him is very strong.

502
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,900
Ηe is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

503
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,480
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

504
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,240
My cIient is no more a fIight risk...

505
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,450
than Your Honor or the able prosecutor.

506
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,580
Ηe's a pillar of his community;

507
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,500
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla...

508
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,130
the community where he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

509
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,130
As our defense wiIl quickly show...

510
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,130
my client is guilty of nothing more...

511
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,140
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

512
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:36,170
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

513
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,360
l'm going to deny bail.

514
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,470
<i>l appreciate you{\i}
<i>coming in so earIy this morning.{\i}</i>

515
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,810
<i>Judge Wakefield,{\i}
<i>it's an honor to handle it for you.{\i}</i>

516
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,980
<i>She's a minor. lt probably wouId have{\i}
<i>expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.{\i}</i>

517
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,780
<i>NevertheIess, this is a sensitive issue for me.{\i}
<i>l'm sure you can understand that.{\i}</i>

518
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,650
<i>Like l said, open container,{\i}
<i>P.l., misdemeanor possession.{\i}</i>

519
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,650
<i>It's easy to make it go away.{\i}</i>

520
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,450
One thing bothers me: That kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

521
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,080
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

522
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,830
So l've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

523
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,210
l don't know what you mean.

524
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,010
Well, l mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

525
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,010
No.

526
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,130
l don't know.

527
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,020
- ls she in any kind of therapy or professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.

528
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,610
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

529
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,140
Well, l hope it stays that way.

530
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,250
<i>Yeah, hi, it's Robert.{\i}</i>

531
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,130
l want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

532
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,340
Because l'm tired of talking to experts
who've never Ieft the beltway.

533
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,590
lt's time to see the front lines.

534
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,250
<i>Carlos Ayala started out{\i}
<i>in the family connection business -{\i}</i>

535
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,970
<i>real estate in Tijuana,{\i}
<i>fishing boats out of Ensenada...{\i}</i>

536
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,260
hydroponic strawberries.

537
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,840
Then he met up with the Obregón brothers
of the Tijuana cartel.

538
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,350
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

539
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:25,390
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

540
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,560
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to further reduce those odds.

541
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,270
So, you pay off customs officials?

542
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,940
Well, you know, in, uh, in Mexico...

543
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,280
law enforcement is
an entrepreneuriaI activity.

544
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,990
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh -

545
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,250
We hire drivers with nothing to lose
and throw a lot of product at the problem.

546
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,120
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
lt's not difficult.

547
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,920
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
lt's gonna continue to work for years.

548
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,840
NAFΤA makes things even more difficult for you
because the border's disappearing.

549
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,470
Do you realize in the next year or two
at the outside Mexican trucking companies...

550
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:02,640
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

551
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,640
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

552
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,440
- lt's gonna be a free-for-all.
- What, are we on Larry King or something?

553
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,230
Shit.

554
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,820
Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

555
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,160
You guys remind me of those Japanese soldiers
left behind on deserted islands...

556
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,990
who think World War ll
is still going on.

557
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:27,540
Let me be the first to tell you, your government
surrendered this war a long time ago.

558
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,710
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help him any in front of a jury.

559
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:34,690
- lt's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

560
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,020
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

561
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Well, l got greedy, didn't l?

562
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,020
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

563
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,480
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

564
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,020
Carl never would have been so stupid.

565
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,500
Well, CarI hired you.
That was a mistake.

566
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,230
CarI and l have been friends
since we were little kids.

567
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,460
Ηe was loyal.

568
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,350
<i>The port of San Ysidro, CaIifornia:{\i}</i>

569
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:46,980
<i>45,000 vehicles on average,{\i}
<i>25,000 pedestrians per day.{\i}</i>

570
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,700
- ln the last six months, a threefold increase?
- lncrease in narcotics seizures.

571
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,540
Would that mean, pro rata,
three times as much drugs is getting in?

572
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,830
That's a scary way to figure it,
but l believe that's true.

573
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:06,250
<i>ln my heart, l'd love to say{\i}
<i>that we were getting 60 or 70%.{\i}</i>

574
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,050
<i>ln the reality, we're more like 40 or{\i}
<i>50% of the total that's approaching us.{\i}</i>

575
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,510
<i>And it's all big-doIlar issues now.{\i}</i>

576
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,510
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

577
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,930
lt's one organization
fighting another organization.

578
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,930
When things are good,
people don't kiIl each other.

579
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,100
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope...

580
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail...

581
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,510
people start killing each other.

582
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,780
- How's David?
- "How's David?"

583
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:42,540
- Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena -

584
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,920
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

585
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,000
- He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

586
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,750
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

587
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,420
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

588
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,590
Ηelena... we're gonna get through this.

589
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,600
l promise.

590
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,140
- l'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea what's going on out here?

591
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,830
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

592
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:12,730
The people in the bank - you should see
the way they look at me when l walk in there.

593
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,950
l have a letter
from the government telling me...

594
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:18,950
anything l sell from the house
will be taken against an income tax lien.

595
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,200
Our fucking friends -

596
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,790
Nobody will heIp us.
Nobody will take us in.

597
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,920
Nobody wants anything
to do with us, Carl.

598
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,760
So, you just telI me
how you're gonna make it up to me.

599
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,180
Helena -

600
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,300
Just tell me what to do.

601
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,470
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

602
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,930
l won't do it, Carl.

603
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,530
l want our Iife back.

Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

617
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,500
- Hi, folks. - Hello.
- Hi. Room 310, pIease.

618
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,300
- Okay, l need to see some l.D.s, please, and $28.
- Okay.

619
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,510
Oh, man, l love this place.

620
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,580
l wish we could just stay here.

621
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,580
Just be here forever and ever and...

622
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,730
make a little home here.

623
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,180
l want to, uh -

624
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:53,980
l want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

625
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,710
Okay.

626
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,190
The first time l got laid
was on a beach just like that.

627
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:45,160
- You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

628
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,990
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

629
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:50,800
- Τhat's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

630
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,850
Did he treat you good?

631
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,520
- Who's this guy?
- l don't know.

632
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,750
- l never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

633
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,540
David!

634
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:25,150
David, come back here!

635
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,820
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

636
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:31,330
<i>Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers.{\i}</i>

637
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:35,290
<i>Karen, if he
tries to move with that kid, you break cover.{\i}</i>

638
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:39,880
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a lot of money.
Snapping this kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

639
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,880
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear...

640
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,630
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

641
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:49,860
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

642
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:18,630
- Javier.
<i>- Sí?{\i}</i>

643
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,420
No.

644
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,930
- No.
- No?

645
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,840
No.

646
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,510
Javier Rodríguez.

647
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,880
- John, how are you? Bob WakefieId, pleasure.
- Judge, welcome.

648
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,130
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

649
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,590
<i>EPlC is very unique.{\i}</i>

650
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:39,390
<i>lt's a facility that has over 15{\i}
<i>different agencies - state and local -{\i}</i>

651
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:42,350
<i>that participate{\i}
<i>in gathering intelligence...{\i}</i>

652
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:44,730
and making sure
that information gets out...

653
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:48,820
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

654
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,620
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats...

655
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,950
anything that carries drugs.

656
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:59,410
When the information comes in,
we're able to check with different databases...

657
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,410
to see if it's in the system or not.

658
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:04,250
And wouId most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

659
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:08,750
The Juarez, the Obregón brothers - Are those
the two that wouId be most important?

660
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,460
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

661
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,220
They are the dominant force
in trafficking...

662
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,380
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

663
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,600
How are the cartels achieving...

664
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,850
the leveI of intelIigence and
sophistication that they're showing?

665
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:25,940
- Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

666
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,610
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

667
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,110
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue...

668
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:35,400
- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

669
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,740
"Way beyond"?

670
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,540
Our budgetary process
makes us pale in comparison.

671
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,540
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

672
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,000
His nickname was Scorpion.

673
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,170
l'll let you figure out
what that means.

674
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,800
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

675
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,130
Best of our information, yes.

676
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:58,720
Who do you interact with
on that side?

677
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,140
Nobody.

678
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,850
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

679
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:07,590
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

680
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,610
<i>l want everyone thinking out of the box...{\i}</i>

681
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,660
<i>for the next few minutes.{\i}</i>

682
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,450
What are we doing about Mexico?

683
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,790
- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- Unlimited funds?

684
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,000
Unlimited.

685
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,960
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

686
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,710
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

687
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,760
Come on, guys,
l want to hear from everyone:

688
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,060
F.B.l., customs, treatment.

689
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,350
- ls there anybody from treatment on this plane?
- No, Judge.

690
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,520
Then l want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

691
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
Yes, sir.

692
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,690
We need to take down one of
these cartels - either Juarez or Tijuana -

693
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,860
not because they're a symbol, but -

694
01:08:55,860 --> 01:09:00,660
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

695
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:04,700
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense...

696
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,870
l send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

697
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,870
Why? Because it's a symbol.

698
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,210
lt's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

699
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:18,840
lt's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

700
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,380
So...

701
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,850
right now...

702
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,550
on this flight only...

703
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,730
the dam is open...

704
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:32,090
for new ideas.

705
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:45,910
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

706
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:49,580
l have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

707
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,580
I learned that back in Miami in '85.

708
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,750
U.S. shut down the entire Caribbean.

709
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,420
lt's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami -

710
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,760
Arnie, l need money.

711
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,590
Somebody - l think it was the Obregóns -
threatened David.

712
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,930
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

713
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:10,270
Oh, Helena.

714
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,770
I'd give it to you myseIf,
but l-l-I just don't have that kind of money.

715
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,770
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

716
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:20,440
Yes, there are people that do owe you money,
but nobody's gonna pay.

717
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,790
Carl's got too much heat on him.

718
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:27,620
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

719
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:31,620
- Don't we own a construction concern?
- Laundromats wash the money.

720
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,040
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

721
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,790
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

722
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:39,160
l'm sorry.

723
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,320
l just keep wondering what's gonna happen
if he doesn't get out.

724
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,680
Just never been on my own before.

725
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,030
Always had someone. Always.

726
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:06,410
l remember the first time
that l saw you -

727
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,700
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

728
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,500
Somehow l knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

729
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,400
Glad you think so, Arnie.

730
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:26,130
l just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

731
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:30,940
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

732
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,980
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone Iike that.

733
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,040
Do you?

734
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,230
<i>l think we{\i}
<i>may have found our Mexican drug czar.{\i}</i>

735
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,230
General Salazar.

736
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,280
Be nice to have somebody
to work with down there.

737
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:15,410
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

738
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,010
Possibly, yeah.

739
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:23,910
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

740
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,750
- Barbara -
- Because l'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.

741
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,000
I think it's important we maintain
a unified front here, Barbara.

742
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,210
lf you start in on the war metaphors...

743
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,420
l'm gonna drive this car
into a fucking telephone pole.

744
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:38,090
- l am as worried as you are.
- Oh, l don't think so.

745
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,100
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

746
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,560
That's what l get from our daughter.

747
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,190
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

748
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:50,990
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

749
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,610
l'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

750
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,610
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

751
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,950
l have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. lt's different.

752
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:05,750
- Oh, is it?
- Otherwise, l would be dying of boredom.

753
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:26,420
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

754
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,540
CaroIine, open this door immediately.

755
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,790
Who is it?
l'm going to the bathroom.

756
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:31,640
- Open the goddamn door!
- One minute.

757
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,870
Excuse me.
l have to go to bed.

758
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,580
Oh, Jesus.

759
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,110
Oh, my God.

760
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:56,030
You are not going anywhere, young lady.
You stay right there.

761
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,010
Where are they?

762
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,910
Where the hell are the drugs?

763
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:10,080
Where are they?

764
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,100
Fuck you.

765
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,590
Fuck you.
l wasn't doing anything.

766
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,750
You're like the Gestapo.

767
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,590
Fuck me. Fuck me.

768
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:24,300
Well, fuck you!

769
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,690
- Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

770
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:17,980
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

771
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,320
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

772
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

773
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,820
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

774
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,820
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

775
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,620
A place we have that we know is protected.
He's good. Let's go.

776
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:32,910
- No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. lt's really safe.

777
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:35,710
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

778
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,330
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

779
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,500
- This is safe.
- Come on.

780
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:43,670
All right.

781
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,300
Where would you like to go?

782
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,290
- Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

783
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:03,400
l believe it's important
that we work together.

784
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,200
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

785
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,030
We agree.

786
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:13,830
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

787
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:20,100
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

788
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,130
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

789
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:27,180
We pay for that kind
of information.

790
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:31,850
ls that what
you're talking about, Javier?

791
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,360
Getting paid?

792
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,760
You like baseball?

793
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:48,030
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

794
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,410
So it's safe.

795
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,490
So they can play baseball.

796
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:57,580
So they no become -

797
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,580
Everybody like baseball.

798
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,670
Everybody likes parks.

799
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,690
Listen.

800
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,220
l believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

801
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,730
in Tijuana now.

802
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:17,730
That's what l'm talking about,
my friends.

803
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,600
<i>Account number...{\i}</i>

804
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,400
<i>8201 -4302-8091...{\i}</i>

805
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,430
2431.

806
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,240
A cash advance.

807
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:40,890
How much can l get?

808
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,150
That's it?

809
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,970
You ever try the patch, man?

810
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,970
- The what?
- The patch.

811
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:56,810
- That shit doesn't work, bro.
- lt worked for my cousin.

812
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,520
- No shit?
- Yeah.

813
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,480
l mean, he had to wear about
five or six of 'em at a time, but it worked.

814
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,380
- So, how's he doing now?
- Oh, he's dead.

815
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,570
- He's dead?
- lt wasn't from the patch, man.

816
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,320
<i>- Okay, she's coming out.{\i}
- On it.</i>

817
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,320
- What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

818
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,040
<i>She's leaving her property.{\i}</i>

819
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,160
Where the hell is she going?

820
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,170
Maybe her neighbors.

821
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:26,500
No, l don't think the neighbors are fucking
with her too much right about now.

822
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,550
What does she have in her hand there?

823
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,170
Huh?

824
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:35,620
<i>She seems to be headed for the van.{\i}</i>

825
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Oh, shit.

826
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,650
- What - Wh-What do we do?
- l-l don't know. What do we do?

827
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:48,610
- What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

828
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:50,690
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

829
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:52,700
- Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

830
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,030
<i>She's waiting outside the van.{\i}</i>

831
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:57,700
- Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

832
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:01,870
- l was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

833
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,870
Sure.

834
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:08,210
l know this is a difficult situation,
and you're only doing your jobs.

835
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:11,710
l don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

836
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,970
But I have a favor to ask you.

837
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:16,220
You're asking us for a favor?

838
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,550
Some man threatened my child.

839
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,560
These charges have created
so much attention...

840
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,730
it seems to be bringing
all the nut jobs out of the nut jar.

841
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,220
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

842
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,230
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

843
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,900
- l'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

844
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:36,610
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

845
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,420
You're welcome.

846
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,670
l'm gonna get this analyzed
right away, bro.

847
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,970
<i>So, it was my birthday...{\i}</i>

848
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,930
<i>and my ex-wife{\i}
<i>was getting remarried...{\i}</i>

849
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:00,930
<i>and l was in some church basement{\i}
<i>telling a bunch of strangers...{\i}</i>

850
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,020
<i>it was a good day because...{\i}</i>

851
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,820
l didn't have to eat
out of a Dumpster.

852
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,770
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

853
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:13,280
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step -

854
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,110
that l came to believe
l was powerless over alcohol...

855
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:19,280
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

856
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,790
My disease tells me
that l don't have a disease...

857
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,450
that it's my birthday
and l can have one little beer...

858
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,290
one little line, a little Valium.

859
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:33,960
Six months later, l wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

860
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,630
l'm from Dallas, people.

861
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,300
lt's a disease,
an allergy of the body...

862
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,810
an obsession of the mind.

863
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,140
So, my name is Marty...

864
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:49,310
and today l'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

865
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:54,110
And it's a good day because
l didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

866
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,800
Thanks.

867
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:01,530
Hi.

868
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:07,160
l'm Caroline.
l'm not sure l'm an alcoholic.

869
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:11,960
I mean... l don't realIy like to drink.

870
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:18,300
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

871
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:27,260
l guess l'm angry.

872
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:33,690
I mean, I think l'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

873
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:38,360
l'm just... not sure what.

874
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:27,240
Listen to me.
l built our house...

875
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,850
and l'm not gonna lose it.

876
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:34,590
<i>My business -{\i}</i>

877
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:40,220
that would take a lot
of private study.

878
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:49,600
l suggest... you look into the Coronel.

879
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,220
The painting?

880
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,440
<i>Into selling it.{\i}</i>

881
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,000
<i>lf you can stomach it...{\i}</i>

882
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:00,870
you should look into it.

883
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:48,340
Oh, my God.

884
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:47,630
<i>Dear Judge...{\i}</i>

885
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:51,720
l recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

886
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:56,520
l make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

887
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,730
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

888
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:05,860
Judge, l'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things...

889
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:10,110
but l have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

890
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,910
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

891
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:15,240
- Congratulations, General.
<i>- Muchas gracias.{\i}</i>

892
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:19,540
l am confident
that before the end of the year...

893
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,920
Juan Obregón is gonna
be taken into custody.

894
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:27,720
But you must understand that
it's going to be a very difficult task...

895
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,510
because of the corruption
in the poIice force.

896
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,930
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

897
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:37,310
between our two countries will help.

898
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:39,600
l hope so.

899
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,560
On another note, General,
we were taIking about supply.

900
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,440
- Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

901
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,530
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

902
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,780
"Treatment of addiction."

903
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:55,120
Addicts treat themselves.

904
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:59,920
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

905
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:09,760
<i>What l want you to do{\i}
<i>right now is write down five triggers...{\i}</i>

906
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,970
that couId lead to your reIapse...

907
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:14,470
that could jeopardize your recovery.

908
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:17,850
Five triggers.
Your parents, something like that.

909
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,470
Something they could say.

910
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,310
Anything that's a trigger for you.
lt varies from person to person.

911
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,810
l know some of us
have already discussed it.

912
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,690
l know, Linda,
we talked about it the other day.

913
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:31,150
l know you have trouble
with your sister...

914
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:35,730
how she's always
kind of outshining you.

915
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:47,100
<i>Hey, sugar foot,{\i}
<i>how do you like your new home?{\i}</i>

916
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,680
You got to be kidding me.
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

917
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,680
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

918
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,510
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or -

919
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,930
- Biscotti?
- Biscotti. Yeah.

920
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:02,180
You ain't getting
none of that shit either. Pick a bed.

921
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,730
Stay off the phone, Eddie.
No long-distance calls, all right?

922
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:09,420
Use 1 -800-CRlMlNAL if you do.

923
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:20,160
<i>Mr. Ayala first came{\i}
<i>to see me in January.{\i}</i>

924
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,370
That would have been 1987.

925
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:26,830
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

926
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:31,050
I didn't ask too many questions.
l am a businessman also.

927
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:35,720
l was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

928
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:40,060
l supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't -

929
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:44,390
l mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

930
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:47,440
l never sold anything
the whole time l was there.

931
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,860
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

932
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,740
l-l don't really know
what they did.

933
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:57,660
Didn't Mr. Ayala
say where the money came from?

934
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,370
No.

935
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:02,540
Did you ask where the money came from?

936
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,580
No.

937
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:05,910
Where do you think it came from?

938
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,420
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

939
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:10,920
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

940
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,720
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

941
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:21,270
No, not really.

942
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,740
Thank you.

943
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,960
You were followed by the police...

944
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,760
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

945
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,850
l want to use a bomb.

946
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:10,810
Are you kidding?

947
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:14,110
Can't you just shoot him or something?

948
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:17,490
I don't really like guns.

949
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:19,990
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

950
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:24,790
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

951
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,830
When are you gonna do it?

952
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:32,140
l don't know.

953
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:39,090
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

954
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:41,400
Security will be very tight.

955
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:48,150
- l may not be abIe to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

956
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:53,100
lf they can get to the pope and the president,
you can certainly get to him.

957
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,320
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

958
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:23,070
Nobody saw her leave?

959
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,220
Hmm.

960
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:28,720
No, l understand.

961
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,350
Okay.

962
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,900
l gotta go.

963
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,900
l've got to go home.

964
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,900
Did you want me to resch - Um -

965
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,730
Fine.

966
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,940
Javier.

967
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:56,970
No.

968
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:31,490
What you want? Pot? Rock?
Hey, what you want?

969
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:23,230
Fuck!

970
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,180
What the fuck do you want, man?

971
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:12,760
Yeah.

972
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:30,750
lt has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice...

973
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,090
previousIy represented
the town of Seal Beach...

974
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:36,090
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

975
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,760
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case...

976
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,970
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

977
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:45,100
Mr. Adler,
this is a most unusual motion.

978
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,100
Nonetheless, Your Honor...

979
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:50,440
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

980
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:55,240
l hope this is not in any way designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

981
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,910
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning...

982
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:07,710
and l will see counsel
in my chambers.

983
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,490
They are coming this way.

984
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:35,470
They are passing me now.

985
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:43,910
Boy, there's a lot of them.

986
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:48,630
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hoteI today?

987
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:51,950
- Walk back?
- Yeah.

988
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,160
They're not getting into the car.

989
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,630
What are they doing?

990
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,340
They're arguing or something.

991
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:09,180
lt's two blocks.
l could use the fresh air.

992
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:11,770
l've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

993
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,480
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

994
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,690
- l want to walk 'cause l want to walk, not 'cause he wants to walk.
- Let's walk.

995
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:19,050
l like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

996
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:24,270
They're going past me.

997
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:32,170
l-I-l do not know. l think
they're going back to the courthouse.

998
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:36,970
This could be the Iast chance to do this!
Get out of the car and shoot him in the head!

999
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,400
<i>You're a fucking big man?{\i}</i>

1000
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:03,200
l'm a real fucking man. l don't fucking
deal drugs to Iittle fucking kids, you -

1001
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:12,620
- You think you're a badass?
- l am a badass!

1002
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,250
Move, move! Get down!

1003
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:25,220
- We need an ambuIance!
- l got it!

1004
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,570
- Go, go, go! We need an ambulance.
- Go, go, go.

1005
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:00,140
Ray. Ray! Ray!
Wait a minute, Ray!

1006
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,750
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

1007
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,850
Sorry about the other night.

1008
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:30,510
Me too.

1009
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:43,300
Thank you for coming down here, though l
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

1010
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:48,430
- Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, l hear these stories.

1011
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:51,810
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos...

1012
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:54,270
various people fighting over the scraps.

1013
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:58,940
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

1014
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,650
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

1015
01:52:01,650 --> 01:52:04,570
Your route has been compromised.

1016
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:08,070
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

1017
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,330
- l don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

1018
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:13,200
No.

1019
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:18,000
My husband was working on something
he calIed the Project for the Children.

1020
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,800
- Are you aware of this?
- l don't know. Perhaps I remember something.

1021
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:32,010
lf you want to smuggle narcotics
<i>in Senor Espastico Jacobo...{\i}</i>

1022
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,350
that is nothing new, Senora.

1023
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:38,190
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

1024
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:42,860
High impact, pressure-molded cocaine.

1025
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:47,200
lt's odorless, undetectable by the dogs.

1026
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:50,350
Undetectable by anyone.

1027
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:52,800
l don't believe you, senora.

1028
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:19,480
l'm six months pregnant.

1029
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,790
l won't do it.

1030
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:25,280
- Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

1031
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,740
We don't have a deal.

1032
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:32,660
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregón.

1033
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:35,580
Okay.

1034
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:37,890
Okay, okay.

1035
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:50,700
- That's good coke.
- lt should be. lt's yours.

1036
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:54,010
l want our debt forgiven...

1037
01:53:54,010 --> 01:53:58,600
l want to be the exclusive distributor of
Obregón brothers' cocaine in the United States...

1038
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:03,400
and l want the principal witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

1039
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,860
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

1040
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:17,420
Yes.

1041
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:22,170
- AIex?
- Solid.

1042
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:24,630
- That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier...

1043
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:27,300
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

1044
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:30,970
Yes, but l have
a contact at MexTel...

1045
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:34,340
who can get me
his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

1046
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:36,660
That's good to know.

1047
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:44,310
So, now that you have
what you want...

1048
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:47,650
let's talk about how
l get what l want.

1049
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:49,990
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

1050
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:52,820
You're not gonna have
any problems there.

1051
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:57,330
Yeah, but first let's talk about what precautions
you're taking to protect yourself.

1052
01:54:57,330 --> 01:55:01,370
You worry about getting me
what l want.

1053
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:04,230
l'll worry about myself.

1054
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:13,260
<i>Oye, Javier,{\i}
you should feel good about this.</i>

1055
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:19,080
l feel like a traitor.

1056
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:49,100
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregón brothers' place in Tijuana.

1057
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:51,270
- Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

1058
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:55,780
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

1059
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:58,090
Okay.

1060
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:11,790
- HelIo?
<i>- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.{\i}</i>

1061
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:14,130
<i>- D-Did I wake you? l'm sorry.{\i}
- No, it's okay.</i>

1062
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:16,300
<i>General SaIazar has been arrested.{\i}</i>

1063
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:18,800
<i>It turns out he has been working{\i}
<i>for Porfirio MadrigaI...{\i}</i>

1064
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,970
<i>and the Juarez cartel{\i}
<i>the entire time.{\i}</i>

1065
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:24,310
<i>That is why he was trying to push{\i}
<i>the Obregóns out of Tijuana...{\i}</i>

1066
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:26,640
<i>- so he and Madrigal could move in.{\i}
- What?</i>

1067
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,770
l thought Madrigal was dead.
l thought that had been verified.

1068
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:33,150
<i>ApparentIy not. lt is a shitstorm here...{\i}</i>

1069
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:37,320
<i>but the D.E.A. supplied the information{\i}
<i>and was part of the sting.{\i}</i>

1070
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,820
<i>So maybe we can spin this a little.{\i}
<i>But l don't know what to telI people.{\i}</i>

1071
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:44,160
<i>- So, when are you coming back?{\i}
- l'll try to get there as soon as l can.</i>

1072
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:46,500
<i>- Yeah, okay, but -{\i}
- Robert.</i>

1073
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,460
<i>Robert?{\i}</i>

1074
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:51,790
<i>Robert?{\i}</i>

1075
01:57:51,790 --> 01:57:53,880
l gotta call you back.

1076
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,490
<i>- Wh-What -{\i}</i>

1077
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:04,680
- My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

1078
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:08,180
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

1079
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:12,350
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

1080
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,640
lf l can find him,
l shouId be able to find her.

1081
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:29,870
Although
ser and estar both mean "to be"...

1082
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:33,880
they have very specific uses.

1083
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:36,290
May l help you, sir?

1084
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:42,680
- Come on.
- Excuse me!

1085
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:47,480
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

1086
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:57,540
l can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

1087
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:03,370
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

1088
01:59:03,410 --> 01:59:06,030
"To this place"?

1089
01:59:06,030 --> 01:59:08,200
What is that shit?

1090
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,910
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours...

1091
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:13,750
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

1092
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:17,630
asking every bIack person, "You got any drugs?
You know where I can score some drugs?"

1093
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:21,590
Think about the effect that has on the psyche
of a black person, on their possibilities.

1094
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:25,760
l - God, l guarantee you, you bring 100,000
black peopIe into your neighborhood...

1095
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,100
and they're asking every white person they see,
"You got any drugs? Know where l can score some?"

1096
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:34,480
Within a day, everyone would be selling -
your friends, their kids.

1097
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:38,270
Here's why: lt's an unbeatable market force, man.
lt's a 300% markup value.

1098
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:41,230
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours...

1099
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,280
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

1100
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:48,080
You're telIing me that white people
would stilI be going to law school?

1101
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:15,980
- What do you want?
- l'm looking for my daughter.

1102
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:17,940
Caroline.

1103
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:20,480
She's been here.

1104
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,650
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out of here?

1105
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:27,330
l need to find my daughter, all right?
I'Il pay you.

1106
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:31,540
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

1107
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:38,380
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

1108
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:42,300
Why the fuck shouldn't l just
put your ass in a Dumpster?

1109
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:44,590
- l got money.
- I got money!

1110
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:47,430
l got $1,000 in my wallet.
lt's for you.

1111
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:50,820
lf l want your money, man,
l will take your money.

1112
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:55,180
Just tell me where my daughter is.

1113
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:58,190
Please? Please?

1114
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:06,050
Don't do that shit again.

1115
02:01:11,870 --> 02:01:16,670
Look, Jesus, man, l'm telling you,
just don't do this vigilante thing. Okay?

1116
02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:19,880
Either the cops are gonna find her,
or she's gonna calI you.

1117
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,420
Okay? l promise.

1118
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,560
Ana.

1119
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:50,980
l know she's in there.
Just Iet me talk to her.

1120
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:53,860
Look, l - l know she's in there, man!

1121
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:56,960
No, l fucking know she's in there!

1122
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:02,110
Jesus Christ!

1123
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,600
l-l haven't touched her.

1124
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:15,110
You get the fuck
out of here right now.

1125
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:28,770
Hi.

1126
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:38,440
Hi, Daddy.

1127
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:43,730
Hi, sweetheart.

1128
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:20,120
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

1129
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:22,630
- Good morning.
- Big day.

1130
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:28,290
You're a star.

1131
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:31,190
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

1132
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,590
- Who is it?
- lt's the Mafia.

1133
02:05:36,590 --> 02:05:40,580
- l've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

1134
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:46,250
- So who's this going to?
- Over here.

1135
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:55,440
- Ooh.
- Fuck off.

1136
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,490
- ReIax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone, man?

1137
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:00,920
Good-bye.

1138
02:06:02,490 --> 02:06:04,660
You know, you're gonna be testifying
for about 10 days.

1139
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:07,000
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

1140
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
You expect me to be grateful for spending
the rest of my life looking over my shoulder?

1141
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,480
Wow, that's -
that's heavy, Eddie.

1142
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:21,340
Can't you for one second imagine that none of this
had happened, that my drugs had gone through?

1143
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,340
What would be the harm?

1144
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:25,680
Huh? What would be the harm?

1145
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:28,520
A few peopIe get high
who are getting high anyway.

1146
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,170
Your partner's stiIl alive.

1147
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:35,190
We don't have to have
breakfast together.

1148
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:37,400
Don't you see this means nothing?

1149
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:40,060
Your whole life is pointless.

1150
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:43,770
You're really breaking my heart, man.

1151
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,430
- The worst part about you, Monty -
- "Monty"?

1152
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:52,870
The worst part about you, Monty...

1153
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,340
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

1154
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:59,210
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

1155
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:01,470
This food tastes like shit.

1156
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:06,040
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

1157
02:07:08,350 --> 02:07:09,680
Let me tell you something.

1158
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:12,430
You onIy got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

1159
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:14,440
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

1160
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,730
- You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

1161
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:21,420
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

1162
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,240
Fuck me.

1163
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:27,780
- Who is it?
- Breakfast.

1164
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:32,050
Hurry up.
lt's getting cold.

1165
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:38,740
Okay. One second.

1166
02:07:39,590 --> 02:07:42,260
- Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1167
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:45,930
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, l'm on your side!

1168
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:48,980
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

1169
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:52,270
- Call an ambulance! Fuck!
- Palms up. Spread your damn hands out.

1170
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:55,960
Shit! Eddie!

1171
02:07:57,860 --> 02:08:00,070
Hold on.

1172
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:03,360
Oh, shit!
Hurry up with that ambulance!

1173
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,560
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

1174
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:12,660
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1175
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:16,620
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz...

1176
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:21,430
the people have determined that we cannot
continue our case against Carl Ayala.

1177
02:08:23,420 --> 02:08:26,970
Oh! Oh!

1178
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:31,680
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

1179
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:19,210
Yeah?

1180
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:21,570
Hi.

1181
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:25,750
So, I got a copy of your speech.

1182
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:28,590
lt's fantastic.

1183
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:31,260
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

1184
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,310
You're my choice.
You're gonna be great.

1185
02:10:33,310 --> 02:10:36,630
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

1186
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:40,100
After the press conference,
he wants to realIy sit down.

1187
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:44,040
Oh, and l got to the Post too.

1188
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:47,280
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. lt's not news.

1189
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:51,650
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

1190
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:55,620
Anyway, if it came out,
we couId turn it into a quaIification.

1191
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:57,790
"l've been in the trenches
of the drug war.

1192
02:10:57,790 --> 02:11:00,790
l've seen the face of the enemy."
Et cetera, et cetera.

1193
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:05,590
<i>A sterling reputation{\i}
<i>and close friend of the president...{\i}</i>

1194
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:09,460
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy...

1195
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:14,270
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

1196
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:28,320
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win...

1197
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:32,010
and a war that we can win.

1198
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:37,250
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource -

1199
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:40,520
our children.

1200
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,670
Sixty-eight miIlion children
have been targeted...

1201
02:11:44,670 --> 02:11:48,360
by those who perpetrate this war...

1202
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:53,970
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

1203
02:11:57,850 --> 02:12:02,650
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

1204
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:07,500
But where we have fallen short...

1205
02:12:08,110 --> 02:12:11,150
l see not a problem...

1206
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:13,760
l see an opportunity.

1207
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,620
An opportunity...

1208
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:23,610
to correct the mistakes...

1209
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,870
of the past...

1210
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:31,770
while Iaying a foundation
for the future.

1211
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,220
This takes...

1212
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:43,060
not only new ideas...

1213
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:45,570
but perseverance.

1214
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:49,100
This takes not only...

1215
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:52,230
resources, but courage.

1216
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:54,030
This takes...

1217
02:12:54,030 --> 02:12:57,360
not only... government...

1218
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,730
but families.

1219
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:04,420
l've laid out a te-

1220
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:12,090
l have laid out a 10-point plan that -

1221
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,800
l can't do this.

1222
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:35,940
lf there is a war on drugs...

1223
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:40,740
then many of our famiIy members
are the enemy.

1224
02:13:43,450 --> 02:13:48,250
And l don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

1225
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:35,130
National Airport, please.

1226
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:24,050
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

1227
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:27,390
Carl, l'm running late.
l'm coming right over.

1228
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:32,190
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

1229
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:35,400
When were you gonna tell me
about the $3 million...

1230
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:40,200
we got in from San Francisco
two days after l was arrested?

1231
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:44,070
Um... l was waiting
for the right time.

1232
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:47,450
Oh. You didn't think you could
trust my wife with that information?

1233
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:49,580
l didn't want to risk it.

1234
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:52,250
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

1235
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:54,580
You had it all figured out,
didn't you?

1236
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,580
You were gonna move into my house...

1237
02:15:56,590 --> 02:16:00,250
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

1238
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:02,590
with my wife.

1239
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:04,970
Sounds like a nice plan.

1240
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:06,950
Oh, is it insane?

1241
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:09,660
Just think about it, okay?
lf l was gonna rip you off...

1242
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:12,200
why wouldn't l just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

1243
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:15,390
Why would l sit next to you in court
and listen to a dismissal?

1244
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:19,770
Let me ask you something. You think there's
a difference between a reason and an excuse?

1245
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:22,440
'Cause l don't.

1246
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:25,860
- Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl -

1247
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,280
Carl?

1248
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:40,830
Come on, sweetheart. Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1249
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,630
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh -

1250
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:45,970
- He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1251
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:49,070
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1252
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:52,220
<i>- HelIo.{\i}
- lt's a great party.</i>

1253
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:54,640
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, l'm a nobody.

1254
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:57,310
l'm the nobody who arrested you.

1255
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,610
- You're -
- How you doing?

1256
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:02,520
- What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

1257
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,820
You got nice shit.
Drug money buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1258
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:08,280
Listen, you don't want to talk that way
in my house.

1259
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:10,430
Do you know
you're fucking a murderer, Carl?

1260
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:13,240
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1261
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:16,500
- Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1262
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,620
- I'm a cop.
- l don't care.

1263
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:22,560
- Get out.
- Hey! Hey, hey!

1264
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,630
Shit.

1265
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:32,680
- ls that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1266
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:34,690
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

1267
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:37,520
- You got the wrong -
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

1268
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:40,860
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

1269
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:43,190
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1270
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:45,500
- No, no, no, l got it.
- l got it.

1271
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,710
- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

1272
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,350
What do you want to do, man?

1273
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:32,620
<i>On the good days, l feel like l get it.{\i}</i>

1274
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:36,310
Like it all makes sense.

1275
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,040
l can stay in the moment.

1276
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:43,840
l don't have to control
everything in the future...

1277
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,720
and l believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

1278
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:55,220
O...On the bad days...

1279
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:00,490
I just want to grab the phone
and start diaIing numbers.

1280
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:04,770
l want to pull my hair...

1281
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:09,050
and run through
the streets screaming.

1282
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:17,680
But thanks to the people
l've met in these rooms...

1283
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:22,720
like Margaret and Jim...

1284
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:25,180
and Sarah...

1285
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,870
um...

1286
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,130
l'm pretty sure
l'm gonna make it...

1287
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:33,590
through today.

1288
02:19:44,650 --> 02:19:47,750
Would you like to share?

1289
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:52,150
Uh...
my name is Robert...

1290
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:55,360
and my wife Barbara and l...

1291
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:58,560
are here to support
our daughter, Caroline...

1292
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:02,570
and we're hear to listen.
