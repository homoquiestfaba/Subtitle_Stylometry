1
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,872
- OK. Let's do some business.
- Welcome to Washington, Harry.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,356
Ed. I hate this town.
You know my sister's kid, JJ?

3
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,916
- Pleasure to see you...
- Don't give him a speech!

4
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,712
Talk to me. You set up the hotel?

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,391
Everything is in order. Here's some
stuff by that reporter I told you about.

6
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,476
Are you still going to make me
do that interview?

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,276
Look over this <i>New Republic</i> article
he wrote on the EEC.

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,233
He's not some do-gooder
with an axe to grind on my neck, is he?

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,430
You don't want a pushover, Harry.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,429
If Paul gives you the thumbs-up,
it's a big deal in this town.

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,278
Think he knows anything?

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,358
God, no! That's why it's good for you
to meet him up front.

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,233
It shows you have nothing to hide.

14
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,238
Uncle Harry.

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,557
Jesus Christ! Hey!

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,590
- Billie!
- What?

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,792
When a door opens on a plane,
you get out!

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,599
Move it!

19
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,076
They've arrived.

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,912
Welcome to the Willard, Mr Brock.
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

21
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,353
Here he is. Remember, treat him nicely,
don't try to con him. Just be yourself.

22
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,517
- Paul! Good to see you again.
- Hello, Ed. How are you?

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,154
No more hardnosed
investigative stuff, huh?

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,748
Your man doesn't have
a problem with that, does he?

25
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,440
No! You're just
interviewing businessmen now.

26
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,348
You know what they say, Ed.
The business of America is business.

27
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,391
Harry Brock, this is Paul Verrall.

28
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,071
The writer. I know. I liked that thing
you did for the <i>New Republic</i> on the EEC.

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,713
Well...

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,796
Thank you.

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,075
The suite is newly remodelled,
the marble is Italian

32
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,509
and this wonderful glass
comes from the South of France.

33
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,790
We're specially proud
of these atria,

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,151
which give this suite
a lovely, open quality.

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,068
- I hope Mrs Brock is satisfied?
- She's not Mrs Brock.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,270
- That's fine.
- You bet it's fine.

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,710
There's only one Mrs Brock
and she's my mother. And she's dead.

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,716
I'm sorry...

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,637
Listen. Anybody that works in this room,

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,228
tell them to do it good,
do it fast, nobody gets hurt.

41
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,193
I don't like a lot of people around,
and I don't like waiting.

42
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,151
Of course, Mr Brock.

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,874
- Like to save my life?
- With soda or plain water?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,513
- Plain.
- Coming right up.

45
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,632
- Paul, would you like a drink?
- I'm fine, Ed, thanks.

46
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,757
- If there's anything I can do...
- There is.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,713
Go into Billie's room and see
she gets everything she wants.

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,549
She asks for somethin', I'm asking.
What about those white flowers?

49
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,636
The gardenias? All taken care of.

50
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,557
Did you get that other stuff?

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,831
Diet cream soda, the bean dip,
tweezers and cucumber masks?

52
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,509
- All taken care of.
- All right. JJ! Handle him.

53
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,596
Chauncy! Over here.

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,998
Billie!

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,559
What?

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,716
- Well?
- What?

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,116
- Not bad, huh?
- Not bad.

58
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,038
Not bad? You know
what this is costing me a night?

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,196
$6,500, you already told me.

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,676
- So?
- So, I don't like new towns.

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,552
You have to learn
all new channels.

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,274
It took me almost a minute
to find my soap!

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,798
So, what's this gonna be, pal?
A plug or a pan?

64
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,549
I like to know these things. Then I know
how to talk if I know your angle.

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,234
No angle. Just the facts.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,750
A pan. Listen, I gotta do my stairs
and stuff. Are you OK with that?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,638
Sure.

68
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,433
Good! JJ, get a barber up here
for when I get back.

69
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,630
Grab my sweats, we're outta here.

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,119
I'm talking to you cos Ed told me to.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,834
I pay him a couple of hundred grand
a year for advice.

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,791
I'd be a fool not to take it.

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,273
Excuse me, mind if I...?

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,029
Anyway, go ahead.
Give me your best shot.

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,276
How much money have you got?

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,749
- What am I, an accountant?
- You don't know?

77
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,757
Not exactly.

78
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,598
Fifty million?

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,039
Honest to God, I don't know.

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,310
- Ten million?
- Maybe.

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,953
- One million?
- More!

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,311
- How much more?
- How much you got?

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,953
I've saved a little.

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,436
You don't save money, bud,
you make it!

85
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,512
This is the worst time of day, after the
soaps but before <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,552
I have some papers
for you to sign.

87
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,672
What happened to all that stuff
I signed yesterday?

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,593
The back page of each set.
By the Xs.

89
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,349
It seems like I signed
about 10,000 of these.

90
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,029
That's what you get for being
a multiple corporate officer!

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,878
Is that what I am?

92
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,673
No wonder I'm having so much fun.

93
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,798
Is it true you spent 400 million
on your new complex?

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,959
Brock Village.
Finest thing ever built.

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,870
2,000 condos, 175 shops...

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,198
...and two-count 'em-two
golf courses. My masterpiece.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,348
- Did you have to take on a lot of debt?
- You gotta spend it to make it, pal.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,796
Not too vigorous, honey.
I get 'em done every day.

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,990
Just buff 'em up real nice.

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,270
How's the interview going?

101
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,631
Oh, great!
I found out he has parents.

102
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,514
I still don't know
why he came to Washington.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,517
Just a little tax business.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,635
I didn't believe him either.

105
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,036
So far, I've been nice to you.
What are you pumping me for?

106
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,116
That's a reporter's work, Mr Brock.

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,312
Who, what, when, where, how...

108
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,351
...and why.
- Sounds like a law firm to me.

109
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,429
- You know how much I hate lawyers.
- I can vouch for that!

110
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,314
Are you ever afraid
that you're gonna lose all this?

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,795
Never. I want it all too much.

112
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,432
What about things that are
beyond your control, like... fate?

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,316
You show me a businessman
believes in fate,

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,034
I'll show you the first businessman
who ever went broke.

115
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,628
I started with a wagon,
selling somebody's junk.

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,275
And I got here in a silk suit,
talking to a college know-it-all like you.

117
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,473
If I lose it,
I'll meet you right back here in this room,

118
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,194
in a new silk suit.

119
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,197
Why would you lose it all, Mr Brock?

120
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,276
Hey, wait a minute!

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,797
Where do you think
you're going with that?

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,797
- My room.
- Put it back.

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,718
- I just wanted...
- Put it back.

124
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,152
We have a party to go to.

125
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,918
I don't see why I can't...

126
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,032
Because I say you can't, that's why!
Put it back!

127
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,433
Do what I'm tellin' you!

128
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,598
What'll you take to cut his throat,
barber?

129
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,673
Harry, don't get so upset...

130
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,316
Don't tell me what to do.

131
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,119
You don't have to be so formal
around me, Harry!

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,310
- Relax, be yourself.
- Excuse me.

133
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,113
Uncle Harry, we gotta be
at the Duffees' at seven o'clock.

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,595
Is that Alex Duffee,
the Secretary of the Navy?

135
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,598
- JJ, would you get my briefcase?
- Sure, Ed.

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,872
Sorry about the blow-up.
Short fuse.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,911
But I like talking to you.

138
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,315
You make me laugh.

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,317
Finally, a purpose in life.

140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,035
- How about you working for me?
- Harry, I don't think...

141
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,037
Did I ask you?

142
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,436
- Let the man answer.
- What would I do?

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,394
What do you care?
We'll find something for you.

144
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,438
I don't think so, Mr Brock.
Thanks for the offer.

145
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,030
- See you around, pal.
- Sure.

146
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,230
Not a bad guy for an egghead.
Send him a gift, a pen or something.

147
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,436
You pissed at me?

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,516
No.

149
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,956
You don't look right.
Want an aspirin?

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,396
No, Harry, I'm fine.

151
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,069
Considering I've been dead for 12 years,
I feel great.

152
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,318
<i>Now with your abdominals</i>
<i>contracted, buttocks tight,</i>

153
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,512
<i>you're going to be lifting the leg,</i>
<i>starting with the contraction.</i>

154
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,631
<i>Here you go. And... contract.</i>

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,991
<i>And lift it. CP, OK?</i>

156
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,750
<i>CL, contract and lift.</i>
<i>Contract and lift...</i>

157
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,036
Hey!

158
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,438
- Tomorrow, we meet the lobbyists.
- I want congressmen... Billie!

159
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,196
What?

160
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,357
Hurry up. We're going down.
Meet you in the car.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,956
JJ'll wait.

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,876
I can't just phone Congress...

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,151
I leveraged my ass
to build Brock Village.

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,636
If that base closes, I'm looking at
four million square feet of squat

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,035
and I'm signing Chapter Eleven papers.

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,914
Relax. That's the beauty of putting
the companies in Billie's name.

167
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,679
They can't be taken to settle any debts.

168
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,394
Technically, they're not your companies.

169
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,033
If I lose Brock Village, what's to say
I can't lose everything else?

170
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,594
This is your fault! I want names.

171
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,156
- Tomorrow, I've got lunch scheduled...
- Tonight, tonight!

172
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,875
Tonight, you'll see Senator Hedges,
head of Appropriations.

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,070
He's behind in his fundraising
and his race is very tight.

174
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,316
- That's what I wanna hear.
- But Harry...!

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,710
He's not a construction foreman.
The machinations required...

176
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,594
Don't Harvard talk me. I didn't make
my money by being an idiot.

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,948
Where the hell's Billie?

178
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,036
Calm yourself, I'm here.

179
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,869
- Does she look OK to you?
- What's the matter with how I look?

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,956
- That's what I wanna know.
- What do you know?

181
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,116
You open beer cans with your teeth!

182
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,071
- You look beautiful, Billie.
- Thank you, Ed.

183
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,509
Are you sure?
I don't wanna start off on no left foot.

184
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,077
- I'm sure, I'm sure.
- That's OK. That's beautiful!

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,436
JJ, you stay here.

186
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,474
- Good evening, Alex!
- Hi, Ed. How are you?

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,388
- May I introduce my friend...
- Harry Brock, nice to meet you.

188
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,272
And Miss Billie Dawn.

189
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,313
What a beautiful name!
This is my wife, Beatrice.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,668
Hello, how are you?

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,597
Charmed!

192
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,073
Hi, nice to meet you.

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,838
Hello, Bea.

194
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,190
Senator Dorn and his wife Lilly...

195
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,108
Senator, Harry Brock,
pleasure to meet you. Hi.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,231
And Senator and Mrs Hedges.

197
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,794
Senator, good to see you.

198
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,751
Billie, this is Senator Hedges.

199
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,030
Yeah, that's what he said.

200
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,233
- What brings you to town?
- Sightseeing, taking it easy.

201
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,635
Oh, that'll be the day!

202
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,710
I'm a little dry.
Care to join me for a drink?

203
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,479
Excuse us, ladies. Alex.

204
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,638
- It's so screwed up I can't do...
- Mr Brock! Good to see you again.

205
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,513
What a coincidence, hey, Sherlock?

206
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,076
- How's it going?
- I'm off duty. My meter ain't running.

207
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,714
- Billie's here from Chicago.
- Really?

208
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,308
I got my doctorate from
the University of Chicago.

209
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,876
I just interviewed your mayor.
I have a radio show.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,150
What are you planning to see
while you're here?

211
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,554
I don't really know.

212
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,070
Since I've never been here before,
I don't know what there is to see.

213
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,668
What kinds of things are you interested in?

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,196
- Maybe something with the Kennedys.
- You could go to the Kennedy Center.

215
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,953
No, I'd like to see their house, go
on one of them tours, like Graceland.

216
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,914
You learn a lot about a person
when you see their home.

217
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,589
Did you know
that Elvis had over 40 TVs?

218
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,836
I mean, when I saw that,

219
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,838
I knew that Elvis must have been
a really lonely man.

220
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,838
They say it on the tour,
about the 40 TVs,

221
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,635
like it was a big thing,
like you should be jealous of Elvis.

222
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,752
But it just made me really sad.

223
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,757
Everybody in the world
worshipped Elvis,

224
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,634
and it was like he couldn't be
in a room alone. You know?

225
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,991
- I mean, that's sad, don't you think?
- Well...

226
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,792
Kennedy lived in the White House.

227
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,436
Oh, yeah, well, that would be great
if I could see right in there.

228
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,358
If you do decide to take a tour,
my husband can help.

229
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,439
- He's the Under-Secretary of Commerce.
- Is that like a receptionist?

230
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,679
Isn't a receptionist
under a secretary?

231
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,270
Well, he certainly feels that way
sometimes!

232
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,516
I think I need to freshen this up.
Is everyone else all right?

233
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,153
I could use another one.

234
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,590
- What about you, Billie?
- No, thank you.

235
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,680
Something I said was wrong, wasn't it?

236
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,756
It's no big deal.

237
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,988
Mind if I ask you something?

238
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,076
Sure.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,668
Is there something wrong
with my earrings or something,

240
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,792
because everybody
keeps staring at 'em.

241
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,797
Oh, I don't know.

242
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,753
Maybe they're a little... big.

243
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,192
I thought big
was the whole idea with jewels.

244
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,279
You don't need to wear jewels.
You're pretty enough.

245
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,996
Oh, sweet talk.
It's my favourite!

246
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,438
That's what the IMF is for!

247
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,437
No, this is NATO's responsibility.

248
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,836
NATO's not a factor any more.
The UN is the answer.

249
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,032
If there's trouble,
and there's going to be trouble,

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,233
UN troops should jump in and keep peace,
so those markets can grow.

251
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,670
It's incredible!
She's got boyfriends...

252
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,234
And what d'you think, Miss Dawn?

253
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,515
What is our responsibility
now that the Eastern Bloc has collapsed?

254
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,791
I don't know.
How many people were hurt?

255
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,797
What do you mean?

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,471
When the block collapsed, were people
hurt or was it just property damaged?

257
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,510
We're talking about
the Eastern Bloc in Europe.

258
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,395
I don't think we should worry about them.

259
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,272
We got enough problems
with our own streets

260
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,755
before we start fixing the ones in Europe.

261
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,118
Geeks!

262
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,674
- What?
- I said they're geeks!

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,917
- Who the hell are you to say?
- Billie Dawn, that's who.

264
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,190
Nobody asked ya, so shut up!

265
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,949
Pardon me if I'm taking up
too much space on your planet!

266
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,559
- Hello, JJ.
- Hey, Ed.

267
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,958
- Harry, could we go over a few things?
- Take her upstairs.

268
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,036
Take me upstairs.

269
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,438
So, you having fun?

270
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,437
No. Are you?

271
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,030
No. Seems like
we've been gone a month already.

272
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,071
Tell me about it!

273
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,995
Billie is a liability. She doesn't know
what people are talking about.

274
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,872
People don't talk to Billie
to know things.

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,753
She makes them forget about
all the crap in the world.

276
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,269
Every time she opens her mouth,
she says something stupid.

277
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,312
That's going to make her stand out
in Washington!

278
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,358
People were laughing at her.

279
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,836
- Oh... They were?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,437
Well, they got to know her like I do.

281
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,278
There's no reason for her to be here.

282
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,472
How about she owns more of me
than I do? One of your bright ideas!

283
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,512
It is a good idea.
Luckily, she doesn't know about it.

284
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,949
Any papers she needs to sign,
I can send to her at home.

285
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,198
No! No! OK?
There's another reason.

286
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,876
I'm crazy about her, OK?

287
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,759
I'm crazy when she's not around.

288
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,234
I know what you mean
about those people being geeks.

289
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,118
They sure know
how to be stuffy, don't they?

290
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,028
I know you weren't so hot
to come on this trip, so...

291
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,032
Thanks, Harry.

292
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,639
Yeah.

293
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,237
Harry?

294
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,592
You know how when somebody dies,
it's OK to feel sad,

295
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,918
but then at other times, when you're
supposed to be happy and you feel sad,

296
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,033
it's worse than the times when
you're allowed to be sad?

297
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,431
What the hell are you talking about?

298
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,075
Never mind.

299
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,038
Hey! I know where there's this club.

300
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,400
Let's go show these geeks
how to dance!

301
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,273
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

302
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,152
Now?

303
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,516
<i>Come out here on the floor</i>

304
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,316
<i>Let's rock some more</i>

305
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,316
<i>Come out here on the floor</i>

306
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,273
<i>Honey, let's rock some more, yeah!</i>

307
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,158
<i>Now when you get out here</i>

308
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,793
<i>Don't you have no fear</i>

309
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,832
<i>Put your hands on your hip</i>
<i>And let your backbone slip</i>

310
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,916
<i>And work out!</i>

311
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,156
<i>Ohh, my momma, move up</i>

312
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,956
<i>Party move back</i>

313
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,316
<i>Shuffle to the left</i>

314
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,436
<i>Wobble to the right</i>

315
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,558
<i>Now it's plain to see</i>

316
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,238
<i>You put a hurtin' on me</i>

317
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,998
<i>But it's a natural fact</i>

318
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,348
<i>I like it like that</i>

319
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,357
<i>So work out!</i>

320
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,436
<i>Yeah, baby work out!</i>

321
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,036
<i>Baby, work out!</i>

322
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,988
<i>Shout and turn the joint out!</i>

323
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,192
<i>Work out, work out</i>

324
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,276
<i>Work all night long...</i>

325
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,676
Hello?

326
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,472
<i>Billie Dawn, please.</i>

327
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,953
This is Billie.

328
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,833
<i>Marvellous! Cynthia Schreiber here.</i>

329
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,269
<i>We met last night at Duffees' sock</i>- <i>hop?</i>

330
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,631
And I do a show for NPR. You know NPR?

331
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,479
They're the gun people, right?

332
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,152
During fundraising, they are! But usually
they're just National Public Radio.

333
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,590
Anyway...
I'd like you to be on my show.

334
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,033
- Me, on the radio? Are you kidding?
- <i>Of course not. I know this is last</i>- <i>minute,</i>

335
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,754
but my little dream
is that you'd come at around eleven.

336
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,352
Well... I mean, I don't know nothing
about Washington, or nothing.

337
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,038
I don't know if Harry would like that.

338
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,154
- You could promote what he's doing in DC.
- I could tell about Brock Village?

339
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,679
<i>Absolutely.</i>

340
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,155
OK.

341
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,952
<i>Great!</i>

342
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,799
- Yeah?
- <i>Mr Devery, it's JJ.</i>

343
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,990
Harry, it's for you.

344
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,475
- Brock.
- <i>Hello, Uncle Harry?</i>

345
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,115
It's JJ. Get a radio. Billie's on!

346
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,674
- <i>She's on 89.3</i>
- Why? What'd she do?

347
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,597
She's being interviewed.

348
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,597
Holy Christ!

349
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,676
Turn the radio on, 89.3.

350
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,993
<i>Now, you are here as the companion</i>
<i>of multi</i>- <i>millionaire Harry Brock.</i>

351
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,871
<i>How did you two meet?</i>

352
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,120
- In Las Vegas. I was in a show.
- So, you dance and sing?

353
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,949
Yeah, I wasn't only in the chorus,
I was a thespian.

354
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,471
<i>I had lines. Five, to be exact.</i>
<i>Do you wanna hear them?</i>

355
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,510
No!

356
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,757
- Abs... yes. Of course.
- OK, here goes.

357
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,757
Yes, I am.

358
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,519
He was here, but he's not here now.

359
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,437
<i>Oh, just a friend.</i>

360
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,757
<i>I never drink with men I don't know.</i>

361
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,836
Beat it, buster!

362
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,432
I coulda been a star
if I woulda stuck with it.

363
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,949
But Harry didn't like me being in shows.

364
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,275
He likes to go to bed early.

365
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,960
<i>Does Mr Brock do a lot of business</i>
<i>in Las Vegas?</i>

366
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,914
<i>What business?</i>
<i>He came to gamble and meet girls!</i>

367
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,794
He doesn't do that any more.
Now, he just works.

368
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,797
And works and works.

369
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,879
What is Mr Brock doing in Washington?
Is he a strong party man?

370
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,755
Is he! He can throw down a drink
faster than you can unzip your pants.

371
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,032
<i>Boy, can he dance!</i>
<i>We won a limbo contest.</i>

372
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,832
<i>And we got a medal.</i>

373
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,030
She remembered the medal!

374
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,195
<i>You wanna see it?</i>

375
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,793
Yes.

376
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,071
OK. See?

377
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,556
And... looks like first prize.

378
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,436
It has been said
that the love of wealth

379
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,596
is at the heart of all Americans.

380
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,916
Do you think that's true?

381
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,719
- I don't know. Who said it?
- Tocqueville.

382
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,671
He wrote <i>Democracy In America,</i>

383
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,759
possibly one of the most perceptive books
ever written about our system.

384
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,236
It's a book?
No wonder I never heard of it.

385
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,995
In future, I think it would be best to
limit Billie's exposure to the media,

386
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,350
given her limited understanding of...

387
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,436
well, everything.

388
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
Couldn't we do something?
Smarten her up a bit?

389
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,589
She didn't know how to play gin rummy
till I taught her.

390
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,358
Now she beats my brains out.

391
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,675
Isn't there some kinda school?

392
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,951
A long time would pass
before school had an impact on Billie.

393
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,196
I think we should send her back.

394
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,199
All she needs is someone to pound
some smarts into her, one on one.

395
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,719
I got an idea.

396
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,310
The four most terrifying words
in the English language.

397
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,435
- Ed tells me you teach at Georgetown.
- That's right.

398
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,629
How much you make?

399
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,910
- What am I, an accountant?

400
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,076
I love this guy!

401
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,272
Listen, Paulie, the reason I ask...
I got this friend.

402
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,231
Maybe you've seen her - Billie?

403
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,112
Billie. Right.

404
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,516
She's a nice kid,
but she's a little on the stupid side.

405
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,712
Not her fault. I found her in Vegas
and for Vegas, she's smart enough.

406
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,717
But Washington?

407
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,956
I'm just scared
she's going to be unhappy.

408
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,435
She's not used to these kind of people.

409
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,677
I figure maybe you could help her.
And me. You know what I mean?

410
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,631
No, I don't.

411
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,709
Show her the ropes, the low-down,
explain to her what goes on.

412
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,636
Really mean a lot to me.

413
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,149
I'd give you 200 bucks a day.

414
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,469
I'm sorry, Harry,
but that's not what I do.

415
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,477
350.

416
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,637
No. You see, money isn't the issue.

417
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,990
- I told you, Harry.
- Shut up!

418
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,270
500.

419
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,598
- OK, I'll do it.
- You see?

420
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,953
As soon as he said money wasn't
the issue, I had him. I love this guy!

421
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,995
You know, Billie, we're in the big time
now. This ain't Chicago.

422
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,680
You're telling me!

423
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,591
You gotta be very careful
of everything you do.

424
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,990
You understand my meaning?

425
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,316
Yeah.

426
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,914
Gin.

427
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,677
Twenty-eight.

428
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,028
Twenty-ei...?

429
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,116
Twenty-eight!

430
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,114
<i>This old man, he played two</i>
<i>He played knick</i>- <i>knack on my shoe</i>

431
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,356
<i>With a knick</i>- <i>knack paddywhack</i>
<i>Give a dog a bone</i>

432
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,199
<i>This old man came rolling home</i>

433
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,234
Do you mind?

434
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,316
No.

435
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,476
Gin.

436
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,196
See?

437
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,196
Thirty-four.

438
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,316
Thirty-four?

439
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,670
Thirty-four! Three, four!

440
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,996
So, anyway, I met a guy.
He's got a lotta time on his hands.

441
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Since he knows this city pretty good,

442
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,633
it might be nice for you
to have someone to do things with.

443
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,274
- What's going on?
- Nothin'!

444
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,275
It's just... he's a smart guy.

445
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,949
It wouldn't hurt you
to learn... some things.

446
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,154
Since when have you been interested
in my brain?

447
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,714
Since you started exposing it
on the radio!

448
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,434
What did I do? I was trying to help you.

449
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,437
Honey, it's not your fault.

450
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,511
People don't know you like I do.

451
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,316
You just...

452
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,479
You could use a little education
yourself, if you ask me.

453
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,750
- Who asked ya?
- Nobody.

454
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,757
So shut up.

455
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,037
Hold on a second. That will be...
225 dollars and ten cents.

456
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,357
- I gotta get the door.
- You always make me pay.

457
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,356
Ten cents.

458
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,751
- Sore loser!
- I'll get it.

459
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,919
- Now, you be nice to him.
- That's him at the door?

460
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't want some stuffy old tutor!

461
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,713
- Be nice to him or I'll crack you one.
- It's a free country.

462
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,796
That's what you think!

463
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,316
This is Paul Verrall.

464
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,075
Very pleased to have you here.

465
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,997
I got some business to take care of,

466
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,588
so why don't you two
go someplace nice and talk?

467
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,713
- You wouldn't mind, would you?
- No way, I would love to.

468
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,552
Thanks.

469
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,558
So, what are you?
Some kind of gigolo?

470
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,194
No, I just...

471
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,199
- Well, Harry wants me to...
- He wants you to smarten me up?

472
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,638
No, I'm sure you're...
I think he just wants me to...

473
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,955
Smarten me up.

474
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,036
Yeah.

475
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,836
So, what's he paying you?

476
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,156
Five hundred bucks a day.

477
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,510
Sucker.
You coulda gotten twice that.

478
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,756
He's got a lot of it, you know.

479
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,229
I'd have done it for nothing.

480
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,353
Even if I am stupid,
it hasn't hurt me none.

481
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,278
- What do you mean?
- I've got everything that I want.

482
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,549
I got lots of jewels, big like I like.

483
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,238
Mink coat.

484
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,920
A TV that fits in my purse.

485
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,110
I want something, I ask for it.

486
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,832
If he don't give me what I want,

487
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,919
I don't give him what he wants.
If you get my drift?

488
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,071
And you're happy with this setup?

489
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,510
So long as I know how to get what I want,
that's all I want to know.

490
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,312
Makes sense.

491
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,512
So long as you know
what it is you want.

492
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,517
Exactly.

493
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,789
What?

494
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,673
Well, I mean, if you don't know a lot,

495
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,392
how do you know that a mink coat
is the best thing to have?

496
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,592
Because I used to have
a rabbit coat.

497
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,035
I love this song.

498
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,037
Let's dance.

499
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,549
Oh, I don't... I can't dance.

500
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,513
I can.
Harry and me won a medal once.

501
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,473
Well, this isn't a dancing place.

502
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,716
It is if you're dancing. Come on.

503
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,196
<i>We'll start with the ABC of it</i>

504
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,910
<i>Then we'll roll down</i>
<i>to the XYZ of it</i>

505
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,996
Relax.

506
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,233
<i>Help me solve the mystery of it...</i>

507
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,033
OK, so, we should make a list
of things you would like to do and...

508
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,876
...and, er...

509
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,388
<i>And if a shooting star rolls by</i>

510
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,230
<i>I'll use that star to write "I love you"</i>

511
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,235
<i>A thousand times, across the sky</i>

512
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,558
<i>One thing isn't very clear, my love</i>

513
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,949
<i>Should the teacher</i>
<i>stand so near, my love?</i>

514
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,589
<i>Graduation's almost here, my love</i>

515
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,279
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, teach me tonight</i>

516
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,118
Maybe I could teach you something.

517
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,915
<i>... a blackboard high above you</i>

518
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,559
<i>And if an astronaut zooms by</i>

519
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,310
<i>I'll reach and grab him real fast</i>

520
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,795
<i>Then write "I love you"...</i>

521
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,917
Well, OK...

522
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,395
Good night, Miss Dawn.

523
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,954
And... thanks! That was fun.

524
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,438
Aren't you gonna
escort me to my room?

525
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,630
- Yeah... Sure, of course.
- You can call me Billie.

526
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,716
Billie.

527
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,670
It's funny, you don't look like a Billie.

528
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,711
No?

529
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,796
Do I look like an Emma?

530
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,395
- Emma?
- Yeah. That's my real name.

531
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,476
I took Billie for Vegas.

532
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,189
No. You don't look like...

533
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,834
I mean, you don't look like an Emma either!

534
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,278
What do I look like?

535
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,197
To me?

536
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,356
Yeah, to you.

537
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,033
Like an angel.

538
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,156
Sweet talk, again!

539
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,676
Well...

540
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,197
OK! Good night, Billie.

541
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,553
Paul, are you a talker or would you
be interested in a little action?

542
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,229
- Excuse me?
- I got the hots for you right off.

543
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,432
Well... do you get many?

544
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,637
Now and then.

545
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,117
- What do you do about them?
- Stick around and you'll find out!

546
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,998
What about...?

547
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,272
Don't worry about him.
He's too busy being a big man.

548
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,115
This isn't what I expected!

549
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,869
We're just teaching each other
what we know.

550
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,949
Yes, well, about that...

551
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,632
Just read these papers and circle
anything you don't understand.

552
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,637
I don't know about that.

553
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,399
My eyes are kind of weak.

554
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,112
Really?
Well, maybe you oughta try some glasses.

555
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,196
And look like a geek?

556
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,116
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,596
Th-that's OK.

558
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,673
Course, they're not so bad on men.

559
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,037
No?

560
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,588
How're you guys making out?

561
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,915
Oh, fine.

562
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,918
Paul just... taught me a little French!

563
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,679
Is that right, pal? What's the matter?

564
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,076
Was she rude to you?
She's got a mouth on her.

565
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,156
Yes, I know that!

566
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,750
Well, I'm gonna say good night.
Good night!

567
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,156
Wait a minute, buddy.

568
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,190
What's the matter with you?

569
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,596
Where's your manners?
Say thank you to the guy.

570
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,676
Oh... yeah.

571
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,756
<i>Au revoir.</i>

572
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,679
Good night, Billie.

573
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,756
Night.

574
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,040
That guy could do you a lotta good.

575
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,315
I agree.

576
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,068
How'd you know it was me?

577
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,111
Lucky guess.

578
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,119
- Hi. Are you having lunch?
- Just a cappuccino, thanks.

579
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,155
This is ridiculous. It looks like
the paper has the chicken pox.

580
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,716
It would have been easier if you'd told me
to circle things I knew.

581
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,798
I'm never gonna be able
to talk to anybody in this town.

582
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,832
I brought something along
that may help you.

583
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,316
Somebody who's really smart
and looks just like me?

584
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,758
You want to be able to talk to people
in this town?

585
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,998
In Washington, everybody says
exactly the same things at every party.

586
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,076
You just have to know
the right responses.

587
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,954
If you learn these eight sentences,
you'll be a hit at every party.

588
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,752
- You're kidding me!
- Nope.

589
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,032
Those eight sentences cover just about
everything anybody talks about.

590
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,479
It's the Washington art

591
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,229
of sounding like you know what you're
talking about when you don't know zip.

592
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,193
- Go ahead. Read the first.
- OK.

593
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,275
"Here's what I'd like to know; who
elected the Washington Post president?"

594
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,995
That one applies
about 80 per cent of the time.

595
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,953
Number two. "We can't be
the policemen of the world,

596
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,471
but until we get another cop on the
block, we have to support our friends."

597
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,433
That one comes up a lot.
Number three.

598
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,472
"Being a superpower has a price."

599
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,956
Use that with number two
and number four. Read number four.

600
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,718
"It's still a dangerous world."

601
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,150
I'm just gonna say these things
and I'm gonna be a hit?

602
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,034
Yeah, but you have to say them
at the right time.

603
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,991
Read number five.

604
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,510
"That's about as likely
as a Democrat being elected president."

605
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,393
That one shows
you have a sense of humour.

606
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,317
That was funny?

607
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,477
Number six.

608
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,956
"It makes you wonder if a par...
parli..."

609
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,957
Parliamentary.

610
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,232
"...system isn't better."
Yeah, the whole thing makes me wonder!

611
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,237
Number seven.

612
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,558
"I don't think Abe Lincoln himself
would know what to do about that."

613
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,319
You say that one
when you don't know what to say.

614
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,398
Oh, good! Then I'll just say that one.

615
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,470
Number eight is when you're trapped
and you want to shut someone up.

616
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,436
"If only the UN would take out the
Verner Amendment to Resolution 165,

617
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,836
we'd have the power
to do what needs to be done."

618
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,310
I don't understand one word of that.

619
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,237
No-one will.
There is no Verner Amendment.

620
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,272
But the only time anyone in Washington
admits they don't know something

621
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,630
is when they're being indicted.

622
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,638
But how am I going to know
when to say which one?

623
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,479
We'll work out a code. OK?

624
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,158
Try not to talk to anyone. This guy's
only been working on you for a day.

625
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,272
She can talk to anybody, Harry,
and make you proud.

626
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,799
It's working backwards!

627
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,435
Instead of making her smart,
she's making you stupid.

628
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,998
Good evening.

629
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,193
The Middle East is a money drain!
Lt'll always be the same.

630
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,470
We ought to spend that money at home.

631
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,477
So just ignore the region?

632
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,400
Miss Dawn, is there a chance
for peace in the Middle East?

633
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,837
The chances are as good as getting
a Democrat back in the White House.

634
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,311
After all the problems
the President's had recently,

635
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,476
he doesn't have much clout anyway.

636
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,670
It makes you wonder
if a parliamentary system isn't better.

637
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,110
But I think we should keep a strong
presence over there, don't you?

638
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,238
Well, here's what I have to say.

639
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,874
Who elected the <i>Washington Post</i>
king of the universe?

640
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,438
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

641
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,154
Do you think we should keep
an active presence over there?

642
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,953
Forgive me! I thought you said...

643
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,514
Anyway, active presence, yeah...

644
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,868
Well...

645
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,754
I know we can't be
the policemen of the world,

646
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,590
but until we get another cop, we have
an obligation to support our friends.

647
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,077
After all,
being a superpower has its price.

648
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,474
She's right.

649
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,435
It's still a dangerous world.

650
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,313
But what about the Palestinians?

651
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,116
- Yes, what about the Palestinians?
- Yeah, what about the Palestinians?

652
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,751
I don't think even Abe Lincoln himself
could solve that one.

653
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,998
- But let's say you're president.
- Yeah, let's say you was president.

654
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,997
What would you do?

655
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:25,274
It's simple. If the UN would remove the
Verner Amendment from Resolution 165,

656
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,994
we'd have the authority
to do what needs to be done.

657
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,189
Can I get anyone anything?

658
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,754
I'd love a drink.

659
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,277
Excuse us.

660
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,118
Isn't she terrific?

661
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,958
Hell, I'm knocked out.

662
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,038
- She's right about the Verner Amendment.
- Absolutely.

663
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,596
Is it the economy of the state
that worries you, Harry, or your own?

664
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,349
Both. If I go under,
I take a lot of people with me.

665
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,675
Harry, I'm getting tired.

666
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,677
I got business.

667
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,189
Do me a favour, pal, take her home?

668
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,276
With pleasure.

669
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,755
You did a helluva job.

670
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,440
No kiddin', pal. A helluva job.

671
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,757
Senator, we cannot do a thing until
the UN removes the Verner Amendment.

672
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,952
- Yeah, 165!
- Without question.

673
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,957
You were great!

674
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,036
Everybody loved you.

675
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,676
What's the matter?
Don't you think you were great?

676
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,633
Oh, yeah, we really tricked 'em,
didn't we?

677
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,638
What do you mean?

678
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,311
If you saw a good ventriloquist, who
would you compliment? The dummy?

679
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,678
You're not a dummy.

680
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,360
Harry's right.
You're the one who did it.

681
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,590
I still don't know anything,
only now nobody can tell.

682
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,479
But Paul, there was one time,
right in the middle,

683
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,637
when I was saying something
and everybody was looking at me,

684
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,479
like I knew what I was talking about!

685
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,516
And I liked it so much!

686
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,119
Did you teach me to cheat
cos you think I can't learn?

687
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,352
Oh, God, Billie, no!

688
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,473
I... I just didn't think
you were so serious about it.

689
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,034
I'm kind of surprised myself.

690
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,716
I've been thinking a lot
about something my dad used to say.

691
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,197
"Without knowledge,
you are less than everybody."

692
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,197
And I don't want to be less.

693
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,039
I don't want be better than anybody
neither,

694
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,390
and I don't want to go above myself.

695
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,476
I just want...

696
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,840
I want to not be less.

697
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,351
Well, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

698
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,833
Cos you're already
more than most people.

699
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,358
Well, here we are.

700
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,313
See you tomorrow?

701
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,113
So, how are we gonna smarten me up?

702
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,474
Well, we aren't gonna do it.

703
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,910
You're gonna do it.
It's your battle.

704
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,876
It's up to you.

705
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,557
Good night.

706
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,636
G'night.

707
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,190
What are you reading?

708
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,039
<i>Democracy In America</i> by...

709
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,192
...Pocahontas.

710
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,076
Yeah, she's good.

711
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,830
What's anachronistic?

712
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,238
Dictionary.

713
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,316
It's a dictionary?

714
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,950
No, look it up... in the dictionary.

715
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,670
Jeez, that's a book?

716
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,837
It's bigger than my first apartment.

717
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,832
Billie, what are you doing?

718
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,111
I don't like this!
I don't like this at all!

719
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,708
Every word in there, I don't understand!

720
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,308
I had to go to the dictionary
so many times,

721
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,829
people must have thought I was foreign!

722
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,350
This whole thing is making me
feel dumber, not smarter!

723
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,438
I've been reading this for a week
and I'm on page 13!

724
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,152
Well, that's not so bad.

725
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,033
Not if the book's 14 pages, it's not!

726
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,598
It's not supposed to go fast,
it's supposed to make you think.

727
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,475
Yeah, it makes you think how great
it would be to sit around and watch TV!

728
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,273
I don't want to do this any more. I quit!

729
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,277
Billie! Wait a minute.

730
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,757
Being smart isn't just about books.
It's about asking questions.

731
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,350
It's about finding out
why things are the way they are.

732
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,755
Don't stop reading.

733
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,077
But you picked
a kind of a big book to begin with.

734
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,192
How about starting with
something a little smaller?

735
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,794
Like what? A fortune cookie?

736
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,557
- This just came for you.
- Thanks.

737
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,753
<i>Did you say</i>
<i>I've got a lot to learn?</i>

738
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,435
<i>But don't think</i>
<i>I'm trying not to learn</i>

739
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,597
<i>Since this is</i>
<i>a perfect spot to learn</i>

740
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,436
<i>Come on, teach me tonight</i>

741
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,070
<i>Starting with the ABC of it</i>

742
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,909
<i>Right down to the XYZ of it</i>

743
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,989
<i>Help me solve</i>
<i>the mystery of it, yeah</i>

744
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,270
<i>I wanna be taught tonight</i>

745
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,717
<i>The cold sky's a blackboard</i>

746
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,353
<i>High above me</i>

747
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,075
<i>If a shooting star goes by</i>

748
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,829
<i>I'll use that star</i>
<i>To write "I love you"</i>

749
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,631
<i>A thousand times across the sky...</i>

750
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,753
Hi.

751
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,154
Still trying to read this book?

752
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,836
What?

753
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,190
<i>... Come on, teach me tonight</i>

754
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,520
<i>My baby, baby, baby, yeah</i>

755
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,712
<i>Come on, teach me tonight, yeah</i>

756
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,478
<i>I want to learn</i>

757
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,592
<i>Teach me, hey</i>
<i>Teach me</i>

758
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,435
<i>Teach me, teach me, teach me...</i>

759
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,708
Hello, JJ.
Billie called me. Is she here?

760
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,193
Yeah, she is.

761
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,716
- You want to let her know I'm here?
- Yeah.

762
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,479
I don't see the problem.

763
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,036
There are competing
economic considerations...

764
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,032
Boys, don't jerk me around.

765
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,994
If you're gonna help me out,
I need to know and I need to know now.

766
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,157
Harry's blunt about it,
but a lot is riding on this.

767
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,998
He's the principal employer in the area.

768
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,680
- Sorry, I was looking for Billie.
- She's not...

769
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,112
Senator Hedges, hi! Paul Verrall.
I interviewed you.

770
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,196
- I loved what you did.
- Thanks.

771
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,437
Here she is. I think you two
would be more comfortable...

772
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,393
Billie,
would you make this poor man a drink?

773
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,670
Nice to see you again, Paul.

774
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,438
Nice to see you, gentlemen.

775
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,835
Good to see you again.

776
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,155
- Harry.
- Hey, kid.

777
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,990
- What did he mean, he interviewed you?
- He's a reporter.

778
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,872
He's doing a puff piece on Harry.

779
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,878
Not now he's seen him
alone in a room with all of us.

780
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,150
Thanks for coming so quick.

781
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,031
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

782
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,516
Billie, Harry's got six senators in there.

783
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,631
So? He's had 'em before.

784
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,354
Senators don't usually make house calls.

785
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,393
Harry gets people to do things
they don't usually do.

786
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,272
Want to know the trick I came up with

787
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,960
to remember the amendments
to the Constitution?

788
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,958
- Billie?
- What?

789
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,753
You've worked really hard
to make yourself smart.

790
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,678
But?

791
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,554
A smart person
knows who she's living with.

792
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,596
Gentlemen, I really don't want you
to worry about this...

793
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,996
That's beautiful.

794
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,429
OK.

795
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,869
I think you'll enjoy <i>David Copperfield.</i>

796
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,309
Anything by Dickens is wonderful.

797
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,396
What is this crap?

798
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,950
It's Haydn, Op. 111.

799
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,755
- It's a classical piece, Harry.
- Classic piece of shit if you ask me.

800
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,029
I like it.

801
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,116
It's good before bed.

802
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,953
So, the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution

803
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,753
says that you can't testify
against yourself.

804
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,475
How would that even work?
It seems physically impossible.

805
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:12,038
- You're teaching her about the Fifth?
- Well, the Constitution. I thought...

806
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,435
It's not your job to think.
Get her to think.

807
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,358
- Harry!
- It's OK, Billie.

808
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,471
First of all, she knows how to think.

809
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,079
And second, she...

810
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,510
I need her so she can talk at parties,
not pass some ancient history test.

811
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,519
You think the Constitution
is ancient history?

812
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,950
- Work on her, not me.
- No extra charge.

813
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,832
I don't need nothing you could tell me.

814
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,111
- There's a lot he could tell you.
- I'll bet!

815
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,152
Who's Tom Paine, for instance?

816
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,159
What do I care? If he's not buying
from me, why should I care?

817
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,431
You're so smart,
who's Dave Righetti?

818
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,235
Left-handed pitcher for the Giants,

819
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,318
pitched a no-hitter for the Yanks in '83.

820
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,193
So what are you, some kind of genius?

821
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,832
- No.
- I fire geniuses every day.

822
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,631
- Clearly.
- The more I see you, the less I like you.

823
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,638
Is that the way you talk
to your senator friends, too, Harry?

824
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,552
I'm gonna tell you this once.

825
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,951
Don't push your luck.
Stay out of my business.

826
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,071
Keep your eye on
what I pay you to keep it on,

827
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,758
or I'll tear it out of your head.

828
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,635
I got to go, Billie.

829
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,628
Just remember, four-eyes.

830
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,069
Any time I want,
I can knock your block off.

831
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,997
See you later, Billie.

832
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,076
Bye.

833
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,828
- Ed said not to forget these.
- That guy's starting to bug me.

834
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,112
Here, doll, sign these papers.

835
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,312
What exactly are you doing
in Washington, Harry?

836
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,989
Telling you to sign those papers,
and you're going to sign them.

837
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,271
I don't want to do anything
that's against the law.

838
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,356
I am the law.

839
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,239
It seems to me by signing these,
it makes me some kind of a partner.

840
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,237
A silent partner.

841
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,430
- So?
- So shut up!

842
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,596
You know what your problem is, Harry?

843
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,756
You're not just rude, you're...

844
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,916
...flagrant about it.

845
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,196
You've been reading de Tocqueville.

846
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,517
Well, yeah!
After we talked on your show,

847
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,030
I figured it was pretty bad that
I hadn't read such an important book.

848
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,832
So I read it.

849
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,314
What was your favourite part?

850
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,116
Well, I'm not sure it's a book
where you can have a favourite part.

851
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,992
Yes, you can. I did.

852
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,553
I liked when he said,

853
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,549
"What is not yet done is only what
we have not yet attempted to do."

854
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,557
It made me feel good.

855
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,591
So, what part did you like?

856
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,914
- May I be honest?
- Yeah.

857
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,758
I haven't read it.

858
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,197
But you said it was the one book
on democracy worth reading.

859
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,833
That's what everybody says.

860
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,954
That's all anybody knows
about de Tocqueville. Except you.

861
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,153
Well, it's not so bad
once you stop falling asleep.

862
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,670
Hi! I couldn't wait
to see how it went.

863
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,677
So, she's stupid.

864
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,156
Well, all I mean is,
I didn't feel stupid myself.

865
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,236
She hadn't never read the book.

866
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,237
- You're kidding!
- No.

867
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,318
People always pretend
to be smarter than they are.

868
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,317
I don't.

869
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,398
I know, Billie.
You're an honest one.

870
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,274
When I just said, "She hadn't
never read it," that wasn't right.

871
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,391
It was a double negative but...

872
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,478
Come on! You told me you'd tell me
when I made a mistake.

873
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,513
A person who reads de Tocqueville should
know not to do no double negatives.

874
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,995
Yes, ma'am!

875
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,320
Smells good in here, doesn't it?

876
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,988
If I'd known art smelled this good,
I would have come a long time ago!

877
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,996
God, it's so small but it's like
it's bigger than the whole room.

878
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,509
Van Gogh painted this
near the end of his life.

879
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,238
What a shame that he was never
recognised while he was still living.

880
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,316
Don't you think?

881
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,549
My mother died
when I was little and...

882
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,639
...my dad raised me and my brothers.

883
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,714
And he loved us so much, but...

884
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,310
I never knew a world like that.

885
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,877
Why didn't you ever kiss me again?

886
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,597
Well, it's complicated.

887
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,396
What's complicated? Either you kiss me
or you don't, and you didn't.

888
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,476
Billie, I'm working for Harry.

889
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,956
And I'm writing a story about him,
and you're living with him.

890
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,117
Then why did you kiss me the first time?

891
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,676
I made a mistake.

892
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,436
Gee, sorry.

893
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,550
Billie. Billie, it's not about you.

894
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,636
It's about ethics.

895
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,029
If I get involved with you,
I'm no different than Harry.

896
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,994
I don't want to use you like Harry
uses senators to get what he wants.

897
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,429
You're crazy about me, aren't you?

898
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,436
Yes.

899
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,393
That's why you get so mad at Harry.

900
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,874
I don't hate Harry.

901
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,199
I hate his kind of life.
What he does, what he stands for.

902
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,074
He's never thought about
anybody else in the world but himself.

903
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,077
Who does?

904
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,998
Oh, God, Billie, millions of people do.

905
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,917
The whole damn history of the world

906
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,589
is the story of the fight
between the selfish and the unselfish.

907
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,870
Where do I fit in?

908
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,436
I honestly don't know.

909
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,676
You still think I'm the kind of person
that goes with Harry?

910
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,792
You're still with him, aren't you?

911
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,957
Billie, come on, now.

912
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,757
Be fair.

913
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,189
You told me
that all you wanted out of life

914
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,880
was a mink coat
and a TV that fit in your purse.

915
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,391
Yeah, but that's why I did
all this learning. To change!

916
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,392
And it didn't make a difference.

917
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,115
- You don't think you're different?
- I do, sure.

918
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,596
But you don't.
You still see me the same as I was.

919
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,113
In that way,
you're no different from Harry.

920
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,071
How can you say that?

921
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,749
He still thinks I'm a bimbo from Vegas
and so do you.

922
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,756
No, I don't.

923
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,270
I've never gone through
anything like this for anybody.

924
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,871
Last night, I started thinking and
I couldn't fall asleep for ten minutes.

925
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,956
Billie, wait.

926
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,716
How come I feel
like I don't fit in any more?

927
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,072
Tell me why am I so unhappy
with everything that I used to want.

928
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,517
Let me tell you something, Paul.

929
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,155
I don't know about
all this book stuff and ethics.

930
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,033
But I do know
it only takes you so far.

931
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,312
And after that, you have to go on
what you feel, not on what you know.

932
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,237
But I know one thing.

933
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,717
There's a time between a guy and a girl
when it either comes off or it doesn't.

934
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,434
And if it doesn't then, it never does.

935
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,029
- Maybe we haven't gotten to our time.
- No, we did.

936
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,993
You just dropped the ball.

937
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,719
For all our griping, we're a lucky group.

938
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,479
We got food, a roof, friends around us.

939
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,311
Watching the tube the other day, I saw
how many homeless are veterans.

940
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,271
They ought to tack this
on the Constitution.

941
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,279
If you risk your life for your country,
you ought to have a home.

942
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,834
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution

943
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,111
says you can't be deprived of property
without compensation.

944
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,153
It's too bad they didn't offer
that protection to veterans.

945
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,236
That's in the Fifth Amendment.

946
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,273
No, no, I think it's the Sixth.

947
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,756
- Don't pay any attention to her.
- Actually, you're both wrong.

948
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,269
Property compensation
is the Seventh.

949
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,992
- It's the Fifth.
- Billie!

950
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,795
The Fifth is where you don't
incriminate yourself. Jesus!

951
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,956
Actually, both senators are wrong.

952
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,469
Billie's right.

953
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,075
Thanks.

954
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,990
There's a bunch of clauses in the Fifth.
One of them is property compensation.

955
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,111
The Sixth
is the right to a speedy trial.

956
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,109
You put us to shame.
Are you a constitutional lawyer?

957
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,871
No. I'm a student, I guess.

958
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,718
I have a hard time keeping them
straight so I make up little tricks.

959
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,469
Like a... mnemonic device?

960
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,797
I didn't buy anything for it,
if that's what you mean.

961
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,753
- Like I was saying...
- What's your trick?

962
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,552
Really?

963
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,671
You'll probably think I'm nuts,

964
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,870
but I use
<i>The Twelve Days Of Christmas.</i>

965
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,190
Well, why don't you teach it to us?

966
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,880
- Really?
- Sure, yeah!

967
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,116
- This'll be fun!
- Billie!

968
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,198
Stop it. That's enough!
We got business to do here.

969
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,919
We were under the impression
that this was a social occasion.

970
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,432
Please.

971
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,791
Thanks. Does anybody have a pen?

972
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,797
Sure.

973
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,956
Thank you.

974
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,432
And now,
the Senate Family Singers,

975
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,156

Don't tell me what I have to do.
You're not coming across.

1041
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,839
I want that base open!

1042
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,190
I am not an employee of yours, Harry.

1043
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:13,075
No? You think I bought 40,000 copies
of your book cos I kept misplacing it?

1044
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,714
I am not a lackey in one of your malls!

1045
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,593
I will decide if I help you
and how much I help you.

1046
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,188
You're making a mistake,
treating me this way!

1047
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,039
You are not a charity.
You are an investment.

1048
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,631
If you don't want to wind up as
secretary to YMCA, you do what I tell you!

1049
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,637
Harry! Harry, for God's sake...

1050
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,672
- Let me get him back here.
- I think he was clear enough!

1051
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,756
Go on!

1052
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,316
Hi.

1053
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,150
I don't think that Harry should talk
to you like that. You're a senator.

1054
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,313
Well, the operation of government
is... complex.

1055
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,069
I don't think anybody
should talk to a senator like that.

1056
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,237
- A senator's a wonderful thing.
- Thank you.

1057
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,318
It seems to me
that if Harry pushes you around,

1058
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,989
he's pushing around
the millions who voted for you.

1059
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,997
Well, not quite that many.

1060
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,076
How many, then?

1061
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,831
Eight hundred and sixty-three thousand,
four hundred and thirty-four.

1062
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,396
That's a lot of people
to push around.

1063
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,398
Why do you let him?
Who voted for him?

1064
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,592
At least he believes
in what he's doing.

1065
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,395
Maybe that's why
he's such a hard man to say no to.

1066
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,476
It's getting easier.

1067
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,320
Let me know your secret. Goodbye.

1068
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,396
Bye.

1069
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,396
Hello, Billie.

1070
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,750
- What is this?
- Same old stuff.

1071
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:16,199
I like having things explained.
I found that out.

1072
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,356
Let me explain this.
Don't start up with him.

1073
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,152
They're legit.

1074
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,874
Why can't I read them, then?
There must be something wrong...

1075
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,672
They're all right!

1076
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,116
I'm sorry.

1077
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,357
It's OK, I understand.

1078
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,994
You don't want to be doing
his dirty work.

1079
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,190
You know you're better than him.

1080
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,160
That's enough, Billie, please.

1081
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,311
I'm not so sure.

1082
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,396
Maybe you're worse.

1083
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,356
"Pursuant."

1084
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,116
Good word.

1085
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,276
What's the matter?

1086
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,879
Ed.

1087
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,797
What'd he do to you?

1088
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,388
It's what he's done to himself.

1089
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,274
Do you know, he used to be
attorney general of a whole state?

1090
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,072
Do you know, he wrote a book?

1091
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,239
It was called <i>The Roots of Freedom.</i>
I read it. It was beautiful.

1092
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,749
Don't tie up your new brain with Ed.

1093
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,749
You're not as big as I used to think.

1094
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,991
All through history,
there's been bigger men and better.

1095
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,716
Name somebody bigger.

1096
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,150
My father.

1097
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,872
Minimum wage!

1098
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,798
So what? At least he spent time with me.

1099
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,471
- I work every day. Even Sundays.
- For what, for who...? For whom?

1100
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,353
For money!
What do you think?

1101
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,835
So go rob a bank! That's work!

1102
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,439
I have never in my whole life...

1103
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,473
...robbed a bank!

1104
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,511
You're still not big.

1105
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,313
You don't care about anything big.

1106
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,591
Don't get nervous
just cos you read a book.

1107
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,314
You're still as dumb as you ever were.

1108
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,591
But I don't mind,
cos you're still the hottest little...

1109
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,358
Come here!

1110
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,439
I've never seen you like this.
What's the matter with you?

1111
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,194
My life is what's the matter with me.

1112
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,949
Maybe I am dumb, but I know
there's a better life than this!

1113
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,630
I want to be like those Van Gogh people,
where people care about each other!

1114
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,876
Harry...!

1115
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,638
You got money, Harry,
but you got a cheap life.

1116
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,718
I don't own nothin' cheap
except you.

1117
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,116
There's a little law about that.
Nobody can own anybody.

1118
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,038
Yeah? Well, what I say is law.

1119
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,878
So shut up!

1120
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,917
Sign the papers.

1121
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,156
Business is all you care about.

1122
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,353
Business bought you that outfit, and
just about everything else you own.

1123
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,119
So cut the crap! Sign the papers!

1124
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,396
All right.

1125
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,314
What are you waiting for?

1126
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,035
- I want to read 'em first.
- Just do it.

1127
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,513
Listen, you big ox,

1128
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,359
if I'm putting my name
on something, I want to know what it says.

1129
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,076
That's it. You sign the papers
and I'm sending you back to Chicago.

1130
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,630
- No.
- Sign the papers!

1131
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,716
I want to read them first!

1132
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,312
No! Harry!

1133
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,509
No, Harry!

1134
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,910
Did you do it?

1135
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,196
Yeah.

1136
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,556
Get out.

1137
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,756
Serves you right,
you big... anarchist!

1138
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,756
Don't you ever lay a hand on me again!

1139
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,078
Things aren't working out between us,
but don't make me hate you.

1140
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,876
- Do me a favour, Harry.
- What?

1141
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,432
Drop dead!

1142
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,516
I think he's done something illegal,

1143
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,950
and now I've signed these papers,
maybe I have, too.

1144
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,152
- Have you read them?
- No. Him and Ed wouldn't let me.

1145
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,236
He and Ed. Nominative case.

1146
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,590
Oh, yeah. See how upset I am?

1147
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,154
- I'll just check and see...
- Yeah, I'll wait here.

1148
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,837
Is Mr Brock upstairs?

1149
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,110
No, he went out a while ago.

1150
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,875
- Do you know where he keeps the papers?
- Yeah, but we have to hurry.

1151
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,833
Who knows when
he's going to come back?

1152
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,520
- He keeps everything on this stand.
- This one?

1153
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,596
Yeah.

1154
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,635
C'mon, Paul...

1155
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,231
- Was it in a brown folder?
- Hurry! Let's just take everything!

1156
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,071
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1157
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,597
Oh, no, it's him! Hurry!

1158
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,316
Oh, no!

1159
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,792
Thank you.

1160
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,830
- This one.
- Here?

1161
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,230
He's put all of his companies
in your name.

1162
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,076
They're all called Billie?

1163
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,196
No. I-I mean, you own them.

1164
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,788
These papers don't give him
control over you.

1165
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,593
It gives you control over him.

1166
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,631
You're Harry's boss!

1167
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,354
- I am?
- Yeah!

1168
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,274
What?

1169
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,231
Of course!

1170
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,237
What?

1171
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,399
These are photostat copies of cheques
that Harry's written to the senators.

1172
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,556
He's been bribing the senators
to keep that base open.

1173
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,989
What does he care if the base closes?

1174
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,395
Oh! All his customers.

1175
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,751
- Exactly!
- Poor Harry.

1176
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,874
Poor bribe-giving, law-breaking Harry!
I'm going to take this stuff to the paper.

1177
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,992
I knew it! Now all I got to do is write it.

1178
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,473
Just a minute.

1179
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,956
I can't let you do that.

1180
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,955
A necklace
or are you going to try something else?

1181
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,152
- May I help you, sir?
- The biggest wedding ring you got.

1182
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,316
- What?
- I'm marrying her.

1183
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,396
- You're kidding!
- She's been jumpy.

1184
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,956
It's been eight years.
What do you think she's worrying about?

1185
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,676
I was rough on her. She needs
to know I want her around whatever.

1186
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,597
I'll take this to the paper.

1187
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,951
You pack and I'll come back for you, OK?

1188
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,831
Paul, I don't think
that I'll see you again.

1189
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,269
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Why?

1190
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,197
Because of this?

1191
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:41,758
No, I just wonder sometimes if it's
good to find out so much so quick.

1192
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,557
Quickly.

1193
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,229
So quickly.
I think I'll just go away for a while.

1194
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,195
Where?

1195
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,232
I thought maybe I'd go see my dad.

1196
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,150
I got a better idea.
Let's get married.

1197
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,111
Are you crazy?

1198
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,116
I have been.

1199
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,916
But I love you.

1200
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,514
I can't think about this now.

1201
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,791
Who says you got to think
about everything all the time?

1202
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,916
Billie!

1203
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,911
Billie!

1204
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,952
There.

1205
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,038
Billie, marry me?

1206
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,231
Give me those papers.

1207
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,191
I can't.

1208
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,876
Go, quick. He'll kill you!

1209
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,595
Oh, hello. I didn't hear you.

1210
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,918
- Where have you been?
- What's the matter? Did you miss me?

1211
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,397
I had an idea. You know me,
I hate waiting when I got an idea.

1212
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,148
I don't blame you for being mad.

1213
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,352
I was thinking about
why you're so on edge.

1214
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,235
And then I realised that you don't know
what you mean to me.

1215
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,999
I can feel how much I mean to you,
Harry.

1216
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,833
Hey, I've done a lot
of good things, too.

1217
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,509
Don't forget about those
just cos of one mistake. Here...

1218
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,596
Maybe this'll help.

1219
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,435
Da!

1220
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,359
- Boy, when it rains, it pours!
- Yeah!

1221
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,311
Just name the date.

1222
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,035
I'm thinking of the thirteenth.

1223
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,513
What month?

1224
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,713
It's not a day, it's the Thirteenth
Amendment. No more slavery.

1225
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,355
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I can't marry you, Harry.

1226
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,998
You're too dumb.

1227
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,277
You think dumb people
make this much money?

1228
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,552
I think only a dumb person
would think money makes him smart.

1229
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,638
I got a different kind of life in mind.

1230
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,918
Is this something
your little teacher taught you?

1231
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,110
He's what needs to be different
around here.

1232
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,516
- I don't want you seeing him no more.
- I won't.

1233
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,474
- That's more like it.
- It's not because of you!

1234
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,514
Look, you're upset about the hit,
I know.

1235
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,473
- I'm sorry.
- Let me tell you about that hit.

1236
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,479
Everything I've been reading about and
Paul's been telling me, it mixed me up.

1237
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:45,720
But when you hit me, everything
fell together and made sense.

1238
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,071
Some people are always giving it
and some are always taking it.

1239
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,397
I'm not taking it any more!

1240
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,990
Why don't we go to my room
and I'll calm you down?

1241
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,951
Marry me or you'll be sorry!

1242
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,958
I'm already sorry. That's why I'm leaving!

1243
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,231
Billie, I'm offering to make you
a real partner.

1244
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,316
Partner in here.

1245
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,200
I want you to be my wife.

1246
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,118
Men are unbelievable.

1247
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,071
I give and give and give
and it's like wallpaper to you.

1248
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,156
You just walk right past it.

1249
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,158
Then you make one effort
and you think we're equal.

1250
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,751
It only looks like a big effort
because you never made one before.

1251
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,595
No!

1252
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,992
Fine.

1253
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,351
We'll see how you get along without me.

1254
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,238
You don't look like you did
five years ago.

1255
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,952
You look like shit!

1256
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,590
Yeah? Well, as far as I'm concerned,
vice versa!

1257
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,599
I'd forgotten how great this really is.

1258
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,029
She's leaving me.
Let's make sure everything's in order.

1259
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,948
Got to get these companies
back in my name.

1260
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,515
Looking for the stuff
I'm always signing?

1261
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,312
Yes.

1262
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,919
Like that file?

1263
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,029
Yes.

1264
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,674
- In the blue cover?
- Yes! Yes!

1265
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,796
- Paul has it.
- What?

1266
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,434
You gave it to him? Why?

1267
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,028
So he could take 'em to the paper.

1268
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,830
- Are you selling me out?
- Hello? Anybody home?

1269
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,276
JJ, lock the doors.

1270
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,830
Get in here and sit down.

1271
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,430
Why, thank you, I'd love a seat!
My feet are killing me.

1272
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,191
Hello!

1273
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,199
- How have you been?
- Very good, thank you. And you?

1274
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,231
Pretty good. Busy.

1275
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,033
Can the tea party crap!
Is she tellin' the truth?

1276
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,436
- Did you take that stuff to the papers?
- Billie always tells the truth.

1277
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,597
All right, pal.
You bring those papers back here.

1278
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,676
Or I will make you very sorry.

1279
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,279
Tell him I'm not bluffing.

1280
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,958
He's not bluffing.

1281
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,392
This would be good for the article.
Six years ago, there was a strike at...

1282
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,159
Shut up! You don't know nothin' about that!

1283
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,316
I know that was a double negative!

1284
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,759
You stupid, goddamn...

1285
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,752
I also happen to know
you've been paying people off,

1286
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,235
so that they won't shut down that base.

1287
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,429
What?

1288
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,792
I forgot, you're not a book reader
like us. You bribed 'em!

1289
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,319
No, no, Billie.

1290
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,715
Bribe is a strong word.

1291
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,559
They got $150,000 each.

1292
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,319
What would you call that? A tip?

1293
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,910
You had no right
to take those papers.

1294
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,952
You had no right to do what you did.

1295
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:08,119
But you did it. And now that you've done
it, the people have a right to know.

1296
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,231
- What people?
- The people.

1297
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,952
- Never heard of 'em.
- You will.

1298
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,435
12 of them are going to be deciding
where you're going to live.

1299
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,712
- Who are you, the government?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

1300
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,750
Since when?

1301
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,952
Since 1776.

1302
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,308
Exactly.

1303
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,951
All right.

1304
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,640
What'll it take, Paul?

1305
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,552
What do you mean?

1306
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,036
I think he's trying to tip you.

1307
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,638
What'll you take?

1308
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,594
I'll take a beer.
A light one, if you've got it.

1309
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,477
Get back here. Don't try to get funny.

1310
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,717
I ain't never met a guy yet
that didn't have his price.

1311
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,115
I'm ready to talk big numbers.

1312
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:57,189
You and your big numbers! You'll be
wearing big numbers across your chest.

1313
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,518
There are some things
more important than money.

1314
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,074
Like what? Your career?

1315
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,996
Nope.

1316
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,350
Like doing the right thing.

1317
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,873
Come on, Billie. Let's go.

1318
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,310
Stop it! Stop, Harry!

1319
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,991
- You could've killed him!
- What do you care?!

1320
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,588
I'm gonna marry him, that's what I care!

1321
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,518
- You what?
- You what?

1322
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:44,077
I'm gonna marry him,
cos he finally smartened up.

1323
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,749
I need a drink.

1324
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,836
Let me get it for you, Mr Devery.

1325
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,712
Am I in the room?
Hello! Am I in the room?

1326
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,310
You been cheatin' on me with this guy?

1327
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,590
No, we never did anything.

1328
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,393
I wanted to, but he wouldn't let me.

1329
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,792
Let's just drop the whole thing.

1330
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,276
You get her, and you don't have to
worry about what I'm doing.

1331
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,311
Oh, but I do worry, Harry.

1332
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,876
See, we got this beautiful
piece of machinery...

1333
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,958
I don't have to listen to you.
You talk more than a senator.

1334
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,275
You wanna screw
Brock Village? Go ahead!

1335
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,119
I got plenty other businesses!
So get out!

1336
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,878
I'm sick of the sight of both of you!

1337
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,833
Your other businesses belong to me.

1338
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,916
Oh, Christ!

1339
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,631
Remember how you used to say we'd
go away, buy a house on the beach?

1340
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,637
Why didn't we ever do that?

1341
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,990
I couldn't do that. I had to work.

1342
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,918
But why? You had five companies
when I met you.

1343
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,918
When was it going to be enough
so we could we enjoy it?

1344
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:03,512
One thing I have had enough of
is you and Professor Windbag!

1345
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,838
That will be corrected shortly,
when I leave.

1346
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,190
I'll give the companies back to you,
but only one at a time.

1347
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,709
- What?
- And only one a year.

1348
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,559
- What?
- Oh, my God!

1349
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,148
You're calling those senators
and getting that money back.

1350
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,431
Then you're getting out of town
or Paul will write that story.

1351
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,918
If I take their money back,
they close the base, I lose the mall!

1352
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,679
What am I supposed to do?

1353
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,473
- Maybe take a watercolour class?
- Very funny.

1354
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,999
Also, you should walk the beach.

1355
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,998
- I don't live near a beach.
- I'm rich for a little bit.

1356
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,759
I'll buy you a beach
and I'll pay for your watercolour class.

1357
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,793
And I'll get you a ticket to the museum,
so you can see that Van Gogh.

1358
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,629
Are you nuts?
Why should I do all this stuff?

1359
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,513
- You have to ask why?
- Yeah!

1360
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,269
That's why! So you'll know
what all that stuff is for!

1361
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,472
Then maybe you'll find a little bit
of what I've found.

1362
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,795
Trust me, Harry.
This will make you happy.

1363
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,992
How would you know?

1364
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,078
Do you think I was born yesterday?

1365
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,794
God, I love this woman.

1366
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,796
Bye, JJ.

1367
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,916
Bye.

1368
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,191
You ready?

1369
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,276
Absolutely.

1370
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,474
You do what I'm tellin' ya!

1371
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
