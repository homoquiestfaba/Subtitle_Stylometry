00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,931

He's like an action figure.
So, who's the flavor of the

34
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm making dinner tonight.
Maybe it was kreston.
[ Laughing ] Kreston?

35
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:25,984
Maybe it was kreston.
[ Laughing ] Kreston?
That couldn't have been it.

36
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,119
[ Laughing ] Kreston?
That couldn't have been it.
Do you want to try that new

No, I can't.
I'm actually meeting your

I'm actually meeting your
brother for breakfast tomorrow.

43
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,692
I'm actually meeting your
brother for breakfast tomorrow.
We're gonna have coffee.

44
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:34,393
Brother for breakfast tomorrow.
We're gonna have coffee.
Okay.

45
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,894
We're gonna have coffee.
Okay.
"A," you two and your coffee

46
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,729
okay.
"A," you two and your coffee
ritual still weirds me the hell

47
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,565
"a," you two and your coffee
ritual still weirds me the hell
out, and "b," I would prefer if

48
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,133
ritual still weirds me the hell
out, and "b," I would prefer if
you'd start referring to Kyle

49
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,434
out, and "b," I would prefer if
you'd start referring to Kyle
not as my brother but as your

50
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,569
you'd start referring to Kyle
not as my brother but as your
ex-husband.

51
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,003
Not as my brother but as your
ex-husband.
Well, technically, the papers

52
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,004
ex-husband.
Well, technically, the papers
aren't signed yet.

53
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,439
Well, technically, the papers
aren't signed yet.
So, he's not really my ex.

54
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,141
Aren't signed yet.
So, he's not really my ex.
I could call him my husband if

55
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,409
so, he's not really my ex.
I could call him my husband if
it'd make you feel any better.

56
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,979
I could call him my husband if
it'd make you feel any better.
Okay, I retract my protest.

57
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,949
It'd make you feel any better.
Okay, I retract my protest.
Cody!

58
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,617
Okay, I retract my protest.

have to come back, get some work

66
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:08,494
morning with Sasha, and then I
have to come back, get some work
done.

67
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,828
Have to come back, get some work
done.
Why are you having coffee

68
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,729
done.
Why are you having coffee
with her again?

69
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,097
Why are you having coffee
with her again?
Because it's Tuesday, and

70
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,098
with her again?
Because it's Tuesday, and
that's what we do.

71
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,800
Because it's Tuesday, and
that's what we do.
Really not what I meant.

72
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,502
That's what we do.
Really not what I meant.
How do you justify having a

73
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,137
really not what I meant.
How do you justify having a
standing coffee date with your

74
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:18,670
how do you justify having a
standing coffee date with your
ex?

75
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,872
Standing coffee date with your
ex?
I don't have to<i> justify</i>

76
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:20,539
ex?
I don't have to<i> justify</i>
anything.

77
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,807
I don't have to<i> justify</i>
anything.
We were friends way before we

78
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,541
anything.
We were friends way before we
got married.

79
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,809
We were friends way before we
got married.
It stands to reason we can go

80
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,977
got married.
It stands to reason we can go
back to that post-breakup.

81
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,044
It stands to reason we can go
back to that post-breakup.
Yeah, if by "stands to

82
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,179
back to that post-breakup.
Yeah, if by "stands to
reason," you mean wobbles to

83
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,447
yeah, if by "stands to
reason," you mean wobbles to
reason, like a drunk baby

00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,515
reason," you mean wobbles to
reason, like a drunk baby
crossing an icy street, then,

85
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,549
reason, like a drunk baby
crossing an icy street, then,
yeah, I suppose it does stand to

86
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,116
crossing an icy street, then,
yeah, I suppose it does stand to
reason.

87
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:31,917
Yeah, I suppose it does stand to
reason.
Look, man.

88
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,852
Reason.
Look, man.
I can't even stand to<i> look</i> at my

00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,754
look, man.
I can't even stand to<i> look</i> at my
ex, let alone share a latte with

I can't even stand to<i> look</i> at my
ex, let alone share a latte with
her.

91
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:37,156
Ex, let alone share a latte with
her.
It's a latte.

92
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,724
Her.
It's a latte.
It's a fucking sacred beverage.

93
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:39,658
It's a latte.
It's a fucking sacred beverage.
[ Laughing ] Okay.

94
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,792
It's a fucking sacred beverage.
[ Laughing ] Okay.
Well, first of all, latte is,

95
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:41,994
[ laughing ] Okay.
Well, first of all, latte is,
like, the least-sacred beverage

96
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,128
well, first of all, latte is,
like, the least-sacred beverage
in the history of beverages.

97
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,863
Like, the least-sacred beverage
in the history of beverages.
No nations ever came to peace

98
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,665
in the history of beverages.
No nations ever came to peace
over a steaming-hot, processed

99
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,132
no nations ever came to peace
over a steaming-hot, processed
coffee.

100
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,834
Over a steaming-hot, processed
coffee.
And you're pissed at your ex

101
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,702
coffee.
And you're pissed at your ex
because she cheated on you with

102
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,204
and you're pissed at your ex
because she cheated on you with
your roommate while you were

103
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,605
because she cheated on you with
your roommate while you were
passed out in the same room.

104
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,607
Your roommate while you were
passed out in the same room.
Cunt.

105
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,508
Passed out in the same room.
Cunt.
Hmm? Exactly.

106
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,776
Cunt.
Hmm? Exactly.
The worst my ex ever did was

107
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,144
hmm? Exactly.
The worst my ex ever did was
take the couch in the divorce.

108
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,612
The worst my ex ever did was
take the couch in the divorce.
It's the same thing, man.

109
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,047
Take the couch in the divorce.
It's the same thing, man.
We fucking loved that couch.

110
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,215
It's the same thing, man.
We fucking loved that couch.
It's not like we had a bad

111
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:03,815
we fucking loved that couch.
It's not like we had a bad
breakup.

112
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,484
It's not like we had a bad
breakup.
It could have been a lot worse.

113
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,452
Breakup.
It could have been a lot worse.
Sasha, all of your material

114
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,454
it could have been a lot worse.
Sasha, all of your material
possessions are here -- all of

115
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,190
Sasha, all of your material
possessions are here -- all of
your appliances, the life you

00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:11,890
possessions are here -- all of
your appliances, the life you
built.

117
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,559
Your appliances, the life you
built.
You stole the man's couch!

118
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,093
Built.
You stole the man's couch!
I didn't steal anything.

119
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,662
You stole the man's couch!
I didn't steal anything.
I was entitled to half.

120
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,063
I didn't steal anything.
I was entitled to half.
But you didn't take half.

121
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,531
I was entitled to half.
But you didn't take half.
You took the whole thing.

122
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,033
But you didn't take half.
You took the whole thing.
You even brought the

123
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,235
you took the whole thing.
You even brought the
video game-induced swamp-assy,

124
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,103
you even brought the
video game-induced swamp-assy,
spilled bong water, and

125
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,472
video game-induced swamp-assy,
spilled bong water, and
ashtray-mishap odor with you.

126
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,674
Spilled bong water, and
ashtray-mishap odor with you.
That couch is fine.

127
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,575
Ashtray-mishap odor with you.
That couch is fine.
I febrezed it.

128
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,108
That couch is fine.
I febrezed it.
You saw me.

129
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,543
I febrezed it.
You saw me.
That couch doesn't need

130
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:31,977
you saw me.
That couch doesn't need
febreze.

131
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,178
That couch doesn't need
febreze.
It needs a Hazmat team...

132
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,881
Febreze.
It needs a Hazmat team...
The whole thing, which you took

133
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,782
it needs a Hazmat team...
The whole thing, which you took
with you.

134
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,917
The whole thing, which you took
with you.
Not half -- whole.

135
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,551
With you.
Not half -- whole.
Look.

136
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,719
Not half -- whole.
Look.
I didn't have a chain saw handy.

137
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,187
Look.
I didn't have a chain saw handy.
My options were a little

138
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:42,955
I didn't have a chain saw handy.
My options were a little
limited.

139
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,857
My options were a little
limited.
Whatever, Solomon.

140
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,527
Limited.
Whatever, Solomon.
Maybe his name was Charles.

141
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,529
Whatever, Solomon.
Maybe his name was Charles.
Charles sounds right.

142
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:50,862
Maybe his name was Charles.
Charles sounds right.
"R."

143
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,030
Charles sounds right.
"R."
I remember screaming that last

144
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:52,831
"r."
I remember screaming that last
night.

145
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,132
I remember screaming that last
night.
So, what, it's just as simple

146
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,067
night.
So, what, it's just as simple
as hating her guts?

147
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,235
So, what, it's just as simple
as hating her guts?
It'd sure make my life

148
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:56,935
as hating her guts?
It'd sure make my life
easier.

149
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,237
It'd sure make my life
easier.
What?! How?

150
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,072
Easier.
What?! How?
Dude, I'm your best friend,

In a breakup, it's my job to

153
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,042
okay?
In a breakup, it's my job to
ruthlessly demonize her while

154
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,811
in a breakup, it's my job to
ruthlessly demonize her while
helping you address your pain

155
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,579
ruthlessly demonize her while
helping you address your pain
and angst by exposing you to

156
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,615
helping you address your pain
and angst by exposing you to
wholesome entertainment, like

157
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,582
and angst by exposing you to
wholesome entertainment, like
strip clubs.

158
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,750
Wholesome entertainment, like
strip clubs.
I'm just saying, man.

159
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,252
Strip clubs.
I'm just saying, man.
Like, have you even considered

160
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,886
I'm just saying, man.
Like, have you even considered
how your so-called "maturity"

161
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,188
like, have you even considered
how your so-called "maturity"
about this might be affecting

162
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,989
how your so-called "maturity"
about this might be affecting
me?

163
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,023
About this might be affecting
me?
No, you haven't.

164
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,558
Me?
No, you haven't.
You're right, trey.

165
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,926
No, you haven't.
You're right, trey.
I am a selfish bastard.

00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,927
You're right, trey.
I am a selfish bastard.
I'm saying.

167
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,128
I am a selfish bastard.
I'm saying.
Not to mention all of the

168
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,196
I'm saying.
Not to mention all of the
perfectly respectable

169
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,664
not to mention all of the
perfectly respectable
gentlemen's-club buffets that

170
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,999
perfectly respectable
gentlemen's-club buffets that
we're missing, okay?

171
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,967
Gentlemen's-club buffets that
we're missing, okay?
Man cannot live on cheap beer

172
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,669
we're missing, okay?
Man cannot live on cheap beer
and fucking spaghettios alone.

173
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,770
Man cannot live on cheap beer
and fucking spaghettios alone.
Shouldn't you be happy for

174
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,104
and fucking spaghettios alone.
Shouldn't you be happy for
us?

175
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,305
Shouldn't you be happy for
us?
I mean, it could be a whole

I mean, it could be a whole
hell of a lot worse.

177
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,173
I mean, it could be a whole
hell of a lot worse.
Undoubtedly.

178
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,708
Hell of a lot worse.
Undoubtedly.
This is far better than the

179
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,542
undoubtedly.
This is far better than the
alternative.

180
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,910
This is far better than the
alternative.
Doesn't mean I'm not still

181
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,612
alternative.
Doesn't mean I'm not still
allowed to be a little skeeved

00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,980
doesn't mean I'm not still
allowed to be a little skeeved

Of course it was just inside

But my dynamic with my ex
somehow skeeves you out.

00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,036
You really are.
Best safe word ever.
[ Laughs ]

286
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,438
Best safe word ever.
[ Laughs ]
Anyway, enough about me.

287
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,306
[ Laughs ]
Anyway, enough about me.
How come you haven't gotten laid

288
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:21,840
anyway, enough about me.
How come you haven't gotten laid
yet?

289
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:22,274
How come you haven't gotten laid
yet?
Jesus.

290
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,375
Yet?
Jesus.
Would you believe it's 'cause I

291
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,075
Jesus.
Would you believe it's 'cause I
haven't tried?

292
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:24,843
Would you believe it's 'cause I
haven't tried?
No.

293
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,478
Haven't tried?
No.
Seriously, I'm curious.

294
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,979
No.
Seriously, I'm curious.
Like, how long has it been?

295
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,980
Seriously, I'm curious.
Like, how long has it been?
Like, nine months?

296
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,049
Like, how long has it been?
Like, nine months?
You must be, like, going crazy.

297
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,051
Like, nine months?
You must be, like, going crazy.
First of all, the good book

298
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,786
you must be, like, going crazy.
First of all, the good book
says love thyself, okay?

299
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,888
First of all, the good book
says love thyself, okay?
I listen.

300
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,456
Says love thyself, okay?
I listen.
That's gross.

301
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,790
I listen.
That's gross.
I remember you saying how that

302
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,891
that's gross.
I remember you saying how that
depressed you, like the whole

303
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,992
I remember you saying how that
depressed you, like the whole
back of the hand smacking up

304
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,060
depressed you, like the whole
back of the hand smacking up
against the gut and whatnot.

305
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,762
Back of the hand smacking up
against the gut and whatnot.
Yeah, I got over it.

306
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,163
Against the gut and whatnot.
Yeah, I got over it.
Secondly, it hasn't been nine

307
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,832
yeah, I got over it.
Secondly, it hasn't been nine
months since I've gotten laid,

308
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,167
secondly, it hasn't been nine
months since I've gotten laid,
in case you forgot.

309
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,168
Months since I've gotten laid,
in case you forgot.
Thought we agreed not to talk

310
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,836
in case you forgot.
Thought we agreed not to talk
about that.

311
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,204
Thought we agreed not to talk
about that.
We can not bring it up all

312
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:52,871
about that.
We can not bring it up all
you want.

313
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,306
We can not bring it up all
you want.
Doesn't change the fact that it

314
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,106
you want.
Doesn't change the fact that it
happened.

315
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,341
Doesn't change the fact that it
happened.
Ostrich syndrome, hon, doesn't

316
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,710
happened.
Ostrich syndrome, hon, doesn't
change the facts.

317
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:10,489
Did you -- did you sign the
papers yet?
Jesus, Sasha.

318
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,523
Papers yet?
Jesus, Sasha.
Really know how to fuck up a

319
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,090
Jesus, Sasha.
Really know how to fuck up a

320
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,227
Really know how to fuck up a
lunch.
You know that?

321
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,462
Lunch.
You know that?
I'll get to it tomorrow.

322
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,865
You know that?
I'll get to it tomorrow.
Thanks.

323
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,366
I'll get to it tomorrow.
Thanks.
Look, um...

324
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,301
Thanks.
Look, um...
I got to go meet Lacey.

325
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,269
Look, um...
I got to go meet Lacey.
I'm gonna be late.

326
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,237
I got to go meet Lacey.
I'm gonna be late.
Maybe she can help you get

327
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,104
I'm gonna be late.
Maybe she can help you get
the sand out of your --

328
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:26,872
maybe she can help you get
the sand out of your --
what was that?

329
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,774
The sand out of your --
what was that?
Hmm? I said, "I'll see you."

330
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:40,418
Now I've lost my appetite.
False alarm.
Oh, I'd never leave you, baby.

331
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,921
False alarm.
Oh, I'd never leave you, baby.
Oh, my God.

332
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,358
Oh, I'd never leave you, baby.
Oh, my God.
So good.

333
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,993
Oh, my God.
So good.
Oh, God.

334
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,161
So good.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna cuddle you so hard.

335
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,064
Oh, God.
I'm gonna cuddle you so hard.
It's gonna be sexy-time.

336
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,332
I'm gonna cuddle you so hard.
It's gonna be sexy-time.
You're my sexy, little bagel

337
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,534
it's gonna be sexy-time.
You're my sexy, little bagel
girl.

338
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,135
You're my sexy, little bagel
girl.
I probably shouldn't personify

339
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:57,802
girl.
I probably shouldn't personify
my food.

340
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,504
I probably shouldn't personify
my food.
Might be why I'm fat.

341
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,407
My food.
Might be why I'm fat.
I'm talking to nobody right now.

342
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:13,418
So, who are these guys?
The guy Scott that I'm
meeting, he's a bartender at

343
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,553
the guy Scott that I'm
meeting, he's a bartender at
that one bar.

344
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,087
Meeting, he's a bartender at
that one bar.
That's a terrible name for a

345
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:16,421
that one bar.
That's a terrible name for a
bar.

346
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,923
That's a terrible name for a
bar.
Yeah, like six months ago,

347
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,291
bar.
Yeah, like six months ago,
you thought that was an awesome

348
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:20,225
yeah, like six months ago,
you thought that was an awesome
name for a bar?

349
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:20,959
You thought that was an awesome
name for a bar?
Remember?

350
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,994
Name for a bar?
Remember?
Six months ago, I was stoned.

351
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,397
Remember?
Six months ago, I was stoned.
So...Six months ago, it was.

352
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,599
Six months ago, I was stoned.
So...Six months ago, it was.
Anyway, Scott is really,

00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,101
so...Six months ago, it was.
Anyway, Scott is really,
really cute and really sweet.

354
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,270
Anyway, Scott is really,
really cute and really sweet.
And on a scale of one to

355
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,873
really cute and really sweet.
And on a scale of one to
fuckable, he is about an 11.

356
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,441
And on a scale of one to
fuckable, he is about an 11.
And his friend?

357
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,843
Fuckable, he is about an 11.
And his friend?
Uh...I haven't actually met

358
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,511
and his friend?
Uh...I haven't actually met
the guy.

359
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,948
Uh...I haven't actually met
the guy.
Not sure.

360
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,151
The guy.
Not sure.
Great.

361
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:46,518
Not sure.
Great.
Okay.

362
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,153
Great.
Okay.
Can we talk about the terrible

363
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,588
okay.
Can we talk about the terrible
act of betrayal I'm committing

364
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,056
can we talk about the terrible
act of betrayal I'm committing
by being your wing woman?

365
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:51,590
Act of betrayal I'm committing
by being your wing woman?
Whoa.

366
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,491
By being your wing woman?
Whoa.
How is this an act of betrayal?

367
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,960
Whoa.
How is this an act of betrayal?
This is an act of friendship.

368
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,127
How is this an act of betrayal?
This is an act of friendship.
Sasha...

369
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,229
This is an act of friendship.
Sasha...
You're still married...

370
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,364
Sasha...
You're still married...
To my brother.

371
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,566
You're still married...
To my brother.
Yeah, technically, on paper,

372
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,069
to my brother.
Yeah, technically, on paper,
for, like, six more weeks.

373
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,003
Yeah, technically, on paper,
for, like, six more weeks.
Come on, Lacey.

374
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,571
For, like, six more weeks.
Come on, Lacey.
We have been best friends since,

375
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,206
come on, Lacey.
We have been best friends since,
like, what, the eighth grade?

376
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,008
We have been best friends since,
like, what, the eighth grade?
I mean, if you think about it,

377
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,176
like, what, the eighth grade?
I mean, if you think about it,
I was yours first.

378
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,644
I mean, if you think about it,
I was yours first.
Yeah, but Kyle and I shared a

379
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,145
I was yours first.
Yeah, but Kyle and I shared a
womb.

380
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,113
Yeah, but Kyle and I shared a
womb.
I mean, he was in it first.

381
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,081
Womb.
I mean, he was in it first.
So, technically, it's like a

382
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:16,648
I mean, he was in it first.
So, technically, it's like a
hand-me-down womb.

383
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,916
So, technically, it's like a
hand-me-down womb.
But still...

384
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,584
Hand-me-down womb.
But still...
Kyle and I are over.

385
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,120
But still...
Kyle and I are over.
We have been over, and you know

386
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,654
Kyle and I are over.
We have been over, and you know
that.

387
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,389
We have been over, and you know
that.
I know.

388
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,524
That.
I know.
And despite the fact that you

389
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,660
I know.
And despite the fact that you
guys have this whole "getting

390
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,528
and despite the fact that you
guys have this whole "getting
along better as friends"

391
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,998
guys have this whole "getting
along better as friends"
"everything's going great" whole

392
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,899
along better as friends"
"everything's going great" whole
dynamic, it's still fucking

393
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,067
"everything's going great" whole
dynamic, it's still fucking
awkward.

394
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,668
Dynamic, it's still fucking
awkward.
Wait a sec.

395
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,069
Awkward.
Wait a sec.
So, you're saying I can't be

396
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,004
wait a sec.
So, you're saying I can't be
friends with my ex.

397
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:39,504
So, you're saying I can't be
friends with my ex.
No.

398
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,473
Friends with my ex.
No.
I'm saying<i> I</i> can't be friends

399
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,508
no.
I'm saying<i> I</i> can't be friends
with my ex, and I'm projecting

400
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,176
I'm saying<i> I</i> can't be friends
with my ex, and I'm projecting
my insecurities onto you.

401
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,144
With my ex, and I'm projecting
my insecurities onto you.
Is there a point to all of

402
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,679
my insecurities onto you.
Is there a point to all of
this?

403
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,647
Is there a point to all of
this?
Yeah.

404
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,615
This?
Yeah.
I just feel...Scuzzy,

405
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,584
yeah.
I just feel...Scuzzy,
double-dating with my

406
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,286
I just feel...Scuzzy,
double-dating with my
sister-in-law.

407
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,488
Double-dating with my
sister-in-law.
You're not scuzzy.

408
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,189
Sister-in-law.
You're not scuzzy.
You're just trying to help a

409
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,924
you're not scuzzy.
You're just trying to help a
newly divorced woman get back

410
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,159
you're just trying to help a
newly divorced woman get back
into the dating game.

411
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,193
Newly divorced woman get back
into the dating game.
It's actually a good thing that

412
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,261
into the dating game.
It's actually a good thing that
you're doing, if you think about

413
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,131
it's actually a good thing that
you're doing, if you think about
it.

414
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,232
You're doing, if you think about
it.
I'm going to hell.

415
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,433
It.
I'm going to hell.
I thought you were an

416
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,567
I'm going to hell.
I thought you were an
atheist.

417
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,703
I thought you were an
atheist.
Agnostic, actually.

418
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,004
Atheist.
Agnostic, actually.
All right, then.

419
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,472
Agnostic, actually.
All right, then.
Well, you're doing that vague,

420
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,174
all right, then.
Well, you're doing that vague,
undefined higher power's work.

421
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,642
Well, you're doing that vague,
undefined higher power's work.
In fact, you're practically a

422
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,277
undefined higher power's work.
In fact, you're practically a
Saint.

423
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:28,353
So, tell me about this guy.
Scott?
No, the other one -- the one

424
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,454
Scott?
No, the other one -- the one

710
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:45,903
like, nothing kills the mood
more than having a loogie hocked
at you.

711
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,971
More than having a loogie hocked
at you.
Come on.

712
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,139
At you.
Come on.
Well, maybe you just weren't

713
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,307
come on.
Well, maybe you just weren't
as into Scott as you thought you

714
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,675
well, maybe you just weren't
as into Scott as you thought you
were.

715
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:51,942
As into Scott as you thought you
were.
You know, as insane as that

716
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,244
were.
You know, as insane as that
is, I thought about that, too.

717
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,679
You know, as insane as that
is, I thought about that, too.
So, after I sent him home, I

718
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:55,880
is, I thought about that, too.
So, after I sent him home, I
double-clicked the mouse a

719
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:56,681
so, after I sent him home, I
double-clicked the mouse a
little bit.

720
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,214
Double-clicked the mouse a
little bit.
Mm-hmm.

721
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,182
Little bit.
Mm-hmm.
Nothing.

722
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,618
Mm-hmm.
Nothing.
Dry like the mojave.

723
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,586
Nothing.
Dry like the mojave.
Well, you know, Scott, fit,

724
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,322
dry like the mojave.
Well, you know, Scott, fit,
athletic specimen -- it's not

725
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,856
well, you know, Scott, fit,
athletic specimen -- it's not
really what Kyle was.

726
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,758
Athletic specimen -- it's not
really what Kyle was.
I hate to say it, Sasha, but

727
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
really what Kyle was.
I hate to say it, Sasha, but
you're kind of a chubby chaser.

728
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,295
I hate to say it, Sasha, but
you're kind of a chubby chaser.
I'm not a chubby chaser!

729
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,998
You're kind of a chubby chaser.
I'm not a chubby chaser!
It's just that, I don't know,

730
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,233
I'm not a chubby chaser!
It's just that, I don't know,
I'm just, well, fat guys<i> really</i>

731
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,702
it's just that, I don't know,
I'm just, well, fat guys<i> really</i>
know how to eat.

732
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,003
I'm just, well, fat guys<i> really</i>
know how to eat.
Oh, Jesus, Sasha!

733
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,237
Know how to eat.
Oh, Jesus, Sasha!
Still my brother!

734
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,072
Oh, Jesus, Sasha!
Still my brother!
Come on!

735
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,973
Still my brother!
Come on!
Yeah, but it's true.

736
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:23,808
Come on!
Yeah, but it's true.
Okay.

737
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,209
Yeah, but it's true.
Okay.
Look. I'm sorry.

738
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,277
Okay.
Look. I'm sorry.
Still true.

739
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,845
Look. I'm sorry.
Still true.
Okay, well...

740
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,314
Still true.
Okay, well...
Maybe the issue is, is that your

741
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,916
okay, well...
Maybe the issue is, is that your
geyser really is old faithful.

742
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,617
Maybe the issue is, is that your
geyser really is old faithful.
What the fuck does that mean?

743
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,052
Geyser really is old faithful.
What the fuck does that mean?
I mean...

744
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,821
What the fuck does that mean?
I mean...
Maybe you're not done processing

745
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,155
I mean...
Maybe you're not done processing
emotional baggage from the

746
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:38,823
maybe you're not done processing
emotional baggage from the
divorce.

747
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,257
Emotional baggage from the
divorce.
Maybe you're just not ready to

748
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,792
divorce.
Maybe you're just not ready to
be out fucking somebody yet.

749
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,828
Maybe you're just not ready to
be out fucking somebody yet.
Of course. That's it!

750
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,862
Be out fucking somebody yet.
Of course. That's it!
Really?

751
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,097
Of course. That's it!
Really?
'Cause I was actually kind of

752
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:46,897
really?
'Cause I was actually kind of
reaching there.

753
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,899
'Cause I was actually kind of
reaching there.
It's guilt.

754
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:49,367
Reaching there.
It's guilt.
Oh.

755
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,000
It's guilt.
Oh.

Oh.

00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,737
What?
It's guilt.
Basically, I've moved on.

758
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,672
It's guilt.
Basically, I've moved on.
So, I'm feeling guilty because

759
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,239
basically, I've moved on.
So, I'm feeling guilty because
Kyle hasn't.

760
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:55,840
So, I'm feeling guilty because
Kyle hasn't.
You see?

761
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:56,207
Kyle hasn't.
You see?
No.

762
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,141

I'm feeling guilty.
So, I can't perform with anybody

767
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:02,313
I'm feeling guilty.
So, I can't perform with anybody
else.

768
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,715
So, I can't perform with anybody
else.
Also retarded.

769

Else.
Also retarded.
Oh, my God.

Also retarded.
Oh, my God.

Why do I feel like this is
gonna be crazy?

773
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,255
Why do I feel like this is

Gonna be crazy?
I need to get Kyle laid.
Oh!

775
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,357
I need to get Kyle laid.
Oh!
It must be 'cause I'm psychic.

Oh!
It must be 'cause I'm psychic.
No, no, no. Listen, asshole.

So, my subconscious?

I'm feeling guilty.
So, my subconscious?
Well, it's turning my fun spot

so, my subconscious?
Well, it's turning my fun spot
into a no-fly zone.

Your refusal to sign those

00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,944
train.
Your refusal to sign those
papers -- well, it's clearly a

00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:40,778
your refusal to sign those
papers -- well, it's clearly a
cry for help.

836

Oh.

You are not over me, and, I
mean, I get it.

842
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,322
You are not over me, and, I

Oh, I'm sorry.
Between my waistline and your

oh, I'm sorry.
Between my waistline and your
ego, the table's getting a

00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:58,829
between my waistline and your
ego, the table's getting a
little cramped.

848
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,897
Ego, the table's getting a

You know, you don't have to

849
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:00,498
little cramped.
You know, you don't have to
be an ass about it.

You know, you don't have to

I'm trying to be helpful.
I'm trying to be your friend.
And as your friend, I'm telling

happens to be your friend.
The two aren't mutually

863
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,089

The two aren't mutually
exclusive, you know?

864
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,490
The two aren't mutually
exclusive, you know?
I mean, who's gonna help you

865
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,258

Trey is a very good friend, and
he's always had my back.

869
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,196
Trey is a very good friend, and
he's always had my back.
Okay.

870
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,531
He's always had my back.
Okay.
But would you seriously fuck

871
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,999
okay.
But would you seriously fuck
anybody he set you up with?

872
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,500
But would you seriously fuck
anybody he set you up with?
Dude's a skunk magnet.

873
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,135
Anybody he set you up with?
Dude's a skunk magnet.
Everybody knows that.

874
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,937
Dude's a skunk magnet.
Everybody knows that.
Think about it.

875
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,839
Everybody knows that.
Think about it.
Trey cannot find you a good,

876
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,573
think about it.
Trey cannot find you a good,
clean girl.

877
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,440
Trey cannot find you a good,
clean girl.
And Lacey?

878
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,075
Clean girl.
And Lacey?
Her pool of chicks that we

879
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,810
and Lacey?
Her pool of chicks that we
haven't already met is, like,

880
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:47,811
her pool of chicks that we
haven't already met is, like,
totally limited.

881
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,446
Haven't already met is, like,
totally limited.
So, I've decided as your friend

882
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,981
totally limited.
So, I've decided as your friend
to step up to the plate.

883
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,082
So, I've decided as your friend
to step up to the plate.
I'm gonna assume the burden

884
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,817
to step up to the plate.
I'm gonna assume the burden
myself.

885
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:54,985
I'm gonna assume the burden
myself.
So, hold on.

886
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,921
Myself.
So, hold on.
Just so I think I have this

887
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:57,955
so, hold on.
Just so I think I have this
figured out.

888
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,257
Just so I think I have this
figured out.
You think that just because I

889
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,826
figured out.
You think that just because I
didn't sign the papers yet that

890
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,261
you think that just because I
didn't sign the papers yet that
I'm not over you.

891
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:04,895
Didn't sign the papers yet that
I'm not over you.
Yep.

892
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,363
I'm not over you.
Yep.

893
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,932
yep.
You never stopped to consider
that maybe I didn't sign the

894
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,166
you never stopped to consider
that maybe I didn't sign the
papers 'cause I was busy?

895
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,036
That maybe I didn't sign the
papers 'cause I was busy?
Nope.

896

Papers 'cause I was busy?
Nope.
You work at home.

Nope.
You work at home.
And lazy?

Can you be serious for, like,

00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,008
Can you be serious for, like,
a second?
I<i> am</i> being serious.

you know, I haven't even seen
you look at another girl since
we broke up.

912
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,389
You look at another girl since
we broke up.
And there's a reason for

we broke up.
And there's a reason for

918
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,198
But your whole gender is a big

I just decided to go on a diet.

919
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,933
Bowl of crazy flakes.
I just decided to go on a diet.
Your irreverent denial is

00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,246
you really think that I'm just
some poor, pathetic schlub,

yet, but you know what?
This was a divorce, not a

This was a divorce, not a
high school breakup.

This was a divorce, not a
high school breakup.
And it's been less than a year.

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,230
High school breakup.
And it's been less than a year.
I'm not supposed to be over us

like a troll.

1037
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,585
I'm, like, so making him sound
like a troll.
He's not a troll.

1038
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,453
Like a troll.
He's not a troll.
He's a big guy, but that's all

1039
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,289
he's not a troll.
He's a big guy, but that's all
right, because big guys, they

1040
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,623
he's a big guy, but that's all
right, because big guys, they

1042
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,358
Know their way around the

And, in this case, he knows his

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,426
kitchen.
And, in this case, he knows his
way around the bedroom pretty

1044
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,194

Less bombastic.
Middle ground.
From the bottom of my heart, I

1069
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,532
House-style, or should I class

Class?

1070
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,500

Class?
You're being pimped out by your

You're being pimped out by your
soon-to-be ex-wife and being

1072
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,137
you're being pimped out by your
soon-to-be ex-wife and being
paid in a six-year-old couch

1073
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:17,441
soon-to-be ex-wife and being
paid in a six-year-old couch
that reeks of bong water.

00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:19,243
Paid in a six-year-old couch
that reeks of bong water.
Class is a distant memory at

Oh, fuck you.

not be above taking advantage of

not be above taking advantage of
a loved one for my own personal
gain, I know you.

1092
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,881
A loved one for my own personal

You have some noble motive

You have some noble motive
behind this, no matter how

Okay.

Fucking stupid it might be.
Okay.
You might have a point.

1097
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,590
Okay.
You might have a point.
For reasons completely oblivious

1098
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,659
you might have a point.
For reasons completely oblivious

When does making the shrew

When does making the shrew
feel better become your

when does making the shrew
feel better become your
responsibility?

Feel better become your
responsibility?
I thought you laid that burden

1105
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,336

I thought you laid that burden
down when she took legal action.

1106
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,971
I thought you laid that burden
down when she took legal action.
It was a divorce, not a

It was a divorce, not a

It was a divorce, not a
restraining order.
What do you think?

Restraining order.
What do you think?
You look like a date rapist,

You look like a date rapist,

If you do, we lose the couch.
I'm sure they won't be awful.

If you do, we lose the couch.
I'm sure they won't be awful.

You realize you only have
five strings.
You're missing a string there.

1462
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:51,928
Five strings.
You're missing a string there.
Oh.

You're missing a string there.
Oh.

string, 'cause I don't use it
that often.

1466
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:57,667
String, 'cause I don't use it

You mean, the "e" string --

1468
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,138
I think it's all right.
You mean, the "e" string --
pretty essential in most chords,

00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,006
you mean, the "e" string --

00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:49,986
"The sinner's prayer" with me?

"The sinner's prayer."

1678
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,520
The what prayer?
"The sinner's prayer."
It'll take five minutes, and I

1679
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:52,855
"the sinner's prayer."
It'll take five minutes, and I
promise you will feel so much

1680
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,256
it'll take five minutes, and I
promise you will feel so much
better after you're saved.

1681
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,692
Promise you will feel so much
better after you're saved.
What does that even mean?

1682
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,662
Better after you're saved.
What does that even mean?
From hell, silly.

1683
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,764
What does that even mean?
From hell, silly.
Okay.

From hell, silly.
Okay.

Okay.

Most of my friends are probably

most of my friends are probably
going to hell, and I would hate

Getting in touch with our spirit

00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,105
Guides.

Wait. Hold on.
Did you say spirit guides?
Do they get, like, all their

00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,152
Thing.
Who the fuck is he, anyway?
I have no idea.

1742
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,054
Who the fuck is he, anyway?
I have no idea.
If YouTube wasn't a thing, tebow

1743
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:06,455
I have no idea.
If YouTube wasn't a thing, tebow
wouldn't be, either.

If YouTube wasn't a thing, tebow

vow of celibacy.
Okay.

Vow of celibacy.
Okay.
What's that supposed to mean?

Okay.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. Just okay.

What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. Just okay.
No, no.

00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,168
Nothing. Just okay.
No, no.
That was a loaded "okay."

No, no.
That was a loaded "okay."
Lacey, if you have a problem,

It's not that my brother has
joined the priesthood, Sasha.

1776
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:01,510
It's not that my brother has
joined the priesthood, Sasha.
It's just that he knows better

1777
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:02,878
joined the priesthood, Sasha.
It's just that he knows better
than to stick his dick into

1778
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,812
it's just that he knows better
than to stick his dick into
crazy.

1779
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:04,547
Than to stick his dick into
crazy.
Oh, come on.

Couple weeks.
Okay.
And where on God's green did you

00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:19,562
okay.
And where on God's green did you
find dawn?

1794
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:20,629
And where on God's green did you
find dawn?
There's nothing wrong with

There's nothing wrong with
dawn.

1796

There's nothing wrong with
dawn.
Kyle overreacts.

1797
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:22,831
Dawn.
Kyle overreacts.
It wasn't that big a deal.

1798
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,966
Kyle overreacts.
It wasn't that big a deal.
She just has a couple unorthodox

1799

it wasn't that big a deal.
She just has a couple unorthodox
opinions.

1800
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:25,968
She just has a couple unorthodox
opinions.
Who doesn't?

1801
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,670
Opinions.
Who doesn't?
Unorthodox opinions?

1802
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,939
Who doesn't?
Unorthodox opinions?
Sasha, her opinion was that the

1803
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,241
unorthodox opinions?
Sasha, her opinion was that the
final solution was a swell idea.

1804
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:33,576
Sasha, her opinion was that the
final solution was a swell idea.
That's not unorthodox.

1805
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,945
Final solution was a swell idea.
That's not unorthodox.
That's a crime against humanity!

1806
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,046
That's not unorthodox.
That's a crime against humanity!
Oh, whatever.

00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,048
That's a crime against humanity!
Oh, whatever.

Sasha, I get that you want to
see him happy.
I do!

See him happy.
I do!
<i>I</i> want to see him happy.

1811
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,986
I do!
<i>I</i> want to see him happy.
But I really don't think that

1812
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:45,154
<i>i</i> want to see him happy.
But I really don't think that
this is the way to do it.

1813
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:47,556
But I really don't think that
this is the way to do it.
Wait. Where are you going?

1814
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,857
This is the way to do it.
Wait. Where are you going?

01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,247
One thing.
I got mace.
Okay?

2096
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:27,555
So...
So!
Matthew?

2097
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,857
So!
Matthew?
Not the ending you were

2098
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,492
Matthew?
Not the ending you were
expecting from this date, huh?

2099
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:31,826
Not the ending you were
expecting from this date, huh?
Not exactly.

2100
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,695
Expecting from this date, huh?
Not exactly.
But, to be honest, I'm happy it

2101
01:05:33,697 --> 01:05:34,729
not exactly.
But, to be honest, I'm happy it
ended this way.

2102
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:35,397
But, to be honest, I'm happy it
ended this way.
Yeah?

2103
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,731
Ended this way.
Yeah?
Yeah.

2104
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,266
Yeah?
Yeah.
The way I see it, people just

2105
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,534
yeah.
The way I see it, people just
jump into bed way too soon.

2106
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,802
The way I see it, people just
jump into bed way too soon.
It fucks everything up.

2107
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,470
Jump into bed way too soon.
It fucks everything up.
I couldn't agree with you

2108
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,772
it fucks everything up.
I couldn't agree with you
more!

2109
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,373
I couldn't agree with you
more!
But I thought that's what you

2110
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,374
more!
But I thought that's what you
were looking for.

2111
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:46,808
But I thought that's what you
were looking for.
Eh.

2112
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,443
Were looking for.
Eh.
It's kind of more what my

2113
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,278
eh.
It's kind of more what my
ex-wife is looking for, for me.

2114
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,514
It's kind of more what my
ex-wife is looking for, for me.
Oh.

2115
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:55,250
Ex-wife is looking for, for me.
Oh.
You know, I half-responded to

2116
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,986
oh.
You know, I half-responded to
your dating video out of, like,

2117
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,754
you know, I half-responded to
your dating video out of, like,
morbid curiosity.

2118
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:02,290
Your dating video out of, like,
morbid curiosity.
I was enthralled with your

2119
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:06,361
morbid curiosity.
I was enthralled with your
undoubtedly interesting tale.

2120
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:07,629
I was enthralled with your
undoubtedly interesting tale.
But can I be honest with you?

2121
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,663
Undoubtedly interesting tale.
But can I be honest with you?
You got a husband, and he's

2122
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:09,564
but can I be honest with you?
You got a husband, and he's
gonna be home any minute?

2123
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,266
You got a husband, and he's
gonna be home any minute?
No. Very funny.

2124
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,401
Gonna be home any minute?
No. Very funny.
I think you're taking this

2125
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,637
no. Very funny.
I think you're taking this
"good" ex thing a little too

2126
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,371
I think you're taking this
"good" ex thing a little too
far.

2127
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:17,806
"Good" ex thing a little too
far.
How do you mean?

2128
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,274
Far.
How do you mean?
I mean, your ex-wife is

2129
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:20,608
how do you mean?
I mean, your ex-wife is
trying to pimp you out, and

2130
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,643
I mean, your ex-wife is
trying to pimp you out, and
you're letting her.

2131
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:25,647
Trying to pimp you out, and
you're letting her.
Well...Yeah.

2132
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,948
You're letting her.
Well...Yeah.
She's just going through a

2133
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,650
well...Yeah.
She's just going through a
really rough time right now, and

2134
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,751
she's just going through a
really rough time right now, and
we're still friends.

2135
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,820
Really rough time right now, and
we're still friends.
I just want to help.

2136
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,621
We're still friends.
I just want to help.
And I get that, and it's

2137
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:34,522
I just want to help.
And I get that, and it's
noble and all.

2138
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:38,026
And I get that, and it's
noble and all.
But...Aren't you going through a

2139
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,294
noble and all.
But...Aren't you going through a
tough time?

2140
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,930
But...Aren't you going through a
tough time?
You're getting divorced, too.

2141
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:51,673
So, let me get this straight.
You can't get off until your
ex-husband does?

2142
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,274
You can't get off until your
ex-husband does?
Yep.

2143
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:54,442
Ex-husband does?
Yep.
That's the long and short of it.

2144
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,544
Yep.
That's the long and short of it.
That's crazy.

2145
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:58,313
That's the long and short of it.
That's crazy.
Tsk. What do you know?

2146
01:06:58,315 --> 01:06:59,881
That's crazy.
Tsk. What do you know?
I know normal people don't

2147
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:01,549
tsk. What do you know?
I know normal people don't
stalk their exes on dates.

2148
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:02,717
I know normal people don't
stalk their exes on dates.
And they really don't share

2149
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:03,985
stalk their exes on dates.
And they really don't share
booze with a crazy they met on

2150
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:05,387
and they really don't share
booze with a crazy they met on
the street.

2151
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:05,954
Booze with a crazy they met on
the street.
Whatever!

2152
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:07,589
The street.
Whatever!
You sure you just don't need

2153
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:08,823
whatever!
You sure you just don't need
the right guy to fuck you

2154
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,992
you sure you just don't need
the right guy to fuck you
straight?

2155
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:13,962
The right guy to fuck you
straight?
Yeah, pretty positive.

2156
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:24,939
Worth a shot.
Look.
I'm just some crazy sexual

2157
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:25,740
look.
I'm just some crazy sexual
deviant.

2158
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,308
I'm just some crazy sexual
deviant.
Clearly, if I knew shit about

2159
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,643
deviant.
Clearly, if I knew shit about
relationships, I'd still be

2160
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,078
clearly, if I knew shit about
relationships, I'd still be
living with ex-wife, I wouldn't

2161
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,913
relationships, I'd still be
living with ex-wife, I wouldn't
smell like shit, and my hand

2162
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,448
living with ex-wife, I wouldn't
smell like shit, and my hand
wouldn't be sticky.

2163
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:37,452
Smell like shit, and my hand
wouldn't be sticky.
So, consider the source.

2164
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:38,686
Wouldn't be sticky.
So, consider the source.
But it seems to me like you have

2165
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:39,888
so, consider the source.
But it seems to me like you have
some unresolved issues that you

2166
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,955
but it seems to me like you have
some unresolved issues that you
aren't addressing.

2167
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,957
Some unresolved issues that you
aren't addressing.
Oh, God, you sound just like

2168
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:43,925
aren't addressing.
Oh, God, you sound just like
my roommate!

2169
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:45,527
Oh, God, you sound just like
my roommate!
I get that a lot.

2170
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:46,494
My roommate!
I get that a lot.
Really?

2171
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,997
I get that a lot.
Really?
[ Laughing ] No.

2172
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:57,472
Well, that's my cue.
You're ditching me.
Looks to me like you could do

2173
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:58,640
you're ditching me.
Looks to me like you could do
with some contemplative alone

2174
01:07:58,642 --> 01:07:59,808
looks to me like you could do
with some contemplative alone
time.

2175
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,742
With some contemplative alone
time.
That and I just scored some

2176
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:01,743
time.
That and I just scored some
binoculars, and there are these

2177
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,744
that and I just scored some
binoculars, and there are these
apartments in the west village

2178
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,646
binoculars, and there are these
apartments in the west village
with college girls who don't

2179
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,381
apartments in the west village
with college girls who don't
know what blinds are for.

2180
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:09,350
With college girls who don't
know what blinds are for.
You are a strange dude, Jeff.

2181
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:10,518
Know what blinds are for.
You are a strange dude, Jeff.
Yep!

2182
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,821
You are a strange dude, Jeff.
Yep!
See ya.

2183
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:17,759
Thanks for the drinks, Mary,
and for the advice.
No problem, Kyle.

2184
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,360
And for the advice.
No problem, Kyle.
But do yourself a favor and

2185
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,629
no problem, Kyle.
But do yourself a favor and
start taking care of you.

2186
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,498
But do yourself a favor and
start taking care of you.
Thank you, Mary.

2187
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,366
Start taking care of you.
Thank you, Mary.
And if you ever want to take

2188
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:27,035
thank you, Mary.
And if you ever want to take
a milf out for a drink, you got

2189
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:27,836
and if you ever want to take
a milf out for a drink, you got
my number.

2190
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:28,803
A milf out for a drink, you got
my number.
Wow!

2191
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,004
My number.
Wow!
Aggressive!

2192
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:31,639
Wow!
Aggressive!
I'm a single mom!

2193
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,675
Aggressive!
I'm a single mom!
I don't have time to be coy.

2194
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:35,376
I'm a single mom!
I don't have time to be coy.
I'll see you, Mary.

2195
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:36,945
I don't have time to be coy.
I'll see you, Mary.
Bye.

2196
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:38,880
I'll see you, Mary.
Bye.
Peace!

2197
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,052
Sasha?
Shit.
What the hell are you doing

2198
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:44,619
shit.
What the hell are you doing
here?

2199
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,121
What the hell are you doing
here?
I was in the neighborhood.

2200
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:47,622
Here?
I was in the neighborhood.
You live in Brooklyn.

2201
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,723
I was in the neighborhood.
You live in Brooklyn.
Yeah, I can go out.

2202
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,091
You live in Brooklyn.
Yeah, I can go out.
It's not like I stay home all

2203
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:50,758
yeah, I can go out.
It's not like I stay home all
the time.

2204
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,494
It's not like I stay home all
the time.
No.

2205
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:53,061
The time.
No.
What?

2206
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:54,762
No.
What?
Are you spying on me?

2207
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:55,663
What?
Are you spying on me?
No, not spying.

2208
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:56,431
Are you spying on me?
No, not spying.
That's crazy!

2209
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,899
No, not spying.
That's crazy!
You're fucking spying on me.

2210
01:08:57,901 --> 01:08:58,766
That's crazy!
You're fucking spying on me.
No, I'm not.

2211
01:08:58,768 --> 01:08:59,834
You're fucking spying on me.
No, I'm not.
I -- I can't believe this.

2212
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:00,435
No, I'm not.
I -- I can't believe this.
Look.

2213
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:01,169
I -- I can't believe this.
Look.
It's not what it looks like.

2214
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,704
Look.
It's not what it looks like.
I was just going for a walk.

2215
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,806
It's not what it looks like.
I was just going for a walk.
No! You know what?

2216
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,774
I was just going for a walk.
No! You know what?
Sasha, throughout this entire

2217
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,710
no! You know what?
Sasha, throughout this entire
ludicrous exercise, all I've

2218
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,712
Sasha, throughout this entire
ludicrous exercise, all I've
been trying to do is make you

2219
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:11,412
ludicrous exercise, all I've
been trying to do is make you
happy.

2220
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,481
Been trying to do is make you
happy.
All I want is to see you happy.

2221
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,450
Happy.
All I want is to see you happy.
And you're here, what, making

2222
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:16,918
all I want is to see you happy.
And you're here, what, making
sure your schlub of an

2223
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,453
and you're here, what, making
sure your schlub of an
ex-husband still has what it

2224
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:19,687
sure your schlub of an
ex-husband still has what it
takes to get his dick wet?

2225
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,488
Ex-husband still has what it
takes to get his dick wet?
Kyle --

2226
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,123
takes to get his dick wet?
Kyle --
well, you'll be sorry to hear

2227
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,758
Kyle --
well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I failed to close yet

2228
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,893
well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I failed to close yet
another deal.

2229
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:25,693
That I failed to close yet
another deal.
What do you mean?

2230
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:26,661
Another deal.
What do you mean?
I thought you and Mary hit it

2231
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:27,562
what do you mean?
I thought you and Mary hit it
off.

2232
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:28,897
I thought you and Mary hit it
off.
Oh, we did, but that's not

2233
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:29,597
off.
Oh, we did, but that's not
the point.

2234
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,167
Oh, we did, but that's not
the point.
You once again omitted a major

2235
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:34,068
the point.
You once again omitted a major
detail about yet another woman.

2236
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,070
You once again omitted a major
detail about yet another woman.
She has a child.

2237
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:37,438
Detail about yet another woman.
She has a child.
How is that a problem?

2238
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,740
She has a child.
How is that a problem?
It's not, and Matthew seems

2239
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:39,641
how is that a problem?
It's not, and Matthew seems
like a great kid.

2240
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:40,642
It's not, and Matthew seems
like a great kid.
But you know what?

2241
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,043
Like a great kid.
But you know what?
I'm not ready to be a father.

2242
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:43,778
But you know what?
I'm not ready to be a father.
I'm not about to sacrifice my

2243
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,513
I'm not ready to be a father.
I'm not about to sacrifice my
integrity or lead an innocent

2244
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,614
I'm not about to sacrifice my
integrity or lead an innocent
woman on just 'cause you got a

2245
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,449
integrity or lead an innocent
woman on just 'cause you got a
screw loose.

2246
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,518
Woman on just 'cause you got a
screw loose.
Kyle, I am so incredibly --

2247
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,452
screw loose.
Kyle, I am so incredibly --
no!

2248
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:53,054
Kyle, I am so incredibly --
no!
If you try to apologize to me

2249
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,589
no!
If you try to apologize to me
right now, while you're

2250
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:56,090
if you try to apologize to me
right now, while you're
currently making me feel so

2251
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,759
right now, while you're
currently making me feel so
small -- fuck it.

2252
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,160
Currently making me feel so
small -- fuck it.
I'm done.

2253
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,228
Small -- fuck it.
I'm done.
Kyle, wait.

2254
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:00,929
I'm done.
Kyle, wait.
No.

2255
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,464
Kyle, wait.
No.
Keep the fucking couch!

Yep.

No, because I'm not actually

01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:38,059
No, because I'm not actually

I'm at home in my bed, having a

2276
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:39,827
here.
I'm at home in my bed, having a
terrible dream in which my

I'm at home in my bed, having a
terrible dream in which my
roommate and best friend has

roommate and best friend has
dragged me out at ungodly hour
for pastries.

2280
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:47,001
Dragged me out at ungodly hour
for pastries.
It's noon, trey.

2281
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:49,871
For pastries.
It's noon, trey.
Ungodly.

2282
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,940
It's noon, trey.
Ungodly.
Okay.

2283
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,075
Ungodly.
Okay.
Seriously?

2284
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:54,909
Okay.
Seriously?
Hmm?

2285
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:56,277
Seriously?
Hmm?
You're not gonna tell me why

2286
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:56,978
hmm?
You're not gonna tell me why
we're here?

2287
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,313
You're not gonna tell me why
we're here?
It's Tuesday.

2288
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,948
We're here?
It's Tuesday.
Yeah, I know why<i> you're</i> here.

2289
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,784
It's Tuesday.
Yeah, I know why<i> you're</i> here.
Where's your nondate?

2290
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:06,187
Yeah, I know why<i> you're</i> here.
Where's your nondate?
Don't worry about it.

2291
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,188
Where's your nondate?
Don't worry about it.
Wait a minute.

2292
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,056
Don't worry about it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2293
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:09,290
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Has it finally happened?

2294
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,025
Wait a minute.
Has it finally happened?
Have you finally branded your

2295
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,727
has it finally happened?
Have you finally branded your
ex-wife as the manipulative

2296
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,062
have you finally branded your
ex-wife as the manipulative
couch thief that she is?

2297
01:12:14,064 --> 01:12:15,663
Ex-wife as the manipulative
couch thief that she is?
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

2298
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,331
Couch thief that she is?
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.
Okay, look.

2299
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,199
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.
Okay, look.
Private eyes has a wing platter

2300
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,334
okay, look.
Private eyes has a wing platter
that is to die for!

2301
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:19,934
Private eyes has a wing platter
that is to die for!
Rick's?

2302
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,269
That is to die for!
Rick's?
They got a steak that's so good

2303
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,670
Rick's?
They got a steak that's so good
you can taste that it had

2304
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,339
they got a steak that's so good
you can taste that it had
friends.

2305
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:25,006
You can taste that it had
friends.
Lace!

2306
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,140
Friends.
Lace!
Lace just started serving

2307
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:26,808
lace!
Lace just started serving
breakfast.

2308
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,809
Lace just started serving
breakfast.
What club do you want to start

2309
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:28,876
breakfast.
What club do you want to start
with?

2310
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,244
What club do you want to start
with?
You're damaged.

2311
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:31,012
With?
You're damaged.
Come on.

2312
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,347
You're damaged.
Come on.
Tell me you wouldn't enjoy

2313
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:33,948
come on.
Tell me you wouldn't enjoy
having your steak experience

2314
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,383
tell me you wouldn't enjoy
having your steak experience
garnished with nubile, naked,

2315
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:37,051
having your steak experience
garnished with nubile, naked,
young flesh dancing around it?

2316
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,319
Garnished with nubile, naked,
young flesh dancing around it?
You say I'm sick?

2317
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:39,287
Young flesh dancing around it?
You say I'm sick?
You realize that your

2318
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:40,655
you say I'm sick?
You realize that your
insurance covers therapy, right?

2319
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,923
You realize that your
insurance covers therapy, right?
Like, two hours a week.

2320
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,658
Insurance covers therapy, right?
Like, two hours a week.
And she's not manipulative, by

2321
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,158
like, two hours a week.
And she's not manipulative, by
the way.

2322
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,660
And she's not manipulative, by
the way.
She just followed me on my last

2323
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,694
the way.
She just followed me on my last
date.

2324
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:47,128
She just followed me on my last
date.
What?

2325
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,296
Date.
What?
I know. Who does that?

2326
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:49,797
What?
I know. Who does that?
Made me feel like such a fucking

2327
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:50,365
I know. Who does that?
Made me feel like such a fucking
loser.

2328
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:51,799
Made me feel like such a fucking
loser.
No, no.

2329
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:52,934
Loser.
No, no.
I mean...

2330
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:54,268
No, no.
I mean...
What?!

2331
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,203
I mean...
What?!
Oh, my God.

2332
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,271
What?!
Oh, my God.
You still can't see it, can you?

2333
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:58,906
Oh, my God.
You still can't see it, can you?
Hmm. See what?

2334
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,074
You still can't see it, can you?
Hmm. See what?
God, you are simple.

2335
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,876
Hmm. See what?
God, you are simple.
It's not that she followed you

2336
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:02,944
God, you are simple.
It's not that she followed you
on a date, Kyle.

2337
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,679
It's not that she followed you
on a date, Kyle.
It's that she made you go on

2338
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,080
on a date, Kyle.
It's that she made you go on
dates in the first place.

2339
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,949
It's that she made you go on
dates in the first place.
We've been over this.

2340
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:09,217
Dates in the first place.
We've been over this.
Yeah, not enough, apparently.

2341
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:09,784
We've been over this.
Yeah, not enough, apparently.
Look.

2342
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:10,785
Yeah, not enough, apparently.
Look.
I don't know what kind of

2343
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:11,986
look.
I don't know what kind of
"lifetime" movie bullshit you've

2344
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:13,187
I don't know what kind of
"lifetime" movie bullshit you've
been exposing yourself to, where

2345
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,322
"lifetime" movie bullshit you've
been exposing yourself to, where
you think this is normal, but

2346
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:16,657
been exposing yourself to, where
you think this is normal, but
ex-wives do not try to get their

2347
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,892
you think this is normal, but
ex-wives do not try to get their
ex-husbands laid.

2348
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,227
Ex-wives do not try to get their
ex-husbands laid.
And ex-husbands do not allow

2349
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,862
ex-husbands laid.
And ex-husbands do not allow
themselves to be pawned off on

2350
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,663
and ex-husbands do not allow
themselves to be pawned off on
other women by ex-wives.

2351
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:23,965
Themselves to be pawned off on
other women by ex-wives.
It's not like that.

2352
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,666
Other women by ex-wives.
It's not like that.
She's just trying to make sure

2353
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:26,801
it's not like that.
She's just trying to make sure
I'm okay.

2354
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:27,735
She's just trying to make sure
I'm okay.
No, Kyle, she's trying to

2355
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,703
I'm okay.
No, Kyle, she's trying to
make sure<i> she's</i> okay.

2356
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:29,670
No, Kyle, she's trying to
make sure<i> she's</i> okay.
And that makes two of you,

2357
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:30,705
make sure<i> she's</i> okay.
And that makes two of you,
'cause she's the only person

2358
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:31,773
and that makes two of you,
'cause she's the only person
whose well-being either one of

2359
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,007
'cause she's the only person
whose well-being either one of
you seems to be concerned with.

2360
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,175
Whose well-being either one of
you seems to be concerned with.
Meanwhile, you're ignoring the

2361
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:34,842
you seems to be concerned with.
Meanwhile, you're ignoring the
big picture.

2362
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:35,676
Meanwhile, you're ignoring the
big picture.
Which is what?

2363
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:36,344
Big picture.
Which is what?
She's no longer your

2364
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:38,813
which is what?
She's no longer your
responsibility, Kyle.

2365
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,114
She's no longer your
responsibility, Kyle.
Entertaining all this shit in

2366
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:41,849
responsibility, Kyle.
Entertaining all this shit in
the first place is an exercise

2367
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,918
entertaining all this shit in
the first place is an exercise
in emotional masochism.

2368
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,420
The first place is an exercise
in emotional masochism.
I mean, she doesn't get you.
