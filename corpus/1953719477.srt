1
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,728
( Speaking Arabic )

2
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,128
( man speaking Arabic )

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,164
(coughing )

4
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,690
( man speaking Arabic )

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,722
After all these years,
we are blessed.

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,766
Omphalos, the lost temple of Pan.

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,241
What mastery.

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,607
Looks like the work
of Philodysos,

9
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,366
fourth century BC.

10
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,722
(woman reading in Greek)

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,881
Man:
What is that?

12
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,202
It's a map of Pandemonium.

13
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,011
The mythical world of the Pans?

14
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,642
All of Classical Greece
considered it very much real,

15
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,882
a place where Pans roamed free...

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,041
( Puffs )

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,285
...seduced by forest-haunting nymphs
of legendary beauty,

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,802
a circus where demons
were entertained

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,122
by the torture of the damned.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,084
There was even a pond

21
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,282
where beneath
its magical waters

22
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,001
held all the world's fantasies
and nightmares.

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,249
Olympus-- heaven.
Hades-- hell.

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,768
Pandemonium--
the pathway to both,

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,329
thus more like our world
than any other myth.

26
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,643
Charles, it doesn't look
anything like a map.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,082
You're right. How odd.

28
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,083
Nigel:
What is it?

29
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,483
Charles: Seems to be
some sort of ritual item.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,045
( Puffs )

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,250
Why is it spewing out
fire and brimstone?

32
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,169
Yes.

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,608
The rite of Pandemonium.

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,843
It-- it's some sort of
instructional chart

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,525
on how to build it.

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,321
Charles,
we must reconstruct it.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,644
Yes, we must.

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,043
The modern world has yet to see
anything like this.

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,042
( Phone rings )

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,361
Man:
Hello.

41
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,444
Hello, sir. This is Nigel.
We've had success. We found it.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,762
Excellent, Nigel, excellent.

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,082
Nigel: This is everything
you asked for and more.

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,083
Charles and the others
are constructing it now.

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,244
God damn it.

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,444
I told him not to touch a thing
until I was present.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,365
My instructions were exact!

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,364
Put him on the telephone
immediately.

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,363
Nigel: Sorry, sir,
but he stayed on the island

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,727
and sent me to the mainland
to contact you.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,121
I will leave for the island
at once.

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,442
I'll be there at the dock
to meet you.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,329
God damn it.

54
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,162
( Motor whirring )

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,801
Go find Nigel.
He was supposed to be here.

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,724
I'll find him.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,082
( Birds chirping )

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,651
( rustling )

59
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,485
Hello? Anyone there?

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,484
( Rustling )

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,688
( fluttering )

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,130
( gasps )

63
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,049
They're dead.

64
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,885
They're all gone.

65
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,929
Nigel...

66
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,569
what have you done?

67
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,767
It wasn't me.

68
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,161
It was the game

69
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,250
Charles constructed
from the cave drawings we found.

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,289
It changed us all.

71
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,681
A game. Nigel?

72
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,569
Where is the game now?

73
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,246
I tried to destroy it.

74
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,801
It wouldn't let me.

75
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,527
Sol hid it in a place
it will never be found.

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,924
Nigel, you cannot
keep it from me.

77
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,003
This island isn't that big.

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,288
Now with your help
or without your help,

79
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,249
we will eventually find it.

80
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,768
I will find it, Nigel,
because that is what I do.

81
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,002
- No.
- I will find it.

82
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,049
Now I want
what I have paid for,

83
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,929
and I want it now.

84
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,206
(gunshot)

85
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,368
( hammer clicks,
gunshot echoes )

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,731
- Woman: Is that it there?
- Man: Pretty sweet, huh?

87
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,442
- Woman: Whoo!
- Man: Okay.

88
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,562
Woman:
Thank you.

89
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,688
Whoo!
(woman chuckles )

90
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,411
- Man: Thank you very much.
- Woman: What are those?

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,847
Man: These must be
Pete's lobster traps.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,764
Woman:
Sweet.

93
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,241
Who's Pete?

94
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,641
- ( Gunshot cracks )
- Woman: Oh, my God.

95
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,768
Get off my island!

96
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,567
Pete! What, are you nuts?
It's me-- Anton.

97
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,131
Oh.

98
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,442
Damn, boy, you did grow up,
didn't you?

99
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,001
I thought you weren't coming
till the 9th.

100
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,891
It is the 9th.

101
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,805
Oh. I'll be right down.

102
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,887
Sorry about that, ma'am.

103
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,202
Pete:
Hey, how are you doing?

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,085
- I take it we're the first to arrive.
- Yeah.

105
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,009
I'm gonna call Renee
and see how far off they are.

106
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,487
- Pete: Oh, don't bother.
- Excuse me?

107
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,962
You didn't happen to notice any cell
phone towers on the way in here, did ya?

108
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,002
- What's with the dead animals?
- ( woman groaning )

109
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,686
It's not exactly the welcome
I was asking for.

110
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,531
Pete: Well, the animals need
a little help getting up on my wall.

111
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,365
I gotta cut the head off
and draw the blood out of them first.

112
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,921
Could you please take them off
before my friends arrive?

113
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,003
Did you happen to bring
what I asked you to bring?

114
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,491
Sure did.

115
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,603
Oh.

116
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,001
Oh! Don't throw it.

117
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,686
Young lady, you ever seen
a grown man cry?

118
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,447
Well, you would have if this would
have hit the rocks and exploded.

119
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,762
This here is
the nectar of the gods.

120
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,810
- ( Anton laughs )
- Well, the house is wide open.

121
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,008
You know the way up there,
don't you?

122
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,326
Anton:
Yep.

123
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,882
Pete: You two have a good time,
do whatever you're gonna do.

124
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,129
Don't go out in the woods.
I still got traps out there.

125
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,044
<i>'Naps'?</i>

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,001
Great.

127
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,811
Woman: She'd better not bring
TV dinners and sushi

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,610
like she did in Aruba.

129
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,451
Just because we look alike
does not mean we think alike.

130
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,086
I know, I know. You're the good twin.
She's the evil one.

131
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,241
Exactly.

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,562
You're obviously
the smart one.

133
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,688
That's right,
and don't forget it.

134
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,767
Why wouldn't
Erica and Anton tell us

135
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,127
that the pier was a mile and a half away
from the train station?

136
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,049
Probably 'cause
they weren't anticipating

137
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,720
you packing
your entire wardrobe.

138
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,166
Hey, look, there's Veronique.

139
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,561
Wow, she sure didn't waste any time
showing off her new boobs.

140
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,927
- New boobs?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,605
- Veronique.
- Josh.

142
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,882
Hey, Josh, Renee.

143
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,042
Josh, hello...?

144
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,844
Asshole.

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,571
- ( Veronique squeals )
- Hey.

146
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,324
- Oh, so good to see you.
- You too.

147
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,002
We saw you in "Astro Babes."
You were amazing. You were amazing.

148
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,845
You were like Jessica Simpson
meets Meryl Streep.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,082
- Stop.
- Wasn't she great, babe?

150
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,565
( All chattering )

151
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,200
- Come, give me a little squeeze.
- Kathy: Hey, girl.

152
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,204
Trent: Playboy, what's going on, sir?
How are you doing, man?

153
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,409
( All chattering )

154
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,642
Hey, big man. What's up?

155
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,048
Where's Anton and Erica? Aren't they
supposed to have a ferry or something?

156
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,965
- Rick: Whoo!
- ( horn honking )

157
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,089
Who invited him?

158
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,129
( Scoffs )
Don't look at me.

159
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,250
- What's up, Josh my man?
- What up, big dawg?

160
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,810
What?

161
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,363
Come on, hop in, you guys. I got
a cooler full of beers in the back.

162
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,646
Ugh.

163
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,406
I love you, sweetness.

164
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,882
Kathy:
Aww, how did he do it?

165
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,963
On a horse-and-buggy ride
through Central Park.

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,610
Veronique:
Aww, that is so romantic.

167
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,371
- Oh, shit.
- Kathy: So do you guys have a date set?

168
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,124
- You did not.
- I did.

169
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,248
- I did, I did, I did.
- Oh, shit.

170
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,563
- Does Erica know about this?
- Yeah, of course.

171
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,370
So do you guys
have a date set?

172
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,643
Yes, sometime in June
after graduation.

173
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,201
Anton: Maybe our kids will grow up
to be best friends too.

174
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,243
Kids? Who said anything
about having kids?

175
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,091
Kathy: Oh, God, Trent's been bugging me
for years to get married,

176
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,090
but he couldn't afford a ring
half that size on his salary.

177
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,647
- Renee: No. That's horrible.
- Kathy: I know.

178
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,167
- ( Women chattering )
- Woman: It's beautiful.

179
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,766
Nice try, Rick.
You're not staying in my room.

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,724
Don't think
you're staying with me.

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,002
I only got a single bed
in my room.

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,841
- Hey, Anton.
- What?

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,891
Why is everyone acting like they didn't
know I was coming here this weekend?

184
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,044
Rick, you got some real balls
coming here.

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,885
Erica-- she's still pissed
about the bachelor party incident,

186
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,326
and you knew that.

187
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,841
Shit, no, man, I didn't.

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,447
Look, what if I have a little powwow
with her, you know, apologize?

189
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,683
My advice to you,
stay out of her way.

190
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,291
( Insects chirping )

191
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,603
( buoy bell ringing )

192
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,287
Pete: On a stormy night
in April 1952,

193
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,489
a merchant marine ship
bound for Iceland

194
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,608
left Bar Harbor.

195
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,928
This was no ordinary trip.

196
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,242
Once the ship got out to sea,

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,051
for some unknown reason,
the first mate went crazy

198
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,522
and slit the throats
of everybody on board the ship--

199
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,526
the captain, his wife,
even his children

200
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,526
all sliced from ear to ear

201
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,682
before this monster of a man

202
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,810
took his own life.

203
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,849
The ship eventually
ground ashore

204
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,247
on the north side
of the island.

205
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,721
And when the police
found the ship,

206
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,770
they say that the stench of death
was so thick,

207
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,725
you could smell it
from a mile away.

208
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,844
But that's not all.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,526
In 1971

210
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,963
there were some backpackers
exploring the island

211
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,566
and they turned up missing.

212
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,123
And the rescue team found them
in the hull of the ship--

213
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,089
dead,

214
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,881
with their throats slit
from ear to ear.

215
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,806
And on a wall nearby,
dripping in fresh blood,

216
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,928
was the ghoul

217
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,691
of Beacon's Isle.

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,962
Even to this day

219
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,487
there are those who say

220
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,450
the ghoul is still here

221
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,170
on this island,

222
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,006
lurking for his next kill.

223
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,164
- Beacon's Isle has got a death curse.
-( people laughing )

224
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,448
You are doomed.

225
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,961
All of you-- you are doomed.

226
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,971
And what if the ghoul

227
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,963
is a real person,

228
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,487
very much alive

229
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,644
and living on this island?

230
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,201
Do they have any idea
who the murderer was?

231
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,930
No one knows.

232
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,920
Hell, you could be
looking at him.

233
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,691
- ( Distant howling )
- ( dogs barking )

234
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,248
You kids have fun.

235
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,600
- How creepy.
- ( Rick laughing )

236
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,650
- Are you shitting me, man? Come on.
- Oh, my God.

237
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,121
( Music playing softly )

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,449
Oh, man, I ain't eaten like that
in a long time.

239
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,011
Haven't.

240
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,730
Say what?

241
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,009
You have a college education
and you still say words like "ain't."

242
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,283
( laughs )

243
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,448
Bro, remember the cheerleader--
the one that you had a crush on--

244
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,967
you know, Charlene Hutchison,
you know, sophomore year or whatever?

245
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,929
You gave her your number
after basketball practice

246
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,368
and you always wondered
why she never called you back.

247
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,961
It's because your balls
was hanging out, man.

248
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,849
( People giggling )

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,968
- Shut up.
- No, I'm dead serious.

250
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,282
Out of them little tiny-ass PE shorts
that we used to wear.

251
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,249
They looked like that turkey neck
on Thanksgiving.

252
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,890
That's what was
going around the high school.

253
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
Did you bring
any other games with you?

254
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,646
Wrinkled too.

255
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,768
So what's on TV?

256
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,924
Veronique, the reason
we came to this island

257
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,646
is to watch the fire,
take in the stars,

258
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,211
get away from it all.

259
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,601
You know, nature.

260
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,404
Yeah, Veronique, come on.

261
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,483
I promised Renee I wouldn't watch
any of the ball games.

262
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,883
- You gotta suffer too.
- Can't we watch a little TV?

263
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,408
No. Watching TV is the last thing
in the world I want to do out here.

264
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,762
Not even
"Astro Babes from Mars"?

265
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,809
- Get out. Put it on.
- Veronique: No.

266
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
- ( All chattering )
- No, seriously, that's embarrassing.

267
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,887
- Erica: No way.
- Veronique: That's embarrassing.

268
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,281
( All chattering )

269
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,851
Post. Post.

270
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,287
- Josh: Keep it up.
- Hey, over here.

271
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,807
Josh: Keep it up. Keep it up.
What are you doing? No.

272
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,248
- What are you doing? No.
- Rick: What the fuck?

273
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,200
- ( Laughing )
- That was a rental, you know.

274
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,249
Looks like there's gonna be
some late fees.

275
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,051
Veronique:
Watch a little--

276
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,168
- Kathy: Whoa.
- Trent: Oh. Hey.

277
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,084
- Robert: Oh, great.
- Trent: Hey. Hello. Hello.

278
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,561
( All chattering )

279
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,330
Robert: That radio station
sucked anyway.

280
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,609
Anton: Must be the circuit breakers.
It's an old house. It happens.

281
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,603
- Josh: It's okay. I got you.
- Trent: Goddamn, Boy Scout.

282
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,843
- A flashlight already, huh?
- Sit tight. It'll just take a minute.

283
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,844
Yeah, hook up some cable
while you're back there, MacGyver.

284
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,809
Kathy: Come on,
there's got to be a flashlight

285
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,962
or candles around here somewhere.
Guys, come look.

286
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,810
( Rick laughs )

287
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,167
Josh: Shit, the lights are out
in the whole house.

288
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,922
( Planks clatter)

289
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,402
Anton?

290
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,290
(wood squeaks )

291
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,966
Oh, shit!

292
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,645
Dude, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

293
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,404
- Anton, are you okay, sweetie?
- Watch out. Watch out.

294
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,289
- Anton: I'm all right.
- I found a flashlight.

295
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,930
Watch your step.
You'll fall through.

296
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,970
Anton: You're not gonna believe
what I found here--

297
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,770
a whole 'another room.

298
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,330
These don't work.

299
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,764
Someone must have
sealed this.

300
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,251
( All chattering )

301
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,922
All:
Whoa.

302
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,888
Robert: Looks like
some sort of game.

303
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,929
Anton:
Let me see.

304
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,005
Trent:
Hey, check this out, guys.

305
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,801
It says, "Apollo had forged
a magical flute

306
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,088
from lightning and earth
as a gift to Hades,

307
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,925
the once Eden-like
kingdom of the Pans,

308
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,447
to celebrate
their laughter and song.

309
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,291
But the lure
of the powerful flute

310
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,490
proved far too great
for this once naive, fawn-like race

311
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,803
who soon stumbled
into a deadly feud

312
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,328
- of chaos and destruction."
- Ooh.

313
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,687
(all chuckling)

314
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,729
"Remember,

315
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,882
neither the keenest mind

316
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,486
nor the sharpest wit

317
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,530
is a match for the truest heart.

318
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,127
Each player selects
a game piece..."

319
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,884
Yeah, yeah, we get it.
It's like Monopoly.

320
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,042
You roll the dice
and move a space. Let's play.

321
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,646
- I don't know about this, you guys.
- Randophomos,

322
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,002
the ghost oracle,

323
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,085
- and the carnival of curses.
- Veronique: Curses.

324
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,881
The haunted forest
of the Furies.

325
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,530
- Ooh.
- ( Trent laughing diabolically )

326
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,889
Guys, stop it. Pete's ghost story
really freaked me out.

327
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,530
- Did you guys hear that?
- Man: What?

328
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,205
- Wait, listen. Listen.
- Knock it off.

329
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,561
Whoo-oo...

330
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,643
It's the ghoul of Beacon's Isle!

331
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,609
-( Laughing )
- Stop it. You're scaring me.

332
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,728
-( Roars )
- ( screams )

333
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,604
- Don't you ever make that face again!
- What's wrong with you? What face?

334
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,048
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

335
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,487
Oh, my God, man.
That was so fucking creepy.

336
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,689
-( People laughing )
- Erica: Did you see that?

337
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,522
Rick:
"First, on your quest,

338
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,202
you must pass the haunted forest
of the Furies.

339
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
Pray that you do not
stop there,

340
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
for these three
demon-like nymphs

341
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,690
named Grudge, Retaliation
and Unnameable

342
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,049
will taunt you
with a deadly kiss."

343
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,884
Ugh.
(giggles)

344
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,761
"Draw a card that corresponds
with the space you land on

345
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,161
and dare to tell the truth.

346
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,721
And be true to that dare.

347
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,326
They can taste secrets
on your lips

348
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,450
and smell the lies
on your breath."

349
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,568
- Veronique: Ooh.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

350
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,848
That's why I'm here tonight.
That's where all the action is at.

351
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,241
( Laughter)

352
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,883
That's right. I'm right here.
I'll take this creature,

353
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,929
bam! Hit right there.

354
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,401
Then I grab one of these cards,
gentlemen.

355
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,647
"Bespeak thy hurt unspoken

356
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,724
by a trust
that hath been broken."

357
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,803
- Rick: Ooh.
- ( man chuckles )

358
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,369
- Billie Holiday CD, dawg.
- Oh, come on, man.

359
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,682
You borrowed my Billie Holiday CD
and you never returned that shit.

360
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,968
- ( All chattering )
- It's my Billie Holiday CD, man.

361
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,050
Look, my grand mama gave me that shit.
Look, that's a classic.

362
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,090
Come on, man.
It has to be bad, like really bad.

363
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,890
Fuck y'all.
All y'all are gonna burn in hell.

364
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,611
- ( Laughter)
- All right.

365
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,808
Rob,

366
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,681
I got you your job, man.

367
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,241
You know, as a matter of fact,
I'm the one who got you started

368
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,448
in the mortgage business
in the first place.

369
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,803
Before me, I mean, you was
greener than fucking lettuce.

370
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,928
And in one year

371
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,731
not only do they
promote you above me,

372
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,201
but they make you
a branch manager.

373
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,927
And in all that time

374
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,401
not once do I ever recall you
even saying what?

375
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,722
"Thank you."

376
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,045
Where's the fucking gratitude
in that, man?

377
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,444
Scratch that shit!
The Hathaway loan-- it was mine.

378
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,602
It's fucked up, the way
they took it away from me

379
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,651
after I busted my ass on that
and they gave it to your wonky ass.

380
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,842
Fuck that. I'm jealous, all right?
It's out there.

381
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,570
I'm jealous, okay?

382
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,762
Whew.

383
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,322
Well, perhaps I shouldn't have
taken that deal.

384
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,603
But if they didn't give it to me, they
would have just given it to another LO.

385
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,489
Oh, man.

386
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,043
I should have at the very least
shared the commission with you.

387
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,642
And, you know, forgive me
for not being more appreciative.

388
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,202
You did hook me up with the job
and, in turn, a career.

389
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,045
And I'm sorry if I never
really said thank you.

390
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,043
Truth be told, man, you are
one hell of a loan officer, all right?

391
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,568
Well, look at it this way--
now that I got some clout there,

392
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,922
I can make sure
you get all the best leads,

393
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,447
you know,
the big money deals.

394
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,929
And I'll repay you tenfold
for all the things you've done for me,

395
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,482
friend to friend.

396
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,768
- Veronique: Aww.
- Josh: Yeah.

397
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,561
Josh:
Come on. Come on.

398
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,246
Trent:
All right.

399
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,404
Don't you just love
when men hug?

400
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,086
Rick:
I knew it was all an act.

401
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,800
Are you ever gonna tell me
why they took the deal away from you?

402
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,209
So whose turn is it?
Whose go is it?

403
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,931
-( Huffs )
- ( people chattering )

404
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,241
"On a bed of nails
rests the burden of blame.

405
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,769
Thou must confess
thy secret shame."

406
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,602
I don't know.

407
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,410
Uh...

408
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,769
okay, look, there's no right way
to say this, so maybe I shouldn't.

409
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,161
Look, man, just go ahead and say
the shit. Just spit the shit out.

410
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,970
You'll feel better, man.

411
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,122
All right.

412
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,205
Kathy, there's something
I've always wanted to tell you.

413
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,926
I've never forgiven myself
for what happened to your brother.

414
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,970
Rick, don't.
I don't want to talk about it.

415
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,963
I want you to know
that there's not a day that goes by

416
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,202
that I don't regret
giving him those keys.

417
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,569
He swore to me
that he was sober.

418
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,122
I don't know, I guess I was just
so drunk, I believed him.

419
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,329
But all I'm trying to say is
my life has never been the same

420
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,687
and it's never gonna be.

421
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,564
He was my best friend.

422
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,485
He was your best friend
and you let him drive

423
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,042
with 1.8% alcohol in his system.

424
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,248
Okay?
That's twice the legal limit.

425
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,686
I don't want to play this game
anymore.

426
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,729
You know what?
I'll never forgive you, Rick, okay?

427
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,690
I only tolerate you because you
were so close with Danny.

428
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,491
And why he chose to have you
as a best friend

429
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,130
I will never fucking know.

430
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,601
Kathy, come on.
You gotta forgive me.

431
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,808
- No.
- Look, that's enough of this,

432
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,440
all right? Rick, look,
this shit has gone too far.

433
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,682
- Rick: Come on, Kathy.
- He shouldn't have come here.

434
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,604
Remember me, you and Danny
jumping off the cliffs,

435
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,649
swimming around the rocks
in the cove?

436
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,201
Remember when we used to joyride
in your dad's car,

437
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,522
and when we brought it back,
we had to shut the light off

438
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,967
and put it in neutral
and wheel it in the driveway?

439
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,168
- So Dad wouldn't hear it.
- Yeah.

440
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,887
I will never forgive you,

441
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,520
because you had the opportunity
to stop him,

442
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,563
and you didn't.

443
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,963
And as cruel as it may sound,
I want you to live with that pain

444
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,929
for the rest
of your fucking life,

445
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,607
just like I have to live
with the pain of loss.

446
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,206
Danny was wild.

447
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,323
That's what we all loved
about him.

448
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,290
Look, man, I'm sorry, Rick,
but nowhere in the rules does it say

449
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,727
that anyone
has to forgive you.

450
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,370
( Kathy huffs)

451
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,761
Let's just get back to trying
to play this game, man.

452
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,763
Since we're not going
in order,

453
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,167
I'll go.
I'll bring back the fun.

454
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,243
- Yeah.
- ( people chuckling )

455
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,006
Josh:
Bring it back.

456
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,811
Doubles.
It's my lucky day.

457
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,208
I know I put another trap
out here...

458
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,044
somewhere.

459
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,601
If I have known
they were coming today,

460
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,524
I could have got up
this morning

461
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,364
and done it
when the sun was still up

462
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,603
instead of wandering around here
in the dark like a jackass.

463
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,521
I don't want some city slicker

464
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,163
getting caught in a trap
and having his leg chewed off...

465
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,121
and suing my ass.

466
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,408
"Thou may not have given
much thought of it,

467
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,042
yet whom in this room
doth thou secretly covet?"

468
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,406
I don't get it.

469
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,244
It means, who would you
like to get with?

470
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,051
Come on, babe,
you know it's me.

471
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,488
This is embarrassing. Um...

472
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,325
Come on, girl, just spit it out.

473
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,529
Fine, so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

474
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,011
Josh and Anton.

475
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,208
Anton:
Oh, Jesus.

476
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,125
- ( Veronique chuckles )
- Together?

477
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,287
Veronique:
Wait, let me explain.

478
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,808
Anton, because he's the sensitive,
romantic type.

479
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,806
And Josh, because he's
the big and strong,

480
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,850
take-charge kind of guy.
And I always thought

481
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,321
if I could have a combination
of the two,

482
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,723
that I would have
the perfect man.

483
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,406
Too bad, girl,
'cause they're both taken.

484
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,927
And don't you forget it.

485
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,123
Don't look so defeated.
It's just a game, right?

486
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,930
Okay, my turn.

487
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,208
Whoo!

488
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,610
Here.

489
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,801
"Apology is an open door,

490
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,407
forgiveness is a closed gate,
bolted and locked.

491
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,968
When unresolved,
issues still await."

492
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,885
Okay, Rick,

493
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,122
actually,
there's been something

494
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,368
that's been bugging me
for kind of a long time,

495
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,126
something that happened between
you and I that I'd like to talk about.

496
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,164
The morning after the new pledges
at Phi Kappa Delta

497
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,209
where we crashed out
and spent the night

498
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,249
because we were all partying
really hard,

499
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,405
well, I woke up on the couch
half-naked

500
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,609
and you were lying next to me
with your shirt off.

501
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,047
- Wait, wait, what the fuck?
- Kathy: Hey, you know,

502
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,044
hold on one second, okay? You don't
need to get all fucking riled up

503
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,043
because you and I weren't
even together at the time.

504
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,249
No, actually, we were together.
Look, you got your dates all fucked up.

505
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,402
Orientation didn't begin
at the beginning of the school year.

506
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,887
- It began in the summer.
- Let's just give Rick a chance

507
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,249
to explain himself before we jump
to any conclusions, all right?

508
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,522
- So, Rick...
- Yeah, all right.

509
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,762
Explain.
Explain to me.

510
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,127
No, explain to me
what happened that night.

511
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,288
( Huffs)

512
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,920
I gotta admit, I was
just as confused as you were

513
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,168
- when we woke up next to each other.
- Bullshit.

514
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,766
I can't even believe that you never even
told me that this shit happened.

515
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,924
What am I gonna tell you about this for?
You're friends with the asshole.

516
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,241
Erica:
You know, Rick,

517
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,006
is there anybody in this room that has
something nice to say about you?

518
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,605
- Erica, please.
- Shut up, Anton.

519
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,610
You know, when your father died,
I thought you might actually change,

520
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,087
maybe get your life together,
become more mature.

521
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,767
But instead, you quit school

522
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,605
and right away start throwing
your father's money around.

523
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,762
And how do you show it off
to my husband?

524
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,969
By renting out a penthouse
full of strippers and hookers.

525
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,489
Erica, you've had it in for me
before we even met, okay?

526
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,645
But does anybody here talk about
the good things I've done, huh?

527
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,768
Anton ever tell you
who loaned him that cash

528
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,161
for that little
honeymoon of yours?

529
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,449
You're looking at him,
right here.

530
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,080
Oh, yeah?
With your father's money.

531
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,004
Yeah, well, my father's money

532
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,084
paid for that fucking rock
on your sister's finger.

533
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,004
- Rick, what the fuck?
- Anton: Rick.

534
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,562
You gotta walk away right now.
It's getting out of hand.

535
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,367
Okay, fine.

536
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,450
I'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

537
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,921
Enjoy your game.

538
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,447
Don't let the door kick you in the ass
on the way out.

539
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,047
- I wouldn't worry about that one, hon.
- Fucking prick.

540
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,846
Well, that was fun.

541
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,651
Yay. I'm going to roll now.

542
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,689
Okay.

543
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,410
( Dice rattling )

544
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,321
( people chattering,
laughing )

545
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,202
( glass shatters )

546
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,169
Renee:
"Bestow a sweet peck

547
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,484
of innocent bliss to the person
seated beside thee,

548
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,722
a harmless kiss."

549
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,004
( chuckles )

550
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,682
( Josh chuckles )
What is this, "Spin the Bottle"?

551
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,281
What's everybody
looking at me for?

552
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,444
Kiss him. What the hell do I care?
It's no big deal.

553
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,922
- Veronique: Hey, do it. Do it.
- ( all chattering )

554
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,401
- Kiss him. Kiss him.
- Veronique: Do it.

555
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,961
Erica: Kiss him,
kiss him, kiss him.

556
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,485
All right, I'll kiss him.

557
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,247
- Trent: Oh!
- Veronique: Whoo!

558
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,128
- Who wants margaritas?
- Renee: I do.

559
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,930
- I'll go. I'll go.
- Kathy: I do.

560
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,884
Let's go.

561
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,851
Hey, guys, what was up with that
back there?

562
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,367
Does, like, everyone think
I'm a prude or something?

563
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,251
Kathy: Well, you wear a T-shirt
over your bathing suit.

564
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,165
- You don't drink. You don't smoke.
- I have asthma.

565
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,971
Erica, I got you a vibrator
for your bachelorette party

566
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,521
and you thought
it was a back massager.

567
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,570
That's so sad. Aww.

568
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,008
Well, at least I don't crawl into bed
with perfect strangers

569
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,801
and pretend it's acting just because
there's a camera in the room.

570
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,442
First of all, B-movie is Shakespeare
compared to porno.

571
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,170
No, sweetie.

572
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,005
Shakespeare is Shakespeare.

573
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,322
A B-movie is porno.

574
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,845
Excuse me.

575
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,082
Well, maybe to a prude
like you.

576
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,449
Shit. This is never
gonna come out.

577
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,167
- Here, put this on. Give me that.
- Okay.

578
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,448
I'll wash it out
before it stains.

579
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,569
Don't let her get to you, okay?

580
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,451
I admire
how outgoing you are.

581
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,762
( Both chuckle )

582
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,202
Veronique: So what's the matter
with you and Trent?

583
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,761
You guys make
such a good couple.

584
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,691
He's been so distant lately

585
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,803
ever since they promoted
Robert over him.

586
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,371
He won't even talk about it.

587
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,204
Yeah, I heard him
kind of dodge that earlier.

588
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,203
Yeah. We've been together
for five years.

589
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,409
If he can't talk about his feelings
and his problems, then it's useless.

590
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,525
I think what you need
is a good one-night stand.

591
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,284
Great sex cures all.

592
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,801
I could never cheat on Trent
with another guy.

593
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,485
What about with a woman?

594
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,529
Kathy:
I don't go that way.

595
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,489
You should try it.

596
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,802
I have. It's liberating.

597
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,329
You keep looking.

598
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,324
Do you like 'em?

599
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,130
( Chuckles )

600
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,444
I was noticing
what a great job they did.

601
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,840
They look fabulous.

602
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,002
- Feel 'em.
- What?

603
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,482
Come on, don't be embarrassed.
They feel natural.

604
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,845
Come on.

605
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,160
- Ahem.
- What's wrong?

606
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,967
(sighs)
Mmm...

607
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,971
Rick? Oh, you pis-

608
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,882
Shit.

609
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,687
Anton: I hope you got enough
batteries for the boom box.

610
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,411
- ( Robert chuckles )
- Hey, you know,

611
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,446
I wonder, what would Rick do

612
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,729
if he knew that we were
smoking his shit?

613
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,927
(laughing)

614
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,730
Well, at least he's good
for something.

615
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,042
(all giggling)

616
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,641
- What? What's so funny?
- Look what you're doing right now.

617
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,484
Josh:
Oh.

618
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,884
- You're so fucking rude.
- ( blows raspberry )

619
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,401
I can smoke
and I did that at the same time.

620
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,891
(laughing)

621
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,242
Okay, my roll.
Let's do this.

622
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,687
Anton:
Go ahead.

623
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,689
- Are you okay?
- Eight.

624
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,928
- Trent: Hey.
- One, two,

625
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,845
three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

626
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,889
- "Unnameable."
- Shh.

627
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,644
Listen.

628
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,644
"A fruitless wish
could drive thee mad.

629
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,521
What hath thee always yearned for,
yet never had?"

630
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,490
- Sex with twins.
- ( laughing )

631
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,644
Excuse me, are you talking
about sex with my wife?

632
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,882
Josh: Hold on.
Hold on just a second.

633
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,485
Hold on. Listen to me.

634
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,211
You two used to date

635
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,569
and we all know for a fact
have had sex.

636
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,690
So you've had sex
with my girl.

637
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,242
Listen. Why can't I have sex
with yours? It'd make us even.

638
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,243
- The same goes for Renee.
- ( Anton coughing )

639
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,562
Plus I've always wanted
to do twins.

640
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,161
- Anton: You're killing me.
- I think it's time to move on, okay?

641
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,970
It's done. Done. Finito.

642
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,361
Ah, doubles.

643
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,525
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

644
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,205
( Game creaking )

645
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,728
- Erica: Oh, my God.
- Men: Whoa. What the fuck?

646
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,041
Did you see that?

647
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,124
Do you think this thing is
on some kind of a timer or something?

648
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,686
- Renee: Holy shit.
- Erica: Oh, my God. Oh.

649
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,320
Anton:
Oh, my God.

650
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,530
Trent: "Come ye all to the carnival
of curses big and small.

651
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,126
Take thy turn and spin
the wheel of Exum--"

652
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,123
Exium.

653
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,044
I said that.
You repeated me.

654
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,922
"Of Ex--ll
what was that again?

655
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,366
- Exium.
- "Exium,

656
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,091
who was sentenced
to turn for eternity."

657
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,890
Erica:
Okay.

658
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,802
"Carved in stone,
words deep and bold.

659
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,930
Thou must grant
the wish last told."

660
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,686
- Trent: Oh!
- Josh: Oh-ho-ho!

661
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,922
Trent: Light, camera, action,
damn it.

662
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,491
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

663
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,971
Hey, rules are rules.

664
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,487
There's no way you're having sex
with my sister.

665
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,529
Erica: This is ridiculous, okay?
It's cheating.

666
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,082
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
I may have a solution.

667
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,402
Is that really cheating
if we all do it together?

668
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,562
I mean, we're friends.
We know each other.

669
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,404
You two are sisters,
for God's sake.

670
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,847
Josh: Look, if it will
make it easier,

671
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,048
you two can sleep with me
and then sleep with Anton.

672
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,170
Hell, or all four of us all together.
Just no grab-ass from you, okay?

673
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,448
- Erica, Renee: What? No.
- Anton: Hey, let's do it.

674
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,085
I can't feel my toes.

675
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,881
You know that I have always been
a little bit resentful

676
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,690
that you've hooked up
with Anton.

677
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,763
So this is a way
to fix that forever.

678
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,605
I'm really enjoying
playing the hell out of this game.

679
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,525
- This is some fun shit.
- I don't have any toes.

680
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,684
First of all, there's no way

681
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,286
my sister would do this
in a million years.

682
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,920
We roomed together,
and Erica thought

683
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,885
that "420" was
a household cleaner.

684
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,969
(all laughing)

685
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,804
She did. She did.

686
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,163
Trent: Wait, she didn't lose her
virginity until when she was, like, 21?

687
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,402
- Veronique: She's still a virgin.
- Anton: Why do you bring this up?

688
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,891
Anton:
Guys, easy.

689
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,326
Oh: yeah?

690
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,160
( People laughing )

691
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,408
Let's go, boys.

692
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,450
- ( Josh gasps )
- Erica, hold on.

693
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,489
I guess that's our cue.

694
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,689
- Robert: Don't stay up.
- Trent: Oh, shit.

695
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,320
Trent:
Oh, my--

696
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,562
Get the fuck--
I love this game.

697
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,891
Oh, damn,
I got the munchies.

698
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,489
Well?

699
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,324
Switch.

700
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,402
(laughing)

701
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,646
- Come on, let's all go for a dip.
- Renee: What are you doing?

702
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,768
Josh: We're just screwing
with you guys.

703
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,002
Although the fact that you're
getting into it is really starting

704
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,128
- to make me horny.
- Anton: I second that.

705
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,601
Josh:
Come on. Come on.

706
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,047
- Erica: Be careful.
- Anton: Just follow me.

707
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,283
- Come on. It's all right.
- Okay, just be careful.

708
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,724
Jesus Christ.

709
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,844
Pete, you scared
the hell out of me.

710
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,002
Inoficed
the lights weren't on.

711
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,525
Did the power go off?

712
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,245
Yeah, it went out
about an hour ago.

713
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,405
Yeah, well, it's an old house.
It happens.

714
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,284
Can you fix it?

715
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,050
Oh, no,
I can't fix it tonight.

716
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,441
Tell everybody I'll be going
into the mainland.

717
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,204
I'll get a box of fuses.

718
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,880
Brought you some candles.

719
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,884
Ain't no big city fire trucks
out here,

720
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,520
so don't go burning down
my house.

721
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,565
( Chuckling )

722
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,246
Man, that is some good shit.

723
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,363
( Humming )

724
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,851
Man, what the hell
did you put in that thing?

725
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,766
- You want some?
- Hell, no.

726
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,809
Where the hell
did everybody go?

727
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,009
- You don't want to know.
-( laughing )

728
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,730
It's your turn.

729
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,123
Oh, it's my turn. Thank you.

730
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,804
(thumps)

731
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,166
( squeaking )

732
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,288
- Whoa.
- Hey.

733
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,522
It's like it has a mind
of its own.

734
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,808
Hey, hey, what the hell?
I was winning here. Come on, man.

735
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,731
It can't be running on gears
'cause I don't see a crank.

736
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,446
And it's too old
to be running on batteries.

737
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,410
"Kneel before the fabled pond

738
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,164
where Narcissus drowned

739
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,085
after falling in love
with his own reflection.

740
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,006
There thou will find
his lover Echo

741
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,367
who replenishes the water
with her tears."

742
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,085
So romantic.

743
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,004
So depressing.

744
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,970
"The pond may look shallow,
but this watery mirror

745
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,361
is as deep as the soul.

746
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,411
So share not thy vision,
or thou might just fall in."

747
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,209
( chuckles )

748
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,690
What?

749
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,080
Nothing.

750
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,083
Says here
you have to roll again.

751
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,888
Okay.

752
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,721
"Carry out thy vision
seen in Echo's pond."

753
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,881
( chuckles )

754
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,565
What?

755
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,007
You've gotta be kidding me.

756
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,601
What? You didn't actually
see something, did you?

757
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,203
Come with me.

758
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,362
Where are we going?

759
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,729
Follow me
and I'll show you.

760
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,211
Oh, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

761
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,408
Where are you going?
I'm right here. Are you leaving me?

762
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,050
(women giggling )

763
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,884
Hey, can I come?

764
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,247
Oh, man, I don't know
what I would do if I were you,

765
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,563
but you have to admit,
that is pretty damn hot.

766
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,007
I mean, well, it's not like
she's cheating on me

767
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,571
with a guy or anything--
you know, like that.

768
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,290
It's fine with me
if it's fine with you.

769
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,329
I mean, this is cool.
This is cool, right?

770
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,282
- ( Girls squeal)
- Erica: Oh, my God.

771
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,010
- Josh: Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- ( Renee shrieks )

772
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,521
- Josh: Whoo-hoo!
-( Erica squeals )

773
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,081
Erica:
Oh, my God.

774
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,250
Robert:
My turn.

775
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,562
( Dice rattling )

776
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,324
Robert: "Honesty,
often akin to poisonous drinks,

777
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,689
tell thy friend
what thou truly thinks."

778
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,449
Robert:
Based on my observation,

779
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,802
if you really want to elevate
your status in this company,

780
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,770
it's gonna have to start with
a considerable attitude adjustment.

781
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,402
Now the whole
"I'm black and I'm proud" thing

782
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,689
doesn't fly in the corporate world.
You have to be a team player.

783
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,730
Now quit the Y.
Join the country club.

784
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,804
Take up golf.
It's called "building relationships."

785
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,770
And what's the deal
with your attendance lately?

786
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,207
You know that desk
and that phone at work?

787
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,045
Think of that phone
as your ATM machine.

788
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,646
You have to be on that phone
to get the money out.

789
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,643
You don't get the apps--
you can't get the loan.

790
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,121
If you don't get the loan,
then you don't get paid.

791
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,127
Remember your ABCs--
"always be closing."

792
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,931
( gasps )

793
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,923
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

794
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,201
( Cracks )

795
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,402
Hello!

796
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,441
Will somebody please help me?

797
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,525
Trent?

798
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,929
Is that you?

799
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,128
Come on.

800
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,766
Come on, man,
please untie me.

801
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,481
( Knocks twice )

802
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,880
( knocks )

803
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,129
So tell me why you did it.

804
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,408
Dude, I don't know
what you're talking about.

805
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,369
( Screams )

806
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,171
Jesus, Trent, are you
out of your fucking mind?

807
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,006
You sabotaged my loan file.

808
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,286
Why?

809
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,363
It really wasn't my intention.

810
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,210
Wrong fucking answer.

811
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,647
( Robert screaming,
gagging )

812
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,084
We can do this all fucking night.
I don't give a shit, all right?

813
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,403
I already know you did it.
Why did you do it?

814
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,642
I got greedy,
plain and simple.

815
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,409
I got myself into debt
really bad.

816
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,689
And I just needed one big payday
to get things back on track.

817
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,363
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

818
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,807
But like I said,
I had plans to make it all right.

819
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,201
How was I to know
that closing that deal

820
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,761
would get me promoted?
I just needed the commission.

821
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,491
If you needed money,

822
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,642
all you had to do was ask.

823
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,529
No.

824
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,490
You were just trying
to show me up.

825
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,450
No, man. No.

826
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,125
Yeah.

827
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,280
It really wasn't intentional.

828
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,490
- That's exactly what it was.
- Let me go. Let me go!

829
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,007
You wanted to show everybody
what a fuckup Trent was

830
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,925
and how good old
motherfucking "White Chocolate"

831
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,129
could save the day.

832
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,250
You've come
to save the day, huh?

833
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,289
"I can save the deal for you.

834
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,046
I can save the deal."
That's what you wanted to do.

835
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,521
No, man.
Come on, man.

836
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,081
Please don't, man,
I'm begging you.

837
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,411
Look what we got here.

838
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,131
I wonder if this
motherfucker works.

839
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,483
Sounds like this motherfucker
got some gas.

840
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,085
No, man, please don't.

841
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,050
I'm begging you, man, stop.
I'm sorry, man.

842
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,282
I said-- did you hear me?
I said I'm sorry.

843
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,966
- ( Sobbing )
- Everybody's fucking sorry.

844
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,043
They always say they're sorry
right at the 11th hour

845
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,964
or at the point
that they get caught.

846
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,726
How are we gonna make this right
between us, Rob?

847
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,248
- How are we gonna make it right?
- Oh, God.

848
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,562
( Saw buzzing )

849
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,122
- Motherfucker, take this!
- ( Rob screaming )

850
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,042
Erica: Okay, I don't want to drown,
you guys.

851
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,328
( All chuckle )

852
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,521
(giggling )

853
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,808
Pete:
You got shit for brains?

854
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,002
(coughing )

855
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,003
We're two hours
from the mainland.

856
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,970
This entire island's filled
with deadwood and dried brush.

857
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,885
If you set this dock on fire,
the island, my house,

858
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,520
all of us will be turned
into kindling.

859
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,688
Pete, you're scaring me.

860
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,811
You try to set my island
on fire again,

861
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,725
I'll gut you like a fish.

862
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,967
Erica:
Anton, are you okay?

863
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,845
That was creepy.

864
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,085
- Ow!
- What's wrong?

865
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,481
Oh, fuck.
I just stepped on something.

866
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,325
- Erica: What?
- Renee: Hold on. Ow.

867
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,209
It hurts.

868
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,048
Ow. Ow.

869
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,009
- Baby, are you all right?
- Anton: Let me see.

870
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,083
No. I cut my foot open.

871
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,368
- Is she okay?
- Anton: Let's get you fixed up.

872
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,449
Hold on.

873
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,840
Here, I'll come with you.

874
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,002
Yeah, it's okay, baby.
Don't worry about it.

875
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,049
Anton: It's okay, bro.
I got it.

876
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,282
I'll come back with some
fresh towels in a minute.

877
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,124
Josh: Are you sure?
Hang on a second. I'll come help.

878
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,367
- No, it's okay, baby.
- Don't worry.

879
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,363
Baby, let me come
with you.

880
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,602
Renee: No, baby, it's okay.
Have fun.

881
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,565
It's locked.
( knocks )

882
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,444
Guys, the door's locked.

883
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,204
- Erica: Hello.
- Renee: Just a minute.

884
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,967
Josh: Just a minute?
( knocks )

885
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,963
- Anton: Hey.
- Renee: Where were you guys?

886
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,282
- Erica: What took you guys so long?
- I used three rolls of gauze.

887
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,289
- She had a real deep cut.
- I got you towels.

888
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,642
- Whose shirt is that?
- It's Anton's.

889
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,928
Why are you wearing
Anton's shirt?

890
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,969
She was cold, dude.
What's the big deal?

891
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,361
It's not like I've never worn
his shirts before.

892
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,410
Okay, come on,
let's go find everyone, okay?

893
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,205
What were you and Renee doing
when we showed up?

894
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,682
I told you,
I was dressing her wound.

895
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,888
Why was the door locked?

896
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,771
( Chuckles )
Locked? It wasn't locked.

897
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,082
Come on, let's go.

898
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,323
Yeah, actually, it was.

899
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,488
- It must have jammed or something.
- Jammed?

900
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,722
What's the matter with you?

901
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,730
( Chuckles )
Oops.

902
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,087
I was--

903
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,760
I was just on my way
to the bathroom.

904
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,888
You guys finished already?

905
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,845
Are you kidding?
Haven't you ever heard of halftime?

906
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,405
(laughs)

907
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,325
Do I sense a little
hanky-panky over here?

908
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,960
Ahem-- and...

909
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,851
you'll never guess with who.

910
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,606
Robert?

911
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,484
Nope.

912
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,966
Trent?

913
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,963
Nope.

914
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,690
Both?

915
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,922
Nope.

916
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,005
Erica:
Oh.

917
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,447
Oh, my God,
what happened here?

918
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,443
Where is everybody?

919
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,524
You know what? Let's get the boys.
Let's go find out.

920
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,244
- Come on, give us a peek.
- No.

921
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,243
- Come on.
- No.

922
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,289
- Show us what we've been missing.
- No.

923
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,522
- Pretty please?
- No.

924
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,047
Who said you could flaunt your
naked body in front of my husband?

925
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,885
Renee:
You are such a slut.

926
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,522
Could you be more obvious
about wanting to fuck my fiancé?

927
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,967
How could you?
Oh, my God.

928
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,531
Josh:
Renee-!

929
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,921
Renee, would you please
just talk to me?

930
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,402
Stop running around on your foot.
You're gonna make it worse.

931
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,131
Erica, open the door, please.

932
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,809
Give me a break. An hour ago you were
gonna let me sleep with your sister.

933
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,201
- Well, that didn't happen, did it?
- I want to know

934
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,727
the real reason you were
in Anton's room for so long.

935
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,325
What are you getting at?

936
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,562
I want to know
what you were doing, Renee.

937
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,405
- What were you doing?
- What are you getting at?

938
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,006
When I saw you,
you had this classic

939
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,731
guilty expression on your face,
like you knew you'd been caught,

940
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,769
but you were gonna play it off
like nothing had happened.

941
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,083
- The door was locked, for chrissakes.
- The door was not locked. It was stuck.

942
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,083
Why was it closed anyway?

943
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,925
I don't know why it was closed.
What do you think?

944
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,844
What, do you think
I fucked Anton?

945
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,889
Is that what you think?

946
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,601
Don't you try
to turn this around on me.

947
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,842
Don't you fucking lie to me!

948
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,129
What?
You were gonna hit me.

949
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,363
No. No.
I just raised my fist.

950
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,602
To hit me.

951
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,721
Renee, I'm sorry.

952
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,649
Renee, I'm sorry.
I love you.

953
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,047
Don't use that word
with me.

954
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,931
No. No!

955
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,447
It was bought
with Rick's money anyway.

956
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,446
Honey, you're taking this whole thing
the wrong way.

957
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,722
Josh and I--
we get childish sometimes.

958
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,450
You know,
best friends do that.

959
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,968
If Josh is really
your best friend,

960
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,646
why did he say to me
when I was alone with him in the water,

961
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,804
"isn't it about time
you got a piece of a real man?"

962
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,927
He put his hands
all over me, Anton.

963
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,929
That's the real reason
I came back so quickly.

964
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,050
What? What do you mean,
he said that?

965
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,606
- Ow! What the fuck?
- Did you grope Erica in the water?

966
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,285
She says you practically
molested her.

967
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,124
What the fuck
are you talking about?

968
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,766
She just told me, Josh.
She was bawling her eyes out.

969
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,888
She's full of shit.
I didn't even touch her.

970
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,810
Jesus Christ.

971
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,128
I think you fucking broke my nose.

972
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,286
Oh.

973
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,488
You motherfucker.

974
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,410
You can't stand the idea

975
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,682
that I would touch your girl...

976
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,968
while you were fucking mine.

977
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,647
Woman's voice:
Hurry.

978
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,601
( Female voices giggling )

979
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,082
(women giggle )

980
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,889
Erica, this isn't funny.

981
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,361
Erica's voice:
Ugh, I can't stand her.

982
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,604
( Voices whispering )

983
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,842
I don't like playing games.

984
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,285
Renee, did you--?

985
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,000
( $lam$ )

986
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,088
( voices whispering )

987
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,369
Woman's voice:
Come here.

988
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,168
(whispering continues )

989
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,648
( fabric ripping )

990
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,564
Renee:
I can't stand her.

991
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,089
MY things.

992
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,321
Why are you doing this?

993
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,528
Erica: We know why you came here
this weekend.

994
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,002
I came here to spend time
with all of you guys.

995
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,764
Renee: You must think
we're stupid.

996
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,241
I don't know
what you're talking about.

997
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,125
Renee: "Anton, because
he's a sensitive, romantic type."

998
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,644
Erica: And Josh is the "big,
strong, take-charge kind of guy."

999
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,926
Whore!

1000
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,802
( Muffled music playing )

1001
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,927
( Veronique screams )
Help me!

1002
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,484
Veronique:
Help me!

1003
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,289
Oh, fuck.
You scared the shit out of me.

1004
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,807
I'm hearing Veronique
screaming out there--

1005
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,285
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- You fucked Rick, didn't you?

1006
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,171
( Shouts )
You fucked Rick, didn't you?

1007
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,281
( Panting )

1008
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,527
(yells )

1009
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,204
( both laugh )

1010
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,328
( screams )

1011
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,487
( panting )

1012
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,841
Pete! Pete!

1013
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,685
Open up! Help!

1014
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,130
( Gate squeaks )

1015
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,082
Rick:
Hello?

1016
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,247
Rick:
Hey.

1017
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,169
Hello?

1018
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,209
Is anybody here?

1019
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,409
Rick's voice: She had her hands
all over you, Danny.

1020
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,483
All over you, man.

1021
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,364
- ( Rick laughing )
- Danny: I think she was more into you.

1022
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,444
Rick's voice:
I still can't believe it. She was hot.

1023
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,450
( Danny, Rick's voices
overlapping )

1024
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,724
( tires screeching )

1025
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,769
Rick:
No-o-o!

1026
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,127
( Crashing )

1027
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,521
( car alarm blaring )

1028
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,882
Why did you lie, Rick?

1029
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,682
(faint coughing )

1030
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,409
( panting )

1031
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,847
- ( Kathy screams )
- Whoa, Kathy. It's me-- Rick.

1032
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,570
Jesus Christ,
what happened to you?

1033
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,881
- He'll kill me.
- What?

1034
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,281
I think he killed Veronique.
Look what he fucking did to me.

1035
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,488
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
I can't understand what you're saying.

1036
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,523
What don't you
fucking understand?

1037
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,121
Shit.

1038
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,681
What the hell?

1039
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,165
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1040
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,526
Is that any way to treat
somebody's home?

1041
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,250
( Kathy panting )

1042
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,528
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

1043
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,804
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1044
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,884
I thought we were going in your boat.
Why are we at Pete's boat?

1045
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,327
The keys to my boat
are back at the house.

1046
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,090
Why?

1047
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,288
- 'Cause I'm an idiot.
- Oh, God.

1048
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,408
I've got a plan.

1049
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,567
<i>L</i> 9°11 YOU. I got you.

1050
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,290
<i>L</i> 9011 you.

1051
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,851
Oh, fuck.

1052
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,963
Come on, we gotta wrap that up,
stop the bleeding.

1053
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,963
Let me find you
something here.

1054
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,009
Come here. Let me see.

1055
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,571
Jesus.

1056
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,290
Come on.

1057
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,647
Oh, fuck.

1058
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,409
Ow.

1059
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,763
All right, just hide here
until I come back, okay?

1060
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,161
Come on. It's gonna be okay.
Come on, Kathy.

1061
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,921
I won't be gone long,
I promise.

1062
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,844
Okay?

1063
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,409
Yo, it's Rick.

1064
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,767
Is anybody here?

1065
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,888
Hello.

1066
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,966
Where are my keys?

1067
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,769
(woman screams )

1068
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,161
( screams )

1069
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,049
Erica!

1070
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,690
Jesus.
What the fuck?

1071
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,842
(gulps)
Ugh...

1072
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,722
Oh, Veronique.

1073
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,083
Nos no! no, no, "C.

1074
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,925
What, you don't like
her new look?

1075
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,162
What about my new look, baby?
Want a peek?

1076
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,561
I've always wanted her eyes.

1077
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,520
And now I have them.

1078
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,206
- Give him the money shot, sis.
- But of course.

1079
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,721
Watch this.

1080
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,723
Did they look as good on me
as they did on her?

1081
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,881
Are you insane?

1082
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,890
Don't act so innocent.
We know what you did to Josh.

1083
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,845
Wha-- no, wait.
I-- I didn't.

1084
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,849
All you did
was save us some trouble.

1085
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,008
Both:
Now it's your turn.

1086
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,685
(grunts)

1087
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,928
( screams )

1088
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,448
I was-- I was faithful to you.

1089
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,682
Why couldn't you be?

1090
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,602
Rick!

1091
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,486
( Footsteps approaching )

1092
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,722
( gasps )

1093
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,843
( brief gasp )

1094
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,608
Kathy, it's me-- Rick.

1095
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,850
- Come to save your girlfriend?
- Come on, man.

1096
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,401
There's no need for this.

1097
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,642
Of course there isn't.

1098
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,849
You've already fucked her, right?

1099
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,764
- So why bother?
- Trent, man,

1100
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,764
she needs medical attention.
Kathy's hurt really bad.

1101
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,849
I'm gonna hurt you too.

1102
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,887
( Oar clatters )

1103
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,010
- Kathy: Where did he go?
- I don't know. I can't see him.

1104
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,527
- You think he's dead?
- You may have knocked him out.

1105
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,409
I can't be sure.

1106
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,961
Come on, just...

1107
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,280
Rick:
Oh, my God.

1108
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,886
Come on.

1109
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,929
Let's go.

1110
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,162
Come on.

1111
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,569
Robert too.

1112
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,370
What?

1113
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,284
I found him
in the basement.

1114
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,444
Oh, God. How?

1115
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,763
You don't want to know.

1116
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,241
( Screams )
Oh! Oh, fuck.

1117
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,243
Ow! Argh!

1118
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,609
Come on, come on.
Come on, let's go. Get up. Get up.

1119
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,330
- Rick: Come on, Kathy.
- Come on, hurry up.

1120
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,845
Kathy: What are we
gonna do?

1121
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,082
- Rick: I'm gonna find Pete.
- Hurry up.

1122
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,445
Pete, it's Rick and Kathy.
Are you around?

1123
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,887
( Kathy gasps )

1124
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,451
Anton.

1125
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,369
It's me.
It's Kathy and Rick.

1126
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,524
Hey, we're--
we're your friends.

1127
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,523
He's no friend of mine.

1128
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,651
Anton, please
put the knives down.

1129
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,007
You broke Erica's heart, Rick.

1130
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,925
I told you I didn't want any hookers
at my bachelor party,

1131
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,846
but, no, you had to
have it your way.

1132
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,641
I brought the girls,
but I didn't make you sleep with them.

1133
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,484
Just calm down, man.

1134
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,160
If Erica hasn't forgiven you,
she will.

1135
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,685
Just give her some time.

1136
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,251
She won't!

1137
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,688
She's dead.
And you're next.

1138
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,763
(gunshot)

1139
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,121
( Kathy sobs )

1140
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,487
That had to hurt.

1141
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,529
Are you two okay?

1142
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,001
Yeah. Thanks.

1143
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,731
What the hell
is going on here?

1144
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,651
I couldn't even begin
to explain it.

1145
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,127
You have to get us
off this island now.

1146
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,930
Rick: Do you have a phone
or something?

1147
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,924
Well, I had a radio
until somebody smashed it up.

1148
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,969
What about your boat?
Does it work?

1149
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,851
The same person
that smashed the radio

1150
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,844
took the keys to the boat and my shells.
I only got one shot left.

1151
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,287
Shit.

1152
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,369
I suppose I can
hot-wire the boat.

1153
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,090
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

1154
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,969
Whoa, not so fast there, slick.

1155
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,088
- You two ain't going anywhere with me.
- What?

1156
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,931
Oh, no, I'm flying solo
from here on out.

1157
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,844
Please, you have to
take us with you.

1158
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,924
No, I don't have to do nothing, darling.
It's my island, my rules.

1159
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,202
Now, I've seen some pretty sick shit
here tonight.

1160
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,364
I ain't taking my chances
with you two.

1161
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,682
You can hide until I bring back
the authorities.

1162
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,248
Come on, man.
She's hurt.

1163
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,721
"Come on, man" nothing.
You sit tight.

1164
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,804
I'll be back in about
an hour or so.

1165
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,530
( Rustling )

1166
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,808
Shit. We're fucked.

1167
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,721
- ( Gunshot echoes )
- Rick: Shit.

1168
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,248
- What do you think?
- Fuck, I don't know.

1169
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,161
- Rick: Well, shouldn't we check it out?
- No, Pete said to stay here.

1170
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,328
He only had one shot.

1171
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,482
That means two things.

1172
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,721
What?

1173
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,769
Either he killed Trent
and we're safe,

1174
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,809
or he didn't.

1175
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,566
And if he didn't, then what?

1176
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,690
Fuck it. I'd be willing to take
my chance with that rowboat.

1177
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,082
Fuck it.

1178
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,766
- Anything to get off this island.
- Let's go.

1179
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,689
Shit. We're fucked.

1180
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,763
Shh. Keep your voice down.

1181
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,685
What if he hears us?

1182
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,923
- Well, now what?
- I--

1183
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,082
Maybe we should go back
in the house.

1184
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,009
Are you kidding me?

1185
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,680
We're way better off
holing up here until morning.

1186
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,329
Fuck.

1187
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,730
I'll stand guard
while you get some rest, okay?

1188
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,410
<i>He'! '</i>

1189
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,531
I'm not gonna close my eyes
until we're off this death trap.

1190
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,207
( Rustling )

1191
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,164
- Did you hear that?
- Where is it coming from?

1192
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,129
What the fuck is that?

1193
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,442
Seriously, I can't take
this shit anymore.

1194
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,888
- I want to get the fuck out of here.
- Just shut the fuck up for a second.

1195
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,809
It's down here.

1196
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,404
Oh, shit!
Don't look. Don't look.

1197
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,961
( Kathy whimpering )
Oh, my God.

1198
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,521
Get it out of here.
Get it out of here.

1199
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,081
Well, what do you want me to do?
I'm not going out there with it.

1200
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,607
Just take it outside, and throw it
out the fucking door in the water.

1201
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,326
- Just get it out of my sight.
- Shit.

1202
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,963
- Fuck. Oh.
- ( whimpering )

1203
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,801
Rick: All right. All right.

1204
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,164
Happy now?

1205
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,681
Yes. Thank you.

1206
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,285
( Car horn honking )

1207
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,965
( tires screech )

1208
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,884
( crashing )

1209
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,927
( car alarm wailing )

1210
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,120
Danny.

1211
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,760
Danny.
Come on, wake up, man.

1212
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,809
( Gurgles, spits )

1213
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,406
I told you not to drive.

1214
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,362
(sobs)

1215
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,001
( sobbing )

1216
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,243
(sobs)

1217
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,011
(siren wailing)

1218
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,681
( police radio chatter)

1219
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,121
(Yelps )

1220
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,363
- Jesus, you scared me.
- You unbelievable bastard!

1221
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,568
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You killed Danny.

1222
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,563
- You were driving the car.
- What?

1223
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,451
I saw what you did.
You moved his fucking dead body.

1224
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,806
You killed Danny.

1225
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,440
You're fucking nuts. It's that game.
It's gotten inside your head.

1226
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,284
It shows you
what you want to believe.

1227
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,761
I don't believe a word you say!

1228
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,843
Wait, wait, Kathy.
Listen to me.

1229
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,844
When we were heading back
to the car that night,

1230
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,446
I did see Danny
stumble and fall.

1231
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,001
And I knew right then and there
I should have stopped him.

1232
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,801
But you know what?
I didn't. I let him drive.

1233
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,884
And that will haunt me
for the rest of my life, Kathy.

1234
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,929
But I wasn't the one
who was driving.

1235
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,485
You're a liar.

1236
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,608
This isn't gonna bring him back.
He is dead.

1237
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,082
And there's nothing I can do or say
that's gonna change that.

1238
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,006
You know, when you snitched
about that bachelor party to everybody,

1239
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,686
I lost everyone.

1240
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,963
Now everyone hates me
because of you.

1241
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,724
Haven't I suffered enough?

1242
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,121
You could never
suffer enough!

1243
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,726
( Saw buzzing )

1244
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,042

1245
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,441

1246
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,247
( screams )

1247
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,927
( both grunting )

1248
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,010
Rick:
Oh, shit.

1249
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,168
( Rick screams )

1250
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,960
(thumps)

1251
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,441
( reel whirrs )

1252
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,049
Josh:
Rick.

1253
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,567
Rick, are you gonna answer
the question or what?

1254
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,690
Simple answer--
yes or no.

1255
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,045
- Ask him again, babe.
- Okay.

1256
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,806
"In Echo's Pond,
sights thee have seen.

1257
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,931
Choose to make them reality
or dream."

1258
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,162
Veronique:
Rick? You pig.

1259
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,601
- Josh: Rick, what the fuck?
- Anton: He's no friend of mine.

1260
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,364
Erica: Rick, is there
anybody in this room

1261
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,090
that has something nice
to say about you?

1262
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,406
Robert: Don't think
you're staying with me.

1263
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,607
I only got a single bed
in my room.

1264
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,240
- Renee: Grow the fuck up, Rick.
- Kathy: I will never forgive you.

1265
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,448
Trent: Nowhere in the rules does it say
that anyone has to forgive you.

1266
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,647
Veronique:
Don't look so defeated.

1267
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,404
Kathy: Don't let the door kick you
in the ass on the way out.

1268
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,085
- Danny: Why did you lie, Rick?
- Kathy: You're a liar.

1269
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,244
- Anton: You broke Erica's heart, Rick.
- Kathy: You killed Danny!

1270

Kathy: You could never
suffer enough!
