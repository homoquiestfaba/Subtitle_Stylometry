Trainer called,

AintltPeter. Com.

192
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,001
Your PR people said I

193
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,069
your Oscar rags
to riches

194
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,170
Everyone back off.

195
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,304
Let the man
have a second.

196
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,305
This isnt a zoo.

197
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,941
I knowyour interview
is very, veryimportant.

198
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,376
Cancel the massage.

199
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,312
We want Sushi Rocoo,
not Sushi Cafe.

200
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,282
And kickboxing is fine but
change the session to 7:30.

201
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,316
Is that all?

202
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,751
All right,
all right.

203
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,686
Shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo.

204
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,787
Go on, disappear.

205
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,084
Come on, I want
to talk to you.

206
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,958
You know, I
dont golf, right?

207
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,159
You know
how hard it was

208
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,261
to get all that
inyour contract?

209
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,663
You re notTom Hanks.

210
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,667
We only got $300,000
budgeted for your entourage.

211
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,536
But once youwin that
little golden statue,

212
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,005
the world s gonna be ours.

213
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,174
Well, I m not
sure I need all this.

214
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,843
LfTom needs it,
you need it.

215
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,744
It s notwho you are,
It swho you look like.

216
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,085
Ill cancel the interview
ifyou want.

217
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,121
His blog has an
insane readership.

218
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,522
I knowwe
need this.

219
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,682
Nah, nah, nah,
well do it.

220
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,391
All right,
this is the deal.

221
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,962
Word is Colin s gonna go
over the studio s head

222
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,898
for his scene, planning
to sneak it in onyou tonight.

223
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,667
It could get U G L Y.

224
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,536
You are the man.

225
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,238
I sayit s
studio business.

226
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,239
Give him
what he wants.

227
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,940
Well deal with it
after the awards.

228
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,942
Don t let anything
get in the way.

229
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,275
Bad publicity right now could
kill us, you knowwhat I mean?

230
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,916
I m just here to give
you the heads up.

231
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,751
Besides Colin, weve
got one more problem.

232
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,718
What s that?

233
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,021
(male)
I understand.

234
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,856
(female)
Get out of
the way, Toby!

235
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:11,982
I should go.

236
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,195
Careful,
shrapnel.

237
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,196
What happened?

238
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,597
Colin said
something and then

239
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,666
Becca in wardrobe
said that they saw

240
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,469
her'boyfriend'
storm out ofhere.

241
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,172
Well, let s give
her some privacy.

242
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,706
Gladly.

243
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,776
All right, guys, nothing
to see here, okay?

244
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,479
What?

245
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,115
Blessed are
the peacemakers.

246
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,284
Uh, peacemakers
get shot, bro.

247
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,343
Remember Bosnia?

248
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,354
Get out
ofhere, Colin!

249
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,557
(Michael)
It s me.

250
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,799
(male)
Okay, what s the
problem this time?

251
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,307
So what happened?

252
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,308
I have no idea.

253
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,209
You have no idea?

254
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,610
You are never
gonna believe it.

255
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,813
I asked her ifher
pants were the right size.

256
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,644
Colin told me
that I m fat.

257
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:12,785
Uh!

258
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,082
He s such a pig.

259
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,387
What?

260
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,654
I hate Hollywood.

261
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,256
Hello.

262
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,130
Colin has a way
withwords.

263
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,400
Uh, yeah.

264
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,595
Butyou know
that s not true.

265
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,645
Don t let him get
you down, okay?

266
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,613
You ready
to do this?

267
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,176
All right.

268
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,274
Are we
ready to shoot?

269
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,943
You mean the princess
got it together?

270
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,213
Did you
pray for her?

271
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,214
What do you mean?

272
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,315
Well, isnt that
what you Christians do?

273
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,484
I saw that I saw
that on 'LarryKing.'

274
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,951
I must have
missed that episode.

275
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,679
(Toby)
Guys, okay.

276
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,124
Whichversion of the scene
do youwant to shoot?

277
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
(Michael)
Thatwas decided before I
signed the contract,

278
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,296
right, Colin?

279
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:36,001
You know, I, for a second,
thought that this was my movie.

280
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,703
Think I m just gonna
be the servant now.

281
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,230
Can I getyou like a Huggies
or a little babywipe?

282
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:47,046
(Toby)
Look, ljust want to know
which one, pink or yellow?

283
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,480
The version where Chad
and Maggie dont make love.

284
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,785
Wait a minute,
so I have to like

285
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,185

[Dramaticinstrumental
music playing]

287
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,509
I couldnt
stay away.

288
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,977
Michael?

289
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,048
You know, It s not
safe here for you.

290
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,717
You promised.

291
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,820
I promised to
keep you alive.

292
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,424
I am dying without
you, Mr. Slater.

293
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,187
No, Maggie,
not like this.

294
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,259
(Colin)
Cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut.

295
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,401
Hey, Michael?

296
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,062
Cassandra, we re just
gonna hold for a second.

297
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,308
(Cassandra)
Thanks for just helping
me through all this.

298
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,111
I didnt do
anything, really.

299
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,978
Where are all
the good men like you, Michael?

300
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,650
(Michael)
I wouldnt know.

301
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,651
Your little
friend really

302
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,454
looks up
to you, huh?

303
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,822
Yeah, I guess so.

304
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,483
He seems
like a good kid.

305
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:07,993
Did we get it?

306
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,994
(Colin)
Uh, no.

307
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:09,995
Okay, I thought Michael
nailed that last take.

308
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,030
Can I get ice chips?

309
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
Guys, sit down.

310
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,032
Let s be
quiet, okay?

311
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
Let s focus.

312
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,300
Sit down.

313
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:24,309
Uh, it s
not the acting per se

314
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,411
and you look great.

315
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,012
But, okay.

316
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,515
Toby, give me
a second.

317
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,949
Give me a second.

318
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,419
All right,
you knowwhat, Michael?

319
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,613
What do you
think, Michael?

320
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,459
Colin, well do
whatever you need.

321
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,460
It s your baby.

322
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,628
Okay, great,
you knowwhat?

323
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,096
I dont buyit.

324
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,666
What is is the, 'Not now,
Maggie, not like this'?

325
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,635
What is that?

326
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,404
These are
two passionate human beings

327
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,672
and I want
them to express

328
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,042
their passion
for each other in this moment.

329
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,978
That s not up
for discussion.

330
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:00,979
Oh, you re right.

331
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:01,980
I m sorry.

332
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,981
I dont knowwhat
got into my head.

333
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,316
Why did I think that
I could competewith

334
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,151
an Oscar nominated actor?

335
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,719
That s irrelevant
and you knowit.

336
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,789
People in the real world
make love as a means

337
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,025
of expressing their feelings
to each other.

338
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,027
Nobody relates
to your archaic,

339
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,296
moral ideology anymore.

340
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,131
I m sorry!

341
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,299
All right, fine.

342
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,701
Why dont we shoot your
scene thenwell shoot

343
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,103
what happens next.

344
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,705
This one night results
in an unwanted child

345
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,840
raised with
no father.

346
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,041
Relate to that.

347
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,876
I m simply not gonna allow
your narrow minded

348
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,312
religious agenda
to ruin my film!

349
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,180
Let me tell you what s
gonna ruinyour film,

350
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,114
the fact that you re
a second rate hack.

351
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,121
Get off my set.

352
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,666
You stay here!

353
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,878
Sorry, Cass.

354
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,346
Whatwas
