1
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:35,071
This "pestilent dust"
has appeared only three times.

2
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:42,036
It was found to be limestone...
Messy, but innocuous.

3
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:47,834
- Innocuous?
- Harmless.

4
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,338
I know what it means. May l?

5
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,592
Your Honour...

6
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,723
Imagine how
the neighbourhood children feel.

7
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,437
The pounding of construction
ringing in their ears.

8
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:10,401
This skyscraper, a tribute
to mankind's greed, grows daily.

9
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:16,240
It casts a shadow over their lives
and surrounds them with toxic dust.

10
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:23,164
Kendall Construction is rebuilding
this neighbourhood.

11
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:30,089
Granting a restraining order here
will throw 753 people out of work.

12
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:35,678
You cannot validate this groundless
example of rapacious litigation.

13
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:41,476
- It is a threat to our society.
- Let's not go off the deep end.

14
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:45,772
You have made
a compelling case, Mr. Miller.

15
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,276
- But there is no irreparable harm.
- Not yet.

16
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:13,803
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

17
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:18,224
- A client of yours?
- Funny!

18
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:22,479
Excuse me, sir...

19
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:54,597
I went to a restaurant the other day
and ordered coffee.

20
00:05:54,805 --> 00:06:00,144
The waiter asked, "Would you
like sugar or Sweet & Low?"

21
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:05,066
I said, "Do I look like
I should be on a diet?"

22
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,822
- Andy.
- Hi, Doc.

23
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:15,202
Your blood work came back.
When I return, we'll discuss it.

24
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:18,581
I'll be right here.

25
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:24,588
- Hi, how are you feeling?
- Pretty good.

26
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:28,842
Make a fist for me.

27
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,682
We're gonna have to start
looking for veins in your feet.

28
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:06,550
- Terrific job on the Kendall case.
- Thanks, Kenneth.

29
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:12,640
Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

30
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:17,103
- The answer is no.
- Dinner at Felicia's...

31
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,107
- I've got a class.
- My briefs need proofing.

32
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,320
Exploit somebody else.
Since you've asked...

33
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,324
- Your exam!
- 98.

34
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,912
98! Congratulations!

35
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:39,043
- Let's talk about the Hansen case.
- Yeah. Thank Amy for the painting.

36
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:46,259
Here are the numbers. The copy's
on your desk. Do you need me?

37
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:49,805
No. It's 6:30. Go home.

38
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:57,021
Hello? Hi, darling.
What a surprise. How are you?

39
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:01,276
- Good.
-what does Dr. Gillman say?

40
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:07,407
She says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

41
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:13,831
- How about my platelets?
- Even myplatelets look good.

42
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:18,753
Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

43
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:25,802
- I'm fine. Your dad is fine.
-what are you doing?

44
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:05,303
- Andy, am I interrupting you?
- In a word, Bob.

45
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,725
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

46
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:15,815
I was just about to take a break.
You're sure I'm not underdressed?

47
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:22,864
Andy has expressed a keen interest
in Highline versus Sander Systems.

48
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:30,038
- The participants interest me.
- It's an anti-trust action.

49
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:39,549
Is it? Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

50
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:46,598
For me, the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement.

51
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:54,064
Tell me this, Andy.which side would
you like to see emerge victorious?

52
00:09:54,231 --> 00:10:01,364
Don't be influenced by my friendship
with Sander's CEO Billwright.

53
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:08,121
- I'd like to see Highline win.
-why, Beckett?

54
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:17,507
If Sander Systems wins, an energetic
young company is destroyed.

55
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:25,515
Copyright laws were enacted to stop
exactly what Sander are doing.

56
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:29,686
- You know who reps Highline.
- Rodney Bailey.

57
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:38,613
He couldn't find his way around
copyright law with a map.

58
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,287
Apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you.

59
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:50,667
Therefore, as of 9:03 this evening,
right after the dessert course,

60
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:56,507
they're now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown.

61
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,969
Outstanding!

62
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:05,976
And more specifically,
senior associate Andrew Beckett.

63
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:22,786
- Thank you, Robert.
- Start on Highline right away.

64
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:27,582
- I'm right on it.
-we have to file within ten days.

65
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:32,046
- Tokyo on line four, Bob.
-walter, thank you.

66
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:37,635
- Thank you, Kenneth.
- Congratulations.

67
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:42,265
- What's that on your forehead?
- Where?

68
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,435
That, right there on your forehead.

69
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:51,358
I got whacked
with a racquet ball... Excuse me.

70
00:11:55,112 --> 00:12:02,829
Charles... I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

71
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:07,960
Faith is a belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

72
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:11,922
It does not apply in this situation.

73
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:20,014
Go home.
No... go back to work!

74
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:33,654
- Thank you, Charles.
- No sweat, buddy.

75
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:04,187
Tommy, how are you?

76
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:40,184
The complaintis on my desk, Shelby.
Tell Jamey to get on top ofit

77
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,520
Anything else?

78
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:48,777
No, I'll be working out of the house
for the rest of the afternoon.

79
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:51,739
Bye.

80
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:57,662
You want to apply the foundation
as evenly as you can.

81
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:04,878
It shouldn't look like
you threw it on with a spoon.

82
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:09,049
You don't think this
is a little too orange for me?

83
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:13,512
It's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

84
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,353
- Say you've been to Aruba.
- I've called in sick for four days.

85
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,565
Now they'll think I was on a cruise.

86
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,985
- Fax.
- Thank you, Bruno.

87
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:30,322
We could try this Light Egypt...

88
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:34,410
- What?
- Andy?

89
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,957
Excuse me.

90
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:49,301
Just like my cousin Fredo.

91
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:59,020
Hi... Does anybody want a bagel?

92
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,286
Are you okay, Andy?

93
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:20,043
I need to go to the hospital.

94
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,832
- It's all right.
- I'm getting out of here.

95
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:01,796
- One more.
- Thank you for driving me here.

96
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:06,885
I told Dr. Gillman to take a day off
and she took a day off!

97
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:13,851
- Did they take a specimen?
- Blood... I'm empty.

98
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:19,857
You have a fever, baby.

99
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:24,988
- This is my guy. Excuse me...
- Just one second.

100
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:32,621
I ran to the bathroom. I almost
lost it in front of everybody.

101
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,168
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- It's just...

102
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:43,508
- Any news on my blood work?
- No.we'll do a colonoscopy.

103
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,143
- It sounds delightful.
-wait.why do that?

104
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,647
-who are you?
-who are you, Doctor...

105
00:16:56,814 --> 00:17:00,068
This is my partner.

106
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:05,448
- He records all my hospital visits.
- I'm Dr. Klenstein.

107
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:12,831
A colonoscopy will show us if it's
the K.S. causing the diarrhoea.

108
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:19,088
- It could be an infection...
- A reaction to AZT.

109
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:22,133
That's possible...

110
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,721
He's not having this
until we cancel out everything else.

111
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:31,602
I'm trying to help your partner.
You're not a member of his family.

112
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:36,816
- I could have you removed.
- He's upset. He's sorry.

113
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:42,322
- No, don't apologize for me.
- Okay, he's not sorry.

114
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:49,204
Let's see what the blood work
tells us. I'll give a specimen.

115
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:54,502
Maybe we'll hear from Dr. Gillman.
Everybody happy?

116
00:17:55,461 --> 00:18:00,508
- I'll check on the blood work.
- Sorry...

117
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:08,058
- That's the third time.
- Dr. Klenstein...

118
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:12,271
I have to call the office.
I want you to relax.

119
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:17,902
- I am relaxed.
- Good. Is there a phone around?

120
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:26,995
If you have been injured, you may
be entitled to a cash settlement...

121
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,499
Good Lord!

122
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:30,833
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

123
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,336
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

124
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:38,007
- Jamey beeped me.
- I'm glad you called.

125
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:45,181
It's about the Highline complaint.
Jamey is going ballistic!

126
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:50,646
- Calm down. Put him on.
- One second.

127
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:55,943
- Where's the Highline complaint?
- Wait! Slow down.

128
00:18:56,152 --> 00:19:00,365
It was supposed to be here
this morning.

129
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:08,332
I left it in my office last night.
I put the corrected copy on my desk.

130
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:14,296
- I'm telling you, it's not here.
- All right, try my hard disk.

131
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:18,593
You'll have
to printit outyourself.

132
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,055
- What did you file it under?
- HL1.

133
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:26,268
You know that there's
a statute oflimitations on this.

134
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:29,438
It runs out...

135
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,149
in 75 minutes.

136
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:40,199
- It's not here. Andy.
- It's not there? I'm on myway!

137
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,375
Every problem has a solution.

138
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,509
Push, baby.

139
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:04,225
It's a girl!

140
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:12,818
- Take a picture, Joe.
- I can't get the film in there.

141
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:16,864
Help me, baby.

142
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:23,955
Look at her. A sweet little...

143
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:29,962
She's perfect.

144
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:36,052
Go down to the deli.
Get a pound of Scotch salmon.

145
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:40,056
Rolls, bagels...
Give me a call.

146
00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:43,893
- And some champagne.
- You're that TV guy.

147
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,730
Dom Perignon.

148
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:51,151
$100? No, get a nice Californian.

149
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:57,158
Get it over here, she's starving.
No, not the baby... Lisa!

150
00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:03,581
- Iris... anybody call?
- Yes, an Andrew Beckett

151
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:08,378
- Who's Andrew Beckett?
- Hey, Joseph!

152
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,419
Explain it like I'm a six-year-old.

153
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:51,884
The entire street is clear except
for a large hole under construction.

154
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:55,221
It's marked and blocked off.

155
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:59,767
You decide to cross the street
and fall down the hole.

156
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:04,648
- Now you want to sue the city.
- Yes. Do I have a case?

157
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:08,735
- Yeah, of course you do.
- Great.

158
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:14,158
Go with my assistant lris.
Sort out the fee arrangement.

159
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,745
We take no cash
unless we get justice.

160
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:22,250
- How's your back? Any pain?
- Now that you mention it...

161
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:29,967
- Iris, take good care of him.
- I will. Mr. Beckett's here.

162
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,845
Mr. Beckett.

163
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:39,227
Come in.

164
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:47,778
Good to see you again, counsellor.
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

165
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:51,448
"Innocuous!"

166
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:57,705
- What happened to your face?
- I have AIDS.

167
00:22:57,872 --> 00:23:01,376
I'm sorry.

168
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:09,509
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah.

169
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,942
Look at this...
you have a new baby.

170
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,740
Yeah, a little baby girl.

171
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:39,417
- "It's a girl". Congratulations.
- Yeah, one week old.

172
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:46,174
- Kids are great.
- Yeah, I'm real excited about it.

173
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:56,268
- What can I do for you?
- I've been fired by Wyant Wheeler.

174
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,565
I want to sue them
for wrongful termination.

175
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:04,653
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?

176
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:10,617
- Yes. I'm seeking representation.
- Continue.

177
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:16,958
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

178
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:20,795
Do you want to hear mine?

179
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:27,552
- Have you been to other lawyers?
- Yes, nine.

180
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:31,598
Continue.

181
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:37,480
The night before it was due, I left
a copy of the complaint on my desk.

182
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:45,363
The next day the complaint vanished.
No hard copy.

183
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:50,035
All traces of it mysteriously gone
from my computer.

184
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:58,753
Miraculously, a copywas found
justin time to getit to court

185
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:05,427
But the next day lwas summoned
to a meetingwith the partners.

186
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:11,183
Hello, Andy. Come on in.
Hit the windows.

187
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:18,691
- Thanks. Come on in.
- Hello, everybody.

188
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:22,362
Thanks for coming in.

189
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:29,828
Before we begin, I'd like to say
that everyone here is your friend.

190
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:35,918
- I know that, Charles.
- More than your friend. Family.

191
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:43,927
Charles... I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

192
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:47,931
That was some scary moment
around here.

193
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:52,478
Thank God that no damage was done.

194
00:25:52,645 --> 00:26:00,695
- This time.what about next time?
- There won't be a next time.

195
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:07,244
Something's come over you lately.
I don't know...

196
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:13,751
- A kind of stupor or fogginess.
- You have an attitude problem.

197
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:18,381
Really?

198
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:22,886
- Who thinks that?
- I do.

199
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:30,894
Excuse me...
Am I being fired?

200
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:37,777
Let me put it this way: Your place
at this firm is no longer secure.

201
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:44,826
It isn't fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited.

202
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:52,292
- I don't want to rush you...
- We've got a committee meeting.

203
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:58,466
This is preposterous.
It doesn't make any sense.

204
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:02,762
- You do have an attitude problem.
- Take it easy.

205
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,057
Why did you ever give me Highline?

206
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:13,274
You nearly blew the entire case.
It could have been a catastrophe.

207
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:21,115
You concealed your illness.

208
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,120
That's correct.

209
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:36,132
Explain it like I'm a two-year-old.
I can't seem to grasp this.

210
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:42,013
Weren't you obliged to tell
your employer you had AIDS?

211
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,975
That's not the point.

212
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:50,022
I always served my clients
with absolute excellence.

213
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:53,859
If they hadn't fired me,
I'd still do that.

214
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:57,530
They couldn't fire you
for being sick,

215
00:27:57,738 --> 00:28:01,576
so they tried
to make you look imcompetent.

216
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:04,704
Correct. I was sabotaged.

217
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,712
I don't buy it, counsellor.

218
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:17,885
- That's very disappointing.
- I don't see a case.

219
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:23,850
I have a case.

220
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:28,897
- If you don't want it...
- That's correct. I don't.

221
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:35,112
Thank you for your time.

222
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,158
Mr. Beckett...

223
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:49,878
I'm sorry about what happened.
It's a bitch.

224
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:04,978
- Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.
- What's the matter with that guy?

225
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,981
Iris, get me Armbruster.

226
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:12,361
I want to see Armbruster
sometime this afternoon.

227
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:15,614
Right away, Iris.

228
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:56,492
HIV-virus can only be transmitted
by the exchange of bodily fluids.

229
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:01,331
Blood, semen,
and vaginal secretions.

230
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:06,461
But they're finding out new things
about this disease every day.

231
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,424
Today you tell me there's no danger.

232
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:14,762
But six months from now
you may know different.

233
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:19,475
Maybe you can carry it
on your shirt or your clothes.

234
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:23,563
What are you doing?

235
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,651
- We're gonna draw blood.
- Why?

236
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:37,119
Joe, I've known you a long time.
Your private life is your business.

237
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:45,378
I don't need an AIDS test.
Just send the bill to my office.

238
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:49,049
Thanks for the information.

239
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:58,059
- You have a problem with gays.
- Not especially.

240
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:01,771
- Do you know any gays?
- Do you?

241
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,190
- Yes.
-who?

242
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,527
Karen Berman. My Aunt Teresa.

243
00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:12,825
Cousin Tommy in Rochester.
Eddie Meyers from the office.

244
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:18,331
- Stanley, who fixed the kitchen.
- Aunt Teresa is gay?

245
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:22,794
That beautiful, voluptuous woman
is a lesbian?

246
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:28,842
- Since when?
- Probably since she was born.

247
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:34,890
I admit it, okay. I'm prejudiced.
I don't like homosexuals.

248
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:39,353
The way they do that thing.
Don't they get confused?

249
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,523
"Is this yours or mine?"

250
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:48,613
I don't want to be in bed with
anybody who is stronger than me.

251
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:54,370
You can call me old-fashioned
and conservative, but I'm a man.

252
00:31:54,537 --> 00:32:02,337
Any man will tell you
how disgusting that whole idea is.

253
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:07,884
- Little cave man of the house.
- You damn skippy.

254
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,639
- Stay away from your Aunt Teresa.
- Don't say that to her.

255
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:19,313
Guys trying to be macho
and faggot at the same time.

256
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:24,110
- I'm being totally honest with you.
- Yeah, you are.

257
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:30,367
Would you accept a client
if you were constantly thinking:

258
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:36,248
"I don't want this person
to touch me or even breathe on me?"

259
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:42,088
- Not if I was you, honey.
- Exactly...what?

260
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:51,139
Merry Christmas.

261
00:32:56,103 --> 00:33:00,483
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.

262
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:04,028
- You're the...
- TV guy.

263
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:59,922
This is the supplement.

264
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:05,303
You're right. There is a section
on HIV-related discrimination.

265
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:10,017
Thank you very much.

266
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:22,238
We do have
a private research room.

267
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:28,537
- I'm fine right here.
- I'm looking for the Murdoch case.

268
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:31,582
Just a moment.

269
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:55,900
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

270
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:14,295
No...
would it make you more comfortable?

271
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,514
Beckett, how are you doing?

272
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:32,064
Counsellor.

273
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:47,664
Whatever, sir.

274
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:54,171
Excuse me.

275
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:09,813
Who did you get?
Did you find a lawyer?

276
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:14,610
I'm a lawyer.

277
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:21,326
- How's your baby?
- She's... wonderful.

278
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:25,413
- What's her name?
- Larice.

279
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:31,211
- That's a beautiful name.
- We named her after my sister.

280
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,965
Look...

281
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,847
How did they find out you had AIDS?

282
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:24,310
One of the partners
noticed a lesion on my forehead.

283
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:32,236
But how..?

284
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:38,326
How do you go from that,
which could have been anything,

285
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:45,959
to deducing that you had AIDS
and terminating you on that basis?

286
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,464
That's a good point.

287
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:01,476
The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton,

288
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:05,772
worked forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm
in D.C.

289
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:12,029
A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,
showed lesions on and off.

290
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:16,033
It was common knowledge
that she had AIDS.

291
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,247
- But they didn't fire her.
- No, they did not fire her.

292
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:25,043
Have you got a relevant precedent?

293
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:32,009
The Arline decision...
Supreme Court.

294
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:51,989
"The Federal Rehabilitation Act
of 1973,

295
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:56,535
prohibits discrimination
against handicapped persons

296
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,915
if they can perform the duties
required of them".

297
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:05,378
"Though the ruling did not specify
AIDS discrimination..."

298
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:10,258
"subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is a handicap

299
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:14,096
because of the physical
limitations it imposes

300
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:19,894
and the prejudice surrounding it,
which exacts a social death...

301
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:28,904
that proceeds
the actual physical one".

302
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:39,707
"This is the essence
of discrimination".

303
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:44,587
"Formulating opinions about others
not based on their merits,

304
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:49,885
but on their membership in a group
with the same characteristics".

305
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:21,627
- Charleswheeler.
- Julius Erving. Glad to see you.

306
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,215
Ken Starr.

307
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,890
It'll only take a minute.

308
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:38,562
Charleswheeler. How are you doing?
A summons for you.

309
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:43,109
Take a look at it.
Dr. J., you're the best.

310
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:48,156
If you ever need a lawyer,
just give me a call.

311
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,326
See you in court.

312
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:54,288
You're the TV guy.

313
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,670
What's up?

314
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:05,550
I want to know everything
about Andy's personal life.

315
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:09,304
Does he frequent
those pathetic bars?

316
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:13,809
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

317
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:18,856
What deviant groups
does he secretly belong to?

318
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:25,196
- What is it, Bob?
- Let's make a settlement offer.

319
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:32,579
Andy brought AIDS into our offices,
into our men's room.

320
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:37,251
He brought AIDS
to our annual family picnic!

321
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:41,506
- We ought to be suing him.
- Show some compassion.

322
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:44,342
We gave him Highline.

323
00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:50,766
Did Beckett say, "I won't be able to
function to the best of my ability?"

324
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:54,937
Now, discarding the trust
I conferred upon him,

325
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:59,358
Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court.

326
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:03,363
To sling accusations at me.
To call me a bigot...

327
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:09,453
in full view of the Philadelphia
judicial establishment.

328
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:19,589
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.

329
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:24,928
- A jury might side with him.
- Wait a minute...

330
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:29,808
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

331
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:35,439
- Did you know he was sick?
- Did you, Bob?

332
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,778
No... not really.

333
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:58,381
Everybody,
this is the house that I grew up in.

334
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:02,135
Right here in
Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

335
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:05,638
Here's proof.

336
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:11,311
There. My hand prints
from when I was a cute little boy.

337
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:17,026
Today is the 40th wedding
anniversary of my mom and dad.

338
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:24,367
- A tough life in all that poverty.
- Those can be some mean streets.

339
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:30,248
Here's the front door. I once
broke this finger in this door.

340
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:36,338
- Where's my brother?
- There's my sister Jill.

341
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:41,094
- Say hello, Alexis.
- Mommy's pregnant again.

342
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,721
Are you really?

343
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:46,808
- Hello, Meghan.
- Uncle Andy.

344
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:50,354
- Where's Dad?
- Fixing the snowblower.

345
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,608
It snows once in seven years,
and Dad buys a new snowblower.

346
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:58,446
- How are you?
- Today's a good day.

347
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:05,203
Meghan, you're doing a great job.
I've got to say hello to my sisters.

348
00:44:15,673 --> 00:44:18,634
Put me down!

349
00:44:40,908 --> 00:44:45,246
Parts of the trial
will be hard for you to hear,

350
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:51,378
about my personal life.
And there's going to be publicity.

351
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:57,218
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, she's fine.

352
00:44:57,676 --> 00:45:04,100
I think it's great you're asking...
but this is really your call.

353
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:07,145
Thanks, brother.

354
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:12,693
You're my kid brother.
That's all that matters, okay?

355
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,283
To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

356
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:25,373
They've been through so much, and
there are some tough times ahead.

357
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:32,256
Andy, the way that you've
handled this whole thing...

358
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:37,219
you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

359
00:45:37,428 --> 00:45:41,891
There's nothing
that anybody could say

360
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:47,814
that could make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

361
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:54,446
I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

362
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:59,577
You get in there
and you fight for your rights.

363
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:02,455
I love you guys.

364
00:46:28,692 --> 00:46:31,153
Ladies and gentlemen...

365
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,702
Forget everything you've seen
on TV and in the movies.

366
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:42,749
There will be no surprise witnesses
or tearful confessions.

367
00:46:42,957 --> 00:46:46,878
You're going to be presented
with a simple fact.

368
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:51,049
Andrew Beckett was fired.

369
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:55,971
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired.

370
00:46:56,931 --> 00:47:01,185
It is up to you
to sift through the facts

371
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:05,523
until you determine
what you think to be the truth.

372
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:11,864
Certain points must be proven.
One: Andrew Beckett was...

373
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:15,659
is a brilliant lawyer.

374
00:47:15,826 --> 00:47:19,580
Two: Andrew Beckett,
has a debilitating disease.

375
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:27,672
He made the legal choice to keep
this fact from his employers.

376
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,722
Three: His employer discovered this.
The illness here is AIDS.

377
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:38,809
Four: They panicked.

378
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:46,943
They did what most of us
would like to do with AIDS.

379
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:53,534
Get it and everybody who has it
as far away from us as possible.

380
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:00,708
Such behaviour may seem reasonable
to you. It does to me.

381
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:04,003
AIDS is an incurable disease.

382
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:11,303
But no matter what moral judgement
you make upon his employers,

383
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,934
the fact that Beckett was fired
because he had AIDS...

384
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:21,272
means they broke the law.

385
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,613
Fact:

386
00:48:30,615 --> 00:48:37,415
Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job varied from competent...

387
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,753
to, often times, mediocre...

388
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:46,508
to sometimes
flagrantly incompetent.

389
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:49,344
Fact:

390
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:54,308
He claims
he's the victim of lies and deceit.

391
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,103
Fact:

392
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:04,402
It was Andrew Beckett who lied
about his disease to his employers.

393
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,821
Fact:

394
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:12,494
He was successful in his duplicity.

395
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:16,415
The partners at Wyant Wheeler
did not know

396
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:21,129
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

397
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:26,593
Fact:

398
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,263
Andrew Beckett is dying.

399
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:42,318
Fact:
Andrew Beckett is angry.

400
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:51,036
His lifestyle and reckless behaviour
have cut short his life.

401
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:57,126
In his anger and rage
he is lashing out.

402
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:01,214
He wants someone to pay.

403
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,262
Thank you.

404
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:26,866
Andrew Beckett represented
your firm in 1990, is that correct?

405
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:31,246
- That's correct.
- Were you pleased with his work?

406
00:50:31,413 --> 00:50:35,793
We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

407
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:40,756
Satisfied.

408
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:48,974
Mr. Laird, you gave me sworn
testimony in your deposition.

409
00:50:49,224 --> 00:50:52,811
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

410
00:50:53,020 --> 00:51:00,736
You said you were impressed
and delighted with Beckett's work.

411
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:03,656
Do you recall saying that?

412
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:16,670
In all honesty I was delighted
with aspects of Andy's efforts.

413
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:22,927
But in general, I found the work
to be merely satisfactory.

414
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:33,313
Do you agree...

415
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:37,485
that a baloney sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

416
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:44,367
Whereas, caviar and champagne,
roast duck and baked Alaska...

417
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,495
might be considered delightful?

418
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:52,876
We object. These gastronomical
comments are irrelevant.

419
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:59,258
Five months ago you characterised
Andrew Beckett as caviar.

420
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:02,470
Now he's a baloney sandwich.

421
00:52:02,637 --> 00:52:08,560
What powerful force
caused this change of mind?

422
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,025
He hasn't changed his mind.
He's amplified his answer.

423
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:18,028
Objection sustained.

424
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:31,919
Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old.

425
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,923
Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

426
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:42,889
- Yes, we won.
- Congratulations, what a...

427
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:46,351
satisfactory experience.

428
00:53:14,506 --> 00:53:17,051
Ready, Mr. Beckett.

429
00:53:23,558 --> 00:53:26,603
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

430
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:31,191
Do you see this
as a gay-rights issue?

431
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:35,404
I am not political.
I just want what is fair.

432
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:37,865
You are gay?

433
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:42,203
That's none ofyourbusiness,
butyes, I am.

434
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,585
Do homosexuals
deserve special treatment?.

435
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:50,962
Hell no!

436
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:55,175
Philadelphia
is the city ofbrotherly love.

437
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:58,763
The Declaration oflndependence
was signed here.

438
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:01,098
That documentsays:

439
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:06,271
"All men are created equal".

440
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,776
Give me a break.

441
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:18,659
- We scorn discriminatorypractices.
- Thank you, Mayor.

442
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:24,165
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

443
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:39,098
Yeah, I am, Filko. I'm changing.

444
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:41,851
I'm on the prowl.

445
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,856
And I'm looking for a hunk.
A real man... like you.

446
00:54:47,816 --> 00:54:51,737
You know what we do.
You want to play sailor?

447
00:54:51,987 --> 00:54:55,282
- Columbus and the first mate.
- That's not funny!

448
00:54:55,449 --> 00:55:00,663
These people make me sick...
but the law's been broken.

449
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,250
You remember the law, don't you?

450
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:12,885
- At least we agree on one thing.
-what's that?

451
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:17,681
Tutti-fruttis make me sick, too.

452
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:27,192
Ms. Benedict, you worked
forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm.

453
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,072
- At the same time as Walter Kenton?
- That's correct.

454
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:37,870
He knew the lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?

455
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:41,249
Definitely, I told all the partners.

456
00:55:41,415 --> 00:55:45,587
How did Walter Kenton
treat you after that?

457
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:50,634
Every time we met,
he'd get this look on his face.

458
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:56,557
The "Oh God!" expression. As in,
"Oh God, that woman has AIDS".

459
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,937
Thank you. No more questions.

460
00:56:01,312 --> 00:56:05,316
Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract AIDS?

461
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:09,488
Through a transfusion
just after childbirth.

462
00:56:09,654 --> 00:56:15,160
So it was not your behaviour
which caused you to be infected.

463
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:18,581
You were unable to avoid it.

464
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,170
I guess.

465
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:30,135
Thank you.

466
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:35,099
But I don't consider myself
different to anyone else with AIDS.

467
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:40,313
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

468
00:56:40,479 --> 00:56:45,527
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No further questions at this time.

469
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:50,615
You may step down, Ms. Benedict.

470
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:57,623
Apart from the marks on his face,
were there other things

471
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,711
that made you suspect he had AIDS?

472
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:07,467
He was thin and he seemed tired,
but he was working so hard.

473
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:10,095
Something was wrong.

474
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:14,641
They're trying to pretend
that they didn't notice anything.

475
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:19,146
- Objection.
- Just answer the question.

476
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:24,444
Have you ever felt discriminated
against at Wyant Wheeler?

477
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:28,490
- Yes.
- In what way?

478
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:32,035
Mr. Wheeler's secretary Lydia

479
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:36,665
said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

480
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:42,922
Apparently Mr.wheeler felt
that they were too "ethnic".

481
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:48,470
She told me he'd like something
a little less garish...

482
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:54,893
- Something more "American".
- What did you say?

483
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,941
I said, "My earrings are American.
They're African-American".

484
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:07,532
- Let's have order, please.
- No more questions.

485
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:12,663
Ms. Burton,
weren't you recently promoted?

486
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:17,334
Yes, I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

487
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:23,716
Congratulations on your unfettered
success at Wyant Wheeler.

488
00:58:23,883 --> 00:58:26,886
Unfettered?

489
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:30,307
I don't understand this.

490
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:36,814
The promotion of an obviously
intelligent, articulate...

491
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:42,111
qualified
African-American woman

492
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:46,658
in a firm which practices
wanton discrimination.

493
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:52,456
- That is what's claimed here.
- I can't explain it.

494
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:59,130
Could it be that
these instances of discrimination

495
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:06,137
are in fact misunderstandings that
have been blown out of proportion?

496
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:12,227
I think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue.
