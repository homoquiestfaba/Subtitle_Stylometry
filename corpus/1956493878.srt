00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,805
by the bad guys, Syria.

373
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,774
They wanted to kill our economy
by oversaturating the dollar.

374
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,577
So now, the US treasury has new
plates,

375
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,647
makes better money, smarter
money, harder to counterfeit.

376
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,551
Yeah, but they're trying to
play a catch-up game, replacing

377
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,520
the old queer with new bills.

378
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,855
DALTREY: It's called serial
rotation.

379
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,991
Once a month, they dump a
truckload of new bills on a 747

380
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,892
and send it overseas.

381
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,860
And what's the take?

382
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,964
On average, $200, $300 million
per flight.

383
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:31,003
Seven players, eight figures
minimum, minus the money

384
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,938
you owe me.

385
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,506
Can you clean it?

386
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,842
I got a banker in Belgrade,
takes 20% off the top.

387
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,411
We bring the cash in, give him
our bank account numbers,

388
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,812
he pushes a few buttons.

389
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,681
It's all numbers.

390
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,815
Who's the crew?

391
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,884
DALTREY: My men, hand picked.

392
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,319
KETCHUM: Why do you need us?

393
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,687
I don't.

394
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,756
I'm being force fed.

395
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,658
NEWCASTLE: Daltrey runs the
show.

396
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,726
You don't like the way the game
is played, walk away.

397
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,399
You in or out?

398
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,333
Why not?

399
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,003
NEWCASTLE: So have you met this
package?

400
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,605
It's Daltrey's sister. SOPHIE:
Sophie.

401
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,239
Hey. - That's him.

402
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,507
That's him. Billy the Kid.

403
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,474
BILLY: Hey. What's up?

404
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,842
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

405
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,281
DALTREY: OK, this is really
heartwarming,

406
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,283
but enough already.

407
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,985
Let's get the freshmen caught up
so we can get to work.

408
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,926
Javier, Brooks.

409
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,932
All right, this job breaks down
into three parts--

410
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,668
getting on board, cracking the
cargo hold,

411
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,470
and offloading the take.

412
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,540
We'll start with the target, a
747-400.

413
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,077
Standard exterior construction,
no real advances.

414
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,580
But the guts are very special.

415
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,983
[INAUDIBLE] modified it to meet
their personnel specs.

416
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,352
Now, the details are secondhand
at best.

417
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,021
However, during downtime, the
Fed

418
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,522
leases it out to a high-end
freight

419
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,925
outfit called Crown Couriers.

420
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,361
Priority one, we pay them a
visit.

421
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,596
Now, it's going to be at
Copperfield--

422
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,432
no lifts, just pictures and
data.

423
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,500
Winky, tell them what you got.

424
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,468
OK.

425
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,040
Data bank is on the west side,
fifth floor.

426
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,409
There's a main entrance, two
side doors.

427
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,878
They lead directly into an
interior stairwell.

428
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,114
There's no alarm, but there is
video surveillance.

429
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:25,017
And they have two night guards,
but they're fat.

430
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,120
Oh, and, uh, two big
Rottweilers.

431
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,488
Two what?

432
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,990
Uh, dogs-- big dogs.

433
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,893
[WHISTLES] OK, here you go.

434
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,395
Here you go.

435
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,129
That's right.

436
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,130
What's your name?

437
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,097
Precious?

438
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,834
Supper's on.

439
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,449
SOPHIE: Exit five, go right,
third door on your left.

440
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,023
DALTREY: Hopefully we get what
we need.

441
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,158
Daltrey.

442
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,960
DALTREY: Then we figure out how
to break into the vault.

443
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:13,031
BROOKS: 12-inch steel door,
fingerprint ID,

444
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,833
voice recognition.

445
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,402
Can't be faked.

446
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,471
If we voice recorders from
above,

447
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,039
record him during a system
check, and [INAUDIBLE]

448
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,708
for the print match. It's a
cake.

449
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,809
Could work.

450
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,778
Would get us to stage two.

451
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,549
10-digit serial alarm with a
code that changes every day.

452
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,583
Mm-hm.

453
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,484
Wait a minute.

454
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
Wait a minute.

455
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,855
Brooks, you designed a code
break for the Syracuse job,

456
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,756
correct?

457
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,690
We use that.

458
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,726
Yeah, but that was a single
task entry.

459
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,528
This is a multilayered system
with rotating inputs.

460
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,498
DALTREY: And your point is what?

461
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,466
Just make it work.

462
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,904
Did your mama slap him when you
were growing up?

463
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,540
DALTREY: Now, part two is
getting on board.

464
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,711
All transatlantic flights are
served out of the same kitchen.

465
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,849
Thankfully, Javier is set up in
food service.

466
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,783
[SPANISH]

467
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,085
JAVIER: Gracias, OK.

468
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,623
There's no way to get direct
access.

469
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,859
So it's got to be a [INAUDIBLE]
wait.

470
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,629
We'll pack two hot meals per
crew member.

471
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,098
Flight crew is usually between
two to four,

472
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,734
plus a couple career suits.

473
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,604
Usually means three carts per
flight.

474
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,741
It's a simple Trojan horse.

475
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,811
OK, OK, OK, OK.

476
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,246
Huh?

477
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,180
Come on.

478
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:46,925
Ready?

479
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,932
- Oh, god. - Ooh.

480
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,802
I guess that's a yes.

481
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,537
Did anybody understand what he
said?

482
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,506
Sí, sí. [SPANISH]

483
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,307
All right.

484
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,111
As for the rest of us, Ketchum,
I

485
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,980
hear you have some toys that
might come in handy.

486
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,682
Yeah, I'll arrange something.

487
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,817
Where'd you get it?

488
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,819
Old Tupolev, Tu-20.

489
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:20,859
Not exactly the same components
as a TEXASBOY713, but close.

490
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,828
This thing going to work?

491
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:28,266
I've never actually tried it
like this, but yeah.

492
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,936
It should work.

493
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,103
You might want to step back.

494
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,679
OK, Billy.

495
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,092
That won't happen, hopefully.

496
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,929
Well, if we decide to shoot it
out of the sky,

497
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,598
I think we're covered.

498
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,833
It's the first try.

499
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,801
Trust me.

500
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,672
Right?

501
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,274
So you guys bring supper?

502
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,279
And finally, offloading.

503
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,215
Now, we're anticipating two to
three pallets,

504
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,818
weighing up to 200 pounds each.

505
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,254
So breaking them down is
essential for the transfer.

506
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:27,659
A stack of $100 bills nine
inches high is $100,000.

507
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,795
Ten of them in a block about
this big is $1 million.

508
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,667
You'll probably get eight to 10
million in one duffel bag.

509
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,335
Take no more than you can carry.

510
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,140
If everything turns out all
right,

511
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,608
you disappear into the night
sky.

512
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,883
So Brooksy, what's the key?

513
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,018
What's going to make the
difference?

514
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,854
Trust, always trust.

515
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,122
Trust, huh?

516
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,359
Yeah, well, that's close, but
I'm going to have to disagree

517
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,261
with you on that one.

518
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,198
Desmodus rotundus-- anyone know
what that is?

519
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,133
Anyone?

520
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,034
No.

521
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,201
Hey, oh, you in the front.

522
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,336
Vampire bat.

523
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,239
Vampire bat, that's correct,
the invisible predator.

524
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,641
Their favorite target is
sleeping cattle.

525
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,210
They secrete a saliva that numbs
the cow's skin

526
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,646
and then gorge themselves.

527
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,784
Stomach full, the bad flies away
while the cow

528
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,119
sleeps on through the night.

529
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,022
That 747 is our cow.

530
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:37,362
And thanks to Mr. Newcastle, we
are the bat.

531
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,365
Invisibility-- that's the key to
this job.

532
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,971
KETCHUM: Twice, when Brooks and
I worked with your brother

533
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,139
about seven, eight years ago.

534
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,874
You don't remember us at all?

535
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,809
Why should I?

536
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:51,910
Common courtesy, you know?

537
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,045
I mean, when somebody says they
remember you, you--

538
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,980
you lie.

539
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,214
You say, oh, yeah, yeah.

540
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,250
Now I remember you.

541
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,287
So you never wanted to be a
normal girl?

542
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,321
I am normal.

543
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,256
No, I mean normal like
shopping,

544
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,459
boys, dating, instead of
cracking

545
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,260
safes and rolling marks.

546
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,462
I go out, you know.

547
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,896

Yep.

I'm not so good in small
planes.

00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,511
Wow.

00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,246

So if there's anything we can do
from up here, just let us know.

Well, pace yourself.

00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,694
It's a long flight.

I always save my paperwork for
the last leg.

Boeing 747, queen of the skies.

00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,314
You know how much one of these
cost when they

793
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,150
first started building them?

00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,084
No.

00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,354
$160 million.

OK, releasing flap.

our landing gear.
