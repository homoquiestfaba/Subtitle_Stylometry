00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,080
Quills (2000) - 25 fps

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,000
Dear reader,
I've a naughty little tale to tell,

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,720
plucked from the pages of history.

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Tarted up, true,

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,000
but guaranteed to stimulate the senses.

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,680
The story of Mademoiselle Renard,

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,720
a ravishing, young aristocrat
whose sexual proclivities...

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,280
ran the gamut from winsome to bestial.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Who doesn't dream of indulging
every spasm of lust,

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,440
feeding each depraved hunger?

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Owing to her noble birth,

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,800
Mademoiselle Renard was granted
full immunity to do just that -

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,920
inflicting pain and pleasure
with equal zest.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Until one day...

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Mademoiselle found herself
at the mercy of a man...

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,080
every bit as perverse as she.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,880
A man whose skill in the art of pain...

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
exceeded her own.

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,080
How easily, dear reader,

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,120
one changes from predator...

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
to prey.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,440
And how swiftly pleasure is
taken from some...

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
and given to others.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
There goes another one.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,480
Your linens, please.

26
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,840
- Move yourself.
- We're going outside.

28
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,600
Good morning.

29
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,280
- I'm going outside.
- Go on.

30
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Stop doing that. Everybody up.

31
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Your linens, please.

32
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,960
Psst.

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,560
It's me.

34
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,120
Careful.
The ink's still wet.

35
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
Now, hurry.

36
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
That you, Maddie ?

37
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Yes, Mother.
Here are the dirty ones for you.

38
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Just, uh-

39
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Just taking the bleached ones out to dry.

40
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
Aren't you gonna give us a hand then ?

41
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bouchon!

42
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,960
Remember your manners.

43
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,160
Here it is.
It's the last chapter.

44
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another
manuscript quick as he please.

45
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,080
- He can't print them fast enough.
- I'll pass the word on.

46
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,960
I'll pay you another visit with
a share of the profits once it's sold.

47
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,160
- I'll be waiting.
- Perhaps, one day, you'll tell me your name.

48
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
All right, we're all clear.

49
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,440
- Thank you.
- Marquis de Sade's Justine.

50
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,960
Latest edition, straight
from the printer's. Justine.

51
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Marquis de Sade.
Justine.

52
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,360
Our story concerns
a nymph named Justine,

53
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,560
as pretty a maid as ever
entered the nunnery,

54
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,880
- with a body so firm and ripe...
- Come on, boy.

55
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,240
it seemed a shame
to commit it to God.

56
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,040
One morning, the bishop placed
his hand upon her thigh.

57
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,600
"Holy Father," cried she,

58
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,040
"I've come to confess my sins,
not commit them anew."

59
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,360
Heedless, the old priest
turned her over on his knee...

60
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,560
and lifted her skirts
high above her hips,

61
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,040
exposing the pink flesh
of her backside.

62
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,400
There between the orbs
of her dimpled ass...

63
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,120
lay a blushing rosebud...

64
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,600
begging to be... plucked.

65
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,760
Before Justine could wrestle
from his grasp,

66
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,080
this most ungodly man
took a communion wafer,

67
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,440
the body of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

68
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,440
and placed it on the girl's
twitching orifice.

69
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,920
Must I, Your Majesty ?

70
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
As he loosened his manhood
from beneath his robes,

71
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,720
the bishop muttered
a Latin prayer...

72
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,120
and then,
with a mighty thrust,

73
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,720
drove it into her very entrails.

74
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,680
The novel's lewd subject matter
and its overripe style...

75
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,400
reveal it to be the work
of the Marquis de Sade.

76
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,720
He composes his prose
from inside a madhouse.

77
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,960
Enough !
Seize every copy !

78
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,320
We'll torch them all on the palace
lawn in full public view !

79
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,080
As for the author, shoot him.

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A note of caution, Sire.

81
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,280
We all remember what happened
to Robespierre, Danton.

82
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,160
Put the marquis to death and history
might even regard you as a despot.

83
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
But I am history.

84
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
Of course, Your Majesty.

85
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Nevertheless,
cure the Marquis de Sade,

86
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
succeed where countless...

87
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,480
physicians and priests
have failed-

88
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,000
No one can fault Napoleon...

89
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,920
for bringing a man to his senses.

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,920
Might I suggest...

91
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,440
an appraisal at the asylum of Charenton

92
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,160
and the rather notorious inmate
in her care?

93
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
I have the perfect candidate
for the job,

94
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,800
Dr. Royer-Collard,

95
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,440
a distinguished alienist
who's a staunchly moral man...

96
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,880
of impeccable character...

97
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,600
and iron resolve.

98
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,520
My colleagues have called me
old-fashioned.

99
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,920
Even barbaric.

100
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
But here at the Hotel Dieu, we favour
an aggressive course of treatment.

101
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Quite.

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,200
I do not seek popularity or renown,
Monsieur Delbené. Mine is a higher mission.

103
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,360
To take God's tiny blunders
and those He has forsaken...

104
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
and condition them with
the same force, the same rigor...

105
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,880
one would employ to train
a feral dog or a wild stallion.

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,080
This may not be pretty,

107
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,960
but it is mercy just the same.

108
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,920
A few more months of this,
and he'll be fine.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,160
It is the emperor's hope...

110
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
that you bring your expertise,
your proficiency...

111
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,080
- to the asylum at Charenton.
- I'm much better now.

112
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,280
Charenton ? The administrator there
is quite well-loved, isn't he ?

113
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
He's young, an idealist.
You'll have to be politic.

114
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you know how
I define idealism ?

115
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,400
Youth's final luxury.

116
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Not so hard. Don't force it.

117
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Let the quill guide you.

118
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Good.

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,960
Slowly.

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
We mustn't just copy the words.

121
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,240
It's important that we know
what they mean.

122
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,040
St. Augustine tells us that angels and
demons walk among us on the Earth...

123
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,000
and that sometimes they jointly
inhabit the soul of a single man.

124
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,640
Then how can we know...

125
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,640
who is truly good and who is evil ?

126
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,520
Well, we can't.

127
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,520
All we can do is guard
against our own corruption.

128
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,400
So you'll practice reading
tonight on your own for me ?

129
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,800
And so the professor lifted
Colombe's skirt...

130
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,880
high above her waist.

131
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,280
"Let me be your tutor" said he,
"in the ways of love."

132
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,600
With that, he slid her...
pantalettes down,

133
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,320
down, down over her knees.

134
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
And there, nestled between her legs,

135
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,080
as pink as a tulip,

136
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,040
as slick as an eel...

137
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,520
We oughtn't to be reading
his nasty stories.

138
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,080
No one's forcing you to listen.

139
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,480
He gazed upon her Venus mound,

140
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,840
her flaxen quim,
the winking eye of God.

141
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,000
You've been in his quarters,
haven't you ?

142
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,720
Once or twice.

143
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,760
I hear he's got a whetstone and a chisel,
that he uses to sharpen his teeth.

144
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,160
He's a writer, not a madman.

145
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,600
- What's he doing in here then ?
- Murder.

146
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,680
That's not so.

147
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,680
He writes books so wicked,
so black with evil,

148
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,600
that one man killed his wife
after reading them.

149
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,560
And two young mothers
miscarried their babies.

150
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,720
I'd say that's murder enough.

151
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,240
If you're going to slander him, you
don't deserve to hear his stories.

152
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,920
I believe she's sweet on him.
That's what I think.

153
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,320
It's not the marquis she's sweet on,
is it, Madeleine ?

154
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
They've no right sending someone
to sit on your shoulder.

155
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
I work for you.
I won't take orders from a stranger.

156
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
You needn't worry.

157
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,400
It's administrative,
nothing more.

158
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,720
Please don't eat
the paint, Pasqual.

159
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Ah, bravo, Dauphin.

160
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,280
It's far better to paint fires
than to set them, isn't it ?

161
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Yes.

162
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,160
Wonderful.

163
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:18,200
Fresh linens.

164
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm hungry for a proper visit.

165
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,880
- Don't start.
- Go ahead. You've a key.

166
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,280
Slip it through my tiny hole.

167
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Marquis ?

168
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Where did you get to then ?

169
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,600
Marquis ?

170
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,560
Well? Did I frighten you ?

171
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,160
Frighten me ? That's a good one.
I'm twice as quick as you are.

172
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,160
I suppose you want to know
about that silly book of yours.

173
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,440
What about my book ?

174
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,760
It sold like the devil.

175
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
Then they started burning it.

176
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,280
That's the peril of composing
such incendiary prose.

177
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,560
If only these coins purchased
your other talents too.

178
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
There's something else
I want from you.

179
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,720
You've already stolen my heart...

180
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,840
as well as another prominent organ
south of the equator.

181
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,200
Your publisher says I'm not to leave
without another manuscript.

182
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
I've just the story.

183
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
Inspired by these very surroundings.

184
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,840
The unhappy tale
of a virginal laundry lass,

185
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,040
a darling of the lower wards where
they entomb the criminally insane.

186
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,280
- Is it awfully violent ?
- Most assuredly.

187
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,200
- Is it terribly erotic ?
- Fiendishly so.

188
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
But it comes with a price.

189
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,920
A kiss for each page.

190
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,520
Must I administer them directly
or might I blow them ?

191
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,520
The price, my coquette,
is every bit as firm... as I am.

192
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
Oh, you.

193
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
You talk the same as you write.

194
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hello.

195
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
So what are we today, Cleante ?

196
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,120
Is it bullfinch or nightingale ?

197
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,640
- There's but one kind of bird
in a madhouse, Abbé.
- Oh, don't tell me.

198
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,560
A loon !

199
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,360
Sorry, I've heard that one before.

200
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,120
It's a long story, this one.

201
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,080
The climax comes at a higher cost.

202
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
You must sit on my lap.

203
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,960
You demand a lot from your readers.

204
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The story's thrilling conclusion
comes at a premium.

205
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
- What's that then ?
- Your maidenhead.

206
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,960
And then you must sew it up
as tightly as the day you were born,

207
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,320
and come back to me renewed
so I can deflower you a second time.

208
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,520
Some things belong on paper...

209
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
others in life.

210
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,160
Blessed fool who can't tell
the difference-

211
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Mademoiselle LeClerc.

212
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,800
You're in the nick of time.

213
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,360
This old letch forgot himself.

214
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,920
He thought I was a character
in one of his nasty stories.

215
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,440
- Madeleine.
- Yes, Abbé ?

216
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,760
The next time you feel
the urge to visit the marquis...

217
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,960
I hope you'll come
to confession instead.

218
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Care for a splash
of wine, Abbé ?

219
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
It's not even noon.

220
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Conversation, like certain portions
of the anatomy,

221
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,600
always runs more smoothly
when it's lubricated.

222
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,920
This is a rare vintage from
an obscure village in Bordeaux.

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,880
Rather than crush the grape underfoot,
they place it on the belly of a bride,

224
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,640
and reap its juices when the young
husband steers his vessel into port.

225
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Full-bodied flavor,
just a hint of wantonness.

226
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,760
Bottoms up.

227
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,840
It's from our own cellar.
I recognize the taste.

228
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,560
I should have told you
it was the blood of Christ.

229
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,440
You'd believe that, wouldn't you ?

230
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,560
We treat you well enough here,
don't we, Marquis ?

231
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Your very own feathered bed
in lieu of a straw mat.

232
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,320
Your antique writing desk,
all the way from La Coste.

233
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
Enough quills to feather an ostrich-

234
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes, yes, yes, dear heart, it's true.
You spoil me pink.

235
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,440
And in exchange, we ask only
that you follow the rules.

236
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,320
You know as well as I do, you're not
to entertain visitors in your quarters.

237
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I ?

238
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Yes, but I'm not a beautiful,
young prospect ripe for corruption.

239
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
Don't be so sure.

240
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,240
Take your pen in hand, Marquis.

241
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,440
Purge these wicked thoughts
of yours on paper.

242
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Maybe they'll govern you less in life.

243
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,320
I'll fill page after page,
my cherub.

244
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,040
I promise.

245
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,720
We're here, Doctor.
Mind your step, sir.

246
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,360
Good day, sir.
We've been expecting you.

247
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,360
Good. Very good.

248
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,360
Dr. Royer-Collard,
welcome to Charenton.

249
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,000
This may feel a little awkward, my friend,

250
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,080
but it needn't be.

251
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,960
I've come merely to oversee your
work here. Understood ?

252
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,120
- Of course.
- It's a formality. Truly.

253
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,280
Well, you're a man of science,
and I'm a man of God.

254
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,200
Charenton stands to profit
from us both, I'm certain.

255
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,000
I shall need an office on the grounds,
somewhere to store my things.

256
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,120
- This way.
- If you don't mind my asking,

257
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,080
why has the emperor taken
such sudden interest in my-

258
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,040
in our affairs ?

259
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,640
It seems a particular patient of
yours... has captured his fancy.

260
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,960
I understand he practices the very
crimes he preaches in his fiction.

261
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Certainly not here.

262
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,760
- There were a few indiscretions in his youth.
- Indiscretions ?

263
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,600
Abbé, please,
I have read his case history.

264
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,040
At 16, he violated
a servant girl with a crucifix.

265
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,440
After six months in a dungeon,
he mutilated a prostitute,

266
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,320
carving her flesh with a razor and
cauterizing the wounds with hot wax.

267
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,280
I hope you'll judge him
by his progress here,

268
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
- No !
- not his past reputation.

269
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,280
I can't go on like this.
Why should this be happening to me ?

270
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
Once again, gentlemen.

271
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,240
I'm just a lowly cobbler.

272
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
I have been all my life.

273
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,400
And with this shoe,
I'm asking you to be a cobbler's wife.

274
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,680
It's a dreadful play, a festering pustule
on the face of literature.

275
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Why, the parchment it's written upon
isn't worthy to wipe my ass.

276
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,720
But you need not make it worse.
Say your lines with conviction,
my happy little shoemaker.

277
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,720
- Like a true actor.
- But I'm not an actor. I'm a dyspeptic.

278
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,560
Just seduce her, you goon !

279
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,360
He's actually made a great success
of our little theater.

280
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,680
There's seldom an empty seat,
not to mention its therapeutic value.

281
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,600
Playing dress-up with cretins...

282
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,480
sounds like a symptom
of madness, not a cure.

283
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,640
Homo perversio:
a species that thrives in captivity.

284
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Marquis, this is Dr. Royer-Collard.
He's joining us here in-

285
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,280
An advisory capacity.

286
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,960
Welcome to our humble madhouse, Doctor.

287
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,120
I trust you'll find yourself at home.

288
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,440
There he is, the new doctor.

289
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Tell me, Abbé, why is he in your care
and not a proper prison ?

290
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,240
- His wife's influence.
- "His wife's" ?

291
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,000
Better to have an insane spouse
than a criminal one.

292
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,120
And he has never once
tried to escape ?

293
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,440
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last
a day on the streets without capture.

294
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,440
Besides, every wholesome thing
he might desire, he has at Charenton,

295
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,000
a library filled with the world's
great books,

296
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,680
music lessons, watercolor exercises.

297
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,080
What effect have all these amenities
had on his psyche ?

298
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,560
He no longer roars or spits.

299
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,080
He no longer taunts the guards
or molests his fellow wards.

300
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,720
And his writing ?

301
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,960
- Ah, yes, that.
- Well ?

302
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,120
It's essential to his recovery,
a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

303
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,680
Do you favor its publication ?

304
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,560
- For sale ? To the general public ?
- Yes. Yes.

305
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,040
No, certainly not. It's unprintable.

306
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,160
All France is aghast at this book,
yet you've never heard of it.

307
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,120
Oh, dear God.

308
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,520
Silence the marquis, or Charenton will
be shut down by order of the emperor.

309
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Shut down ? But he's one
among some 200 wards.

310
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,560
You could try my calming chair on him.

311
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,000
Or, perhaps,
try bleeding him with leeches.

312
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,880
Or maybe flog him at the stake.

313
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,440
Why ? So he'll learn
to fear punishment...

314
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,640
rather than to see virtue
for its own rewards ?

315
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,600
Doctor, let me take up this matter
with the marquis myself.

316
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,600
- Chariton's my life's work.
- I am not without a heart.

317
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,320
But this book is a profound insult
to decent people everywhere.

318
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Can you personally guarantee
this won't happen again ?

319
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,640
You have my word.

320
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,360
- What is it, Abbé ?
- The marquis has embarrassed us.

321
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,880
- From Napoleon himself.
- Why ? What's he done ?

322
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,760
He's been slipping manuscripts
to a publisher.

323
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,800
- He has ?

324
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,480
I placed my trust
too carelessly, Madeleine.

325
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,960
- This is a complete and utter...
- Oh.

326
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,080
disappointment.

327
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,040
Yes, it is.

328
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,040
The paper's cheap.
The type's too small.

329
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,400
What did you do,
bribe one of the guards ?

330
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,520
But you implored me to write
for curative purposes,
to stave off my madness.

331
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,960
But you've no right
to publish...

332
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,360
behind my back
without my sanction.

333
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,160
Have you truly read it,
or did you run straightaway
to the dog-eared pages ?

334
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Oh, enough to discern
its tenor.

335
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,280
And ?

336
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,040
It's not even a proper novel.

337
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,640
It's nothing but an encyclopedia
of perversions.

338
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,160
Frankly, it even fails
as an exercise in craft.

339
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,360
Characters are wooden.
The dialogue is inane.

340
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Not to mention the endless repetition
of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff."

341
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,440
There I was taxed,
it's true.

342
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,680
And such puny scope.

343
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,880
Nothing but the very worst
in man's nature.

344
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,320
I write of the great
eternal truths...

345
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,840
that bind together all mankind
the whole world over.

346
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,360
We eat, we shit, we fuck,
we kill and we die.

347
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,280
But we also fall in love.

348
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
We build cities,
we compose symphonies
and we endure.

349
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,280
Why not put that
in your books as well ?

350
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,280
It's a fiction,
not a moral treatise.

351
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,320
But isn't the duty of art
to elevate us above the beasts ?

352
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,560
I'd have thought that was
your duty, Abbé, not mine.

353
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,720
One more trick like this...

354
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,200
and I'll be forced
to revoke all your liberties.

355
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,320
It's that doctor fellow,
isn't it ?

356
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,520
He's come to usurp
your place here, hasn't he ?

357
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,320
Marquis, more than
your writing's at stake.

358
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,240
The ministry has threatened us
with closure.

359
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,080
Ah, they can't be serious !

360
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,520
Our future lies
in the stroke of your pen.

361
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Mightier than the sword,
indeed.

362
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,880
Put yourself in my place. I have
your fellow patients to consider.

363
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,400
If Charenton folds, they have
no place to go, no manner
to clothe or feed themselves.

364
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,640
Fuck them ! They're half-wits !
Let them die on the streets
as nature intended !

365
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
You among them ?

366
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,280
If ever I showed you
a kind hand, Marquis,

367
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,440
if ever I granted you
walking privileges
on a spring day...

368
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,840
or slipped an extra pillow
beneath your door,

369
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,160
if ever I shared your wine,
laughed at your vulgarities
or humored you with argument,

370
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,520
then you will oblige me now...

371
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,600
for your sake...
and for all Charenton.

372
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,720
You've a touch
of the poet too.

373
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,640
Perhaps you should
take up the quill.

374
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,240
- Do I have your word ?
- Honestly, you cut me to the core.

375
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,800
What's the point of all your
valiant attempts at rehabilitation...

376
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,960
if, when I finally succumb,
when at long last I pledge
myself to righteous conduct,

377
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,560
you regard me
with nothing but suspicion ?

378
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,440
Have you no faith
in your own medicine ?

379
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,360
My, my.

380
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,800
At Charenton,
even the walls have eyes.

381
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,720
Don't they ?

382
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Well ?

383
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,320
Well, I spoke to him
with reason and compassion,

384
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,360
the tools which
serve us best here.

385
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,280
- And ?
- He's sworn to obedience.

386
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,040
He's more than a patient, Doctor.
The marquis is my friend.

387
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,400
You keep strange
company, Abbé.

388
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
If you have the matter here
truly in hand,

389
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,320
- I have.
- then I have a friend
of my own to visit.

390
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,600
- Ah, Doctor.
- I've come for my bride.

391
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,080
- Oh, yes.

392
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,560
We've not expected you
for some time.

393
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,280
Simone has not yet
come of age.

394
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
I've taken a new post
at Charenton.

395
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,160
- I need the succor
only a wife can provide.
- Mmm, yes.

396
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,560
Simone...

397
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,800
you remember Dr. Royer-Collard.

398
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
I'd not forget the man
to whom I was promised.

399
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,560
He's come to collect you.

400
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,280
Today ? This minute ?

401
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,520
I apologize, mademoiselle.

402
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,440
I had no time to write.

403
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,600
Be grateful, child.

404
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,200
In my experience, poor girls
who are orphaned never wed.

405
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,880
They wind up spinsters
or, worse still, nuns.

406
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,440
- Thank God that fortune
has spared you...

407
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
from such a fate.

408
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,640
Good-bye, Simone.

409
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,280
God bless you, Simone.

410
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,400
Let's move it !

411
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,640
The emperor wishes to assure
your comfort while at Charenton.

412
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,960
Consider the chateau a gift,

413
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,840
provided you're willing
to finance the necessary repairs.

414
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:23,360
Monsieur Prouix is the court's
most promising young architect.

415
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
He's at your disposal.

416
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,840
Of course, the place hasn't been
occupied since the Terror.

417
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,920
It has possibilities, yes ?

418
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Simone ?

419
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,360
I am to live here ?

420
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,760
It belonged to the Duke du Blangie,
a avowed monarchist.

421
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,080
The Jacobins were most unforgiving.

422
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,800
His wife tried to escape.

423
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,960
They caught her here on the stairs.

424
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,480
Set about her with bayonets.

425
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,440
There but for the grace
of God, eh, Doctor ?

426
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,080
I shed no tears for the past,
Mr Delbené. I look to the future.

427
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,520
Monsieur Prouix.

428
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,120
We should quarry fresh marble,
don't you think ?

429
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,360
You must humor my wife
in all things.

430
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,600
If she wants Venetian glass,
she shall have it.

431
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,280
Italian tile, Dutch velvet-
Spare no expense.

432
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,680
But in her bedroom, see to it that
the door locks from the outside...

433
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,560
and on her windows are iron grates.

434
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,480
Bars, sir ?

435
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,560
In the convent, Simone was spared
the world's temptations.

436
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,000
I will not allow her
to fall prey to them now.

437
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,240
She is a rare bird.

438
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,480
I intend to keep her caged.

439
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,400
Perhaps the sisters...

440
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,080
failed to instruct you...

441
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,440
in the ways of marriage.

442
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,480
The nightly duty...

443
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,920
of a wife... to her husband.

444
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,920
- No.
- It's a scandal, truly.

445
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,600
He's a doctor pretending
to be a God-fearing man.

446
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,280
And that's not all. He's far too old
to marry her, and she's far too young.

447
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,360
- Hasn't finished her schooling.
- Whisked away with barely a word.

448
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,520
- And that's not all.
- Tell me more.

449
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,720
The sweet little thing is barely 16.

450
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,400
I say she's even younger,
only a child.

451
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,920
- That's not all the nuns told us.
- Tell me more.

452
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,120
Listen to this.

453
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,480
No.

454
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
- And that's not all.
- What else ?

455
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,840
She's not a coquette.
She's meant to be a nun.

456
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,760
I swear.

457
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,040
- Tell me more.
- She came with a statue of the Virgin Mary.

458
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,360
She arrived with a statue of the
Virgin Mary and a crucifix around
her neck from a convent.

459
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
Hmm. Tell me more.

460
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,560
He's old enough to have
fathered her twice over.

461
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
The hypocrite.

462
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,920
This has all the makings of a farce.

463
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,600
Abbé de Coulmier, you rascal.

464
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,640
Your comedies are becoming quite the
rage. I had to claw my way to a ticket.

465
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
- I can hardly take-
- So expertly acted.

466
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
That charming young man
in last week's comedy-

467
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,320
I had no idea he was an imbecile.

468
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,240
Everyone has talents
if we look for them.

469
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,160
- Yes, yes, I'm sure.
- Oh.

470
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,760
Isn't that the new doctor?
How thrilling for you.

471
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,440
- A renowned expert
right here at Charenton.
- Yes, indeed.

472
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,280
I will say one thing for him.
He has a beautiful daughter.

473
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,480
Enough of this bilge!

474
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,000
We're better than this.

475
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,400
Remember, gentlemen,
inside each of your... delicate minds,

476
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,240
your distinctive bodies,

477
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,280
art is waiting to be born !

478
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:41,040
So let's give the doctor a performance
tonight I hope he'll remember forever.

479
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,080
That's Madame Bouginal
and Mademoiselle Clairel.

480
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
And in front of them,
the marquis' wife.

481
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,480
Indeed.

482
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Begging your pardon,
it's time to begin.

483
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,240
You ! You're the north wind.

484
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,040
Mesdames et Messieurs,

485
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,480
there's been a change
in tonight's program.

486
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,040
We will not be performing
The Happy Shoemaker.

487
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,080
Instead,

488
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,280
we'd like to premiere a new play...

489
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,840
in honor of the newly appointed
Dr. Royer-Collard...

490
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,400
and his lovely bride.

491
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,320
A comedy entitled-

492
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,520
- Crimes of Love.
- The Crimes of Love.

493
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,400
Written by one of Charenton's
very own wards,

494
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,360
the Marquis de Sade !

495
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,520
- Wait. Statue, statue.
- There you are.

496
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,240
Sister Senfone,
whither do we go,

497
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,120
passing over rivers,
canyons and snow ?

498
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,160
Hurry Eugenie,
for we must not tarry.

499
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,560
I deliver you now
to the man you shall marry.

500
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,320
When you have rested,
at your leisure,

501
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,800
he will coach you
in the ways of pleasure.

502
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,000
At last, she arrives,
my hard-won bride.

503
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,000
Hurry, my child,
and scurry inside.

504
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,080
There you'll find
such treasures await you.

505
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,080
Marzipan and meringue
to sate you.

506
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,280
Such gallantry in men
is sadly a rarity.

507
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,440
How lucky I am
to receive his charity.

508
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,000
Thank you, dear sister,
for abetting me so,

509
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,640
- bringing her here
to this secluded chateau.
- Quickly.

510
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,000
- Stand still and be quiet.
- Was that good ?

511
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,080
Little does she know
that terror's in store...

512
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,640
when I tutor her in
Les crimes...

513
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,480
de l'amour.

514
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,200
Take this side of the curtain.
One, two, three-

515
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,200
Quickly, my suckling,
out of your clothes.

516
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,040
My scepter awaits.
How solid it grows.

517
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,960
Stop it, I beg you.
Have pity I say.

518
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,720
You're not my lover.
You're a monstrous roué.

519
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,840
Do as you're told.

520
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,000
- Stick your legs in the air.
- Leave at once.

521
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,280
- But it's just begun.
- Do as I say.

522
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,560
Madame.

523
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,960
It's true, I'm a pig.

524
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,440
And you've truffles down there.

525
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Oh, God !
Oh, God, what's this ?

526
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,640
Such a wicked sensation.

527
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
A feeling somewhere
between shame and elation.

528
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,080
Oh, God !

529
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,920
Use your tongue like a wand in much
the same manner as Sister Semfone.

530
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,560
Leaving already ?
Of course, you've seen it all before.

531
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,520
I had a suspicion
the sister was sapphic.

532
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,560
I'd tell you more,
but it's simply too graphic.

533
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,800
Suffice it to say
she's a preference for lasses.

534
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,560
Even at Vespers,
she always made passes.

535
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,440
My darling Eugenie, dainty morsel,
get on your back. Let's try it dorsal !

536
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,840
I won't escape. He wants to take me
in every way.

537
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,680
I'll plunder every lovely pore
till you're weak and cry "No more!"

538
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,840
No, more, more !

539
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,160
Give me this !
More ! More !

540
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,840
Everybody, come forward quietly
for the next bit.

541
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,560
Then to prove you're truly mine,
I'll plunder you, darling,
from behind !

542
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,200
Yes, yes, yes,
let's do it.

543
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,120
And what of my lips ?
Will you soil them too ?

544
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,800
When you've broken
every other taboo ?

545
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
I'll fill every slippery hollow.

546
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,880
If you're obliging,
then you'll swallow!

547
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,520
Manners !

548
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,400
- Now that my body is broken and swollen,
- Yes !

549
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,040
Take him to the infirmary.
Maddie ?

550
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,240
- Has he hurt you ?
- No. His breath made my eyes run,
that's all.

551
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
It's all right.

552
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,200
Madeleine ?

553
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,720
Do you mean to take us
all down with you ?

554
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,400
Don't be absurd.

555
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,800
Disgraceful!

556
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
It's only a play.

557
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,080
That play was filthy.

558
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,600
It's disgusting.

559
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,920
I wonder who's to blame,
the author or his muse ?

560
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,880
- It was fiction, of course.
- Of course.

561
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,440
- It was not inspired by circumstance.
- It certainly was not.

562
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,360
You ought to be ashamed, Abbé,

563
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,880
exploiting these pathetic cretins
for financial gain.

564
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,800
This is not our intention.

565
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,280
It was a freak show for tourists
and curiosity seekers.

566
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,920
Charenton is a sanatorium,
not a circus !

567
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,280
The theater is henceforth closed.

568
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,360
Closed ?

569
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,400
As for your friend,
playwright emeritus of the madhouse-

570
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,040
I'll do everything in my power-

571
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,080
Do more, or I shall be forced
to inform the ministry...

572
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,120
that the inmates are,
indeed, running the asylum.

573
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,360
Mmm. Mmm.

574
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,840
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

575
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,560
He shut down our theater.

576
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,480
He can't do that to me.

577
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,800
How can one man be so selfish ?

578
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,840
We merely held up a mirror.

579
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,880
Apparently,
he didn't like what he saw.

580
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,120
- What the devil are you
doing with my quills ?
- You've left me no choice.

581
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,080
I kept my promise. I didn't publish.

582
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,280
Perhaps, in time,
you can earn them back.

583
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,240
You can't.

584
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,600
I've all the demons of hell in my head.

585
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,040
My only salvation
is to vent them on paper.

586
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,040
Try reading for a change.

587
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,120
The writer who produces more
than he reads-

588
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,440
A sure mark of an amateur.

589
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,400
Here.

590
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,320
Start with the Bible.

591
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,160
It's cheerier and more artfully written.

592
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,040
This monstrous God of yours ?

593
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,640
He strung up His very own son
like a side of veal.

594
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,040
I shudder to think what He'd do to me.

595
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,040
Why are you doing this to me ?

596
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,360
Stop it.

597
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,960
I'll die of loneliness.

598
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,600
I've no company but the characters I create.

599
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,400
Whores and pederasts !

600
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,360
You're better off without them.

601
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,400
- I have a proposition.
- You always do.

602
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,440
Madeleine. She's besotted with me.

603
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,560
She'd do anything I asked.
She could pay you a midnight visit.

604
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,560
I don't know who you insult more,
her or me.

605
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,960
- Part the gates of heaven, as it were.
- That's enough !

606
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,800
You're too tense, darling. You could
do with a long, slow screw.

607
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,120
Good night, Marquis.

608
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,040
Then bugger me !
Goddamn you, Abbé !

609
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,440
Have you no true sense
of my condition ?

610
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,360
Of its gravity ?

611
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,040
My writing is involuntary,
like the beating of my heart.

612
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,600
My constant erection !

613
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,720
I've done just as you bade me.

614
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,200
I've paid a visit to the craftsmen.

615
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,560
He laughed and called me a whore.

616
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,480
Took my money just the same.

617
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,920
I don't know which
gives you greater pleasure:

618
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,840
the objects themselves...

619
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,760
or the humiliation I endure
procuring them on your behalf.

620
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,160
And last, but not least,

621
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,000
I brought you some aniseed drops...

622
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,680
and some chocolate pastilles.

623
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,040
Did you now, madame ?

624
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,520
They're filled with cream, yes ?

625
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,480
You know I shan't touch them
unless they're positively...

626
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,200
bursting,

627
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,560
erupting with cream.

628
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,520
What else have you brought
that I might nibble upon ?

629
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,080
- Donatien, you mustn't.
- Hmm ?

630
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,440
Tell me. What other little treats ?

631
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,040
Shame on you, truly.

632
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,160
For fuck's sake, woman.
Bonbons ?

633
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,680
Am I to sit here gorging myself
on useless trifles,

634
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,640
sucking on your little sweetmeats,

635
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,880
when what I truly require,
what I truly need...

636
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,200
are a few quill pens,
perhaps a pot of ink ?

637
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,560
- Forgive me. I beg you.
- Don't you see ?

638
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,840
I've been raped.

639
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,320
- Far more egregiously than any
of my wretched characters.
- How was I to know, darling ?

640
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,400
How was I to tell you,
by writing a letter ?

641
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,440
With what, my asinine bride ?

642
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,520
I beg you, Donatien,

643
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,200
as your wife, your only ally,
you must stop making a monstrous
spectacle of yourself!

644
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,000
- You have come to lecture me ?
- To flaunt your deviance
in public upon a stage ?

645
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,000
They have put you up to this,
haven't they ?

646
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,040
You should court the doctor's favor,
not his contempt.

647
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,480
The doctor ? I ought to
carve my name into his backside
and fill the wounds with salt !

648
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,120
You're here, safe,
surrounded by brick and mortar.

649
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,640
My prison is far crueler.
It has no walls.

650
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,440
Everywhere I go,
they point and whisper.

651
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,680
At the opera, they hiss at me
when I take my box.

652
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
When I went to church, the priest
refused to even hear my confession.

653
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,080
He said I was already damned.

654
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,320
Why must I suffer for your sins ?

655
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,000
That's the way
of all martyrs, isn't it ?

656
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,880
Give me back my anonymity.
That's all I ask.

657
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,840
Let me be invisible again.

658
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,320
You tell me, have you ever done anything
to secure my release ? No.

659
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,160
Have you petitioned the courts ? Never !

660
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,560
- Sought an audience with the emperor ?
- How ? He refuses to see me !

661
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,520
It's a convenience
having your husband locked away.

662
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,120
You no longer have to hold your tongue
or hoist your skirts...

663
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,960
or crack your mouth so I can
put it to its one pleasurable use.

664
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,640
You're not my wife, no! You're one of
my many jailors. Aren't you?

665
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,000
- What in God's name ?
- Take this cow away !

666
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,320
I can't look at her !

667
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,640
Perhaps you'll find a place for her
in the west wing among the hysterics !

668
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,640
Lock her up as well
so she knows how it feels !

669
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,960
The sow !

670
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,560
For a woman of humble origin,
your wife has refined tastes.

671
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,720
When I suggest granite for the foyer,
she's quick to counter
with Peruvian marble.

672
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,080
Peruvian marble.
It costs a fortune to import.

673
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,800
Whatever her heart desires,
Monsieur Prouix.

674
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,280
I would like nothing better than
to grant her every wish, sir,

675
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,680
but on the modest sum
you have accorded me-

676
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,040
I'm an architect, not a magician.

677
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,040
I must see the doctor at once.

678
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,440
It's a matter of dire urgency.

679
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,160
It is customary to write
and request an appointment.

680
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,680
Desperation has driven me past
etiquette, all the way to frenzy.

681
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,080
My schedule is not subject
to the whim of lunatics.

682
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,480
I beg to differ, Doctor.
You work in a madhouse.

683
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,600
Your every waking moment
is governed by the insane.

684
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,680
I pray you, be succinct.

685
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,600
You're new to Charenton, yes ?

686
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,880
Perhaps you're not yet familiar
with my husband and his unusual case.

687
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,000
With all due respect, madame,

688
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,480
all France is familiar with your husband.

689
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,080
Would you grant me a moment alone,
please, Monsieur Prouix ?

690
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,160
Certainly sir. Your servant, sir.

691
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,160
Uh, gentlemen.

692
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,560
Madame, please.

693
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,320
Good morning, madame.

694
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,800
I assume you've come here to plead for
clemency on your husband's behalf.

695
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,760
You do, do you ?

696
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,000
It's my dearest hope, Doctor,

697
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,720
that he remain entombed forever.

698
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,480
And that when at last he perishes in
the dank bowels of your institution,

699
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,920
that he be left as carrion
for the rodents and the worms.

700
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,160
I stand corrected, madame.

701
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,800
If you can't cure him...

702
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,000
truly cure him...

703
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:17,640
then at least, I beg you, harness the
beast that rages in his soul.

704
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,960
That is not easily done, madame.

705
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,240
You are aware, are you not,
that it costs a great deal...

706
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,280
to house your husband at Charenton ?

707
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,720
I pay his stipend every month,
far more dutifully than I should.

708
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,560
But that barely covers
the cost of his room...

709
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,080
with nary a penny left over
for appropriate treatments:

710
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,160
opiates to quell his temper,

711
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,360
restraints to chasten him
when he misbehaves.

712
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,360
Perhaps, if you could buttress your
entreaties with the means to oblige them-

713
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,560
I'm not a wealthy woman.

714
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,760
You have a pension, haven't you ?

715
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,280
- From the sale of his books ?
- It's tainted money, Doctor.

716
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,640
- What a beautiful thought.
- What thought is that ?

717
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,040
That the ill-gotten funds
born of his degeneracy...

718
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,920
might now affect his salvation.

719
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,440
It's beyond perversity...

720
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,800
that honor should carry a price tag.

721
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,760
Imagine...

722
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,680
old friends deigning
to kiss your hand again.

723
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,960
"Why, Marquise, enchanted to see
you again."

724
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,440
"Welcome back from your long,
dark descent into the abyss of infamy."

725
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,680
Don't toy with me, Doctor.

726
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,400
Now is the time to secure your epitaph:

727
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,640
"The benevolent Marquise,

728
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,400
Charenton's most revered
philanthropist"...

729
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,080
or "Satan's bride."

730
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,520
Rest assured, Marquise,

731
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,960
your generosity will speed your
husband ever faster towards a cure.

732
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,840
The Peruvian marble,
without question.

733
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,760
- I'm eternally in your debt.
- And I in yours, Marquise.

734
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,320
Doctor, can I impart to you
his cruelest trick ?

735
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,520
Of course.

736
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,480
Once, long ago...

737
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,280
in the folly of youth...

738
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,680
he made me love him.

739
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,360
Madeleine, my sweet, can you
smuggle me a quill and some ink ?

740
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,280
I don't dare.

741
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,240
The doctor's got his eye on you
sharper than ever now.

742
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,160
Dr. Montalivet was,
politely put, diminutive.

743
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,520
When flaccid, his member
was little more than a bobbin.

744
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,440
And when inflamed,
it towered a mere four inches.

745
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,320
To compensate, he strove to impress his
ladylove with a host of other endowments:

746
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,680
fine wine, fresh game and a house as
large as his other fortunes were small.

747
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,000
We've ceiling beams en route from
Provence.

748
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,080
And next week,
a muralist from Paris arrives...

749
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,080
to paint a trompe l'oeil
in the ballroom.

750
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,440
- Doesn't that please you ?
- Very much.

751
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,000
I would prefer brandy in the salon...

752
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,160
where we can sit side by side
before the fire.

753
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,240
I'd rather read, thank you.

754
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,640
You prefer a book
to your husband's company ?

755
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,640
Well, no wonder.
I'm only flesh and blood.

756
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,440
That's no match, is it,
for the printed page, hmm ?

757
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,200
Good evening then.
Enjoy your solitude.

758
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,840
Your linens, please.

759
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,640
Your linens.

760
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,440
Now or never.

761
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,360
Voila !

762
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,640
Well, if you won't read it
to your own mother,

763
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,680
perhaps you ought not
to be reading it at all.

764
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,640
It's not your cup of tea, Mother.

765
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,480
Oh, go on, darling, give it a read.

766
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,720
"Monsieur Bouloir was a man
whose erotic appetites...

767
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:27,040
"might discreetly be described
as... postmortem.

768
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,680
"A habitué of cemeteries,

769
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,600
"his proudest conquest
was a maid...

770
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,920
"six decades his senior,
deceased a dozen years."

771
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,040
That's terrible.

772
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Oh, that's too, too terrible.

773
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,600
Well, go on.

774
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,000
"The vigor with which
he made love...

775
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,160
Mm-hmm.

776
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,200
"caused her bones to dislodge.

777
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,640
"Still...

778
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,400
"he granted her the highest compliment
he accorded any woman."

779
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,840
Yes ?

780
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,400
"Well worth the dig."

781
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,200
You asked my name once.

782
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,440
It's Madeleine.

783
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,360
Sweet then, like the pastry.

784
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,680
Haven't you a name yourself?

785
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,720
Ride away with me someday.
Perhaps I'll tell you.

786
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,680
Your mother may be blind,
but you have a keen pair of eyes.

787
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,200
My mother is blind on account of
the lye in the laundry kettles.

788
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,960
Soaking sheets for lunatics
has cost this woman her sight.

789
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,600
- This could cost her far more.
- You'll get more from her
with kindness than-

790
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,600
What could cause
a tincture like this ?

791
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,520
- I'm only a laundress, not a detective.
- Now is not the time-

792
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,880
Perhaps your kettles
are stained with rust.

793
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,680
Or maybe the lye is rancid.

794
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,080
Or maybe, just maybe...

795
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,760
these sheets once belonged
to our friend the marquis.

796
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,400
We've over 200 beds.
They could have been anybody's.

797
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,320
With such a fine thread count,
decorated in his very own script ?

798
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,840
She's lying. It shows on her face.

799
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,000
We're clearing everything out.

800
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,760
- Almost done, sir.
- Remember, anything
he could fashion as a quill.

801
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,680
His entire room stripped bare.

802
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,200
So the doctor cracks his whip
and you dance !

803
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,840
My bed, gone.
Am I to freeze to death ?

804
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,760
Go on, take his rug.

805
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,240
- Take it.
- That's a Turkish weave, you idiot.

806
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,200
It costs more than
you'll earn in a lifetime.

807
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,960
- His chair.
- Fine. Take it. Take it all.

808
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,880
- Here.
- There you go.

809
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,240
And this-
Careful, it's slippery.

810
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,160
You've no idea where it's been.

811
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,400
Let's not forget Mary. Sweet Mary,

812
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,800
the Jewish whore. God's little harlot.

813
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,920
Virgin birth ? An entire religion
built on an oxymoron.

814
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,840
His wine.

815
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,760
From now on, nothing but water
at every meal.

816
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,320
- Water ?
- And your meat shall be deboned.

817
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,640
- Why this sudden torture ?
- Because your writing continues unchecked.

818
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,600
- I didn't create this world of ours.
I only record it.
- Its horrors, perhaps.

819
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,680
Its darkest nightmares.
And to what end ?

820
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,320
- Nothing but your own morbid gratification.
- No, I write what I see:

821
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,280
the endless procession
to the guillotine.

822
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,080
We're all lined up,
waiting for the crunch of the blade.

823
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,480
The rivers of blood are flowing
beneath our feet, Abbé.

824
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,640
I've been to hell, young man.

825
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,440
You've only read about it.

826
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,000
I'm sorry, Marquis, truly.

827
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,240
These chastity vows of yours-
How strict are they ?

828
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,920
Suppose you only put it
in their mouth ?

829
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,720
Pious little worm.

830
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,800
In conditions of adversity,
the artist flourishes.

831
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,400
Curious, aren't you ?

832
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,600
If I can pleasure myself,
I can pleasure you too.

833
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,720
You don't know
what you're missing, darling.

834
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,840
I'm in search of a book.
Perhaps you know it.

835
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,560
I've only got one copy left.

836
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,560
Rescued it meself from the bonfire.

837
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,160
Please hurry.
My husband locks the door at dusk.

838
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Sweet little thing like you...

839
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,120
shouldn't be reading such filth anyway.

840
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,600
I grew up in a convent, sir.

841
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,800
Everything I know in the world,
I owe to books.

842
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,960
To the young maidens of the world,

843
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,120
wrest yourselves free
from the tyranny of virtue...

844
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,280
and taste without shame
the pleasures of the flesh.

845
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,120
Male power lies in the clench of a fist,

846
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,880
but a woman's power lies elsewhere:

847
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,200
in the velvet cavity
betwixt her thighs.

848
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,000
It's late, Simone, darling.

849
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,120
Put your poems aside.

850
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,720
Breakfast.

851
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,000
Madeleine, I beg you-

852
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,440
What have they done to you now ?

853
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,400
Tortures so ugly, so medieval...

854
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,080
even I haven't the words
to describe them.

855
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,000
If you have an ounce
of pity in your heart,

856
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,760
you'll throw caution aside...

857
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,200
and unlock my door.

858
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,640
God help me.

859
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,840
- I don't dare.
- Don't be a dunce, child.
I have a surprise for you.

860
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,760
Now open the friggin' door.

861
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,600
My newest book.

862
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,680
It starts at my left cuff...

863
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,880
and continues right across my back.

864
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,680
The longest sentence, you'll notice,

865
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,760
runs the entire length of my inseam.

866
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,200
And it all completes itself...

867
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,120
at the base of my right shoe.

868
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
- Oh, my. "Pikestaff" ?
- Yes.

869
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,080
- Yes.

870
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,600
- "Naked on a plate" ?
- Yes.

871
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,840
"One hundred unhurried tongues" ?

872
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,760
Yes.

873
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,720
- You're a genius !
- Yes !

874
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,640
Shh !

875
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,160
Go quickly...

876
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,840
so you won't be blamed
for my  misbehavior.

877
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,680
Maddie, you traffic with the devil,
you'll pay the devil's price.

878
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,160
- Sorry.
- Guards !

879
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,760
- Guards !
- Yes !

880
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,120
- Shh !
- You'll pay ! Guards !

881
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,880
Look what I've brought you,
my darlings.

882
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,320
- There's something written.
- Two chapters, one for each cheek.

883
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:15,840
My writing lives !

884
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:30,080
Take this beast back to his cage !

885
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,080
Don't tell me.
You've come to read my trousers.

886
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,040
Don't keep me in suspense. What will it
be, 50 lashes ? A night on the rack ?

887
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,320
I won't sully my hands with him.

888
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,960
Nor should you. That's the first
rule of politics, isn't it ?

889
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,400
The man who orders the execution
never drops the blade !

890
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,560
You're fortunate
they've forced me to punish you.

891
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,040
If it were up to the doctor,
you'd be flayed alive.

892
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,760
Well, the doctor is a man
after my own heart.

893
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,160
What in God's name
am I to do with you ?

894
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,400
The more I forbid,
the more you're provoked.

895
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,360
Strip.

896
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,920
Your britches as well.

897
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,080
You started this little game...

898
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,600
you finish it.

899
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,640
Or haven't you the courage ?

900
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,040
I thought not.

901
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,400
It's a potent aphrodisiac,

902
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,560
isn't it, dumpling ?

903
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,840
Having power over another man.

904
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,800
Your wig.

905
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,160
You'll no longer
spread your insidious gospel.

906
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,560
From now on,

907
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,960
you will not even write
your own ignominious name.

908
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,080
Are your convictions
so fragile,

909
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,560
they cannot stand
in opposition to mine ?

910
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,720
Is your God so flimsy, so weak ?
For shame !

911
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,880
Don't flatter yourself, Marquis.

912
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,440
You're not the Antichrist.

913
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,640
You're nothing but a malcontent
who knows how to spell.

914
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,240
I saw her with my own eyes.

915
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,600
She put the key in the latch
just as proud as she pleased.

916
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,600
Free her now !

917
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,560
Leave her duly strung.

918
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,200
Maddie.

919
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,520
If only blood will appease you,

920
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,080
then shed mine !

921
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,560
- Abbé, no.
- Go on.

922
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Now !

923
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,760
That won't be necessary.

924
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,560
If you're going to
martyr yourself, Abbé,

925
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,520
do it for God, not a chambermaid.

926
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,520
Now put your clothes back on.

927
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,520
Had I known your taste in novels,

928
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,280
I never would have taught you to read.

929
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,360
Don't say that.

930
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,160
Reading's my salvation.

931
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,440
But why must you indulge
in his pornography ?

932
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,720
It's a hard day's wages,
slaving away for madmen.

933
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,480
What I've seen in life,

934
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,080
it takes a lot to hold my interest.

935
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,120
I put myself in his stories.

936
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,680
I play the parts.

937
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,200
- Each strumpet, each murderess.
- Oh, Maddie-

938
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,600
If I wasn't such a bad woman
on the page,

939
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:53,720
I'll hazard I couldn't be
such a good woman in life.

940
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,760
This is no place for a child like you.

941
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,280
I'm sending you away from here.

942
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,240
And then we take the whole den
till up there.

943
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,560
Now this is not good enough.
You understand ?

944
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,040
I refuse to pay-

945
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,840
We could line the walls
with Chinese silks.

946
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:30,160
Or, if you prefer,
a Florentine tapestry.

947
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,880
- Are you a literary man ?
- Excuse me ?

948
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,080
I do so admire men
with an appetite for...

949
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,440
books.

950
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,840
Madame, how could you ?

951
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,520
Have you actually read this volume ?

952
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,160
I've memorized it.

953
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,520
There comes a time
in a young lady's life...

954
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,440
when she must cast books aside...

955
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,080
and learn from experience.

956
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,560
That, monsieur...

957
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,480
requires a teacher.

958
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,240
Oh, yes, come on. We'll have some fun.

959
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,040
Maddie, what are you-

960
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,480
Is something wrong ?

961
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:24,080
Abbé, don't send me away, I beg you.

962
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,880
I shouldn't refuse your kindness...

963
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,960
but my heart's held fast here.

964
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,520
By whom ? The marquis ?

965
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,960
Mother's not half so blind as you.

966
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,240
Oh, Madeleine.

967
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:53,680
There are certain feelings...
we must not voice.

968
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,120
Why not ?

969
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,640
They incite-

970
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,200
They incite us to act...

971
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,480
in ways...

972
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,400
we should not.

973
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,960
No.

974
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,480
What have I done ?

975
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,720
Go. Go back to your room quickly.

976
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,360
You'll hate me now, won't you ?

977
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,680
No. I love you, Madeleine...

978
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,600
as a child of God.

979
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,320
Forgive me.

980
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,640
Madeleine.

981
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,480
Maddie.

982
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,520
You don't fear the marquis' sway on me.

983
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,560
You fear your own.

984
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:17,000
If you'd grant me a final favor,
I'd like to explain myself.

985
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,840
Don't come any closer, Abbé.
God's watching.

986
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,840
Maddie-

987
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,480
"Most esteemed Dr. Royer-Collard,

988
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,760
"At long last your chateau is complete.

989
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,920
"You will find everything
in its assigned place:

990
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,320
"the chintz draperies,
the English bell pulls,

991
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,200
"even the ivory doorstops.

992
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:55,480
"Only one detail is missing-

993
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
"Your wife."

994
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,440
Tell him I'm no fool.

995
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,360
A prison is still a prison,

996
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,080
even with Chinese silks
and chandeliers.

997
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,080
"By the time you read this,
we'll be long gone.

998
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,480
"Bound for England
or points beyond."

999
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,200
Tell him if he discovers
our whereabouts,

1000
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,760
you'll slit your wrist with a razor and
I'll plunge a hat pin through my heart.

1001
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,760
You'd do that...
rather than forsake our love ?

1002
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,400
No... but tell him I would.

1003
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,040
Sign it... quickly.

1004
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,920
Then you can ravish me again on
linens for which he so dearly paid.

1005
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,800
And then, I beg you,

1006
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,080
on the bearskin rug in his study.

1007
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,640
And finally, as a crowning gesture,

1008
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,040
we'll leave puddles of love
on the Peruvian marble.

1009
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,480
Simone !

1010
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,520
Simone ! Simone ?

1011
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,760
Simone ?

1012
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,280
Stop !

1013
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,280
Stop ! I beg you !

1014
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,800
I'll write dainty stories,
odes to virtue.

1015
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,960
Children's verse. I promise !

1016
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,960
It excites you, doesn't it,
to hurt me thus ?

1017
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,000
Look, you're solid as bone,
straining your trousers.

1018
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,560
Don't you see,
you self-righteous fuck ?

1019
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,480
The longer you continue
your vexations,

1020
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,600
the deeper you root
my principles in my heart !

1021
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,160
Haven't you seen...

1022
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,160
a man naked before ?

1023
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,680
The abbe's sending me away.

1024
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,240
Yes.

1025
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,200
Of course he is.

1026
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,640
Marquis...

1027
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,080
tell me one little story.

1028
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,000
How do you propose I do that ?

1029
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,200
With dust upon the air ?

1030
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,120
Whisper it to me now.

1031
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,520
Child, that's far too dangerous.

1032
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,440
I may never see you again.

1033
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,320
Let me transcribe it for you,
something to remember you by.

1034
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,080
This is neither the time
nor the place.

1035
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,120
We've lost.

1036
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,000
I never thought I'd see you defeated.

1037
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,920
There are thousands of stories...

1038
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,840
I would dearly love to tell.

1039
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,400
Then tell me one.

1040
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,640
Perhaps I can.

1041
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,600
Tonight, place yourself
in the linen pantry...

1042
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,640
with a bottle of ink and a quill.

1043
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,560
And then you shall have a story...

1044
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,440
that will make the angels weep...

1045
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,720
and the saints all gasp for air.

1046
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,200
Psst, she's here.

1047
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,840
Dauphin. Dauphin.

1048
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,160
Dauphin.

1049
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,840
Cleante. Cleante.

1050
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,520
Psst, Cleante, are you ready ?

1051
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,920
- Are you ready ?
- Marquis, is that you ?

1052
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,160
For fuck's sake, who else would it be ?
Have you alerted the others ?

1053
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,960
I'm no longer a man.

1054
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,520
I awoke to discover I turned into
a sparrow.

1055
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,240
Is that so ?

1056
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,560
Well, I awoke to discover
I'd turned into a cat !

1057
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,160
If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my
little fangs into your drumsticks...

1058
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,160
and suck the marrow
straight out of your bones !

1059
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,840
Have you got that, little bird ?

1060
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,400
At your service, Count.

1061
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,520
To my beloved reader,

1062
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,400
prepare yourself
for the most impure tale...

1063
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,320
ever to spring from the mind of man.

1064
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,160
Off your hump.

1065
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,680
Dauphin. To my beloved reader,

1066
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,280
prepare yourself for the most...

1067
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,480
impure tale ever told.

1068
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,120
To my beloved reader,

1069
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,960
prepare yourself for an impure tale.

1070
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,680
- Psst, Bouchon.
- Huh ?

1071
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,040
To my beloved reader, prepare yourself.

1072
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,360
I have an impure tale to tell.

1073
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,360
Prepare yourself.

1074
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,160
Bouchon ?

1075
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,760
What did you say ?

1076
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,560
Prepare yourself.
I've a tale, an impure tale.

1077
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,320
Our story concerns
the prostitute, Fauchau,

1078
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,680
whom nature had equipped...

1079
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:54,200
with a tight and tiny fissure
between her thighs...

1080
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,520
and the most finely
cleft ass ever molded...

1081
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,840
by the hand of God.

1082
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,400
Fauchau was a prostitute...

1083
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,600
with a tight and downy fissure...

1084
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,840
between her thighs and-

1085
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,800
The most finely cleft ass !

1086
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,200
The most finely cleft ass.

1087
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:22,840
My glorious prose filtered
through the minds of the insane.

1088
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,080
Who knows, they might improve it.

1089
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,120
It's about a harlot named Fauchau.

1090
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,080
It's about a harlot...

1091
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,600
named Fauchau with a downy fissure.

1092
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,600
One day, Fauchau's first client
was a surgeon.

1093
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,240
He ran his fingers across her
naked skin,

1094
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,640
pulling apart folds of flesh.

1095
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,360
He ran his fingers
across her naked skin,

1096
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,560
pulling apart folds of flesh.

1097
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,240
Pulling at her folds and-

1098
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,120
He ran his fingers
over her naked skin,

1099
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,360
pulling at her folds.

1100
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,720
Feeling over her naked skin.

1101
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,080
Her naked skin.

1102
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,480
- Naked-
- Yes, I've got that bit.

1103
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,520
"What shall I make ready ?"
asked Fauchau.

1104
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,880
"My mouth, my ass...

1105
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,080
or my succulent oyster ?"

1106
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,080
What shall I make ready ?

1107
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,040
My ass or my succulent oyster ?

1108
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:25,120
"None !" cried the surgeon,
brandishing his scalpel.

1109
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,040
- Yes ?
- Which hole ?

1110
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:33,840
My mouth, my ass or my succulent-

1111
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,280
succulent oyster.

1112
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:41,200
"For I'll carve new orifices
where there were none before."

1113
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,400
- None-
- Cried the surgeon.

1114
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:49,120
I'll carve new-new-new orifices
where there were none before.

1115
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:53,960
With that, Fauchau expelled a scream
so extravagantly pitched...

1116
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,360
that the surgeon was obliged
to tear out her tongue.

1117
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:01,120
Fauchau expelled a scream
of such extravagant pitch-

1118
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,240
With that, the extravagant bitch-

1119
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,720
- screamed so loud-
- She screamed...

1120
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,960
so long and so loud-

1121
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:12,200
She screamed, so he felt
he should- He ought-

1122
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,880
- To seal the wound,
he took a poker from the fire.
- A poker !

1123
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,360
To tear out her tongue.

1124
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:22,240
-He took a poker from the fire.
-From the fire. From the fire !

1125
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,840
He took a poker from the fire.

1126
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,920
From the fire.
From the fire.

1127
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,680
He took a poker from the fire.

1128
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,120
From the fire.

1129
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,000
- Dauphin.
- From the fire.

1130
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,760
- What's the next bit ?
- Bouchon, the words ?

1131
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,520
- Tell me the words.
- Fire.

1132
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,160
Dauphin ?

1133
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,080
Dauphin ?

1134
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,200
- Fire !
- What's the next bit ?

1135
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,200
- Fire ! Fire.
- What's the next bit ?

1136
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:09,840
- Fire ! Fire !
- Tell me the next bit !

1137
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,680
You must tell me the words.

1138
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:17,160
Fire !

1139
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:21,440
Open all the doors !
Let the patients out!

1140
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,640
Get some water !
Hurry ! Come on !

1141
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,440
Get some water !

1142
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,280
Jesus ! What the hell have you done ?

1143
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,240
Where's that water ?

1144
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,480
Get the beds ! Stomp them out!

1145
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:53,160
Fire ! Fire !

1146
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,400
Fire !

1147
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,400
Where are you going with that ?

1148
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,000
Bouchon ?

1149
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,640
Bouchon ?

1150
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,400
Remember your manners, Bouchon.

1151
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,320
Don't-

1152
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,080
- No ! No ! No !
- Madeleine.

1153
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,920
Madeleine !

1154
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,200
- Madeleine !
- Madeleine !

1155
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,120
- Madeleine!
- Madeleine !

1156
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,480
Madeleine!

1157
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,920
- Madeleine!
- Madeleine.

1158
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,200
Madeleine! Madeleine!

1159
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,280
Madeleine!

1160
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,080
Madeleine! Madeleine!

1161
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,920
Maddie ?

1162
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,040
Madeleine !

1163
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,280
- Maddie !
- It's awful !

1164
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,880
The devil's unleashed himself
upon us !

1165
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,800
It's her fault !

1166
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,960
Up the stairs !

1167
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,480
No! No! No!

1168
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,160
No ! No ! No !

1169
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,920
Maddie !

1170
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,680
Madeleine ! Madeleine !

1171
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,880
We must save Charenton!
Keep the chain going !

1172
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,960
We've got to stop it
before it gets to those beams !

1173
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,640
Get him off of me !

1174
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,560
Pitou !

1175
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,960
- Madeleine !
- Madeleine !

1176
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,040
Guards ! Guards !

1177
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,960
Guards !

1178
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,880
Brigitte. Are you all right ?

1179
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:27,760
Madeleine !

1180
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,640
Go ! Quickly !

1181
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,000
Madeleine !

1182
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,280
Where are you, Maddie ?

1183
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,800
"She screamed...

1184
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,920
so he felt he ought
to tear out her tongue."

1185
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,560
Bouchon, wait !

1186
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Abbé.
I couldn't help it.

1187
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,960
No.

1188
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,600
Oh, my God.

1189
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,680
No.

1190
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,480
Oh, no.

1191
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,320
Madeleine!

1192
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,000
Now, now, don't be shy.

1193
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,240
We've a nice surprise
just waiting for you.

1194
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,080
There's a good boy.

1195
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,080
Huh ?

1196
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,840
Huh ! There's a good boy.

1197
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,760
Huh ?

1198
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,280
I'm sorry. Wait.

1199
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,520
I promise I won't do it again.

1200
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,440
I promise.

1201
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,960
Of course, we mustn't blame Bouchon.

1202
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,160
He is merely one of nature's
experiments gone awry.

1203
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,680
No discipline, no conscience, no morality.

1204
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,240
In fact, it is our duty...

1205
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,920
to provide such things on his behalf.

1206
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,240
Is it not ?

1207
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,960
As you say, Doctor.

1208
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,840
He was so impressed
by the marquis' tale...

1209
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:55,320
that he chose to reenact it, yes ?

1210
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,920
Upon a certain chambermaid.

1211
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,280
Perhaps you would be so kind
as to remind me of her name.

1212
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:07,640
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me
say it.

1213
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:10,200
Her name, Abbé.

1214
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,880
Madeleine.

1215
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,720
Tell me, Abbé,

1216
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,080
when you are called before God,

1217
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:24,680
how will you answer
for Madeleine's death ?

1218
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:39,280
Murderer.

1219
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,800
Your words-

1220
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,080
Your words drove Bouchon to-

1221
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,120
Oh, for fuck's sake, Abbé !

1222
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:54,000
Suppose one of your precious inmates
attempted to walk on water and drowned ?

1223
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,640
Would you condemn the Bible ?
I think not.

1224
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:01,160
An innocent child is dead.

1225
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,600
So many authors are denied
the gratification...

1226
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,600
of a concrete response to their work.

1227
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,240
I'm blessed, am I not ?

1228
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,880
It's no secret that you loved her.

1229
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:17,320
I wanted to fuck her, that's all.

1230
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,360
- And did you ?
- It's not your province to ask.

1231
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,520
- Why was it you never
took her by force ?
- Who's to say I did not ?

1232
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,600
- Was it impotence ?
- Never !

1233
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,000
Then... it must have been love.

1234
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,920
I fucked her countless times...

1235
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,200
and all the while she pleaded for more.

1236
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,600
We inspected the body.

1237
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,200
She died a virgin.

1238
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,240
Give her... a proper burial...

1239
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:30,080
in the churchyard...

1240
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,000
at my expense.

1241
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,080
Do not inter...

1242
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:38,320
her sweet body...

1243
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,840
in the same ground...

1244
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,400
as the devils who inhabit
this accursed place.

1245
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,160
Your terrible secret revealed.

1246
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,080
You're a man after all.

1247
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,920
I've opium to numb the pain.

1248
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,280
Our intention is punitive.

1249
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,720
If we numb the pain,
what's the point ?

1250
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,240
Abbé de Coulmier.

1251
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,160
I'm here.

1252
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,080
Would that I were so easily silenced.

1253
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,400
There's a good boy.

1254
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:26,960
My, my.

1255
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,680
You have exceeded my expectations.

1256
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:34,840
Have I ? I'm not the first man God
has asked to shed blood in His name.

1257
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,160
I will not be the last.

1258
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,480
And will you sleep soundly tonight ?

1259
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,080
No, sir.

1260
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,800
Plainly put,

1261
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,160
I never expect to sleep again.

1262
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,120
Don't send me away, Abbé.

1263
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,760
Abbé. Abbé.

1264
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,560
Abbé-

1265
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:40,320
Abbé. Abbé.

1266
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,960
Abbé! Abbé!

1267
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:51,080
You best come quick, Abbé !

1268
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,160
He's written all over the walls.

1269
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,120
Used his own filth.

1270
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:00,760
- Made him self a kind of paint.
- Dear God.

1271
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,560
The stench !

1272
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,680
- Free his mouth.
- You mustn't do that, sir.

1273
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,440
I must grant him his last rites.
Give me your dagger.

1274
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,720
Leave us.

1275
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,520
Shh.

1276
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,240
I failed to save your soul in life.

1277
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,800
I won't fail in death.

1278
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,120
Dear Heavenly Father,

1279
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,840
prove Your infinite mercy...

1280
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,840
and open Your gates to this man,

1281
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:04,720
no less Your child than any other.

1282
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,040
There is...

1283
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,440
in each of us...

1284
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,400
such beauty...

1285
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,560
and such abomination.

1286
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:18,240
No man is exempt.

1287
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,480
Forgive him.

1288
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,480
Forgive us all.

1289
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,920
Kiss the cross.

1290
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,160
Marquis !

1291
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,120
Marquis !

1292
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,400
No !

1293
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,700
Welcome to Charenton, Abbé.

1294
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,120
I'm pleased to have
the new post, sir.

1295
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:18,360
Are you ? Thank you.

1296
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,400
I'm afraid our endowment
has shriveled to a mere pittance.

1297
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:24,600
We are the laughingstock
of all France.

1298
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,480
However, on a happier note,

1299
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,280
the hospital is now in my sole command.

1300
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:36,600
My policy here is that
each man must earn his keep.

1301
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,280
The Charenton Press, Abbé.

1302
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:44,920
We produce books for the
discriminating collector.

1303
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,080
The compulsive inmates
set the type.

1304
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,440
The listless ones do the binding
and prepare the ink.

1305
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,480
It's remarkable, Doctor.

1306
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,520
The patients are
so subdued, so docile.

1307
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,440
Yes, they are at peace.

1308
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,560
They have the satisfaction that only
a hard day's labor can provide.

1309
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,240
I don't believe it.

1310
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,080
The Marquis de Sade ? You're actually
publishing his novels ?

1311
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,280
Yes. Ever since
his unfortunate death,

1312
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:22,000
there's been a surge
of interest in his works.

1313
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:27,000
Of course, I will use the profits to
restore Charenton to its former glory.

1314
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,920
Oh, Doctor.

1315
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,840
We have a meeting
with Herr Becker at 4:00.

1316
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,880
He wants to publish
a Swiss edition...

1317
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,160
on gilded paper bound in calfskin.

1318
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,880
- Thank you, Charlotte.
- My pleasure.

1319
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,520
Have a look at page 205.
I turned the corner down.

1320
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,240
Come on, move.
On your left. Come on.

1321
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,360
Next one. Go on.
Get these books onboard.

1322
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,280
Come on! Those boxes over there !

1323
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,480
Move yourself. Right.

1324
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,640
Right, old mate, that's it !
See you next week !

1325
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,160
Of course, everything is not
quite as harmonious as it seems.

1326
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,720
I hope you have a strong constitution.

1327
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,480
My years tending lepers steeled me
for life's grisliest offerings.

1328
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,720
We still have a few lone incurables...

1329
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:34,240
prone to violence and perversion.

1330
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,920
So...

1331
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,320
you're my successor, yes ?

1332
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,240
Successor ?

1333
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,240
Oh.

1334
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,720
Listen to me... Abbé,

1335
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,920
and listen well.

1336
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:57,320
I've stared into the face of evil...

1337
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:01,720
and I've lived to tell the tale.

1338
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,560
Now, I beg you, for your sake,
let me write it down.

1339
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:08,080
Gibberish, my friend.
He rants and he raves.

1340
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:10,160
If you've an ounce of Christian charity,

1341
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:14,120
then you'll bring me parchment,
ink and a quill.

1342
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:19,520
You'll do no such thing. This patient
poses a grave danger to himself and others.

1343
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,960
Are you all right, sir ?

1344
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:39,800
Do you not see, Abbé ?

1345
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:43,640
Some men are beyond redemption.

1346
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,480
No. Wait. Please.

1347
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:50,240
Please bring mea quill. Please ?

1348
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,400
Wait. I'm sorry.

1349
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:57,320
Goddamn you, Abbé ! A quill !

1350
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:07,080
A quill.

1351
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,480
Use it well.

1352
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,200
You owe her that.

1353
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,600
Beloved reader,

1354
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:50,720
I leave you now with a tale
penned by the Abbé de Coulmier,

1355
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:55,160
a man who found freedom
in the unlikeliest of places -

1356
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,600
at the bottom of an inkwell,

1357
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,880
on the tip of a quill.

1358
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,680
However, be forewarned,

1359
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,200
its plot is blood-soaked,

1360
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,960
its characters depraved,

1361
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,400
and its themes... unwholesome at best.

1362
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,440
But in order to know virtue,

1363
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,720
we must acquaint ourselves
with vice.

1364
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:30,080
Only then can we know
the full measure of man.

1365
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,720
So come.

1366
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,160
I dare you.

1367
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,680
Turn the page.
