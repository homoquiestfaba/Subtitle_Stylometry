00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,733
<i>Four days ago,</i>

2
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,470
<i>On the outside,
my life seemed perfect.</i>

3
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:43,474
<i>Perfect boyfriend, perfect job,</i>

4
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:47,077
<i>Perfect peace.</i>

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,146
<i>But something
was always missing.</i>

6
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:55,350
<i>That's why I needed to find you.</i>

7
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:57,318
<i>To find me.</i>

8
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:49,760
"Ahimsa,"

9
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,328
Which means non-Violence,

10
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,664
Is the foundation
of our practice.

11
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,369
<i>We have the ability,</i>

12
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,536
<i>Every day,</i>

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,138
<i>To choose peace.</i>

14
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,612
<i>Within every posture,</i>

15
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,548
<i>Every breath,</i>

16
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,783
And every moment of our lives.

17
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,450
That is a nice car.

18
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:59,487
What is that?
'65? '66?

19
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,455
'65.

20
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,224
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

21
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,924
I know it's expensive,
but I really think

22
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:21,294
<i>It's worth advertising
in the yoga journal.</i>

23
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:24,530
- Okay.<i>
- We could mention that we're donating to that orphanage.</i>

24
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,632
Yeah.

25
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,967
Do you have any pictures
of you with the kids there?

26
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,669
- Yeah, I think I do.
- That's great.

27
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,937
And I'm still waiting on
your bio.

28
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,772
I know, I'm working on it.

29
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:38,875
Just keep it simple...
You're an inspiring woman.

30
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:42,911
- I guess.
- You inspire me.

31
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:46,247
<i>Hey, honey, did you take</i>

32
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,549
<i>Your old car out today?</i>

33
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:53,387
- Yeah, why?<i>
- Well, you said you were</i> gonna take your bike.

34
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,323
I just... Just ran
a couple of errands.

35
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:57,390
<i>Yeah, well I wish you would
have told me,</i>

36
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,591
I would have come back early.

37
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,762
You know, I, um...
I heard from Kathy today.

38
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,864
The... You know
the private investigator?

39
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,666
<i>And?</i>

40
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:15,803
And, she has an address
for Susan,

41
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,405
And it's 30 minutes away.

42
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,408
- Wow.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,043
I think I really
want to meet her.

44
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,878
<i>I think that's great.</i>

45
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,849
I think that's gonna be
really good for you.

46
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,817
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
take a few hours tomorrow,

47
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,986
- And just drive down there...
- Tomorrow?

48
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:37,921
<i>Yeah.</i>

49
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,391
Well, we just...
We've got so much to do.

50
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:44,460
<i>This is gonna be very
emotional for you.</i>

51
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:48,864
Yeah. Yeah,
you're probably right.

52
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,699
I should just do it
some other time.

53
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,804
Yeah?

54
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,339
Hi.

55
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,441
Are you Susan Adams?

56
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,909
Yeah.

57
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,012
I'm may miller.

58
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,880
So, what do you want?

59
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:47,750
This is gonna sound strange,

60
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,919
But I think you're my sister,

61
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,721
From my biological mother,

62
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:57,091
Her name was Jennifer Adams.
Are you...

63
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:01,929
- <i>Who is it?
- Nobody, baby.</i>

64
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:04,498
Yeah, there's a bar
around the corner,

65
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,099
I'll meet you there
in five minutes.

66
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:45,169
Want a drink?

67
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,637
Yeah, I'll get it.

68
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,105
Um, what would you like?

69
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,709
I'll have a vodka cranberry.

70
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,477
It doesn't need to be
fancy vodka,

71
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,078
House is fine.

72
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:03,016
Okay.

73
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,787
Um, i...

74
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,424
I brought you these.
They are these a... Amazing raw cookies,

75
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,528
With, uh...
Macadamia, chia seeds.

76
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,530
Thanks.

77
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,899
You might want to take
a look at that.

78
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:29,204
I'll get our drinks.

79
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,107
You are Susan, right?

80
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:10,043
Yeah, but call me Shiva,
even mom did.

81
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,114
Okay.

82
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,187
- Um, so...
- So, what...

83
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,691
Sorry, uh, you...

84
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,526
- You, uh... Go first.
- No, you go.

85
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,963
This is fuckin' crazy.

86
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,565
Yeah.

87
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:45,571
I guess she never
told you about me.

88
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:47,272
No, never.

89
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:50,942
Thanks.

90
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,579
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

91
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:58,081
Yep.

92
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,822
You look just like her.

93
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,090
It's something about your, um...

94
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:15,962
Well, I wouldn't know

95
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:18,698
'Cause I've...
I've never seen her.

96
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:26,639
Here.

97
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,321
How old were you when she died?

98
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,589
12.

99
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,924
God, that must have been hard.

100
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:51,026
- Yeah.
- Did you live with your dad after that?

101
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:53,928
Foster homes.

102
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,130
Didn't you have
any other family?

103
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:59,099
Yeah, my mom's parents,
but they didn't want me.

104
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,176
What year were you born?

105
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:13,345
'81.

106
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,280
Fuck, she was like 17
when she had you.

107
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,886
Do you think it's...

108
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:23,953
Do you think it's possible

109
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,255
That we have the same dad?

110
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:27,589
I doubt it.

111
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:29,290
I mean,
I never met my dad, so...

112
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,725
But, I don't know,
like ten years apart?

113
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,194
- It doesn't seem likely.
- Hmm.

114
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,368
- So, what do you do?
- What do you mean?

115
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,635
You know, for a living.

116
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,236
Oh, uh...

117
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,239
I try to make people happy.

118
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,674
I guess I kind of do that too.

119
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,343
- How?
- I teach yoga.

120
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,944
Huh.

121
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:58,846
<i>What about you?</i>

122
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,748
Uh, massage.

123
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,117
Oh.

124
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,384
Here, give me your hand.

125
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:18,229
Oh, look at that.

126
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:22,833
- What?
- Your lifeline.

127
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:26,303
It like totally stops
and then it starts again.

128
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:29,773
It's like you have two lives.

129
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,946
<i>Okay, you hurt yourself</i>

130
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,747
Doing yoga.

131
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,381
Isn't it supposed
to be, like, healing and shit?

132
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:42,849
Well, yeah, I mean, that's...

133
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,383
That's absolutely the intention,

134
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:48,219
But you know,
you can't control the outcome.

135
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,855
Sometimes,

136
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:54,157
You... You need
an injury to grow.

137
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,191
You need it to,

138
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,226
You know, evolve.

139
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,961
That's fucked up.

140
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,701
Well, this is me.

141
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,136
What?

142
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:13,239
Holy shit, this is your ride?

143
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,306
Yeah, you like it?

144
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:17,309
Holy shit, yeah.

145
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,311
My boyfriend wants me to sell it

146
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:22,013
For a smart car, or something.

147
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,347
Oh my god, fuck that.

148
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:25,115
Over my dead body
you can sell this

149
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:26,950
For a fucking smart car.

150
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:29,719
Oh my god, I would kill
for a car like this.

151
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,287
Well, you want to buy it?

152
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,222
Oh, yeah...
Just let me get the bag of cash

153
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,856
That's waiting
in my living room.

154
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,091
Oh, now, I'll give
you the family discount.

155
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,297
Um, here, uh,

156
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,133
Take it,
I got... I got others.

157
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,868
Thanks.

158
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:55,272
Um, I gotta go.

159
00:13:57,008 --> 00:14:00,910
Okay, so, um, can...
Can we see each other again?

160
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,712
Yeah, yeah, um...

161
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:06,114
yeah,
I'll call "yoga with may."

162
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:11,252
Yeah, we will, uh,
we'll do some yoga.

163
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,487
Yeah, so my knee
can get fucked up, too.

164
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,755
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

165
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,008
- Hey.
<i>- Hey. Where you been?</i>

166
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,243
Oh, you picked up the postcards.

167
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,310
<i>Yeah, they look great.</i>

168
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,946
Yeah, I've been trying
to call you all morning.

169
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,816
- So, where were you?
- Hmm?

170
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:50,485
Oh, um...

171
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:53,087
I was just out.

172
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,423
<i>Who is it?</i>

173
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:03,195
- I met her.
<i>- Who?</i>

174
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,199
I met Susan.

175
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,436
<i>So, how was it?</i>

176
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,873
It was great.

177
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,441
It was really great.

178
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:19,842
I mean, she's
so different from me.

179
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,144
She's so different.

180
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:27,315
But there was just this,
I don't know, this...

181
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:30,151
This deep connection
that I didn't expect.

182
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,986
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

183
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,089
I'd love to meet her.

184
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,857
Well, her boyfriend
wants to meet me, too,

185
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,058
And they are going out tonight,

186
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,826
And they invited us to come.

187
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,527
<i>Well, not tonight.</i>

188
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,229
<i>We have plans, remember?</i>

189
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:18,617
All the bullshit I do for you?

190
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,285
Like what?

191
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,486
<i>Like all I've fucking done.</i>

192
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,554
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hey.

193
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,223
So, uh...
So this is may, right?

194
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,391
Oh this is my...
My boyfriend, Cody.

195
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:29,525
Well, it's nice to meet you.

196
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:31,393
Yeah, likewise.

197
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:34,429
You know I can, uh...
I can see the family resemblance.

198
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,199
Must be like looking
in a mirror with you two.

199
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,434
Hey, wait, let me, uh...
Let me buy you a drink.

200
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,669
- What do you want?
- Oh, um, well I'm...

201
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,171
- I'm driving tonight, so just a water.
- Oh, bullshit, come on,

202
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,273
You can have one drink, right?

203
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,242
No, I'm... I've got a really
early start in the morning, so...

204
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,676
A glass of wine, maybe?

205
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,244
You look like
the chardonnay type.

206
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:55,678
<i>You are the chardonnay type.</i>

207
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,048
Well, sometimes,
but not... Not tonight.

208
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,349
- <i>No?</i>
- Thank you.

209
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:02,517
Baby, can you just
get her a water, please?

210
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,051
Okay.

211
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,352
All right, so one water,

212
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:08,321
One vodka and cranberry
for the princess.

213
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:09,689
I'll see you inside.

214
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,192
- Hey, can we go?
- Is everything okay?

215
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,993
<i>I can't deal with him
tonight, let's go.</i>

216
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,461
- Sure.
- - Okay.

217
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:20,597
Do you want to tell him?

218
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,231
Do you want a lime in it?

219
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,099
- Hey. Hey.
- - Just trust me.

220
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:25,300
Where the fuck are you going?

221
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:28,002
I'm buying you a fucking drink,

222
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,937
- Fuck off.
- - What the fuck is that bullshit?

223
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,271
- Hey, come on,
- Get off!

224
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:32,639
I'm buying you fucking drinks.

225
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,674
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Don't fucking hit me.

226
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,709
Leave her alone, man.

227
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,311
I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

228
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,679
<i>Hey, be cool, man.</i>

229
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:43,114
<i>If the lady wants
to leave, just...</i>

230
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,548
- <i>Cody, cut it out!
- I said, who the fuck are you?</i>

231
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,116
- Look, I got no... Hey!
- Who the fuck are you?

232
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,118
<i>You don't have any problems?</i>

233
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,952
<i>I've got problems.</i>

234
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,186
- Can you get me out of here?
- - <i>I got no problem...</i>

235
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,554
- Please?
- - <i>That's funny,</i>

236
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:52,556
<i>'Cause I've got a big
fucking problem.</i>

237
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:53,557
<i>Leave us alone!</i>

238
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:55,391
Oh, that's cute, fuck.

239
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:56,725
Fucking weakling.

240
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,259
We have to call the police.

241
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,127
<i>Please, may, let's just go.</i>

242
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,129
<i>Stop it!</i>

243
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,330
Shit, huh?

244
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,564
What the fuck you gonna do?

245
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:09,602
- Jesus.
- - <i>Shiva,</i> where are you going?

246
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,491
I think it's fate
that we met right now,

247
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,392
Don't you?

248
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:42,433
I also think that you are a powerful,
beautiful woman

249
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:45,102
Who doesn't even realize it.

250
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,009
Thanks.

251
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,615
- <i>Good-Night.</i>
- Good-Night.

252
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:20,434
<i>Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu.</i>

253
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,441
What are you doing?

254
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:31,810
I'm just saying
a prayer for peace.

255
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:35,245
You're such a hippie.

256
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,658
Sorry.

257
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:56,663
No, it's...
It's okay.

258
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:59,132
It's nice.

259
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:22,853
May.

260
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,124
May.

261
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:33,327
Hey.

262
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,364
<i>I did not feel comfortable
letting her go back</i>

263
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,232
To her own place.

264
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,868
Okay.
I've gotta go, I've got a private.

265
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,503
- Okay -
You've got class in less than an hour.

266
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,271
<i>So you should start moving.</i>

267
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,673
No, I think I'm gonna
cancel today.

268
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,642
Cancel? What?

269
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,543
Look, I'm happy
that you found your sister...

270
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,545
- <i>Hi.
- Hi, I'm sorry,</i>

271
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:02,514
I just needed to use
the bathroom.

272
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:05,316
Oh, yeah, it's just...
Um, there, on the left.

273
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,384
And this is my boyfriend.

274
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,552
Hi, Shiva. Dex.
Very nice to meet you.

275
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,120
<i>Yeah, you too.</i>

276
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,125
<i>She seems sweet.</i>

277
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:21,595
- Okay. We can talk about this later.
- Okay.

278
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:24,197
- All right
- Mm-Hmm. Bye.

279
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,399
- Love you.
- Love you.

280
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:27,566
Bye, Shiva.

281
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,475
Hey.

282
00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:41,578
He seems, like, super nice.

283
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,346
Yeah.

284
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,481
<i>You know, I was thinking,</i>

285
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:49,283
Would you want to just
go away for a night?

286
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,584
Just you and me?

287
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,252
Like a lady date?

288
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,187
Exactly.

289
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:56,422
Go where?

290
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:57,923
Well, my mom
has this little place

291
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:00,425
Up near Santa Barbara,
we could just chill, and...

292
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:02,160
She's probably gonna be there,

293
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:03,794
But there is a pool.

294
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:07,631
<i>Oh, fuck. I wish.</i>

295
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:12,468
- <i>Why not?</i>
- Cody would fucking freak.

296
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,269
Well, Dex will freak too.

297
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,370
So?

298
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:16,571
I've gotta work this weekend.

299
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:19,173
I've gotta get my rent together.

300
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:37,557
Here.

301
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,659
Pay me back whenever.

302
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,661
Are you sure?

303
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:43,529
Yeah.

304
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:48,634
Thanks.

305
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,679
His truck's gone,
so he's definitely not home.

306
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,515
Do you want me
to go in with you?

307
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:06,883
Okay.

308
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:10,519
Or you could
just borrow something,

309
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,454
Because I have plenty
of stuff there, like I said.

310
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:15,723
No, I'm... I'm good.

311
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:18,225
- What is that look?
- - What look?

312
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,593
That look you just gave me.

313
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,660
<i>I didn't give you a look.</i>

314
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,495
Yes, you did.

315
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,796
<i>I to...</i>

316
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,731
<i>Okay, you look gorgeous
in that dress,</i>

317
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,967
<i>I'm just like...
I couldn't pull it off the way you do.</i>

318
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,579
<i>Hey, I like your disco ball.</i>

319
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,716
- Oh yeah?
- Mmm-Hmm.

320
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:51,286
Cool.
Um, yeah I got it at the flea market.

321
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,955
<i>Do you want something to drink?</i>

322
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:55,523
Like some water?
I think we have...

323
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:56,690
I think we have beer.

324
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,491
Nope, I'm fine.

325
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,827
Okay.

326
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,475
So, how long have you
lived here?

327
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,510
Like, three years.

328
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,482
Is... Is that a gun?

329
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,352
Yeah.

330
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,020
Is it yours?

331
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,389
It's Cody's.

332
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:35,757
You know what guys are like.

333
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:38,859
Jesus, don't point
that over here.

334
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,727
Well, it won't bite
unless you make it.

335
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,995
Woof!

336
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:43,997
That is not funny.

337
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:46,298
It's a little funny.

338
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,433
You totally wanna hold it.

339
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:50,567
Take it,
come on. Take it.

340
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,005
Come on.

341
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,606
Wow. It's heavy.

342
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,341
Yeah,
it's a .45.

343
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:02,510
It's Cody's
dad's gun from Vietnam.

344
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,413
Is it loaded?

345
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,481
Always.

346
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,082
Here.

347
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:15,019
I mean, come on,
doesn't that make you a little scared?

348
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:17,388
You have a loaded gun
in your house.

349
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,057
No. It makes us safe,
right?

350
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,025
Like if the bad guys come?

351
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:24,527
Yeah, but if the bad guys come,

352
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,862
It's more likely
to be used on you.

353
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,598
No, those bad guys
never met Cody.

354
00:26:56,492 --> 00:27:00,393
<i>What was our mother like?</i>

355
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,661
<i>She was just so much fun.</i>

356
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,734
<i>Was she cool?
Was she wild?</i>

357
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,437
<i>You know,
she had such a big heart.</i>

358
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,941
<i>She was...
I loved her.</i>

359
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:35,988
<i>You would have loved each other.</i>

360
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,757
<i>Fuck, nice place.</i>

361
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,891
<i>Thanks.</i>

362
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,064
Hey, can I ask you something?

363
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,565
Yeah, sure.

364
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,833
And it's...
If it's none of my business,

365
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:25,835
I mean...

366
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,602
you don't have to answer.

367
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,070
Okay.

368
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:34,908
What kind of massage do you do?

369
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:43,815
Is this what you've been thinking
about for the past half hour?

370
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,850
No.

371
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:49,720
I was just kind of
curious, if...

372
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,922
Are you trying to ask me
if I'm a hooker?

373
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,624
- No.
- I prefer sex worker.

374
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,525
Sure, yeah.

375
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,926
Not that it really matters.

376
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:01,628
No, I get it.

377
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,931
I get it.

378
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,968
Do you have anything else
you want to ask me?

379
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,505
- Nope.
- Okay.

380
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:19,577
Well, actually, um,

381
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:23,013
Are you okay
with what you're doing?

382
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,752
I mean, it's not perfect, but,

383
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:29,919
What the fuck is?

384
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,091
I don't need to be saved.

385
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,867
Mom?

386
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:51,803
- Mom?
- - <i>I'm in my room.</i>

387
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,039
Okay, um...

388
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,140
why don't you just
hang out by the pool,

389
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,108
Or get a drink, or something?

390
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,143
- Okay.
- Make yourself at home.

391
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:05,948
<i>Hey, mom,</i>

392
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,549
Hey, honey.

393
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,250
Whew, it's really chilly
in here.

394
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:12,286
Oh, it's so hot
outside I can't stand it.

395
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:14,821
This much A.C.
Is gonna kill you.

396
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:17,557
I didn't expect to see you
this weekend.

397
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,591
Well, I hope you don't mind,

398
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:20,559
But I brought a friend.

399
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,960
What do you think of this?

400
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,562
It's nice.

401
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,864
I'm going to re-Decorate.

402
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,832
Why? I like it the way
that it is.

403
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,600
Oh, I like a change.

404
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:31,701
Did you say you brought
a friend?

405
00:30:31,703 --> 00:30:34,804
Yeah.

406
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:38,140
- Her name is Shiva...
- That's unusual.

407
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:42,944
Yeah, and...

408
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:48,182
well actually she's
not just a friend.

409
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:50,984
She's my biological sister.

410
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:54,287
Half-Sister.

411
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,327
I only just met her.

412
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,062
So, it's new for me too.

413
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,231
But she's really great.

414
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,200
I think you'll like her.

415
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,937
I didn't know you were...

416
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,806
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

417
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:21,675
I don't know.

418
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:29,949
Have you contacted
your birth mother?

419
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:35,353
She passed away.

420
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:38,255
And I know that you
didn't want me to do that,

421
00:31:38,257 --> 00:31:42,759
But since dad died,
I don't know...

422
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:46,062
I just...

423
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:47,930
I just don't understand why you
didn't talk to me about this.

424
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:49,164
Why so secret?

425
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:53,601
Just because I love you,

426
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:55,603
And I didn't want to hurt you.

427
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,037
So why did you bring
her here then?

428
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,841
I just wanted you to meet her.

429
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:06,712
And she has, I don't know...

430
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:08,046
Trouble with a boyfriend,

431
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,614
I thought...
I thought it would be nice

432
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,082
To have a night away.

433
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,753
Life is difficult enough without
inviting problems into it,

434
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,121
You know that.

435
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:21,125
She's not a problem, mom.

436
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:23,193
I just feel bad for her.

437
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:25,028
You know,
she doesn't have any family or anything,

438
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,631
She doesn't have anybody.

439
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:30,799
This is pretty, don't you think?

440
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,685
Hey.

441
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,992
Cody called.

442
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:01,928
Did you speak to him?

443
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,096
He left a message.

444
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:06,131
And?

445
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:10,834
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

446
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:14,237
<i>I swear to god,
I just got out of jail, Shiva,</i>

447
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,172
<i>If you're not home
by the time I get back,</i>

448
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:17,706
<i>You're fucking dead.</i>

449
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,340
<i>You understand?</i>

450
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,077
What do you want to do?

451
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:30,081
Oh my god, isn't it too hot?

452
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,750
Mom, this is Shiva.

453
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,752
Shiva, this is my mom, Martha.

454
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:37,688
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

455
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,989
Wow, where are you going?

456
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,691
Oh, back to I.A.,
On a date.

457
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,459
- No way...
- Blind date.

458
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:44,993
Lynn set it up.

459
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:46,361
I'm too old to be dating, but...

460
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:49,063
Ah, you're never
too old to date.

461
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:53,199
Anyway, I hope you girls
enjoy yourselves,

462
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:56,135
Don't forget to leave
the alarm on when you leave.

463
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:57,936
Okay.
Bye, mom.

464
00:33:57,938 --> 00:33:59,971
I know we'll be meeting again.

465
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,772
I hope so.

466
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,473
This is Dex, I gotta take it.
Sorry, mom.

467
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,074
- See you. Bye.
- - Bye.

468
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,211
- Hello?
- - <i>Hey, you.</i>

469
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:12,845
<i>I was looking
at the business account,</i>

470
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,380
Looks like there's
a thousand dollars missing.

471
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:17,248
<i>- Did you know</i> that?
- I know.

472
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,849
<i>What, did you pay a bill?</i>

473
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,151
<i>Where did it go?
I don't understand.</i>

474
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,852
It's that gas guzzler,
again, isn't it?

475
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,019
We've got to get rid of it.
That's it.

476
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,253
We've got to sell it this week.

477
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,921
No more discussion, please.

478
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:28,155
It wasn't the car.

479
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:30,223
Okay?
I gave it to Shiva.

480
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,824
<i>Wait, what?</i>

481
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:34,927
I gave it to Shiva for her rent.

482
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,194
Are you being serious right now?

483
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:37,962
No, I thought it was
a good idea.

484
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:40,464
It felt like the right
thing to do.

485
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:42,799
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

486
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,767
<i>I cannot believe
that you did not call me, may.</i>

487
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,135
<i>We're supposed to talk
to each other</i>

488
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:47,302
<i>And to make decisions like this.</i>

489
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,936
<i>We're a team.</i>

490
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:50,237
<i>This is unbelie...
We need that money,</i>

491
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,972
<i>For the first month of rent,</i>

492
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:55,475
If we don't get enough
students then we're gonna be...

493
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,176
Is this funny to you?

494
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,378
No, I just...
The line's breaking up,

495
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,313
I can't hear you anymore.

496
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,014
<i>- May?</i>
- Hello?

497
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:04,915
<i>- May?</i>
- Hello?

498
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:11,387
Oh, he's pissed.

499
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:13,522
And I haven't even told him
I'm out of town.

500
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,993
You're a beautiful,
powerful woman.

501
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:21,528
Some old bitch
told me that once.

502
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,434
<i>- Hey -
You wanna tell me</i> what's going on?

503
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:29,868
No, I don't know
what happened back there,

504
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,770
It just cut out.
So listen,

505
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:35,439
I am at my mom's place at
Santa Barbara with Shiva,

506
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:38,041
And I will be home
in time for class tomorrow.

507
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:39,242
<i>What?</i>

508
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:40,810
Yeah, and we did
drive the marlin,

509
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:42,478
And we used an entire
tank of gas,

510
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,779
And it was really fun.

511
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:44,880
I love that car

512
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:46,381
And I don't want to sell it.

513
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:49,450
Okay?
I love you so much, Dex.

514
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:51,852
Bye.

515
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,904
"May is passionate
about sharing this practice

516
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:14,907
"Which so profoundly
changed her life."

517
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:18,877
"It gives her great joy to see how peace
unfolds in the lives of her students."

518
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:26,317
It just sounds like bullshit.

519
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,252
I mean, honestly,
most the people that teach this

520
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:30,988
Wanna have a nice ass.

521
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,991
Nothin' wrong
with having a nice ass.

522
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:39,062
You wanna see my page?

523
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,430
You have a webpage?

524
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,499
An ad.
Here, give me.

525
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,477
"Angel will give you
the sexiest massage"

526
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:59,046
"With the happiest ending
you could dream of,"

527
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:02,983
"And nothing gives her
more pleasure."

528
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,551
As if.

529
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,519
It's all fucking bullshit.

530
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:10,622
Don't take it so seriously.

531
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:13,625
But it's different,
I mean yoga is about truth.

532
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:15,860
Isn't sex?

533
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:25,501
What was it like the first time

534
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:27,469
You... did it,

535
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:29,637
Like...

536
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,207
Well how else do you say it?

537
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,243
That I did it.

538
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:40,547
Mmm. Cody and I
were at this party,

539
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,915
And this guy came up to me,

540
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,650
And he was like,

541
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,887
"I'll give you 500 bucks
if you come home with me."

542
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:50,289
And of course
I thought he was kidding.

543
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,658
And then I realized he wasn't.

544
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:57,228
And then, I thought
Cody would fucking freak,

545
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,397
But he didn't.

546
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,204
We needed the money.

547
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:16,378
You gotta let your hair down
every once in a while.

548
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:32,626
Like a fucking pro.

549
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,394
Don't tell anybody.

550
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,530
Oh, fuck, oh I love this song.

551
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,265
Mmm.

552
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:55,245
- I'm not coming up.
- Come on.

553
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:14,121
<i>Yeah, she gave me
the money just like that.</i>

554
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:16,456
<i>Easiest money I ever made.</i>

555
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:20,592
Yeah, I can get more,
stop bitching at me.

556
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:23,194
She's rich, okay?

557
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:25,396
I'll be home this afternoon.

558
00:40:25,398 --> 00:40:28,465
Um, okay.
Yeah, I love you. Bye.

559
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:39,774
Hey.

560
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:41,575
We should probably
get goin', huh?

561
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,382
Okay, yeah. Sure.

562
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,477
I'm not trying
to steal your money.

563
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,449
I just said that
because I don't want

564
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,451
Him to kill me when I get home.

565
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,392
If you don't want
to go back, don't.

566
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,128
Yeah?

567
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,839
You can stay with me and Dex
for a few nights.

568
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:06,679
Take this moment
to feel the calm in your body.

569
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,814
To feel the peace
in every cell of your being.

570
00:43:20,525 --> 00:43:22,259
Rolling over onto your side,

571
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:26,529
Come up into a comfortable,
seated position.

572
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:33,768
Put your hands on your heart.

573
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,603
Gently opening your eyes,

574
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:38,672
Bringing that sense
of peace and oneness

575
00:43:38,674 --> 00:43:40,840
To everything
that you see today.

576
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:42,408
<i>Namaste.</i>

577
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,575
<i>Namaste.</i>

578
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:47,277
Okay, you guys,
thank you so much.

579
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:49,612
See you next week, we're open.

580
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:50,813
Very exciting.

581
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:53,981
Bye, see you tomorrow.

582
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,785
Hey.

583
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:02,255
Hey.

584
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:04,624
So, what can I do for you?

585
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:06,859
Uh, Shiva left this
at our place.

586
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:12,397
Wouldn't happen to have
seen her would you?

587
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:19,536
Well, that's ironic, right?

588
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:24,407
"Shiva".

589
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:32,948
You know, I was uh,
I was born in new Mexico.

590
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,750
The home of the nuclear bomb.

591
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:36,817
Oh yeah?

592
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:38,952
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:40,687
You know what the guy
said who invented it,

594
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:42,321
When we saw
the first one explode,

595
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:45,524
You know what he said?

596
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:49,494
He said, "I am Shiva,

597
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,796
Destroyer of worlds."

598
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:54,898
You see, that's the thing
about Shiva,

599
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,367
You know,
you get too close to her,

600
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:59,469
And everything you ever loved
can be destroyed,

601
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:01,637
Just like the bomb.

602
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,610
That's funny,
speak of the devil, right?

603
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:14,847
What are you doing here?

604
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,515
Well, you know, it's funny,

605
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:17,816
'Cause I could ask
the same fucking thing to you.

606
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,751
What are you doing?

607
00:45:19,753 --> 00:45:23,421
I'm hanging out,
I was just, um...

608
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:24,889
Gonna... I was gonna
come home soon.

609
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,357
- Oh, really?
- - Mmm-Hmm.

610
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,058
Wow.

611
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,428
You know, that was so nice of
you to call and let me know.

612
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,762
I mean, you girls
been having a nice time

613
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:36,799
While I was in jail?
Huh?

614
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:50,978
Shiva's gonna stay here
for a few nights.

615
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:54,981
Oh yeah?

616
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:57,716
Yeah.

617
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:10,795
I'm gonna get my stuff.

618
00:46:16,768 --> 00:46:18,935
Anyway, like I was saying,

619
00:46:18,937 --> 00:46:20,937
You never really know
what you're gonna get.

620
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:24,740
And it's not like
I imagine you two girls

621
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:27,509
Having much in common,
anyway, right?

622
00:46:28,944 --> 00:46:31,478
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

623
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:37,984
Excuse me.

624
00:46:46,426 --> 00:46:47,926
Please don't leave with him.

625
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:50,061
You don't want to deal with this,
trust me.

626
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:52,096
I don't care.
I will call the police.

627
00:46:52,098 --> 00:46:53,363
What are they gonna do?

628
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:54,697
They will make him leave.

629
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:57,933
Like he wouldn't come back.
I gotta go.

630
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,135
Please.

631
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:04,038
Look, remember how you said
that it was fate that we met?

632
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,006
That's what it's like
with me and Cody,

633
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:08,575
So there's no use
in fighting it.

634
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,543
This is exactly
what he wants you to think,

635
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:13,112
But you have a choice.

636
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,795
Pressure, that's it, man.
I understand this guy, right?

637
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:34,463
- Uh... Dex.
- Dex.

638
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:35,931
Dex is amazing,
he was just telling me

639
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:37,666
How yoga might help me
with my headaches.

640
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:38,833
You know, apparently,

641
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:40,601
I have too much
stress in my life.

642
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,769
I mean, I don't even know
how I get up in the morning.

643
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:44,170
- Let's go.
- All right, but you see,

644
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:45,738
The trouble is,
it's my girlfriend here,

645
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,639
She's always in a rush,
makes me crazy.

646
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:52,176
Hey, man,
I know exactly what you mean.

647
00:47:52,178 --> 00:47:54,044
Uh, if you're interested
seriously, take that.

648
00:47:54,046 --> 00:47:55,578
Baby, he doesn't want that.

649
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,146
Oh, Pico and Lincoln, yeah.

650
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:59,181
Yeah, exactly.
That's right above the print shop.

651
00:47:59,183 --> 00:48:00,515
Okay, I'll look for it.

652
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:02,083
- Thank you.
- Cody.

653
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:04,085
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah, Dex.

654
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,719
All right.
Take care.

655
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,588
See you guys.

656
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:14,560
Why were you so nice to him?

657
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:15,994
He's your sister's boyfriend.

658
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,695
He is her pimp.

659
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,436
Shiva's a whore?

660
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,806
Don't call her that.

661
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,708
What do you want me to call her?

662
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,178
Prostitute?

663
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,014
A sex worker.

664
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:45,118
- It doesn't make a difference.
- Yeah, it does.

665
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,554
Fine, she's a sex worker.

666
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:49,888
And you gave her our money.

667
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,056
You know, Dex,
I just wanted to help her.

668
00:48:52,058 --> 00:48:53,724
She probably set you up
from the beginning

669
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:54,891
So she could get our money.

670
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,459
Did you even think
about that, may?

671
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:57,993
Well, if she did,
she is welcome to it.

672
00:48:57,995 --> 00:49:00,595
She needs it a lot more
than we do.

673
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:02,964
You're telling me
that this woman is a prost...

674
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:04,065
A sex worker, and it's okay

675
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,766
If she comes into our home?

676
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:07,701
Why does it matter to you
so much what she does?

677
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:09,169
Because I don't want
that energy in my house.

678
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:10,171
And neither should you.

679
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:12,238
What energy?

680
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,641
Okay, stop.
Let's just stop.

681
00:49:15,643 --> 00:49:16,775
Let's just leave this.

682
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,668
<i>Let's go.
We're gonna be late.</i>

683
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,862
<i>Do you have the info?</i>

684
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,096
Here.

685
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:51,764
That's awesome.

686
00:50:51,766 --> 00:50:53,599
We'll definitely be there.

687
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,702
- See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
- Yeah, see you. Bye.

688
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:05,843
What is that?

689
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,277
It's the money
that I gave Shiva,

690
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:09,312
And the key to our place
that she didn't take.

691
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:12,315
Good.
This is literally karma in action.

692
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:14,283
- I have to get this to her right now.
- Wh... May, just...

693
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:16,184
Let's take a while and think
about what you're doing.

694
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:17,919
I don't want to take a moment
to think about anything.

695
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:19,887
- We'll be coming tomorrow.
- Excellent.

696
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:21,188
- <i>Namaste. Namaste.
- Namaste.</i>

697
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,056
Okay, bye.

698
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:24,290
Let's not talk about
this here right now.

699
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,292
This is not appropriate.
You know what?

700
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,059
Fuck appropriate.

701
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:28,226
Shh. Let's just
talk about this outside.

702
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:30,027
What is it with you and this...

703
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:31,228
You know what,
this is what you're interested in?

704
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,696
This is all you fucking
care about?

705
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,731
Then you can fucking take it!

706
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:35,998
May.

707
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:45,906
May, stop right there!

708
00:51:45,908 --> 00:51:48,041
Fuck you.

709
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,742
Don't you ever touch me
like that.

710
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:51,777
What is happening to you?

711
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:54,780
You're in there, and you're talking
about how you want to heal people?

712
00:51:54,782 --> 00:51:58,116
But you only want to heal
people who have money.

713
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,352
I know one person,
right now, who needs help.

714
00:52:01,354 --> 00:52:03,387
Okay, I'm not saying
don't help her,

715
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:08,892
I'm just saying
think this through.

716
00:52:08,894 --> 00:52:11,895
She didn't take the money,
so she can't pay her rent.

717
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:15,198
And she doesn't have our key,
so she has no place to go.

718
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,867
You don't even know
who she really is.

719
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,372
I don't think you know
who I really am.

720
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:33,713
Where are you going, may?

721
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:41,219
May!

722
00:53:33,805 --> 00:53:38,175
Shiva, it's me.
It's may.

723
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:41,477
Can you please open the door?

724
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:44,146
I really need to talk to you.

725
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:51,885
I know you're in there,

726
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:54,153
And I'm not leaving
until I see you.

727
00:54:00,726 --> 00:54:04,061
What do you want?

728
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,333
You forgot these.

729
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:13,736
I don't need 'em.

730
00:54:13,738 --> 00:54:17,840
Can we talk, please?
Can I come in?

731
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,288
I don't need anything, okay?

732
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,057
I know you don't.

733
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:39,926
So why did you come here?

734
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:42,862
Just take these from me, okay?

735
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:45,030
I don't need 'em.

736
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,165
I said I don't need 'em.

737
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,167
I'm not coming over.

738
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:54,905
What is that on your neck?

739
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:57,173
It's nothing, okay?
Just leave.

740
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:08,449
Come with me.

741
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:11,918
What's the fucking point?
He'll kill me.

742
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:15,821
I'm not gonna let that happen.

743
00:55:15,823 --> 00:55:17,022
Oh, yeah, and how
are you going to stop it?

744
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:19,890
By chanting?

745
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,292
He loves me.

746
00:55:22,294 --> 00:55:23,926
This is not love.

747
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:26,561
Yeah, well it's the closest
thing I've got, so...

748
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:30,298
You have me, now.

749
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:37,404
I love you.

750
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:42,041
<i>I love you.</i>

751
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:46,311
You don't count.

752
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:50,415
<i>Why not?</i>

753
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,549
Because you're a girl.

754
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,986
<i>Since when do girls not count?</i>

755
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,897
You count.

756
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:17,871
You fucking count.

757
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,515
Fuck!

758
00:56:35,153 --> 00:56:36,353
Get in the fucking closet.

759
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,188
I'm not gonna get in the closet.

760
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,556
You and me,
we're gonna leave together

761
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:40,957
Get in the fucking closet.

762
00:56:42,326 --> 00:56:44,860
<i>- Hi, baby.</i>
- - <i>Hey.</i>

763
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:47,529
<i>What you watchin'?</i>

764
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:49,931
<i>Get your ass ready,
I've got a date for you.</i>

765
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,468
I want you to look
real pretty too.

766
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,303
<i>Don't I always look pretty?</i>

767
00:56:56,305 --> 00:56:57,637
<i>Yeah, you always look pretty,</i>

768
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:01,373
<i>Just put some fucking makeup on.</i>

769
00:57:02,408 --> 00:57:03,574
Who's the date?

770
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:06,476
Lonely ed.

771
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:08,044
- <i>No.</i>
- - Come on, man.

772
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:09,345
He loves you, that guy.
I already told you,

773
00:57:09,347 --> 00:57:11,647
I'm not seeing that freak again.

774
00:57:11,649 --> 00:57:14,216
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. We need the fucking money.
- I'm serious.

775
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:17,018
<i>I don't like that guy,
he really fucked me up last time.</i>

776
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,987
Aw, come here.

777
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:22,522
Come on, what?

778
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,924
You're not afraid of him,
are you? Huh?

779
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:27,026
- Are you?
- - I don't know.

780
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,028
Come on, that's bullshit.

781
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,261
Who loves you?

782
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:31,396
Who loves you?

783
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:32,897
- You do.
- Yeah, you're right.

784
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:34,198
You know, I'd walk
to the end of the earth

785
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,599
On broken shards
of glass for you,

786
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,601
You know that?
All right?

787
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:38,368
<i>I know.</i>

788
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,970
<i>So what are you... Huh?
What the fuck are you?</i>

789
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,271
You're a fearless fucking tiger,

790
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:43,672
That's what you are.

791
00:57:43,674 --> 00:57:45,106
So come on,
give me these tiger titties

792
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:46,340
For a minute...

793
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:56,148
I got five minutes,
so, warm you up a little bit.

794
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:07,023
Baby, I'm hungry.

795
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,658
Can we go get something to eat?

796
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:16,164
Are you out
of your fucking mind? Huh?

797
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,065
How many fucking times
have I got to tell you,

798
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:20,133
I gotta fucking pay this rent.

799
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,339
Jesus Christ.

800
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:32,642
<i>Baby, I don't wanna see Ed,</i>

801
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:34,243
<i>I wanna... I wanna
be with you.</i>

802
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:36,511
<i>Let's go have some fun.</i>

803
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,151
<i>You've got
the fucking money for that?</i>

804
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,986
<i>Huh?</i>

805
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:47,287
You got the fucking money?

806
00:58:54,394 --> 00:58:56,428
Open the money drawer.

807
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,062
Open it.

808
00:58:58,064 --> 00:59:00,230
Open the fucking drawer!

809
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:10,039
<i>You see any money in there?</i>

810
00:59:14,144 --> 00:59:15,744
<i>What do you see?</i>

811
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,182
Yeah. Give it to me.

812
00:59:35,562 --> 00:59:37,496
<i>You wanna fuck us up?</i>

813
00:59:37,498 --> 00:59:39,431
<i>Huh?</i>

814
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:42,500
<i>Give me one good reason</i>

815
00:59:42,502 --> 00:59:43,701
<i>Why I shouldn't
shoot you right now,</i>

816
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:46,103
<i>You fucking bitch.</i>

817
00:59:46,105 --> 00:59:48,538
Because you love me.

818
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:52,674
Well, I fucking hate you.

819
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,710
I fucking hate you.

820
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:29,204
What the fuck?

821
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:31,406
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:33,508
What the fuck is this shit?

823
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,449
Don't touch her.

824
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:50,122
Are you okay?

825
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:52,757
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

826
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:55,793
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

827
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:04,200
<i>Tell her.</i>

828
01:01:07,504 --> 01:01:09,604
I'm not your sister.

829
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:15,076
I just wanted your money.

830
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:30,223
I'll see you downstairs.

831
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:17,168
<i>You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.</i>

832
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,770
<i>You owe me double now.</i>

833
01:02:19,772 --> 01:02:21,271
<i>Yeah, all right, all right.</i>

834
01:02:21,273 --> 01:02:23,706
<i>Yeah, we can make that happen.</i>

835
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,674
Yeah, she's available.

836
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,345
A little midnight special.

837
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,582
<i>All right,
I'll have her cleaned up</i>

838
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,183
<i>And send her over in an hour.</i>

839
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,617
<i>Bye.</i>

840
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:54,772
I need to speak to Shiva.

841
01:05:54,774 --> 01:05:57,508
Did you just climb over my gate?

842
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,643
The girl... The girl
that just came in here.

843
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:00,744
I need to speak to her.

844
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,479
You've got the wrong house.

845
01:06:32,707 --> 01:06:34,007
I'm gonna call
the cops, if you...

846
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:36,609
<i>What the fuck?</i>

847
01:06:39,479 --> 01:06:42,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

848
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:47,819
go ahead, call them.

849
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:52,623
Listen, uh...

850
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,458
We're all consenting
adults here.

851
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,127
I just watched a man
threaten to kill her,

852
01:06:57,129 --> 01:07:00,163
So she would come here.
So don't talk to me about consent.

853
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:04,500
Okay, just...

854
01:07:04,502 --> 01:07:05,567
Sh...
She's upstairs.

855
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:08,869
<i>Shiva, come on down.</i>

856
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:12,005
<i>It's okay.</i>

857
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:13,806
I don't think she can hear you.

858
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:17,843
Take me to her.

859
01:07:17,845 --> 01:07:20,712
Look, why don't you
put the gun down?

860
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:23,114
Just take me to her.

861
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:24,648
<i>I had no idea that she came here</i>

862
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,851
<i>Under any duress, I swear.</i>

863
01:07:27,853 --> 01:07:30,119
Slowly.

864
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:31,520
Move slowly.

865
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,874
Open it.

866
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:03,650
May, what the fuck?

867
01:08:03,652 --> 01:08:05,585
Give me the key.

868
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:06,719
<i>Why don't you put the gun down?</i>

869
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:08,954
Give me the fucking keys!

870
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:10,655
- The keys in my case.
- - <i>Shut up and get it!</i>

871
01:08:10,657 --> 01:08:12,523
- I'll... I'll get it.
- Do not let him go over there.

872
01:08:12,525 --> 01:08:13,991
It's...
It's in my case.

873
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:15,659
- Hey, don't go over there!
- Take the safety off.

874
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:16,726
- How?
- Pull it back, take the safe...

875
01:08:18,096 --> 01:08:19,895
What... Are you out
of your mind?

876
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:23,999
I said shut the fuck up,
so shut the fuck up.

877
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:28,136
Go to the case.
Go to the case.

878
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,904
Move over there.

879
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:32,739
Stay right there.

880
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,880
Right, right.

881
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:43,616
Oh, fuck.
There's a gun in there.

882
01:08:48,922 --> 01:08:51,156
Okay... Okay?

883
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,494
Take his gun.

884
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:59,062
What? Why?
Why would I steal his gun?

885
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:01,897
- You stole Cody's gun.
- - That was different.

886
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:06,601
I'm not leaving him
with a fucking gun, okay?

887
01:09:06,603 --> 01:09:09,069
Take the gun.

888
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,905
Go, go, go, go.

889
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:15,974
- Stay there.
- Wait. W... W... W... Wait.

890
01:09:15,976 --> 01:09:17,942
Handcuff yourself to the bed.

891
01:09:17,944 --> 01:09:21,645
- <i>What?</i>
- Handcuff yourself to the fucking bed.

892
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:31,153
Let's go.

893
01:09:31,155 --> 01:09:33,822
Go, go.

894
01:09:37,526 --> 01:09:39,193
I really don't want
to steal from him.

895
01:09:39,195 --> 01:09:41,061
<i>Okay, fine.
Let's just fucking go.</i>

896
01:09:45,132 --> 01:09:46,599
Those are his kids?

897
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:49,668
Yeah, probably.

898
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:53,270
<i>That is fucked.</i>

899
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,704
That's life.
Let's go.

900
01:09:59,575 --> 01:10:02,009
No.

901
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:04,077
- No.
- - May, what the fuck?

902
01:10:05,546 --> 01:10:07,613
What the fuck are you doing?

903
01:10:09,616 --> 01:10:12,618
What the fuck?

904
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,721
The next time you're about to
pay to slap a woman around,

905
01:10:15,723 --> 01:10:18,924
I just want you to stop
and take a deep breath,

906
01:10:18,926 --> 01:10:21,760
And remember, that
that is someone's daughter.

907
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:25,163
What are you,
a fucking life coach?

908
01:10:25,165 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm a yoga teacher.

909
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:34,805
<i>Namaste,</i> motherfucker.

910
01:10:37,975 --> 01:10:40,176
Now we can go.

911
01:10:40,178 --> 01:10:45,147
You're fucking insane.
I love it.

912
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,316
Oh, my god.

913
01:10:48,318 --> 01:10:50,318
Oh my god is right.

914
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,953
- You are fucking crazy.
- Holy shit.

915
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:55,155
I am fucking crazy, I am.

916
01:10:55,157 --> 01:10:58,324
Dude, you are fucking crazy.

917
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:00,592
You should have seen his face
when I went back up there.

918
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,226
- You should have seen his face.
- - Dude, dude.

919
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:03,961
I cannot believe you just
fucking did that for me.

920
01:11:03,963 --> 01:11:07,230
Why did you do that for me...
Seriously?

921
01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:09,098
I just...
I know that...

922
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,732
That you don't want
to be saved, and all, but...

923
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,667
Fuck what I said.
Oh my god,

924
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:16,604
Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before, ever.

925
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,138
Fuck.

926
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,707
Holy shit, it was amazing.

927
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:31,349
I lied, I am your sister.

928
01:11:37,822 --> 01:11:41,157
<i>I wouldn't have cared.</i>

929
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,925
<i>It wouldn't have mattered.</i>

930
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:55,967
Fuck, it's Cody.

931
01:11:57,369 --> 01:11:59,837
Don't answer.

932
01:12:04,808 --> 01:12:05,874
Where are we going?

933
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:16,016
Where are you?

934
01:12:16,018 --> 01:12:18,151
Hey, Dex,

935
01:12:18,153 --> 01:12:20,186
Can you just do something
for me, please?

936
01:12:20,188 --> 01:12:24,023
Can you just... There's a bunch of keys,
in a box by my shrine.

937
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:25,391
Can you...
Can you get them

938
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:28,360
And can you just bring
them to me?

939
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,096
<i>Why don't you just come home?</i>

940
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:34,999
<i>Listen, may.
I'd... I'd just like to talk to you.</i>

941
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:38,435
Just... Just meet me
at the parking lot on main.

942
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:42,906
<i>Please, just do this for me.</i>

943
01:12:42,908 --> 01:12:45,441
<i>And make sure no one
follows you.</i>

944
01:12:45,443 --> 01:12:48,177
Follow... May,
what are you talking about?

945
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:15,035
May.

946
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:16,936
Hey.

947
01:13:18,104 --> 01:13:19,304
Have you got 'em?

948
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,007
Okay, do you want
to just tell me

949
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:26,343
What's going on?
Are you okay?

950
01:13:26,345 --> 01:13:29,279
Yeah.

951
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:30,313
Well then, you wanna tell me why

952
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:31,380
I'm here in a parking lot,

953
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:33,915
Why you couldn't come home?

954
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:35,783
I just can't talk right now.

955
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:36,950
Do... Do you have
the keys?

956
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:46,225
Okay, may,
I just I wanted to apologize for earlier,

957
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:50,462
I... I should not
have gotten mad like that.

958
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:52,096
That's not... You know me,
that's not me, may.

959
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:55,299
I... I know, I know.

960
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,734
I'm sorry, too.

961
01:13:57,736 --> 01:13:58,868
I'm sorry.

962
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,838
Yeah.

963
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:13,815
Okay.

964
01:14:27,862 --> 01:14:31,064
I...

965
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,066
I think I need some space.

966
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,436
May, what are you...
We can work this out.

967
01:14:39,504 --> 01:14:41,037
I don't know.

968
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:47,375
I... I'll... I'll call.
I'll call you.

969
01:14:47,377 --> 01:14:50,778
May, wait,

970
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,112
Don't go with her.

971
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,887
May.

972
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:07,859
I'm sorry, Dex.

973
01:15:11,096 --> 01:15:12,930
May.

974
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:39,255
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

975
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:40,923
Surprise visit.

976
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:52,267
Yeah, we'll stay here tonight.

977
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:54,469
And then,
you know, we'll just see...

978
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,137
We'll see what happens tomorrow.

979
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:59,507
- Sounds good.
- We'll figure it out.

980
01:15:59,509 --> 01:16:01,342
We will.

981
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:15,020
You didn't give him
this address, did you?

982
01:16:15,022 --> 01:16:16,488
No.

983
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:29,299
Are you sure
your mom's not home?

984
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:32,168
Yeah, she's
in I.A. Tonight.

985
01:16:35,438 --> 01:16:38,339
Okay.

986
01:16:57,392 --> 01:16:59,526
Oh, my god.

987
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:01,127
- Mom?
- - Oh, may.

988
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:03,596
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know you were here.

989
01:17:03,598 --> 01:17:08,033
Christ, you scared
the life out of me.

990
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:10,201
- God.
- - Sorry.

991
01:17:10,203 --> 01:17:11,468
Jesus.

992
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:15,104
Oh my god,
what happened to your face?

993
01:17:15,106 --> 01:17:16,972
I had a peel today.

994
01:17:16,974 --> 01:17:19,074
God, you scared me.

995
01:17:19,076 --> 01:17:21,376
Hey, how was your date?

996
01:17:21,378 --> 01:17:23,244
What is going on?

997
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:27,680
Nothing. Nothing, we just
had fun, we just came back.

998
01:17:27,682 --> 01:17:29,682
Can we talk privately?

999
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:31,283
It's okay, you can talk freely

1000
01:17:31,285 --> 01:17:33,952
In front of Shiva, it's cool.

1001
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:35,053
No, it's not cool, young lady.

1002
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:37,388
This is not cool.

1003
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:40,624
Dex told me what
you did with the money.

1004
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:42,125
Well, you were
the one who told me

1005
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:44,427
To put it to good use.

1006
01:17:44,429 --> 01:17:46,294
Not to give it to a prostitute.

1007
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,164
Jesus, mom.

1008
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,965
It's okay.

1009
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:55,568
It's fine.

1010
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,136
Okay, you know...
We're just...

1011
01:17:57,138 --> 01:17:58,570
We're just gonna rest
for a little bit,

1012
01:17:58,572 --> 01:18:00,438
And then we're gonna
leave in the morning.

1013
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Okay?

1014
01:18:01,441 --> 01:18:03,340
This is crazy.

1015
01:18:03,342 --> 01:18:08,011
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

1016
01:18:08,013 --> 01:18:11,214
And I'm really sorry
that we woke you up,

1017
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:12,515
But we would not have come here

1018
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:14,350
If we knew
you were going to be here.

1019
01:18:16,453 --> 01:18:18,253
<i>Do you want some tea?</i>

1020
01:18:18,255 --> 01:18:19,354
No, I don't want some tea.

1021
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:23,724
I want some respect
in my own home.

1022
01:18:59,122 --> 01:19:01,222
Mom,

1023
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:07,260
Mom, who was that?

1024
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:10,029
Her boyfriend is picking her up.

1025
01:19:10,031 --> 01:19:11,730
He's at the gate,
I told him to come and get her.

1026
01:19:18,202 --> 01:19:20,503
Shiva, get dressed.

1027
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,271
We've got to get out of here.

1028
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:23,505
What's going on?

1029
01:19:23,507 --> 01:19:24,572
Cody's here.

1030
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:27,074
What?

1031
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:30,443
Oh, shit.

1032
01:19:30,445 --> 01:19:32,411
Oh, shit.

1033
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:35,714
No, no, no.

1034
01:19:38,017 --> 01:19:39,017
<i>You should be
with your boyfriend,</i>

1035
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:40,785
<i>You should go home.</i>

1036
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:45,320
Hello?

1037
01:19:47,122 --> 01:19:49,123
I know.
I'm sorry.

1038
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,794
I'm sorry.

1039
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,233
<i>Okay. Okay.
I'm coming!</i>

1040
01:20:01,235 --> 01:20:03,335
- Mom, call the police.
- - No, please.

1041
01:20:03,337 --> 01:20:06,137
- Call the police.
- - Please don't call the police.

1042
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:07,671
I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

1043
01:20:07,673 --> 01:20:09,806
Mom, why the fuck
did you let him in here?

1044
01:20:09,808 --> 01:20:11,307
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

1045
01:20:11,309 --> 01:20:13,442
I'm going, okay?

1046
01:20:17,514 --> 01:20:19,347
I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

1047
01:20:19,349 --> 01:20:21,449
<i>Stop fucking around,
the game's over.</i>

1048
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:24,552
- <i>Let's go</i> home.
- - Your daughter's amazing.

1049
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:27,087
<i>I'm coming!</i>

1050
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:39,664
<i>Shiva!</i>

1051
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:41,699
Trust me.

1052
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:43,567
<i>I swear to god,
I'm gonna count to ten,</i>

1053
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:45,201
<i>And then I'm gonna kick
the fucking door in,</i>

1054
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:46,235
<i>You understand?</i>

1055
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:49,304
<i>One...</i>

1056
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:50,306
<i>Two...</i>

1057
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:52,774
I love you.

1058
01:20:52,776 --> 01:20:55,777
<i>Three...</i>

1059
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:57,245
<i>Four...</i>

1060
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:01,081
<i>Five...</i>

1061
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,083
<i>Six...</i>

1062
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:05,517
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

1063
01:21:05,519 --> 01:21:07,719
I'm fucking
coming Cody, shut up!

1064
01:21:14,726 --> 01:21:16,258
I don't know why
you are so attached to her,

1065
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,425
I really don't.

1066
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:23,363
We shouldn't
have to deal with it,

1067
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:25,498
She is not our family.

1068
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,832
- Get off me!
- Get in the...

1069
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:28,867
Get off me!

1070
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:30,535
Ah! Ah!

1071
01:21:30,537 --> 01:21:32,236
Fuck...

1072
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:33,870
Get off...

1073
01:21:35,874 --> 01:21:37,573
Get off me!

1074
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:43,311
Oh that's cute.
What are you gonna do?

1075
01:21:43,313 --> 01:21:44,645
Are you gonna fucking shoot me?

1076
01:21:44,647 --> 01:21:46,513
I love you, you stupid fuck.

1077
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:48,248
I ain't done with you.

1078
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:52,351
Are you trying to kill me?

1079
01:21:52,353 --> 01:21:54,319
Are you trying to fucking
kill me, you bitch?

1080
01:21:54,321 --> 01:21:55,520
You wanna shoot me?

1081
01:21:55,522 --> 01:21:58,389
After everything I've fucking...

1082
01:21:59,558 --> 01:22:03,326
Cody, get off her.

1083
01:22:03,328 --> 01:22:04,860
Go fuck yourself.
Shut the fuck up!

1084
01:22:04,862 --> 01:22:08,530
I said, get off!

1085
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,133
Are what the fuck
you gonna do about it?

1086
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,734
Huh?
Are you gonna shoot me?

1087
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,638
You know what she is, right?

1088
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,206
She's a fucking whore...

1089
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,507
Oh!

1090
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:27,279
You fucking bitch.

1091
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:31,883
Shiva is free.

1092
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:35,419
You are never gonna
see her again.

1093
01:22:35,421 --> 01:22:36,786
Say it.

1094
01:22:40,157 --> 01:22:42,591
Shiva is free.

1095
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:46,795
You know what?
Go fuck...
