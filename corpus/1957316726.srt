1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,200
AND WHAT A DAY FOR THE 3RD
GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES.

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,200
CLEAR SKIES, MID 70'S,

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
58,000 EXPECTED
AT THE STADIUM.

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,400
SO TELL YOUR BOSS
TO LET YOU GET OFF EARLY.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,000
TELL HIM I SAID SO.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
NAN CALLAHAN,
K.J.M.C. F.M., 102.6.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,600
SPEAKING OF TRAFFIC,

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,800
THAT BAY BRIDGE CONGESTION
HAS CLEARED UP.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
SO WE'RE GOING OVER
TO OAKLAND TO CHECK OUT

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
A FENDER-BENDER
ON INTERSTATE 880.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
HOLD ON!
HOLD ON!

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,200
HE HAS THE BALL!

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
CATHY, SPEED IT UP.

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,200
DADDY SAYS I CAN GO
TO THE TOP TODAY.

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,400
PASTOR, IT'S SO DANGEROUS
UP THERE WITH THE WIND.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT UNTIL
THE BUILDING'S FINISHED.

17
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
PETRA,
IT'S ONLY CONCRETE.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
HE'LL HAVE
A HARD HAT ON.

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
COME ON.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
IT'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE OF MINUTES

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
ON THE WAY TO THE DENTIST.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
MAMA, I'M BIG.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
OK.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
JULIO, DON'T GO
NEAR THE EDGE, OK?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
STAY 10 FEET BACK.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
PRINCESS!

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,600
LOOK AT YOU!

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,800
YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
THANK YOU,
DADDY.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
WHAT TIME IS
CATHY'S APPOINTMENT?

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
3:30.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
YOU GUYS COME STRAIGHT
HOME FROM SCHOOL.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK.
I GOT TO GO.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THEY'RE GONNA PAINT
THAT CONCRETE PURPLE
IF I'M NOT WATCHING.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
PASTOR, NO!

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
THOSE ARE FOR CATHY
FOR SCHOOL.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME MORE
FOR THE GAME.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
BYE, KIDS.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
HI, PETRA.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
HELLO, DONNA.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
PASTOR.

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
YES, PETRA?

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
NO, NO,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
I MEAN,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
BUT I GOT
A SATURDAY JOB.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
NOT CLEANING HOUSES?

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
IT'S JUST ONE HOUSE.
AND IT'S
A VERY SMALL HOUSE.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
IT ONLY TAKES
4 HOURS.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
I MAKE ENOUGH MONEY.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
I KNOW.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,800
BUT YOU SAID YOURSELF
WE COULD USE SOME SAVINGS.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
NO, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL
BE THERE FOR THE KIDS,

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
OK?

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,400
WE'LL BE THERE AT 3:30, OK?

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
THAT EARLIER ACCIDENT
HAS NOW BEEN CLEARED.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
MINOR DAMAGE,
NO INJURIES REPORTED

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
AND TRAFFIC IS ONCE AGAIN
FLOWING FAIRLY EASILY
THROUGH THIS SECTION.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
THERE ARE THE USUAL
DELAYS, HOWEVER,

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
GETTING ONTO
THE BAY BRIDGE.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAD
OVER DOWNTOWN OAKLAND,

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
AND WE'LL CHECK BACK
WITH YOU SHORTLY.

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
IN THE MEANTIME, RELAX AND
ENJOY THE MORNING COMMUTE

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,800
WITH K.J.M.C. F.M., 102.6.

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
A CONTAMINATED VEHICLE.

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
SMELLS LIKE BENZENE
TO ME.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
TELL THAT FOOL
OF A DRIVER

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,400
HE ISN'T BUDGING
TILL WE AIR OUT
THAT BENZENE BUILDUP.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
AND CALL SECURITY
AND HAVE THEM OPEN THIS UP.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
NO, TO HELL WITH IT.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
BUCK, THAT
COULD BLOW YOU
TO KINGDOM COME.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
MARK.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL?

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
WELL, I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO SAY HELLO
IF YOU'RE SKIPPING.

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
DAD, WAIT A SEC.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,400
NAM ET IPSA SCIENTIA
POTESTAS EST.

79
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
YEAH, I KNOW.
"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER."

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
LOOK, DAD, I CAME DOWN HERE
BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
I WANT YOU TO GET ME INTO
THE LONGSHOREMEN.

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
HOLD UP.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
YOU'RE GETTING EDUCATED
SO THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS KIND OF WORK.

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,000
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
2 DEGREES?

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
YOU'RE STILL WORKING DOWN
ON THE DOCKS.

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
THE ONLY PLACE I CAN MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY

87
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200
TO KEEP
5 PEOPLE AFLOAT.

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
SO WHY DENY YOUR SON
ALL THAT MONEY-MAKING
POTENTIAL?

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
COME ON. WHAT KIND OF LIFE
IS THIS? LIVING IN A JUNK VAN

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
AND COMMUTING HOME
ON WEEKENDS?

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
I'M GONNA BE SMARTER
THAN THAT.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,600
I'M NOT GONNA PARK
MY FAMILY 6 HOURS AWAY
IN THE BOONDOCKS.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,200
BESIDES, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WANTING TO BE
LIKE YOUR OLD MAN?

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,800
SO HOW COME YOU NEED
MONEY ALL OF A SUDDEN?

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
DAD, I'M ENGAGED.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
OH, MARK...

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HER.

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
SHE'S GORGEOUS
AND REAL SWEET.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,200
I'LL FINISH SCHOOL
AND I'LL GRADUATE,
I PROMISE.

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
GOING TO HELP ME?

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
THINK FAST, ALL RIGHT?

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
HEY, IF YOU'VE BEEN
WALKING IN BENZENE,

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
I'M TAKING
MY OLD BOOTS BACK.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,800
HEY, IF YOU'D
STUDIED CHEMISTRY,

106
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
YOU'D KNOW THAT
BENZENE EVAPORATES.

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
YOLANDA,
YOU ARE NOT DRESSED YET?

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,600
IT'S ALMOST 3:00.
COME ON. LOOK ALIVE.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
QUIT WORRYING.
I'M OK.

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
POR FAVOR, GET YOUR PURSE.

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
YOU'LL BE BETTER
IF YOU COME WITH ME.

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A BLAST.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
A BLAST?
YES.

114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
FIRST WE'RE GOING TO
PASTOR'S CONSTRUCTION SITE

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO THE DENTIST.

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
THE TICKETS ARE FREE.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
JULIO, STOP!

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
JULIO! CATHY!

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
JUAN'S BEEN GONE
3 MONTHS.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
YOU HAVE TO
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
YOU'VE GOT
3 MINUTES.

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE CAR.

123
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
HELLO?

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
HI, DESIREE.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
OH, DADDY.
GOOD.

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
MY FRIENDS ARE GOING
CAMPING ON SATURDAY.

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
I TOLD THEM
YOU'RE AN EXPERT AT IT.
SO WILL YOU TAKE US?

129
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,400
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T TELL YOU
I'M NOT COMING HOME
NEXT WEEKEND?

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
YOU ALWAYS COME.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
WELL, MOM WANTED
SOME TIME ALONE.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED
TIME TO THINK.

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S ALWAYS--

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,800
NOW, HONEY,
DON'T CRITICIZE HER.

135
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
SHE'S GOT TO DO WHAT
SHE'S GOT TO DO,

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
JUST LIKE ALL OF US.

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
WHY DID YOU LET HER
THROW YOU OUT

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
TELL YOU WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
I'LL WRITE YOU A
LONG LETTER TONIGHT,

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
TRY AND MAKE SOME SENSE
OUT OF THIS CRAZY
SITUATION FOR YOU.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

144
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
IT'S WHAT
KEEPS ME GOIN'.

145
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
GIVE MY LOVE TO JEFF.

146
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,600
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DES?

147
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,000
DAD'S NOT COMING
HOME NEXT WEEKEND.

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
GOOD. WE'LL GET
GRILLED ON HISTORY.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
YOU'RE SO STUPID!

150
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
DES.

151
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
DESIREE.

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
CAN'T YOU
TAKE A JOKE?

153
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
DAD'S COOL, OK?

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
SLOW DOWN! YOU GOT
WORLD SERIES FEVER?

155
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
PASTOR.

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
HEY!

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
LISTEN, PETRA SAYS
TO TELL YOU TO MAKE IT QUICK
OR SHE'LL BE LATE,

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
AND DON'T FORGET
10 FEET.

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
10 FEET.

161
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,600
DADDY MADE THIS
WHOLE BUILDING,
UNCLE TONY.

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,400
ONLY THE CEMENT PARTS,
AND I NEEDED A LOT OF HELP.

163
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

164
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
HE'S THE BRAINS
BEHIND THE OPERATION.

165
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
IF YOUR BOSS HASN'T
LET YOU OFF EARLY,

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
IT'S TIME TO GIVE HIM
SOME SERIOUS GRIEF.

167
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
RIGHT NOW
WE ARE JUST OVER...

168
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
YOU RIG THAT?

169
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
FINISH THAT SECTION
AND YOU CAN ALL TAKE OFF.

170
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
JULIO AND I WILL TOP OFF
THE BUILDING BY OURSELVES.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
HERE YOU GO, CHICO!

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
THANKS, UNCLE TONY.

173
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,000
THAT EARLIER SIG ALERT
HAS NOW BEEN CANCELLED.

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
I CAN REPORT THAT THE TRAFFIC
ON THE BAY BRIDGE

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
IS SURPRISINGLY LIGHT FOR
A WORLD SERIES RUSH HOUR.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
I GUESS ALL YOU FANS
ARE ALREADY AT
CANDLESTICK PARK, HUH?

177
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
FOR THOSE OF YOU
JUST LEAVING WORK,

178
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
PLEASE REMEMBER
TO KEEP IT COOL, OK?

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,000
SO ALL OF US BASEBALL FANS
CAN GET TO THE GAME SAFELY.

180
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING,

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,000
MOVING THE FAMILY
OUT OF THIS CRIME-INFESTED
CITY TO THE COUNTRY.

182
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
LAURIE KEPT WANTING
TO HAVE MORE SPACE,

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
SO I GAVE HER MORE SPACE.

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,800
NOW SHE WANTS MORE SPACE.

185
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO HER,
SHE'LL JUST TAKE IT.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,600
SHE ALREADY HAS.
WE'RE LEGALLY SEPARATED.

187
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,200
WELL, LOOK, LIKE THEY SAY,
IT ISN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER.

188
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
COME WATCH THE GAME.

189
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,200
WE'LL THROW SOME
BEER AND LASAGNA
AT THAT MOOD OF YOURS.

190
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
OH. THANKS, ANYWAY,

191
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
BUT I HAVE TO GO
TO THE LIBRARY.

192
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
I'VE GOT
A VERY IMPORTANT
LETTER TO WRITE.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,800
NO-FATHER GREG.

194
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
SAY HELLO, DAD.

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
THE ONLY TIME YOU SAY HELLO
IS WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
NOT TO FIGHT.

198
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
JUST...

199
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T BELIEVE

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
I'M GOING
TO PAY YOU BACK.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
WHY WOULD I BELIEVE YOU
THIS TIME?

202
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
LOOK, IT'S JUST
FOR A WEEK OR SO.

203
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
JUST TIDE ME OVER
TILL I GET A NEW JOB.

204
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
WILL 100 BUCKS
KILL YOU?

205
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
GREG,

206
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,600
THE WELL IS DRY.

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
50?

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
50 BUCKS.

209
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
MAMA, WHEN'S
MY TURN?

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
AN HOUR AGO.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
EXCUSE ME, COULD I CALL
MY HUSBAND, PLEASE?

212
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,000
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I'M HAVING A BLAST.

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,000
HELLO? HELLO?

214
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
THEY'RE CALLING THIS
BAY'S BALL HERE.

215
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
YOU'RE GOING TO
KILL THEM, CANSECO.

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,800
GAME 3 OF
THE 1989 WORLD SERIES.

217
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
BASEBALL HASN'T BEEN
A SUBWAY SERIES

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,600
SINCE THE NEW YORK YANKEES
PLAYED THE BROOKLYN
DODGERS IN 1956.

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
WELL, THE GIANTS ARE DOWN
TWO GAMES TO NONE.

220
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU'RE GONNA
KILL 'EM, CANSECO.

221
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
I'LL EVEN DRIVE YOU BACK
AFTER THE GAME.

222
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
THIS FIRST.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THE AMERICAN LEAGUE
CHAMPION OAKLAND ATHLETICS'

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
LEAD-OFF BATTER
IS NUMBER 24,

225
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
LEFT FIELDER
RICKEY HENDERSON.

226
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
I'M GONNA MISS
THE OPENING PITCH.

227
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
WE'LL BE HOME SOON.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
NUMBER ONE!
NUMBER ONE!

229
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
HOLD ON!

230
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
THIS IS DEFINITELY
AN EARTHQUAKE.

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WE'RE DEFINITELY
IN THE MIDST OF...

232
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
THERE'S PANIC IN THE STADIUM.

233
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
IT'S OK.

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
GET OUT OF HERE!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OUTSIDE! COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
COME ON, GUYS!

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
CALVIN, GET THE GUYS OVER
TO THE LUMBER YARD.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,600
BRING BACK FORK LIFTS,
LADDERS, WHATEVER
GETS US UP THERE.

239
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,400
FRANK, IT'S LIKE 40 FEET.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,200
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
IT'S IN OUR LAP!

241
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
FRANK!

242
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
LET'S GET GOING, GUYS.

243
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

244
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
QUICK, QUICK,
GET THE LADDER.

245
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,800
FRANK, YOU HAVE
A WIFE AND BABY!

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
CALL HER AND TELL HER
I'M OK!

247
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
FRANK, DON'T BE
A DAMN FOOL!

248
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
WE'RE GETTING A SIGNAL--

249
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,200
LET'S GO.

250
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
SHELLY COULDN'T
MAKE IT ACROSS TOWN.

251
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
YOU'RE DOING
ON-CAMERA.

252
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I'M RADIO!

253
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,400
YOU'RE NOT
FINISHED YET.

254
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
TIME TO SHOW
YOUR PRETTY FACE,
NANAHAN.

255
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
NAN CALLAHAN!

256
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
I HATE WHEN YOU
CALL ME NANAHAN.

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
OF CONFUSION HERE

258
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
WITH SOME DAMAGE
TO THE STATION. TO REPEAT,

259
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE STRUCK
THE BAY AREA MINUTES AGO,

260
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,600
LASTING APPROXIMATELY
8 TO 10 SECONDS.

261
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,400
NAN CALLAHAN OF K.J.M.C.
AIRBORNE OVER OAKLAND,

262
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
WHERE IT APPEARS
THERE'S BEEN DAMAGE

263
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
TO INTERSTATE 880.

264
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

265
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
IS EVERYBODY FINE?

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
OH, GOOD.

267
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,400
LISTEN, ROSA, DID THAT
SISTER OF YOURS STOP BY?

268
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M SURE PETRA'S FINE.

269
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
I'LL HAVE HER CALL YOU
WHEN SHE GETS IN.

270
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
OK.

271
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,200
THIS IS MAJOR, MAJOR DAMAGE,

272
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,600
JUST AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT.

273
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,800
IT LOOKS AS IF

274
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
THE FREEWAY'S UPPER LEVEL JUST
SHOOK LOOSE

275
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,400
AND SLAMMED DOWN
ONTO THE LOWER DECK,
SECTION BY SECTION.

276
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
YOLANDA.

277
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
THIS IS INTERSTATE 880
IN OAKLAND,

278
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
JUST SOUTH OF THE BAY BRIDGE.

279
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,800
THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY
PEOPLE HURT

280
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
AND POSSIBLY DEAD
DOWN THERE.

281
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
HEY! HEY, OVER HERE!

282
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
I CAN'T GET DOWN!

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
HANG ON!
JUST HANG ON!

284
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,600
IT'LL BE OK!
CALVIN, HURRY UP!

285
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
DON'T MOVE, BUDDY!
THAT COPTER'S COMING
TO SAVE YOU!

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
THERE ARE PEOPLE DOWN HERE.

287
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,800
IT'S T.V. NEWS.

289
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,000
YOU CAN SEE THE ENTIRE LENGTH
OF THE DOUBLE-DECK STRUCTURE

290
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
APPEARS TO BE LITERALLY
SANDWICHED TOGETHER.

291
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
ANYBODY HEAR ME?

292
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
ANYBODY HEAR ME?

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,800
IS ANYBODY-- ANYBODY
IN THERE? HUH? ANY...

294
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
HELLO?

295
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
HELLO.

296
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

297
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,800
OH, MY GOD.

298
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
HELLO?

299
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,600
HELLO?

300
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
HANG ON!

301
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,800
DON'T DO
NOTHING STUPID!

302
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
HOLD ON.

303
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I'M LOSING MY GRIP!
MY FINGERS ARE SLIPPING!

304
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
HANG ON, MAN.
HELP'S ON THE WAY.

305
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,800
I CAN'T HANG ON.

306
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
HELP!

307
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
I'M GOING TO FALL!

308
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
GOD, I HOPE
NOBODY'S IN THERE!

309
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,000
HELLO? IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

310
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
IS ANYBODY--ANYBODY...

311
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
ANYBODY?

312
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,000
ANYBODY--ANYBODY
IN THERE? ANY...

313
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
ARE YOU THERE?
ARE YOU--ARE YOU THERE?

314
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
OH, GOD.

315
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
NOW WE'RE OVER SAN FRANCISCO'S
MARINA DISTRICT

316
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,800
WHERE A MASSIVE FIRE
HAS BROKEN OUT.

317
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,800
FLAMES APPEAR TO BE
SHOOTING AT LEAST
200 FEET IN THE AIR,

318
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
AND I'M TOLD THE WATER MAINS
DOWN HERE ARE BROKEN.

319
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,600
DID MY SISTER CALL?

320
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,200
NO, ROSA, BUT SHE WILL.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
APPARENTLY, OFFICIALS ARE
TRYING TO PUMP SEA WATER

322
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
FROM THE BAY UP HERE.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO
LET IT WORRY US.

324
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
NO WAY.

325
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
SHE'LL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

326
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,200
THESE WERE 3 AND 4 STORY
APARTMENT BUILDINGS.

327
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
SHE LEFT THAT
CASSEROLE OUT.

328
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
WELL, THEY'RE GOING
TO BE HUNGRY.

329
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
LET'S WARM IT UP, OK?

330
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

331
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,800
THE QUAKE LITERALLY
SHOOK IT OFF ITS FOUNDATION.

332
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,600
IT SLUMPED RIGHT
INTO THE STREET.

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
SHE HAD TO COME HOME
ON THE 880.

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
PASTOR,

335
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,600
I TRIED TO PRAY,
BUT I COULDN'T.

336
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
THE WORDS WOULDN'T COME.

337
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
I CAN SEE A FEW PEOPLE
ACTUALLY CLIMBING BACK

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
INTO BUILDINGS
NOT ON FIRE,

339
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,200
OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES INSIDE.

340
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
IT'S STILL VERY DANGEROUS
IN THIS AREA.

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
HURRY UP.
YEAH.

342
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,800
YOU SEE ANYTHING
UP HERE?

343
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
SEE ANYTHING?

344
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
SARGE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
IS TAKING COMMAND.

345
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,200
NOW, LOOK,
I'M GONNA MOVE A LOT OF
HEAVY EQUIPMENT IN HERE.

346
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,800
MOVE ALL CIVILIANS
WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY ASSISTING
IN THE RESCUE

347
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
AND SECURE
THE PERIMETER NOW.

348
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
CHIEF NAVARRO,

349
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
DID YOU ORDER THE UNIT
FROM HIGHLAND HOSPITAL?

350
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,200
YOU CAPTAIN SCHAFFER?

351
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
I'M DR. SCOTT,
THIS IS DR. GREEN.

352
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
YOU NEEDED
A TRIAGE UNIT?

353
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
YEAH. I'LL SET
YOU UP OVER THERE.

354
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,600
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WOUNDED
FROM THE UPPER LEVEL
AS WELL AS FROM THE GROUND.

355
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
RON?
JIM.

356
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

357
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
I GOT TO GET UP THERE
TO BEGIN A PRIMARY SEARCH.

358
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,800
I'M NOT LETTING YOU UP
UNTIL I'VE MET WITH
THE CALTRANS ENGINEERS.

359
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
YOU KNOW FULLY WELL
THERE'S GOING TO BE
AFTER-SHOCKS.

360
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

361
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
THE TREMOR REGISTERED
AT LEAST 7.

362
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,800
YOU THINK ANYBODY'S
COMING OUT OF THERE ALIVE?

363
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
ONE WOULD BE A MIRACLE.

364
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
HELLO.

365
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,200
ANYBODY?

366
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
ANYBODY HERE?

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
IS ANYBODY HERE?

368
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,000
OH, MY GOD.

369
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
HOW YOU DOING,
SWEETHEART?

370
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,400
NOT SO GOOD, HUH?

371
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,800
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE FINE.

372
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,400
MY NAME'S FRANK,

373
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,000
AND I'M GOING TO GO
AND GET SOME HELP
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,

374
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
SO YOU JUST KEEP THOSE
PRETTY EYES OPEN, OK?

375
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
IT'S OK. I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, HONEY.

376
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,200
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

377
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
OK?

378
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
JUST KEEP THEM OPEN.

379
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

380
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
THE FREEWAY SECTIONS ARE
NUMBERED IN ASCENDING ORDER.

381
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
PAINT THE NUMBERS
ON THE COLUMNS

382
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
SO YOU CAN ID THEM MORE EASILY
AS YOU SEARCH FOR SURVIVERS.

383
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
IF NOONE'S ALIVE,
GET A DESCRIPTION OF
EACH CAR'S POSITION

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
RELATIVE TO THE MAP.

385
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,600
GET LICENSE NUMBERS,
LOCATIONS OF BODIES,
IDENTIFIABLE CLOTHING,

386
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,200
ANY DESCRIPTIONS
THAT CAN HELP US.

387
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
HEY!

388
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
HEY!

389
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
OVER HERE!

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,800
QUIET!
EVERYBODY QUIET!

391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
YOU STRANDED?

392
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
YEAH.

393
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
FOUND A CHILD.

394
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,800
SHE'S STUCK
IN A CAR.

395
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ALIVE?

396
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
YEAH.

397
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
LOOKS LIKE
HER PARENTS ARE DEAD.

398
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
SCHAFFER, BETWEEN 76 AND 77.

399
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
GET HIM A PRYING BAR
AND A FIRST AID KIT.

400
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
STAND BY FOR
A RESOURCES ORDER.

401
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
WE'LL BE RIGHT UP.

402
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,400
HERE, CATCH THIS.

403
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,600
NICE CATCH.

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,800
THANK GOD FOR FOOLS.

405
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
HEY, SWEETHEART?

406
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
FRANK'S BACK.

407
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
HEY, IT'S FRANK.

408
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
IT'S FRANK, HONEY.

409
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
THAT'S A GIRL.

410
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
CAN YOU OPEN
YOUR EYES?

411
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
COME ON.

412
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
COME ON,
OPEN YOUR EYES.

413
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
COME ON, HONEY.

414
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,400
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S GOOD.

415
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
NOW WE'RE JUST GOING
TO SIT HERE AND--AND TALK

416
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
UNTIL THE RESCUE TEAM
GETS HERE,

417
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
OK?

418
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
CAN YOU TELL ME
YOUR NAME?

419
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
THAT'S--THAT'S OK.

420
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
YOU JUST KEEP BREATHING.

421
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
THAT'S IT.

422
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,000
RESCUE GROUP NICOLA
TO CYPRESS COMMAND.

423
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
TELL CHIEF NAVARRO
I'M ALMOST CERTAIN

424
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,200
NO ONE'S SURVIVED
AT THIS END.

425
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
UPPER LEVEL'S TOTALLY
PANCAKED ON THE LOWER.

426
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
I'M TAKING THE SQUAD
UP TOP.

427
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
ARE YOU OK?

428
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,400
I WAS LISTENING
TO THIS ON THE RADIO.

429
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
...THIS PRECARIOUS STRUCTURE,

430
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
IT COULD GO AT ANY TIME.

431
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,200
A POLICE LIEUTENANT
IS TELLING US
CARS ON THE LOWER DECK

432
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,400
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
BUMPER-TO-BUMPER.

433
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
GUYS.

434
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,600
GUYS, I THINK
YOU COULD USE
A BREAK FROM THIS.

435
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
WHAT?

436
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
YOU DON'T THINK
MARK'S IN THERE OR DAD?

437
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,800
THEY COULD BE, MOTHER.

438
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
THEY'D HAVE CALLED.

439
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
TURN IT ON.

440
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,200
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF
PHONE LINES DOWN.

441
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,200
LET'S NOT MAKE
OURSELVES CRAZY, OK?

442
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,600
THINK. MARK'S CAMPUS
IS NOWHERE NEAR THE 880.

443
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,400
AND I'M SURE
YOUR DAD'S SITTING
ON THAT OLD VAN WRITING.

444
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
THROW DADDY OUT?

445
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
HE MIGHT BE HERE SAFE.

446
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
DESIREE,
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

447
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
I'M SORRY.

448
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,000
IT'S OK.

449
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
DAD'S NEVER HOME
TUESDAYS ANYWAY.

450
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
AND WE BOTH KNOW HE'S
TOO CRANKY TO GO YOUNG.

451
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
IT'S A JOKE, DESIREE.

452
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
YOU'RE BOTH BEING SILLY.

453
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,200
CAN WE TURN IT ON NOW?

454
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
SURE.

455
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,000
...CLIMBING IN BETWEEN
THE SECTIONS SEARCHING
FOR ANYONE

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,600
WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED
IN THERE.

457
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
BUT THE POLICE OFFICER
TELLS ME

458
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
THERE ARE DEFINITELY--
THAT'S A QUOTE--

459
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
DEFINITELY DEAD PEOPLE
IN THE MIDDLE.

460
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,200
OK, CAPTAIN, I'VE SENT
THE GUYS OVER TO 101.

461
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
NEW CREW'S GOING TO 100.

462
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?

463
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
TAKE A COUPLE OF GUYS
AND CHECK OUT
THAT UPPER LEVEL.

464
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
OK, YOU GOT IT.

465
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,600
HEY, CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

466
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,600
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

467
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,600
IS ANYBODY THERE?

468
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,200
HELP.

469
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
HELP.

470
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,800
HELP.

471
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
BOB. BOB, IF YOU WANT US
TO GET TO THE GROUND,

472
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,200
WE'LL DO IT.

473
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,400
BUT WE'RE GETTING
GREAT STUFF OUT HERE.

474
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT,

475
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,200
BUT WE HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE
OUR FORCES AND WORK FASTER

476
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
IF WE'RE GOING TO
FIND ANY SURVIVORS.

477
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
EVERYBODY'S PITCHING IN,

478
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
AND THANK GOD
THE CASUALTIES SO FAR
ARE FEW.

479
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
BOTH FROM THE FREEWAY
AND SURROUNDING AREAS.

480
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
WITH THE BRIDGE DOWN,

481
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,600
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET
ANY HELP FROM ACROSS THE BAY,

482
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,400
SO IT'S ALL UP TO US.

483
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,000
SCHAFFER. SCHAFFER!
STOP! THERE'S GAS!

484
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
OK, OK.

485
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I'M GONNA TRY
THE CROWBAR.

486
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,400
ALL RIGHT.

487
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
HOW MUCH LONGER?
YOU GETTING CLOSE?

488
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,800
COME ON,
COME ON.

489
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
OK. WE'RE GOING IN.

490
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,800
WE'RE IN!

491
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,800
OK, OK. WE'LL HAVE HER
OUT IN NO TIME.

492
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
UH, ANYTHING I CAN DO?

493
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
SCRAM.

494
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,400
YOU'RE A GUTSY GUY,
BUT YOU'RE IN THE WAY HERE.

495
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,800
GOT TO GO NOW,
HONEY.

496
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
YOU'RE DOING
JUST GREAT.

497
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
THAT'S A GIRL.

498
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
WE'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

499
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
IT'S OK. WE'LL TAKE OVER
FROM HERE.

500
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,600
WAIT. THERE'S
ANOTHER KID IN HERE.

501
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
IT'S A BOY.

502
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
HE'S ALIVE.

503
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
JIM?

504
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,400
I'M NEEDED
AT THE 880 COLLAPSE.

505
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
THEY TOLD ME THE CHIEF
OF SURGERY--

506
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
KEVIN SCOTT
ASKED FOR ME.

507
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,800
A CHILD IS PINNED
BETWEEN LAYERS.

508
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
YOU'RE NOT GOD,
YOU KNOW.

509
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
I LIVE WITH YOU.
I'M THE ONE WHO
KNOWS THAT FOR SURE.

510
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,600
I'M MORTAL AS HELL.

511
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,800
I GOTTA GO.

512
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,000
THIS IS DON DELGADO,
K.N.K.I. E.
AT THE 14TH STREET EXIT

513
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
OF INTERSTATE 880,

514
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,800
WHERE A RESCUE WORKER
IS DESCENDING

515
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,200
FROM THE CRUSHED
LOWER LEVEL OF THE FREEWAY.

516
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,600
WE'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD
FROM GROUND WORKERS

517
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,000
THAT AT LEAST ONE CHILD
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED ALIVE,

518
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
THOUGH APPARENTLY,
BOTH PARENTS ARE DEAD.

519
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
THE CHILD IS SAID TO BE
A GIRL OF ASIAN DESCENT.

520
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,800
ONCE AGAIN,
A CHILD FOUND ALIVE IN 880.

521
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
EVERYONE, STAY BACK.

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
PLEASE, LET'S KEEP
THIS AREA CLEAR.

523
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,600
SORRY, MA'AM, WE HAVE
NO INFORMATION
AT THIS TIME.

524
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
THIS THE RIGHT
PLACE?

525
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
TWO KIDS TRAPPED
IN A CAR?

526
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,000
YEAH, ONE OF THEM
IS ABOUT TO COME DOWN.

527
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
I WAS JUST UP THERE
WITH THEM.

528
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

529
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,600
THE MOTHER'S DEAD

530
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
AND THE DRIVER'S CRUSHED
BEYOND RECOGNITION.

531
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I WORKED WITH DR. SCOTT
ON THE RUNWAY CRASH.

532
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,600
HE'S, UH-- IF ANYONE CAN
HELP THEM, IT'S HIM.

533
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
DR. BETZ.

534
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,200
JIM MENDONSA.

535
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I CAN SEND YOU UP
AS SOON AS THE GIRL
COMES DOWN.

536
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
NO, NO, IT'S OK.

537
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,800
I NEED THE EXERCISE.

538
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
OK.

539
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,600
TELL 'EM FRANK SAID
TO HANG IN THERE.

540
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
LET ME KNOW
WHEN HE'S UP TOP.

541
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
OK. GOOD.

542
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE IT EASY. EASY.

543
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE WANT TO BE REAL CAREFUL.

544
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
ALL RIGHT,
HERE SHE COMES.

545
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,400
KEEP IT STEADY.

546
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT HER.

547
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,000
GOT HER.

548
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,000
WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE. THAT'S OK.

549
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,600
JIM. THANK GOD.

550
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
MAMA!

551
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
MAMA!

552
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,000
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO AMPUTATE
HIS RIGHT LEG.

553
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,200
MUST BE 100 TONS
PUSHING DOWN,

554
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,200
JAMMING
THE WOMAN'S BODY
ON TOP OF HIS LEG.

555
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
WHAT ABOUT THE LEFT?

556
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
YOU DECIDE.

557
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,800
3 OF THE
CONCRETE CAPLETS

558
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
STUCK UNDER
THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

559
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,600
WE'RE TRYING
TO JACK IT UP.

560
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,000
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

561
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
I'LL HAVE
THAT OXYGEN NOW.

562
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600
THE SEDATIVE SHOULD
CALM HIM DOWN.

563
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
MAMA! MAMA!

564
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
MAMA.

565
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
...SAYING THAT 53 ARE DEAD,
400 ARE INJURED...

566
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
DES, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TURN IT OFF

567
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,400
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
GET THIS UPSET.

568
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
DON DELGADO
IS AT THE SITE.

569
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
DON, WHAT CAN YOU SEE?

570
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
HELLO.

571
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,200
CHICAGO?

572
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,200
WHAT IS IT, DES?

573
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,200
DADDY'S INSULIN IS
PROBABLY IN THE VAN.

574
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,400
EVEN IF
THEY FIND HIM--

575
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,000
THANK YOU.

576
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

577
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,800
YOUR BROTHER
COULDN'T GET THROUGH
TO US,

578
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,600
SO HE CALLED A FRIEND
IN CHICAGO TO LET US
KNOW THAT HE'S OK.

579
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
MARK OR GREG?

580
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,400
MARK.

581
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
GREG'S STILL IN NEVADA
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

582
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,000
LET'S HOPE
HE STAYS THERE.

583
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
JEFF.

584
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
HE JUST
CAUSES TROUBLE
WHEN HE'S HOME.

585
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
HE'S STILL YOUR BROTHER.

586
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
THE FIRE IS STILL
RAGING OUT OF CONTROL.

587
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,400
THAT'S A BUILDING
THAT THE FIRE FIGHTERS
HAVE ESTIMATED...

588
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

589
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE IT EASY.

590
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,200
YOU WANT TO BE
REAL CAREFUL.

591
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,800
HERE'S WHAT WE DO
WHEN WE GET DOWN.

592
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
YOU PASS THE CASE,
I'LL TAKE THE I.V.
HERE WE GO.

593
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
OK, 1, 2, 3,
UP WE GO.

594
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
ALL RIGHT, CAREFUL.
EASY.

595
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,800
HOW IS SHE?

596
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
SHE HAD TO BE
INTUBATED,

597
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,200
BUT WE'RE HOPIN'.

598
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,800
WHAT ABOUT THE BOY?

599
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
THEY'RE DOING
EVERYTHING THEY CAN.

600
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,600
WE'LL LOOK AFTER HER, PAL.
DON'T WORRY.

601
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
LET'S GO.

602
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,200
HOW'S THE GIRL?

603
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,000
IS THE BOY ALIVE?

604
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
CAN YOU NAME
ALL THE DOCTORS?

605
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
THE YOUNG WOMAN
YOU SAW...

606
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
I'M REPORTING
LIVE...

607
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
FROM THE MILE AND HALF OF
A CONCRETE TUBE
IS SAID TO BE ALIVE.

608
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,600
EARLIER REPORTS INDICATED
THAT THE GIRL
APPREARED TO BE ASIAN.

609
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,400
ALSO, WORD OF A BOY,
ALSO ASIAN.

610
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
LATINO!

611
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,600
I WAS THERE.
AND THEY'RE
BOTH LATINO.

612
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
WE HAVE JUST HAD
AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT
FROM AN EYEWITNESS

613
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
THAT BOTH CHILDREN
ARE LATINO.

614
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
IT DOESN'T MEAN--

615
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
I CAN'T STAY.

616
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,600
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH,
PASTOR. I HAVE FAITH.

617
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,000
OK, YOU STAY
IN CASE THEY CALL.

618
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'LL CALL YOU FROM...
I'LL CALL YOU FROM EVERYWHERE.

619
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
THAT'S WHERE THE YOUNG GIRL
WAS BEING WHEELED FIRST.

620
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
WE'LL TRY AND GET A REPORT
FROM THERE SOON.

621
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,400
IT'S TAKING SO LONG
TO EXTRICATE THESE VICTIMS

622
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,000
BECAUSE RESCUERS
HAVE VERY LITTLE ROOM
TO MANEUVER...

623
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
MAMA.

624
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I CAN'T GET
THE BOY'S LEG OUT

625
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
WITHOUT MOVING THE BODY.

626
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,000
SHAFFER, WHAT'S THE CHANCE
OF MOVING THIS BODY
OUT OF THE WAY?

627
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
SNOWBALL IN HELL.
OR WORSE.

628
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,200
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT DIVIDING THE BODY?

629
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'VE TRIED NOT TO.

630
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

631
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
EASY WITH IT.

632
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
ALL RIGHT.

633
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,600
WHO GETS THIS?

634
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,400
YOU'RE THE CHILD
SPECIALIST.

635
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,800
ALL RIGHT.

636
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
TAKE OFF!

637
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,000
GET YOUR TAIL DOWN!

638
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,600
THE WHOLE THING'S
COMING DOWN!

639
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,000
ALL RESCUE WORKERS ARE
TO CLEAR THE AREA NOW!

640
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,200
CLEAR THE AREA!

641
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
RESCUE WORKERS
ARE TO CLEAR THE AREA!

642
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
CONDITIONS ARE UNSAFE!

643
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
PLEASE! CLEAR THE AREA!

644
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,600
WORKERS FROM SECTION 75
TO 102 MUST CLEAR THE AREA!

645
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
HELP.

646
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
RELAY AND REPEAT:

647
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,000
CLEAR THE AREA!

648
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,600
HELP!

649
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
101'S CLEAR.
HOW'S 100?

650
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
HELP! DOWN HERE!

651
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
100'S CLEAR!

652
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,200
CLEAR THE AREA!

653
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
96 CLEAR!

654
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,800
WORKERS WITH 77!

655
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,400
CLEAR THE AREA!

656
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,600
ALL WORKERS,
CLEAR THE AREA.

657
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
CONDITIONS ARE UNSAFE.

658
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,000
RELAY AND REPEAT!

659
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,200
63 CLEAR!

660
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
64, CLEAR THE AREA.

661
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
ALL WORKERS.

662
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,800
PLEASE, LADY,
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.

663
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
HEY, YOU.

664
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
WAIT. MY DAUGHTER,
MAYBE SHE WAS UP THERE.

665
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,000
WAS SHE THE LITTLE
GIRL ON T.V.?

666
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,400
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PRETTY BUSY HERE.

667
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,800
WAS THERE A BOY
WITH HER?

668
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
I'M SORRY, THERE'S MANY PEOPLE
IN YOUR PREDICAMENT.

669
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,200
TRY THE HOSPITAL.

670
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
HER HUSBAND'S UP THERE.

671
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,600
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US WHERE
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GO?

672
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
HEY, BUDDY, TRY HIGHLAND.
IT'S THE CLOSEST.

673
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO GET HELP,
TO FIND OUT--

674
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.
THE BOY'S DYING.

675
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,400
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.
THE BOY'S DIEING.

677
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
WE CAN'T LIFT UP.

678
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
WE HAVE TO AMPUTATE RIGHT AWAY
IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE HIM.

679
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,000
MAYBE I CAN MOVE
THE DRIVER'S SEAT
FORWARD.

680
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
GIVE ME THE PRY BAR.

681
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,800
I'LL TAKE THIS END.
YOU GO AHEAD.

682
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,200
THIS CAN'T WORK, JIM.

683
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,200
I KNOW.

684
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,800
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

685
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,400
WHAT'S WRONG?

686
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
SOMETHING MOVED.

687
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,800
HOLD ON.

688
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,400
COME ON, COME ON.

689
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,600
OK, I CAN MOVE IT.

690
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,400
HIS LEFT LEG'S FREE.
GO!

691
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,600
HEY, LOOK, I'M GOING TO
DISARTICULATE THE JOINT,

692
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
SO THERE'S NO BONE TO CUT.

693
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,000
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
AN IDEAL MEDICAL FACILITY
FOR AN AMPUTATION.

694
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
GIVE ME THAT SCALPEL.

695
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,000
COME ON. LET'S GO.

696
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,600
COME ON, COME ON.

697
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
COME ON.
HIS PULSE IS DROPPING.

698
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,400
DEAR DESIREE,

699
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,000
I DON'T KNOW
IF THE WORLD HAS ENDED,

700
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,400
IF THERE'S BEEN
A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST,

701
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,600
IF I'M STUCK
IN A BAD DREAM

702
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,200
WITH ALL MY SENSES

703
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,000
CRUELLY AT WORK,
HEARING SIRENS,

704
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,400
SMELLING SMOKE
AND BURNING RUBBER,

705
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TASTING BLOOD AND SWEAT,

706
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,000
AND FEELING...

707
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,800
FEELING DISSIPATED

708
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY.

709
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
ALL I REMEMBER, SWEETHEART,
IS I OWE YOU A LETTER.

710
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,000
I WAS GOING TO WRITE TO YOU
IN THE LIBRARY TONIGHT.

711
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
WELL, I SEEM
TO HAVE STUMBLED

712
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,600
ON THE LIBRARY IN HELL.

713
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,800
THAT'S A JOKE, ISN'T IT?
I DON'T BELIEVE IN HELL

714
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,200
OR HEAVEN.

715
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,600
THIS LETTER'S ABOUT YOU, DES,

716
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,200
AND HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND ME.

717
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,000
I KNOW YOU BLAME HER A LOT,

718
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN BE
A REAL HOTHEAD.

719
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,600
YOU'VE SEEN ME ORDER
YOUR MOTHER AROUND
LIKE A DRILL SERGEANT.

720
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,600
DESIREE, COME AND HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

721
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,200
DINNER'S READY.

722
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,800
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

723
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
LISTEN TO ME.

724
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,000
YOUR FATHER IS NOT DEAD.

725
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,200
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP ACTING
LIKE HE IS, ALL RIGHT?

726
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,600
NO, NO.

727
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
HE COULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN HERE THAT QUICKLY.

728
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,000
THANKS A LOT.

729
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
OH, DES.

730
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,200
HEY, JEFF,
DID DAD CALL?

731
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
NO.

732
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,200
MARK, OH.

733
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,400
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
IN TIME FOR DINNER.

734
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,800
SHE THINKS HE'S DEAD.

735
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,800
THAT'S WHY WE'RE EATING
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

736
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,800
ALL RIGHT, DESIREE,
KNOCK IT OFF.

737
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,200
SHE'S BLAMING ME.

738
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,800
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

739
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,000
TAKE IT EASY, MOM.

740
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,200
STOP TAKING EVERYTHING
SO PERSONALLY.

741
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,200
DESIREE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
STOP YOUR CHILDISH BEHAVIOR

742
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,800
AND HELP YOUR MOTHER
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

743
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
WHY SHOULD I?

744
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,600
BECAUSE I SAID SO.

745
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,200
HEY.
WHO MADE YOU BOSS?

746
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,800
YOU'RE NOT DAD.

747
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT,

748
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
BUT I SAW HIM
ON THE DOCKS
THIS MORNING.

749
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,000
THERE WAS THIS CONTAINER
THAT COULD HAVE EXPLODED.

750
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT HEROIC NUT DID?

751
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,800
TELL US.

752
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,400
MAYBE I WILL

753
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,200
OVER DINNER.

754
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,000
BUT, DES,

755
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,600
DESPITE MY TEMPER,

756
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,400
AND MY IRON HAND,
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE

757
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,800
MY FAMILY
ALWAYS CAME FIRST,

758
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,200
LAST,

759
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,200
AND ALWAYS.

760
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,400
FIRST...

761
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,800
LAST...

762
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
AND ALWAYS.

763
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,800
BULLSHIT, YOU'RE NOT HURT.

764
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,200
PLEASE, GET OUT OF THE WAY
SO WE CAN HELP THOSE
WHO ARE.

765
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,800
MOVE BACK.
MOVE BACK.

766
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,600
LET THIS VEHICLE THROUGH!
STEP ASIDE!

767
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,600
WE DON'T HAVE ANY NAMES YET.
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

768
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,200
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

769
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,400
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE MY LITTLE GIRL WAS
AT THE FREEWAY,

770
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
THEY SENT ME HERE.
SHE'S 8 YEARS OLD.
I'VE GOT A PICTURE.

771
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,400
TRY CHILDRENS.
IT'S A LOGICAL PLACE.

772
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,200
PLEASE, CLEAR THE DRIVE
SO THE AMBULANCE
CAN LEAVE!

773
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,600
COME ON, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

774
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,600
HEMOSTAT.

775
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
OH, I CAN'T...

776
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,600
I CAN'T GET THIS ON

777
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
TO KEEP THE MAIN
ARTERY SHUT.

778
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,200
DAMN.

779
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
YOU WORKING ONE-HANDED?

780
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,600
AH, I GOT TO.

781
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,000
AS SOON AS YOU'RE FREE,
I'LL CLAMP THE ARTERY.

782
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,200
YOU READY
TO WRAP THE LEG?

783
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,800
YEAH.

784
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,200
WIRE BASKET?

785
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,800
SET. EVERYTHING'S SET.

786
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,400
HOW MUCH LONGER?

787
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,800
HANG ON.

788
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,200
WE'RE HANGIN'.
WE'RE HANGIN'.

789
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,200
10 SECONDS.

790
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
YOU READY TO LIFT?

791
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,800
YEAH.

792
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,000
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

793
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,400
GO. GO.

794
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,400
DOCTOR, HOW'S THE BOY?

795
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,800
CRITICAL.

796
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,200
LOOK. PLEASE,
NO QUESTIONS.

797
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,800
WE DON'T KNOW
THE NEXT OF KIN.

798
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,200
UNDERSTAND.

799
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,000
THE MEDIA IS ALL OVER ME.
WHAT CAN I TELL THEM?

800
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,400
WE'RE GOING
INTO SURGERY.
WE'LL HAVE WORD IN AN HOUR.

801
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,200
GOD BLESS HIM.

802
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,800
HE ALREADY HAS,
BELIEVE ME.

803
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
LET ME THROUGH.

804
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
EXCUSE ME.
I'M A DOCTOR.

805
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
YOU WORK FOR DELGADO.

806
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,200
GIVE ME A BREAK, SIR.
HE'S LEANING ON ME
HARD FOR INFORMATION.

807
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,600
HERE'S SOME
HOT INFORMATION.

808
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,000
YOU TRY A STUNT LIKE THIS
AGAIN,

809
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,600
I'LL MAKE
A FORMAL COMPLAINT
TO YOUR NETWORK.

810
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,200
HEY, COME ON NOW.
COME ON.

811
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,600
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU
FOR THE TIME BEING.

812
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,000
AS WE GET INFORMATION,
WE'LL PASS IT ON TO YOU.

813
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,000
CAN YOU
HELP ME, PLEASE?

814
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
CAN--CAN SOMEBODY
HELP ME?

815
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,400
I'M LOOKING FOR 2 KIDS.

816
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,800
ONE IS A GIRL, 8,
AND A BOY, 6.

817
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,200
SIR, SIR.

818
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,600
THEY JUST TOOK
A BOY INSIDE.

819
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
WAS HE ALIVE?

820
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,400
I DON'T KNOW.

821
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,000
I THINK SO.

822
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,200
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?

823
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
OH, MY GOD.
WAIT A SECOND.

824
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,400
STEVE, STEVE,

825
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,800
TAKE THIS MAN INSIDE.

826
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,800
I THINK HE MAY BE
THE FATHER.

827
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,200
CALLAHAN,
WHAT'S THE GUY'S NAME?

828
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,800
UM, I DIDN'T ASK.

829
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,000
YOU WHAT?

830
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,200
YOU HAD TO
BE THERE, OK?

831
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,000
MR. BARUMAN?

832
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,600
MY KIDS?

833
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,800
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
IN ANOTHER FACILITY.

834
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,200
NOTHING
LIFE-THREATENING.

835
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,600
WE'RE ARRANGING
TO HAVE HER
BROUGHT OVER SOON.

836
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,800
OK.

837
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,800
AND JULIO?

838
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,400
HE'S STILL IN SURGERY.

839
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,600
HE MAY BE ALL NIGHT.

840
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,200
I'M AFRAID
HIS CONDITION IS CRITICAL.

841
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,400
HIS RIGHT LEG WAS
AMPUTATED AT THE KNEE,
MR. BARUMAN.

842
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,600
IT--IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO FREE HIM FROM THE CAR.

843
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,800
THEY'RE FIGHTING
TO SAVE THE OTHER LEG.

844
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,800
DR. BETZ
IS OUR TOP SURGEON.

845
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,400
PASTOR!

846
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,400
OUR KIDS ARE ALIVE.

847
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,600
OH, GRACIAS, DIOS.

848
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,000
JULIO'S IN SURGERY,

849
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
SO I'M GOING TO STAY HERE.

850
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,200
WOULD YOU PLEASE
GO TO SEE CATHY?

851
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,800
COULD YOU SHOW HER
WHERE CATHY IS?

852
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,400
YOU BE STRONG FOR CATHY.

853
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,400
OK.
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

854
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
OK.

855
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,600
IN A TRAGIC CONCLUSION
TO LAST NIGHT'S RESCUES,

856
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,200
SURGEONS REVEALED
THEY HAD TO CUT THROUGH
THE BODY OF HIS MOTHER

857
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,600
TO SAVE YOUNG
JULIO BARUMAN'S LIFE.

858
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,800
DR. JAMES BETZ,
CHIEF OF SURGERY...

859
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,800
AMPUTATION BELOW THE KNEE.

860
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,200
IN HORRIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
PETRA BARUMAN...

861
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,600
A TEAM OF SURGEONS
WORKS TIRELESSLY

862
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,400
TO SAVE YOUNG
JULIO BARUMAN'S LEFT LEG.

863
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
HIS RIGHT LEG
WAS AMPUTATED LAST NIGHT

864
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,200
IN GRISLY CIRCUMSTANCES

865
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,400
AS, REPORTEDLY,
HIS MOTHER'S BODY
HAD TO BE DISMEMBERED

866
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,000
FOR SURGEONS
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

867
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,000
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED
AS THE STORY DEVELOPS.

868
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,800
MR. BARUMAN?

869
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,200
MY BOY?

870
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,000
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE HIM PRETTY SOON.

871
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,800
HE'S...

872
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,000
HIS CONDITION
REMAINS CRITICAL.

873
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,200
HIS LEG
HAS A GOOD CHANCE,

874
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,800
BUT WE WON'T KNOW
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

875
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,000
WHAT WAS
YOUR WIFE WEARING?

876
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,400
BLUE.

877
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,800
THIS MORNING
SHE WAS WEARING BLUE.

878
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,000
SHE WAS DRIVING?

879
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
YES.

880
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,000
THE PRESS IS
MISTAKENLY REPORTING

881
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,600
WE HAD TO CUT HER BODY
IN ORDER TO REACH JULIO.

882
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,200
WELL, IT WAS THE OTHER WOMAN,
SHE WAS WEARING
A YELLOW BLOUSE.

883
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,000
YOLANDA.

884
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,400
IF WE WERE GOING TO
SAVE JULIO'S LIFE,
WE HAD TO DO IT.

885
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,200
AND PETRA?

886
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU
THAT THEY DIDN'T SUFFER.

887
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,000
THEY BOTH DIED INSTANTLY.

888
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW?

889
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,400
HOW ARE MY KIDS GOING TO DO
WITHOUT A MOTHER?

890
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,000
CAN YOU TELL ME?

891
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,400
YEAH, I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE
SLOW COMING IN TODAY,

892
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,400
BUT BUCK DOESN'T HAVE

893
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,800
THAT MUCH OF A COMMUTE
FROM HIS VAN.

894
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,600
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

895
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,600
TO SEND SOMEBODY OVER
JUST TO CHECK TO SEE
IF HE'S OVERSLEPT?

896
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
UM, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

897
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,800
POLICE HAVE CORDONED OFF
SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS...

898
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,600
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

899
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,800
IS DADDY AT WORK?

900
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,600
THEY'RE CLOSED TODAY.
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT?

901
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,000
AUTHORITIES ARE ASKING
THAT IF YOU DON'T LIVE
IN THESE AFFECTED AREAS

902
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,800
DO NOT VENTURE DOWN THERE.

903
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
EVEN AT THIS EARLY HOUR
WE'RE GETTING REPORTS

904
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,400
OF SOME PEOPLE HEADING
INTO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS
JUST TO SEE THE DAMAGE.

905
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,400
AND, PETE, THIS IS BECOMING
THE SYMBOL OF THE QUAKE,

906
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,400
A BROKEN, USELESS
BAY BRIDGE.

907
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,000
OBVIOUSLY, NO CARS ARE
BEING ALLOWED TO CROSS IT.

908
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,400
OTHER AFFECTED ARTERIES,
THE CENTRAL FREEWAY IS CLOSED,

909
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,200
THE EMBARCADERO FREEWAY
SHUT DOWN,

910
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
THE DOUBLE-DECK PORTION
OF THE I-280

911
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,800
IN SAN FRANCISCO SHUT DOWN.

912
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,400
ALL FOR INSPECTION
AND REPAIR.

913
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,800
NURSE'S AIDE TO STATION 6,
PLEASE.

914
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
NURSE'S AIDE
TO STATION 6, PLEASE.

915
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,000
MR. JAMES PRICE,
PLEASE REPORT TO ADMITTING.

916
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,000
MR. JAMES PRICE,
PLEASE REPORT TO ADMITTING.

917
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,400
THEY'RE PRAYING FOR HIM
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
I'M SURE.

918
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,600
HOW IS YOUR FAITH
HOLDING UP?

919
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,400
GOD SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN ME, SISTER.

920
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
MAYBE THIS WILL
HELP ME UNDERSTAND

921
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,200
WHY HE MADE
SUCH A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

922
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,400
I KNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE IT NOW, MR. BARUMAN,

923
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,800
BUT YOU'LL FIND
THE STRENGTH TO HANDLE IT.

924
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,400
ALL OF IT.

925
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,400
I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE DEEPLY GRIEVED
OVER YOUR WIFE'S DEATH.

926
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,000
EXCUSE ME, SISTER.

927
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,600
I'LL JUST READ IT
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

928
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,000
OF COURSE.

929
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
JIM, YOU GOT A BONE TO
THROW THE MEDIA OUTSIDE,

930
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,000
BEFORE THEY CLAW
MY SHIRT OFF?

931
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,400
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

932
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
THE BARUMAN'S
ARE AN INTENSELY
PRIVATE FAMILY,

933
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
AND THEY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST
THEY BE SPARED--

934
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,800
MEDIA INTRUSION
IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME.

935
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
GOOD.

936
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,000
OK,
BUT THEY'LL HATE IT.

937
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,800
NOT MUCH LEFT OF YOU,
IS THERE?

938
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,600
OH, GAIL.

939
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,400
I WANT THAT BOY
TO MAKE IT.

940
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,400
HE CAN'T HAVE COME THIS FAR
AND NOT MAKE IT.

941
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,400
SURE WISH
IT WORKED THAT WAY.

942
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,200
SOMETIMES IT DOES.

943
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,200
HOLD ON TO THAT.

944
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,800
OK, LISTEN UP!
QUIET!

945
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,000
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER
HAS ORDERED ALL CIVILIANS

946
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,800
OUT OF THIS AREA
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

947
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,200
O.P.D., CALTRANS,
AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS,

948
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,600
AND THE OAKLAND
FIRE DEPARTMENT

949
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,000
WILL BE WORKING HERE
UNTIL THE LAST VICTIM

950
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,800
HAS BEEN LOCATED
AND REMOVED.

951
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,200
YOU'VE ALL WORKED
LONG AND HARD

952
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
THESE LAST 3 DAYS.

953
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,200
AND WE WANT TO...

954
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,600
I WANT TO PERSONALLY
THANK YOU.

955
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,800
ALL OF YOU.

956
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,400
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BREAK IT UP.

957
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,000
CLEAR THIS AREA.

958
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,000
CLEAR THE AREA!

959
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,800
CIVILIANS AND VOLUNTEERS,
CLEAR THE AREA.

960
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,400
THE SEARCH FOR THE SURVIVORS
IS OVER.

961
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,400
CLEAR THE FREEWAY
AND SURROUNDING AREA.

962
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,000
THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
IS OVER.

963
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,600
CIVILIANS AND VOLUNTEERS,

964
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
CLEAR THE AREA.

965
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,800
WELL,
WITH EACH SUCCEEDING HOUR,

966
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,000
HOPE IS FADING HERE

967
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,000
THAT ANYONE WILL BE
EXTRICATED ALIVE

968
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,600
FROM THIS WRECKAGE
THAT WAS ONCE
THE I-880 FREEWAY.

969
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,400
THIS MORNING,
THE ONLY PEOPLE WE'VE SEEN

970
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,800
LOWERED FROM THAT CONCRETE

971
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,400
HAVE BEEN COVERED IN
THE SHROUD OF DEATH.

972
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,200
IN FACT,
MOST OF THE ACTIVITY HERE

973
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,600
IS CENTERED AROUND
MOVING VEHICLES.

974
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,400
...SLIM HOPE ANYBODY'S...

975
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,600
THAT'S GREG.

976
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,000
BE NICE.

977
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,200
HI.
HI.

978
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,400
ARE YOU GONNA
OPEN THE DOOR?

979
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,200
NOT UNLESS
YOU'RE CLEAN AND SOBER.

980
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,000
I'M HIS SON, TOO.

981
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
NO.
THERE ARE STILL RULES.

982
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,600
I'M CLEAN, OK?

983
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,800
I GUESS I HAVE TO
TAKE YOUR WORD FOR THAT.

984
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,800
...FOR NOW, FEARING THAT COULD
CAUSE FURTHER COLLAPSE

985
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,200
AND BURY THE SURVIVOR
FOR GOOD.

986
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
IN ADDITION,
COUNTY AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING

987
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,000
THAT SOME 2 DOZEN PEOPLE
STILL REMAIN

988
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,400
HI.
OFFICIALLY MISSING.

989
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,600
HI.
HI.

990
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,800
...THE DECEASED VICTIMS

991
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
WILL ALREADY
HAVE BEEN REMOVED...

992
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,600
BUT NOT YET
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED.

993
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,200
IN SOME CASES, FRANKLY,
THE REMAINS ARE
SO BADLY MANGLED,

994
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,400
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR
THE CORONER TO DETERMINE...

995
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,200
BUCK DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHANCE

996
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,600
IF HE'S IN THERE,
DOES HE?

997
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,800
GREG.

998
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
WELL, DIABETES AND ALL.

999
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,400
HE'S NOT DEAD!

1000
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,800
WELL, NO,
NOT NECESSARILY.

1001
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
WE JUST HOPE NOT,
OK, KIDDO?

1002
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,400
BUT NOW RESCUERS
ARE FINDING ONLY BODIES.

1003
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
THIS IS BECOMING
A GRIM TASK TO PEOPLE

1004
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,400
WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING
BLEARY-EYED, NONSTOP,

1005
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,200
SINCE THE QUAKE HIT.

1006
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,200
GOOD NEWS.
CATHY'S ON HER WAY OVER.

1007
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,200
MY BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS.

1008
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,400
MR. BARUMAN,
THERE'S A, UH...

1009
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,800
THERE'S A LOT OF SWELLING

1010
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,800
THAT ACCOMPANIES
FACIAL SURGERY,

1011
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,200
AND HER JAW
HAS BEEN WIRED SHUT,

1012
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,400
BUT WE'RE 100% SURE
SHE'LL BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.

1013
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,800
YOU REMEMBER THAT
WHEN YOU SEE HER.

1014
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,000
100%?

1015
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,200
MAYBE 200.

1016
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,800
MR. BARUMAN,

1017
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
UH, PLEASE,
CALL ME PASTOR.

1018
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,000
PASTOR.

1019
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,600
HAVE YOU THOUGHT HOW
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL

1020
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,800
CATHY AND, UH, AND JULIO
ABOUT THEIR MOTHER?

1021
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,000
NOT NOW.

1022
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,800
WHEN THEY GET WELL.

1023
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
SOONER IS ALWAYS BETTER.

1024
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
IT'S WORTH PRAYING OVER.

1025
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,400
MR. BARUMAN,
THE AMBULANCE IS HERE.

1026
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,000
IS IT TRUE THAT SHE'S GOT
57 BROKEN FACIAL BONES?

1027
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
PLEASE! WE'LL HAVE
A STATEMENT LATER.

1028
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,600
HOW'S THE BOY?

1029
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,800
HOW'S CATHY'S FACE?
WILL SHE BE DISFIGURED?

1030
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,600
ESCORT THIS MAN
FROM THE PREMISES.

1031
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,000
HEY, BUDDY,
ARE YOU A BARUMAN?

1032
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,400
WHO EVER TOLD YOU
THIS WAS JOURNALISM?

1033
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,200
PRINCESS.

1034
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,800
SHE'LL BE
BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.

1035
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,000
PASTOR. PASTOR.

1036
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,000
YOU LOOK AT CATHY
LIKE SHE'S STILL BEAUTIFUL,

1037
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
AND SHE WILL BE.
MMM-HMM.

1038
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,400
ALL RIGHT?
200%

1039
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,800
I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT.
200%

1040
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,400
WHERE'S JULIO?

1041
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,800
DOCTOR BETZ IS OPERATING
ON HIS LEG AGAIN.

1042
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,200
HIS CONDITION
IS DETERIORATING.

1043
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,000
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT HIM.

1044
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,200
I GOT TO GO TO HIM.
NO, NO, PASTOR. COME ON.

1045
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,000
THE DOCTORS WILL DO
WHAT THEY CAN.

1046
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,600
WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN.

1047
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,400
SISTER, WILL YOU LEAD US
IN THE ROSARY?

1048
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,000
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
AND THE SON
AND THE HOLY GHOST.

1049
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
AMEN.

1050
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,800
AMEN.

1051
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,800
I BELIEVE IN GOD
THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,

1052
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,600
MAKER OF
HEAVEN AND EARTH.

1053
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,600
I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST,
HIS ONLY SON, OUR LORD.

1054
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,200
OUR FATHER
WHICH ART IN HEAVEN,

1055
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,000
HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

1056
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,800
THY KINGDOM COME.
THY WILL BE DONE

1057
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
ON EARTH
AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

1058
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,400
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE,
THE LORD IS WITH THEE.

1059
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,800
BLESSED ART THOU
AMONG WOMEN,

1060
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,800
AND BLESSED IS
THE FRUIT OF THY WOMB, JESUS.

1061
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,000
HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD,

1062
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,400
PRAY FOR US SINNERS,

1063
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,400
FROM NOW UNTIL
THE HOUR OF OUR DEATH. AMEN.

1064
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,000
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE,

1065
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
THE LORD IS WITH THEE.

1066
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,200
BLESSED ART THOU
AMONG WOMEN...

1067
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,200
I CAN'T REMEMBER

1068
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,400
WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU, DES.

1069
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,200
MY FLAWS FADE.

1070
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,200
DON'T SEEM TO MATTER NOW.

1071
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,400
I'M COLD. HUNGRY.

1072
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,000
BUT THE TERRIBLE LONELINESS

1073
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,000
MAY BE THE LAST THING I KNOW.

1074
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
NO ONE TO CRY OUT TO

1075
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,400
THAT WOULD HEAR.

1076
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,200
HELP ME.

1077
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,800
SOMEONE HELP ME.

1078
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,200
FROM NOW UNTIL
THE HOUR OF OUR DEATH. AMEN.

1079
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,200
MY BABY.

1080
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,000
I'M BIG.

1081
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,200
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

1082
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,800
YOU'RE SO BIG.

1083
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,800
WHERE AM I?

1084
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,000
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

1085
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,800
YOU GOT HURT.

1086
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,400
IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE,
REMEMBER?

1087
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,000
WAS IT FUN?

1088
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
NO.

1089
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,800
I WANT MY MAMA.

1090
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,200
SHE'S NOT HERE.

1091
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,000
GET HER.

1092
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,200
PASTOR, GO HOME.

1093
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,800
LEAVE THEM WITH US
FOR A FEW HOURS.

1094
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,800
AS THE DEATH TOLL
IS ADDED UP,

1095
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,800
IT APPEARS THERE ARE
FAR FEWER FATALITIES...

1096
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,200
MOM, ARE YOU CRYING?

1097
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,200
DID GREG DO SOMETHING?

1098
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,400
NO, HONEY,
HE'S BEEN FINE.

1099
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,800
IT'S THESE ONIONS.

1100
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,000
THAT'S WHAT
THEY ALL SAY, MOM.

1101
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,400
MAYBE, UH, I DON'T KNOW,
YOU STILL CARE ABOUT DAD.

1102
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,200
JEFF, NO.
NOT--NOT--NOT THAT WAY.

1103
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,000
HONEY, I WILL ALWAYS
CARE ABOUT HIM.

1104
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,800
HE GAVE ME ALL OF YOU.

1105
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,000
YOUR DAD WAS
A HELL OF A GUY.

1106
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,600
COMPLETE SECTION 87

1107
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,600
WITH A TOTAL OF
41 FATALITIES SO FAR.

1108
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,000
BODY COUNT'S COMING IN
WAY LOWER THAN EXPECTED.

1109
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
GUESS EVERYBODY
WAS AT THE GAME
OR AT HOME WATCHING.

1110
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,800
DON TO THE CYPRESS COMMAND.

1111
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,400
I'M STILL AT 100.

1112
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,600
BLUE PICKUP,
NO SURVIVORS.

1113
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,800
WAIT A MINUTE.

1114
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,600
I CAN SEE A HAND HERE.

1115
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,800
THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT.
THERE WE GO.

1116
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,000
GOT IT?

1117
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,800
ALL RIGHT, NICOLA,
YOU CAN I.D. THE BODY.

1118
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,200
GET THE MEDICS!
WE HAVE A LIVE MALE.

1119
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,800
MOM! SOMEONE'S STILL ALIVE.
A MAN.

1120
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,200
HERE AT THE NORTHERN END
OF THE COLLAPSED FREEWAY,

1121
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,000
WORKERS ARE ATTEMPTING
TO RESCUE A MAN

1122
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,800
WHO HAS APPARENTLY
BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE
THE CONCRETE STRUCTURE

1123
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,000
FOR 4 DAYS.

1124
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,800
SURVIVAL IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS

1125
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,600
COULD ONLY BE CALLED
MIRACULOUS.

1126
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT
THE LONE SURVIVOR,

1127
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,000
JUST FOUND NEAR THE NORTH END
OF THE COLLAPSED FREEWAY.

1128
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,600
I KNOW IT'S DAD.

1129
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,600
DES, LET'S JUST NOT
GET OUR HOPES UP, OK?

1130
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,000
MY HOPES ARE UP.

1131
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,800
GET YOURS UP, MAMA.
MAYBE HE CAN FEEL IT.

1132
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,000
MAYBE HE CAN.

1133
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,200
JEFF, CALL MARK.

1134
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,600
...AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID,

1135
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,600
FREEING THE MAN FROM
THE METAL AND CONCRETE

1136
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,600
COULD TAKE SEVERAL HOURS.

1137
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,000
AGAIN TO REITERATE,

1138
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,800
A SURVIVOR
HAS BEEN FOUND

1139
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,000
AFTER 4 DAYS
TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE.

1140
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,200
A DOCTOR TOLD ME...

1141
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,800
DEAR GOD,
LET IT BE BUCK.

1142
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,000
...SEVERELY DEHYDRATED
AFTER 90 HOURS

1143
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,200
IF ONLY I HADN'T LEANED ON HIM
A LITTLE HARDER.

1144
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,000
DAVE,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

1145
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,800
I SHOULD HAVE INSISTED
HE COME WITH ME.

1146
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,600
EASY NOW.
CAREFUL WITH HIS HEAD.

1147
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,600
BE DADDY.

1148
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,400
YES. YES.

1149
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,000
IF THERE'S ANYONE
IN THE UNIVERSE
WHO CAN PULL THROUGH THIS,

1150
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,400
IT'S OUR OLD MAN.

1151
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,600
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

1152
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,600
COME ON, GET OUT OF THE WAY!

1153
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,000
GET OUT OF THERE.

1154
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,400
COME ON. OH, COME ON.

1155
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,200
MOVE IT, DAMN IT!

1156
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,400
THOSE ARE MY BOOTS.
HE WAS WEARIN' 'EM.

1157
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,800
HE WORE MY BOOTS!
THAT'S HIM!

1158
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,600
HE'S ALIVE.
YEAH, THAT'S IT!

1159
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,000
OH, JEFF.

1160
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,400
YES, I'M SURE.
BUCK HELM, H-E-L-M.

1161
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,000
TELL THEM HE'S A DIABETIC.
I'M HIS WIFE.

1162
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,600
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE TAKING HIM?

1163
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,000
GREG, YOU WANT TO
RIDE WITH ME?

1164
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,800
WOULDN'T THAT THRILL DAD
TO SEE ME?

1165
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,400
TELL HIM I SAID HI.

1166
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,200
GREG,
BUCK NEEDS ALL HIS KIDS.

1167
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,800
"AND EVERYONE HOPES
YOU GET WELL SOON.

1168
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,200
THIS IS MARY BYRNE
FROM THIRD GRADE."

1169
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,200
THIS ONE'S
FROM MEXICO.

1170
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
"DEAR CATHY AND JULIO,

1171
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,600
"WE HAVE EARTHQUAKES
IN OUR COUNTRY, TOO,

1172
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,600
"AND BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

1173
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
WE'RE SORRY ABOUT..."

1174
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,000
SORRY ABOUT WHAT?

1175
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,400
WHAT?

1176
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,600
IT'S ABOUT
THE EARTHQUAKE,

1177
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,400
AND ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOTHER.

1178
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,800
DO YOU REMEMBER?

1179
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,000
SHE DROVE YOU
TO THE DENTIST.

1180
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,600
WHEN--WHEN--WHEN MOMMY
DROVE TO,

1181
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,400
TO THE FREEWAY,

1182
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,000
THE EARTHQUAKE HIT,

1183
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,000
AND YOU BOTH WERE SAVED,
BUT MOMMY...

1184
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,000
THE ANGELS TOOK MOMMY.

1185
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,000
WHY?

1186
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,400
THEY DON'T SAY.

1187
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,800
BUT SHE'S IN HEAVEN NOW,
AND SHE'S VERY, VERY HAPPY.

1188
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,000
THEY SHOULD
BRING HER BACK.

1189
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,400
THEY CAN'T, SON.

1190
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,200
THEY'RE ONE-WAY ANGELS
SENT BY GOD,

1191
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,800
AND WE GOT TO LET HER GO.

1192
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,600
I WANT MY MAMA.

1193
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,600
IT'S OK, BABY.

1194
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,600
IT'LL BE ANOTHER
12 TO 24 HOURS

1195
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,200
BEFORE HIS CONDITION
DEFINES ITSELF.

1196
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,600
DOCTOR SCOTT,
I'M A CERTIFIED NURSE'S AIDE.

1197
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,400
I WANT THE TRUTH.

1198
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,400
OK.

1199
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,600
HIS KIDNEYS SHUT DOWN,

1200
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,400
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
ONTO DIALYSIS RIGHT AWAY.

1201
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,200
SOME BROKEN BONES,
SEVERE DEHYDRATION.

1202
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,400
THE DIABETES
COMPLICATES THINGS.

1203
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,600
HE'S CRITICAL.

1204
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,800
YOU WANT TO KEEP HIM ALIVE,

1205
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,600
TELL THE GUARD DOWNSTAIRS
TO LET HIS KIDS THROUGH.

1206
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,000
I PROMISE YOU

1207
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,600
THAT'S WHAT'S KEPT HIM GOING
ALL THIS TIME.

1208
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,800
THIS IS A TRAUMA UNIT.

1209
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,600
YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

1210
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,000
SLOW DOWN, DES.
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

1211
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,400
TRY AND BE REALLY UP
AND CHEERFUL FOR DAD.

1212
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,600
HE LOOKS A LITTLE THINNER.

1213
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,800
DADDY?

1214
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,200
YOU'RE GETTING LETTERS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

1215
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,400
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1216
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
AND THIS IS FROM JAPAN.

1217
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,000
"ITO TANAKA."

1218
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,000
NICE BOX?

1219
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,800
CARD.

1220
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,600
IN ENGLISH.

1221
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,800
SAYS, "DEAR CATHY AND JULIO,

1222
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
"THIS ORIGAMI

1223
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,600
COMES FROM THOUSANDS
OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN TOKYO."

1224
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,000
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY
WHEN YOU SMILE.

1225
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,200
OH, EVEN THOSE WIRES
ARE PRETTY.

1226
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,800
YOU'RE GETTING
PRETTIER AND PRETTIER

1227
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,000
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

1228
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,400
JUST LIKE
DR. BETZ SAID YOU WOULD.

1229
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,600
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER
THAT HE ALSO SAID

1230
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,400
THAT YOU HAD TO EXERCISE
AFTER 2 WEEKS.

1231
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
NOW IT'S TIME.

1232
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,600
CATHY WOULD RATHER NOT
WALK TODAY.

1233
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,400
AT LEAST ANGELS
DIDN'T TAKE YOUR LEG.

1234
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,600
HEY, CATHY.

1235
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,800
YOU REMEMBER ME?

1236
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,400
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

1237
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,600
YEAH.

1238
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,600
JULIO, THE ANGELS
DID NOT TAKE YOUR LEG.

1239
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,000
THEY TOOK MAMA,
DIDN'T THEY?

1240
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,600
THAT IS NOT
HOW ANGELS OPERATE.

1241
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,200
WELL, WHO'S TO BLAME THEN?

1242
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,200
NOBODY.
JUST THE EARTHQUAKE.

1243
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,400
WELL, WHO MADE
THE EARTHQUAKE?

1244
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,600
GOD!

1245
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,600
THEN GOD TOOK MY LEG.

1246
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,200
YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY AT GOD.

1247
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,000
WHO EVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?

1248
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
OK, THE ANGELS THEN.

1249
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,800
MR. BARUMAN?

1250
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,600
FRANK STEWART.

1251
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
HI.

1252
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,400
JULIO, THIS IS THE MAN
WHO FOUND YOU.

1253
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,200
HI, JULIO.
YOU'RE LOOKIN' PRETTY GOOD.

1254
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,200
THE ANGELS TOOK MY LEG.

1255
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,400
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
THEY MADE A CLEAN GETAWAY.

1256
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,800
BUT I BET
THEY'LL BRING YOU ANOTHER ONE,

1257
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,600
ONE
THAT'S SUPERSONIC TOUGH

1258
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,600
THAT NOT EVEN EARTHQUAKES
CAN MESS WITH.

1259
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
HERE.
I THINK YOU LOST THIS.

1260
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,200
OPEN IT.

1261
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
THANK YOU, MR. STEWART.

1262
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,400
YOU KNOW,
I'M A BIG A'S FAN MYSELF.

1263
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,600
I GOT SEASON TICKETS,

1264
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,200
AND MAYBE
WE CAN GO SOMETIME.

1265
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,800
DAD, THIS IS AUDRA,
MY FIANCEE.

1266
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,800
WE SET A DATE
FOR CHRISTMAS.

1267
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,200
I WANT YOU TO BE
MY BEST MAN.

1268
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,800
HEY, BUCK.

1269
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,400
SEE YOU LATER.

1270
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,000
SEE YOU, MARK.

1271
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,600
WE MISS YOU, GUY.

1272
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,400
NOBODY TO QUOTE
ALL THOSE DEAD GREEKS.

1273
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
WHEN CAN I TELL THEM
YOU'LL BE BACK?

1274
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,400
6 MONTHS? A YEAR?

1275
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
BUCK, UH, WHAT IS IT?

1276
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,800
HE'S A GREAT KID.

1277
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,400
YOU KNOW,
IN A THOUSAND YEARS,

1278
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,600
I COULD NOT REPAY YOU
FOR SAVING MY CHILDREN,

1279
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,400
RISKING YOUR LIFE.

1280
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,000
MAYBE IT WAS A CASE
OF TEMPORARY INSANITY.

1281
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,800
BUT YOU KNOW,
MR. BARUMAN,

1282
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,200
FOR A WHILE THERE,
IT FELT LIKE
IT WAS MY KIDS.

1283
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,600
MAYBE EVEN MY RIGHT ARM.
I COULDN'T HAVE LEFT,
EVEN IF I TRIED.

1284
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,000
THERE WAS NOTHING
HEROIC ABOUT IT, BELIEVE ME.

1285
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,600
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE
DONE IT.

1286
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,800
BUT THEY DIDN'T.
YOU DID.

1287
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,200
SO, UH, JULIO'S HAVING
A TOUGH ADJUSTMENT?

1288
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,600
HE'S VERY ANGRY,
MR. STEWART.

1289
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,400
BOY, I WOULD BE, TOO.

1290
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,200
I DON'T FEEL ANGRY,
I JUST FEEL EMPTY.

1291
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

1292
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,600
BECAUSE THAT PICTURE
IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

1293
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,600
YOU BET I'LL HOLD.

1294
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,800
WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
THE 6:00 NEWSCAST.

1295
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,400
SO, HOW MUCH
DID YOU GET FOR IT?

1296
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,200
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1297
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,000
THIS. MY PICTURE OF BUCK.

1298
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,400
HOW MUCH DID YOU GET?

1299
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
COOL IT, LAURIE.
I'LL SPLIT IT WITH YOU.

1300
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,800
DON'T YOU TELL ME
THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.

1301
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,200
IS THAT ALL
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT? MONEY?

1302
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,400
THEY'D HAVE GOTTEN
THE PICTURE ANYWAY.

1303
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,000
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

1304
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,200
WALK IN THERE, TAPE BUCK,
AND SELL IT TO T.V.?

1305
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,800
I'M NO MILLIONAIRE.
I GOT TO LIVE.

1306
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
GREG,

1307
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,600
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO GET IT TOGETHER?

1308
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,400
WHO PUT YOU IN CHARGE?

1309
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,000
YOU'RE JUST
HIS DAMN EX-WIFE.

1310
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,400
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
BEING IN CHARGE.

1311
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,200
THIS IS ABOUT CARING
FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU

1312
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,200
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU PUT HIM THROUGH.

1313
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,200
LOOK, JUST TAKE IT ALL.

1314
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,200
I'M NOT GONNA TELL BUCK
ABOUT THIS,

1315
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,600
WHETHER HE PULLS THROUGH
OR NOT.

1316
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHETHER?
I THOUGHT--

1317
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,400
DON'T THINK, GREG. ASK.

1318
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,400
HEY, I THOUGHT
WE HAD A DEAL!

1319
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
BUCK, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

1320
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,800
I'LL COME AGAIN SOON.

1321
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,400
SEE YOU.

1322
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,000
HEY, BUCK.

1323
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,200
YOU'RE LOOKIN' PRETTY GOOD
FOR A DIRTY OLD MAN.

1324
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,600
NURSES TREATIN' YOU ALL RIGHT?

1325
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,400
HEY, YOU WANT ME
TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE?

1326
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,600
YEAH, I FIGURED.
IT'S MORE OF
THE SAME OLD STUFF.

1327
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,600
I KNOW YOU THINK
THIS IS GONNA BE

1328
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,800
ANOTHER ONE
OF MY COME-ONS.

1329
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,800
LOOK, I KNOW
I'M A DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOU,
RIGHT?

1330
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,200
THIS WHOLE THING'S GOT ME
THINKING DIFFERENTLY, OK?

1331
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'M REALLY SORRY, DAD.

1332
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,000
I LOVE YOU.

1333
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,200
HELLO, WELL,
MY 2 FAVORITE LADIES.

1334
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,800
LOOK AT YOU.

1335
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,200
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY
FOR THE 100-YARD DASH.

1336
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,200
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I CAN'T EVEN CATCH HIM.

1337
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,400
HEY, ARE YOU GOING
TO ANSWER ALL THAT MAIL?

1338
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,200
WE GOT A LOT
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR.

1339
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,200
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, JULIO?

1340
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,600
JULIO, SISTER MARY SAYS
YOU'RE BLAMING THE ANGELS
FOR TAKING YOUR LEG.

1341
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,200
WELL, I CAN'T LET THEM
TAKE THE RAP.

1342
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,800
I HAD TO AMPUTATE YOUR LEG.

1343
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,600
BUT JULIO, I HAD TO DO IT.

1344
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,200
YOUR LEG WAS BADLY HURT.

1345
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,800
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO WALK ON IT ANYWAY.

1346
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,200
IT WOULD HAVE HURT YOU
TERRIBLY ALL THE TIME.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1347
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,400
ALL RIGHT.

1348
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,400
THEN, FROM NOW ON,
IF YOU GET MAD AT ME,

1349
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,800
OR YOU GET MAD AT YOUR LEG,

1350
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,800
I WANT YOU
TO BEAT ON YOUR BED.

1351
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,200
LIKE THIS.

1352
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
ALL RIGHT? YOU DO IT.

1353
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,200
OH, I'D BE WAY MADDER
THAN THAT.

1354
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,400
NO, NO, NO, NO. LIKE THIS.

1355
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,400
ALL RIGHT? YOU DO IT.

1356
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,200
HARD. HIT IT.

1357
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
MAD. GET MAD.

1358
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,400
MAD, MAD, MAD!

1359
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,800
YEAH, MAD.

1360
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,600
MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD,
MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD.

1361
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,200
MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD.

1362
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,000
"BUT YOUR COURAGE
UNDER ALL THAT RUBBLE

1363
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,200
"MADE ME REALIZE

1364
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,200
"I SHOULD STOP COMPLAINING
ABOUT MY OWN DIABETES

1365
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,600
AND REALIZE
HOW LUCKY I AM."

1366
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,400
YOU HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE
JUST BY NOT GIVING UP.

1367
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,000
I'M GOING TO SHOW THESE
TO MOM

1368
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,400
SO SHE'LL SEE
HOW GREAT YOU ARE.

1369
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,000
EVERYBODY SAYS SO.

1370
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,800
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK?

1371
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,200
DES, HONEY,
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER.

1372
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,400
LOVE YOU, DADDY.

1373
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,800
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

1374
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,600
BUCK, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN CRY, YOU KNOW.

1375
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,800
GOD, IT KILLS ME
WHEN YOU DO THIS.

1376
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,600
EVERY TIME I THINK
I'M FED UP WITH YOU,

1377
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,800
YOU PULL SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

1378
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,600
BUCK,

1379
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,600
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME.

1380
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,400
YOU HANG ON,

1381
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,000
AND WE'LL JUST FORGET ABOUT
THIS SEPARATION THING.

1382
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,000
WE'LL WALK OUT
OF THIS HOSPITAL

1383
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
AND TRY AGAIN.

1384
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,200
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BUCK?

1385
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,400
WE GOT A DEAL?

1386
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,600
I STILL CAN'T
FIGURE YOU OUT,

1387
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,000
BUT YOU SURE GO
TO A LOT OF TROUBLE

1388
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,600
TO GET YOUR WAY.

1389
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,200
PLEASE, BUCK, COME ON.

1390
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,800
FIGHT.

1391
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,200
THIS LEG ISN'T SUPERSONIC.
IT JUST STANDS THERE.

1392
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,000
YOU HAVE TO PUT
THE MOTOR IN IT.

1393
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,400
COME ON.

1394
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,600
IT'S TOO HARD.

1395
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,600
NOT FOR A FIGHTER.

1396
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,800
IT WAS HARD
THE FIRST TIME

1397
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,400
WHEN YOU KICKED THE BALL,
REMEMBER?

1398
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,000
SO, YOU DID IT.
COME ON.

1399
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,200
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

1400
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,400
YOU HAVE TO TRY.

1401
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,200
I CAN'T.

1402
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,200
LOOK, IMAGINE THERE'S A BALL
IN FRONT OF YOU. NOW KICK IT.

1403
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,600
I CAN'T MOVE
THIS STUPID LEG.

1404
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,800
KICK THE BALL.

1405
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,000
NO. I CAN'T!

1406
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
KICK IT!

1407
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,400
THIS BALL IS STUPID!
THIS LEG IS STUPID!
STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!

1408
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,200
HEY, HEY.

1409
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,400
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE MAMA?

1410
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,200
I WANTED TO.

1411
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,400
I WANTED TO, SON.
I WANTED IT SO BAD.

1412
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,400
I WANT MY MAMA.

1413
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,400
SO DO I, SON. SO DO I.

1414
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL,
WHERE BUCK HELM,

1415
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,400
WHO SO HEROICALLY
FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE LAST MONTH

1416
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,000
UNDER
THE INTERSTATE RUBBLE,

1417
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
IS FIGHTING
FOR HIS LIFE AGAIN.

1418
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
THIS DRAMATIC TURN
CAME JUST MOMENTS AGO...

1419
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,400
MARK, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

1420
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,800
I GOT TO GET UP THERE.

1421
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,600
OH, WAIT,
THIS IS BUCK'S ORDERS,

1422
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,000
SOMETHING HE WANTS
YOU TO HAVE.

1423
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,600
THIS IS DAD'S UNION BOOK.
HE NEEDS IT FOR WORK.

1424
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,600
OH, GOD.

1425
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,800
HEY, COME HERE.

1426
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,400
MR. BARUMAN?

1427
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,000
MR. BARUMAN?
WHERE ARE YOUR KIDS?

1428
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,400
IT'S JUST ME TODAY.

1429
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,200
I--I--I--I STILL WANT
TO KEEP THEM SAFE,

1430
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,200
YOU KNOW,
AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC EYE.

1431
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,600
UM, THE--THE REASON
THAT I, UH, UM,

1432
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU

1433
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,200
IS BECAUSE
THE--THE FEELINGS THAT I HAVE

1434
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,200
FOR SO MANY ARE TOO LARGE
FOR A SIMPLE THANK YOU.

1435
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,000
THESE LAST MONTHS,
I'VE BEEN WONDERING

1436
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,200
WHAT MAKES A FATHER

1437
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,000
CLIMB INTO A BURNING HELL

1438
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,400
TO SAVE THE CHILDREN
OF A MAN THAT HE'S NEVER MET.

1439
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,600
WHAT--WHAT KIND OF LOVE
SENDS DOCTORS

1440
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,800
AND HUNDREDS OF RESCUE WORKERS

1441
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,800
INTO SITUATIONS
OF EXTREME DANGER,

1442
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,800
WITH NO THOUGHT
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY?

1443
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:43,600
WHAT KIND OF LOVE MAKES
ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN

1444
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,800
BECOME SO MUCH LARGER
THAN THEMSELVES?

1445
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,400
SO MANY THOUSANDS
HAVE WRITTEN TO ME

1446
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,200
TO SHARE WITH ME
THEIR OWN PERSONAL TRAGEDIES,

1447
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,000
SO THAT I CAN LEARN
FROM THEIRS

1448
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,400
AND LEARN HOW TO COPE
WITH MY OWN.

1449
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,200
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE ALL
KNOWN MY WIFE PETRA.

1450
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON,

1451
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,800
YOU KNOW,
REAL THROUGH TO HER SOUL.

1452
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,600
YOU KNOW,
I--I--I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

1453
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,400
AND I GUESS
I NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND

1454
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,400
WHY GOD CLAIMED HER.

1455
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:26,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS DOING
GOOD THINGS FOR EVERYBODY.

1456
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,600
BUT I FEEL THAT, UM...

1457
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,800
ALL THE GOOD THINGS
THAT SHE DID

1458
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,600
ARE COMING BACK TO ME
AND TO--TO CATHY AND TO JULIO

1459
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,800
THROUGH YOU.

1460
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,600
YOU HAVE RESTORED
MY CHILDREN TO ME

1461
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,200
THROUGH YOUR COURAGE
AND YOUR PRAYERS.

1462
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,600
I, UH...

1463
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,000
I--I CAN'T
THANK YOU INDIVIDUALLY,

1464
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,600
AND I CERTAINLY
WON'T BE ABLE

1465
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,000
TO ANSWER ALL THE MAIL,

1466
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,200
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT, UM,

1467
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,800
I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU
IN MY HEART WHENEVER I, UH...

1468
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,600
I FEEL
THAT I NEED THE STRENGTH

1469
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,800
TO GO ON WITHOUT MY WIFE.

1470
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,600
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY

1471
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,800
IT IS HERE IN OAKLAND.

1472
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,200
AS WE APPROACH
THE RUSH HOUR,

1473
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,600
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HEAD ACROSS

1474
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,000
THE NEWLY OPENED
BAY BRIDGE,

1475
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,800
WHERE TRAFFIC IS FLOWING WELL,
OUTBOUND AND IN?

1476
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,600
MIRACLE OF MIRACLES.
