1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,639
See the crows?

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,556
They never tasted prince before.

3
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,718
Is this what you left me for?!

4
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,472
Fight!

5
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,074
Fight me!

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,394
You coward!

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,788
Fight me!

8
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,235
We have a pact! Fight!

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,593
Fight him, son. Fight him.

10
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,389
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,994
Prepare for battle!

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,959
This is not honor!

13
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,549
This is not worthy of royalty!

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,918
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,874
The fight is over.

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,110
The fight is not over.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,918
Stand back, Prince Hector.

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,594
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,034
He is my brother.

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,232
Paris!

21
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,678
Go!

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,992
Get inside, Paris!

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,794
Archers!

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,430
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,874
For Troy!

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,875
- Now!
- Loose!

27
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,473
Get them in line!

28
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,398
Get the men back into lines!

29
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,835
Front line, push!

30
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,993
Forward.

31
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,434
Forward!

32
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,274
Forward!

33
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,675
Apollonians! Now!

34
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,234
Prince Hector!

35
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,268
We need to retreat!

36
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,350
My army's never lost a battle yet!

37
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,909
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

38
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,790
Back to the ships!

39
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,598
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

40
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,749
- Back!
- Retreat!

41
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,558
Go back!

42
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,519
Back. Back to the ships!

43
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,393
Fall back!

44
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,154
- Men, fall back!
- Halt!

45
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,479
Halt!

46
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,119
But we have them on the run!

47
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,396
We're in range of their archers.

48
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,391
Have our men gather our fallen.

49
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,358
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

50
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,909
Would they have done the same for us?

51
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,318
Go! Back!

52
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,758
Fall back into line!

53
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,992
You think I'm a coward.

54
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,798
I am a coward.

55
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,311
I knew he would kill me.

56
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,599
You were watching.

57
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,993
My father.

58
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,678
My brother.

59
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,435
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

60
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,877
I gave up my pride...

61
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,192
...my honor...

62
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,593
...just to live.

63
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,599
For love.

64
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,756
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

65
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,558
I betrayed you.

66
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,150
Menelaus was a brave man.

67
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,197
He lived for fighting.

68
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,953
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

69
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,071
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

70
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,074
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

71
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,233
They think I'll sail home at first light.

72
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,719
Maybe we should.

73
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,075
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

74
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,710
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

75
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,478
Won't be needing her anymore.

76
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,677
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

77
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,400
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

78
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,552
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

79
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,998
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

80
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,438
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

81
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,716
To protect Greece, not your pride.

82
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,440
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

83
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,874
Achilles is one man.

84
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,315
Hector is one man.

85
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,319
Look what he did to us today.

86
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,189
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

87
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,996
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

88
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,593
He's right.

89
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,273
The men's morale is weak.

90
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,150
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

91
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,158
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

92
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,754
I'll talk to him.

93
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,319
He'll want the girl back.

94
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,119
He can have that damn girl.

95
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,554
I haven't touched her.

96
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,994
Where is she?

97
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,792
I gave her to the men.

98
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,871
They need some amusement after today.

99
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,995
Come on, give the bitch to me!

100
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,079
Who's first?

101
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,119
Trojan whore!

102
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,191
What's this? A virgin's robe?

103
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,398
- You won't be needing that much longer!
- Hold her.

104
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,916
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan...

105
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,036
Achilles!

106
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,232
Are you hurt?

107
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,470
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

108
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,997
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

109
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,953
Eat.

110
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,919
I've known men like you my whole life.

111
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,434
No, you haven't.

112
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,239
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

113
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,749
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

114
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,270
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

115
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,754
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

116
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,912
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

117
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,312
Why did you choose this life?

118
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,948
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

119
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,915
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

120
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,352
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

121
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,118
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

122
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,152
Do you enjoy provoking me?

123
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,030
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

124
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,670
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

125
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,274
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

126
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,318
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

127
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,679
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

128
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,913
I'll tell you a secret...

129
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

130
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,395
The gods envy us.

131
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,110
They envy us because we're mortal.

132
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,318
Because any moment might be our last.

133
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,751
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

134
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,758
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

135
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,552
We will never be here again.

136
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,591
I thought you were a dumb brute.

137
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,951
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

138
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,474
Do it.

139
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,159
Nothing is easier.

140
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,594
Aren't you afraid?

141
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,151
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

142
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,478
Do it.

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,070
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

144
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,753
Many.

145
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,993
My lord, there's...

146
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,869
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

147
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,352
Gather the stores.

148
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,469
Agamemnon is a proud man.

149
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,829
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

150
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,150
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

151
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,794
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

152
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,955
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

153
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,476
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

154
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,119
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

155
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,872
Are we supposed to fear him?

156
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,716
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

157
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,193
We need you back.

158
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,118
Greece needs you.

159
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,479
Greece got along fine before I was born.

160
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,790
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

161
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,911
I'm not talking about the land.

162
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,196
The men need you.

163
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,039
Stay, Achilles.

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,638
You were born for this war.

165
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,998
Things are less simple today.

166
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,993
Women have a way
of complicating things.

167
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,717
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

168
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,871
But in this war, you're a servant.

169
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,032
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

170
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,233
I hope you understand that one day.

171
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,037
We're going home?

172
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,599
We sail in the morning.

173
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,070
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

174
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,994
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

175
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,434
These are our countrymen.

176
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,478
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

177
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,632
Someone has to lose.

178
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,479
The gods favor our cause.

179
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,598
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

180
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,269
Their morale is battered.

181
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,477
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

182
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,392
And they will run.

183
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,275
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

184
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,158
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

185
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,880
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

186
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,471
If they decide to attack us, let them.

187
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,473
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

188
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,789
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

189
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,756
We should not return the favor.

190
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,439
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

191
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,990
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

192
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,993
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

193
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.

194
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,751
Am I still your captive?

195
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,033
You're my guest.

196
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,512
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

197
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,272
You should leave then.

198
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,871
Would you leave this all behind?

199
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,752
Would you leave Troy?

200
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,992
Hold those barricades!

201
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,877
Archers to the rear.

202
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,790
Achilles.

203
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,952
Achilles.

204
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,313
Now!

205
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,273
Forward!

206
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,193
Enough for one day.

207
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,032
Yes.

208
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,393
Back to the ships!

209
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,869
Back to the ships!

210
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,272
It was his cousin.

211
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,959
To Troy!

212
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,673
- Back to the city!
- Back to the city!

213
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,159
To Troy!

214
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,230
We were going to sail home today.

215
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

216
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,997
Achilles.

217
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,477
You violated my command.

218
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,870
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

219
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,474
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

220
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,676
You led them into combat.

221
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,599
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

222
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,990
Where's Patroclus?

223
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,752
Patroclus!

224
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,070
We thought he was you, my lord.

225
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,316
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

226
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,198
He even moved like you.

227
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,631
Where is he?

228
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,197
- Where?
- He's dead, my lord.

229
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,113
Hector cut his throat.

230
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,395
Don't!

231
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,632
Where are you taking me?

232
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,117
Do you remember how to get here?

233
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,232
Yes.

234
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,352
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

235
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,592
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

236
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,149
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

237
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,629
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

238
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,392
Why are you telling me this?

239
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,911
- lf I die...
- No.

240
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,594
...I don't know how long
the city will stand.

241
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,354
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

242
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,751
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

243
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,195
- Please.
- The women, they'll take as slaves.

244
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,069
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
- Why are you saying such things?

245
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,278
Because I want you to be ready.

246
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,033
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

247
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,597
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

248
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,752
I killed a boy today.

249
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,192
And he was young.

250
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,072
He was much too young.

251
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,040
That boy has just saved this war for us.

252
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,030
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

253
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,872
I need my armor.

254
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,833
No.

255
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,354
Don't go!

256
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,116
Rope!

257
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,555
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

258
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,757
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

259
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,991
Please.

260
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,634
No.

261
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,591
Hector!

262
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,198
Hector!

263
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,677
Hector!

264
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,913
Hector!

265
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,477
Father...

266
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,915
...forgive me for any offenses.

267
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,830
I've served you as best as I could.

268
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,992
Hector!

269
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,395
May the gods be with you.

270
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,078
Hector.

271
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,597
No father ever had a better son.

272
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,513
Hector!

273
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,958
Apollo guard you, my prince.

274
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,273
You're the best man I know.

275
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,037
You're a prince of Troy.

276
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,239
I know you'll make me proud.

277
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,200
Hector!

278
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,590
Remember what I told you.

279
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,238
You don't have to go. You don't.

280
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,238
You remember what I told you.

281
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,109
Hector!

282
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,468
Hector!

283
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,480
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

284
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,799
I'll make a pact with you.

285
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,716
With the gods as our witnesses...

286
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,351
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

287
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,398
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

288
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,275
Now you know who you're fighting.

289
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,159
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

290
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,314
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

291
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,391
You gave him the honor of your sword.

292
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,111
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

293
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,273
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

294
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,115
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

295
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,514
Get up, prince of Troy.

296
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,873
Get up. I won't let
a stone take my glory.

297
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,837
You lost your cousin.

298
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,352
Now you've taken mine.

299
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,238
When does it end?

300
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,832
It never ends.

301
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,233
Who are you?

302
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,032
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

303
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,754
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

304
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,112
Priam?

305
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,759
How did you get in here?

306
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,708
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

307
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,355
You're a brave man.

308
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,317
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

309
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,309
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

310
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,468
I watched my eldest son die...

311
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,349
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

312
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,190
Give him back to me.

313
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,153
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

314
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,596
Give him to me.

315
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,672
He killed my cousin.

316
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,751
He thought it was you.

317
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,834
How many cousins have you killed?

318
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,029
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

319
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,709
How many, brave Achilles?

320
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,591
I knew your father.

321
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,910
He died before his time.

322
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,114
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

323
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,360
You have taken everything from me.

324
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,119
My eldest son...

325
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,478
...heir to my throne...

326
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,797
...defender of my kingdom.

327
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,191
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

328
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,637
But give me this small mercy.

329
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,315
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

330
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,517
...till the moment you closed them.

331
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,718
Let me wash his body.

332
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,357
Let me say the prayers.

333
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,236
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

334
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,990
If I let you walk out of here...

335
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,077
...if I let you take him...

336
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,556
...it doesn't change anything.

337
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,640
You're still my enemy in the morning.

338
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,632
You're still my enemy tonight.

339
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,076
But even enemies can show respect.

340
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,359
I admire your courage.

341
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,438
Meet me outside in a moment.

342
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,238
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

343
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,189
Your son was the best I've fought.

344
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,840
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

345
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,191
It is the same in my country.

346
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,430
Then the prince will have that honor.

347
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,956
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

348
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,159
Briseis?

349
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,395
I thought you were dead.

350
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,914
You are free.

351
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,478
If I hurt you...

352
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,710
...it's not what I wanted.

353
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,239
Go.

354
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,437
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

355
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,758
Come, my girl.

356
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,509
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

357
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,717
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

358
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,919
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

359
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,116
Peace!

360
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,994
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

361
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,912
This is the time to attack!

362
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,039
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

363
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,794
I will smash their walls to the ground...

364
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,428
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

365
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,114
Hear me, Zeus!

366
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,512
I will smash their walls to the ground.

367
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,353
That's good.

368
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,551
For my son back home.

369
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,559
Well, Odysseus.

370
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,991
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

371
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,515
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

372
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,718
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

373
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,840
I hope I never disappoint you again.

374
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,549
It's I who have been the disappointment.

375
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,720
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

376
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,952
Aren't you coming with us?

377
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,836
I have my own battle to fight.

378
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,912
Let me march beside you.

379
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,153
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

380
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,352
It's a beautiful night.

381
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,197
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

382
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,672
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

383
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,992
Open the gates!

384
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,352
Here.

385
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,232
Plague.

386
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,348
Don't go too close, my king.

387
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,070
This is the will of the gods.

388
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,231
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

389
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,073
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

390
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,028
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

391
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,875
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

392
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,998
What is this?

393
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,836
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

394
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,830
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

395
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,231
- I think we should burn it.
- Burn it?

396
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,556
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

397
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,149
Father, burn it.

398
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,999
Look at them.

399
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,795
You'd think their prince had never died.

400
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,871
You are the prince now.

401
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,556
Make your brother proud.

402
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,872
Briseis. Where is she?

403
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,190
- Where?
- I don't know.

404
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,032
Please. I have a son.

405
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,835
Then get him out of Troy.

406
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,314
Briseis!

407
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,998
Paris! Andromache!

408
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,112
Helen. We must go.

409
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,032
- Where?
- I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

410
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,918
Paris.

411
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,514
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

412
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,238
Briseis!

413
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,998
Paris!

414
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,312
Let it burn!

415
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,710
Let Troy burn!

416
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,077
Burn it! Burn it all!

417
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,597
Burn Troy!

418
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,275
Burn Troy!

419
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,956
It's a long way. Quick.

420
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,193
- Come.
- I stay.

421
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,510
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

422
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,999
I can't leave him.

423
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,516
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

424
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,070
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

425
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,118
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

426
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,191
The sword of Troy.

427
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,750
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

428
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,388
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

429
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,192
- I will.
- Hurry.

430
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,389
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

431
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,993
I'll find her.

432
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,912
Go.

433
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,232
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

434
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,719
Please don't leave me.

435
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,791
How could you love me if I ran now?

436
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,397
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

437
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,158
Go.

438
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,670
To the gate!

439
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,391
Soldiers of Troy...

440
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,875
...you men are warriors!

441
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,600
To lead you has been my honor!

442
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,910
My prince!

443
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,797
The boatman waits for us.

444
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,356
I say we make him wait a little longer!

445
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,513
Paris!

446
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,877
Paris!

447
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,751
Have you no honor?

448
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,318
Have you no honor?

449
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,194
Too late for prayer, priestess.

450
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,350
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

451
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,554
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

452
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,872
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

453
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,114
And at night...

454
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,752
Get up!

455
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,717
Hold her.

456
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,794
Come with me.

457
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,839
No!

458
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,952
Paris!

459
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,434
No!

460
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,438
Stop! Please!

461
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,990
Paris! Don't!

462
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,233
It's all right.

463
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,637
It's all right.

464
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,237
You gave me peace...

465
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,956
...in a lifetime of war.

466
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,633
Briseis, come.

467
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,273
Go.

468
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,554
You must.

469
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,433
No.

470
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,352
Troy is falling.

471
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,672
Go.

472
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,117
We must go. I know a way out.

473
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,474
It's all right.

474
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,518
Go.

475
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,709
Briseis, come.

476
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,677
Go.

477
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,198
Find peace...

478
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,553
...my brother.

479
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,357
If they ever tell my story, let them say...

480
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,909
...I walked with giants.

481
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,870
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

482
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,435
...but these names will never die.

483
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,870
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

484
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,076
...tamer of horses.

485
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,311
Let them say...

486
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,995
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
