1
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,671
- Good morning, Nancy.
- Good morning.

2
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Man walking.

3
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,000
Put your left hand on top of your head.

4
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Now the other one.

5
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
In the years since
my client's incarceration...

6
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,300
A 12-year sentence for manslaughter
during a bank robbery.

7
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,300
In the years since
Michael Bosworth's incarceration,

8
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,300
he's completed the Johns Hopkins
creative writing workshop.

9
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,300
In addition, I present the court
two letters of character reference

10
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,300
from nationally known authors.

11
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,900
I'll produce transcripts from the mothers
of two men he shot down in the past.

12
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,700
I'll also point out that Michael Bosworth's
IQ has been measured above 130.

13
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
The prosecution concedes that
Michael Bosworth is very intelligent.

14
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
But we also know
he always reverts to violence.

15
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
The charge before the court
is attempted murder.

16
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,300
It defies all reason that Bosworth
would jeopardise a flawless prison record

17
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
by attacking a guard...

18
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm not a case history.

19
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,000
The defendant will speak
only when spoken to.

20
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,200
Bailiffs, sit this man down.

21
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm just pro bono work
for her rich daddy's law firm.

22
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Bailiffs, sit the man down.

23
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,600
I wanna go pro per.
I demand to represent myself.

24
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,400
My life is in jeopardy
from every guard in that prison.

25
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,600
And Nancy Breyers' defence is trivial,
unsuitable, weak and defeatist.

26
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,300
Mr Bosworth, if necessary,
I will have you gagged and bound.

27
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,100
Ms Breyers has represented you
diligently these past weeks.

28
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,300
You are fighting for your life.
You may not go pro per.

29
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,300
Your Honour, may I be permitted
to confer with my client in private?

30
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,100
I got nothing to say to you.

31
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
- Permission granted.
- I got nothing to say.

32
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
Man walking.

33
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,500
- I'm gonna grab a sandwich.
- You got it.

34
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Stand right here.

35
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,600
Ma'am.

36
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,200
Hold it right there, buddy.
You stay here.

37
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,900
I am trying to think what more I can do
to convince you of my competence.

38
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,500
Please, I worked very hard to help you.

39
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Please, I've worked very hard.

40
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
Relax, cowboy.

41
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,900
Hook him up. Hook him up.

42
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,500
Better do what he says.
Please put your hands behind your back.

43
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
Son of a bitch.

44
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Whatever I do,
it's only because I need you.

45
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,500
- Say you need me.
- I need you.

46
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,100
- I want you to act scared of me.
- I am scared of you.

47
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
- I knew something'd go wrong.
- You got no faith.

48
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,700
Nancy. Hi. I thought you were
supposed to be in court this morning.

49
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,600
I gotta get going.

50
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll wait for you...
Open your eyes and look at me!

51
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,100
I'll wait for you as long as it takes.

52
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Nancy! Nancy!

53
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,900
My brother knows what he's doing.
Open the door!

54
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
- Where's the lawyer?
- Get outta here!

55
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,900
Nancy, are you OK?

56
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
- Daddy!
- Hey, Zack. How you doin'?

57
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,100
- OK.
- Is Mom in?

58
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,900
Come and see Mommy.

59
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,500
- Hey, Mom! It's Daddy.
- What are you doing in shorts?

60
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
It's almost winter. Go up and get changed.

61
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,600
You're not supposed
to be here till this afternoon.

62
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Hey.

63
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm surprised you guys
are talking to each other.

64
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,500
I love your hair like that.
It's beautiful when you wear it that way.

65
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
- Come on.
- I'm late.

66
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,200
Mom, Kyle will be driving me
to riding class after school.

67
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,700
If it makes you feel better,
she's harder on me when we're alone.

68
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,800
Hey, come here. I want to talk to you.

69
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,700
She still going out with Kyle?

70
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Nora?

71
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Nora?

72
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
I never liked that kid.

73
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,400
Kids his age are supposed
to be cocky, full of life.

74
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,900
You know what I mean?

75
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,700
- Trouble is, Kyle thinks too much.
- We can't all be full of surprises like you.

76
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,300
Kyle's reliable.
She says if she marries him,

77
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,000
she won't have to worry about him
running off with some female half his age.

78
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,000
- Of course, I'm only quoting.
- That is not fair, Nora.

79
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,200
- OK, so Karen is 24 years old. So what?
- Fair?

80
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Is that what you still think
life has to be, Tim? Fair?

81
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,000
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna grow up?

82
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,500
I am trying.

83
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
I came to tell you that Karen is over.
I've broken up with her.

84
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Poor baby. Abandoned at her tender age.

85
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,100
- I came hoping to talk with you.
- What are we doing, wrestling?

86
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
You're never here when I pick up Zack.

87
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
We have nothing more
to say to each other.

88
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,500
You wanna talk to me, talk.
Then leave me alone.

89
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,500
- They're at it again.
- Go put on your pants, OK?

90
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
Do you need any money?
Anything you and the kids need?

91
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,400
- Please, Tim, not that!
- What do you want?

92
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
What I have always wanted.

93
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,300
Somebody I can trust.
Somebody I can depend on.

94
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,500
Not you.

95
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,500
I do want to tell you one thing.
I figured it out.

96
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,400
I took up with Karen
because she wasn't you.

97
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,900
Even dumb me figured that one out.

98
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,900
Now I've broken it up with her
because she wasn't like you.

99
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,400
I can't believe anything you say, Tim.

100
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,900
I don't blame you.
Are you sure you want to sell the house?

101
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,100
The kids are settled here, and
all the work you've put in and everything.

102
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
OK, I'm sorry.

103
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Too many bad memories, huh?

104
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,300
- And good ones.
- Good.

105
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,400
One thing you've gotta believe, Nora.
I never wanted to hurt you.

106
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
You struck out there.

107
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Hey, Zack, come on, let's go!

108
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,700
- Zack.
- There's a brontosaurus in the pool.

109
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,900
No way. They've been extinct
for more than a million years.

110
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,900
How about a kiss?

111
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Don't forget to tell your English teacher
the difference between "lie" and "lay".

112
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,800
- She'll flunk me for being a smart-ass.
- I doubt it.

113
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,100
Can I get a kiss? Just a friendly kiss?

114
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,500
Bye-bye, Mom. See you later.

115
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,100
- I'll call this afternoon. Will you be here?
- I don't think so.

116
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,500
- I'll leave a key under the mat.
- You take care, now.

117
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You too.

118
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,000
You sure?

119
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,300
Sorry.

120
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,300
See you later.

121
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,700
- Hey, young fella.
- Hi.

122
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,900
- You wanna drive?
- It'd be great.

123
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,200
- Move over.
- All right.

124
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,500
- Go on.
- Come on, Dad. Come on.

125
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,800
- Let's go.
- Bye, Mom! Bye! Bye, Mommy!

126
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Now what?

127
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Are you gonna take a swim?

128
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,700
I don't get it.
Won't the cops be looking for the car?

129
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,100
So they will, Albert, so they will.
But not this one.

130
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,800
- Feast your eyes, boys.
- It's a Jaguar.

131
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
- We're gonna steal a Jaguar?
- Where did you get the keys?

132
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,500
You know who God helps,
don't you, brother?

133
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,700
- I never even rode in a Jaguar before.
- Hey, I told you. That's my brother.

134
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,100
- Mike, can I drive?
- Sure, you can drive.

135
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,500
You can drive that beat-up old Cougar
right into the lake.

136
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Take this!

137
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,900
- Albert, can you whistle?
- Sure.

138
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want you to whistle so I can hear you.

139
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,700
I don't want you to stop unless you see
somebody comin' down the road.

140
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Hey, Albert!

141
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,500
Move the goddamn log out of the way!

142
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,300
Geronimo!

143
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Whoo! Mikey! Whoo! Mikey!

144
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,600
Mikey! Mikey!

145
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,100
She's good. She's real good.

146
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,400
You gotta hand it to her -
she's holdin' up real well.

147
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,100
And I hate playing
good cop, bad cop. It's bullshit.

148
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,200
I was too hard on her.

149
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,300
The lady is a liar. Among other things.

150
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,300
- How do you get that?
- I've got a feeling.

151
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Call it women's intuition.

152
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,000
- Bob? Bob?
- Yeah?

153
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,100
This is Carl Ornitz from the US Attorney's
office. He has some news for us.

154
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,300
Not news for the good of mankind,
I assume.

155
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,900
When Bosworth
was originally prosecuted,

156
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,100
a significant part of the government's
case was excluded from the trial

157
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,800
because of an inadmissible confession.

158
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,700
When he was being pursued
he broke into a liquor store.

159
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,800
He wanted to take the clerk with him.
The owner resisted. He was found shot.

160
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
A couple of weeks later,
Bosworth was arrested.

161
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,900
He confessed to the crime
before he was read his rights.

162
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,500
We think he confessed on purpose.

163
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,300
He was never tried for murder,
only for armed robbery.

164
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,900
The thing is he had a prior conviction
for burglary. The people were at home.

165
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
- He held 'em hostage...
- And?

166
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,400
- And, as usual, somebody got dead.
- Are you gonna file on her?

167
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Better. I'm lettin' her go.

168
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,400
What are you talking about?
I haven't even done my affidavit yet.

169
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's get a Title-3 for her phone.

170
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,000
Evidence won't help us with this lady,
even if we had cold proof.

171
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,300
Even if that marshal recovers, she'd waltz
into court and say she was mesmerised.

172
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,700
"He made me do it." Temporary insanity.

173
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Look at her. She's too smart.

174
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
I want her to be free as a kite.

175
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,700
I want her to go to him
because she wants him.

176
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,100
Then we'll take the lovebirds together.

177
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,800
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

178
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,500
I liked the one with the swimming pool.
That's pretty nice.

179
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,900
I think we should get the hell outta here.

180
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Son of a bitch.

181
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Yeah, my heating has gone.
My house was freezing last night.

182
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
- What's the address again?
- 1448 Whitney Drive.

183
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,300
- When can you get someone out here?
- We're really backed up.

184
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,900
We'll get someone out there
as soon as we can.

185
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,100
Is that soon as in "real soon",
or soon as in "whenever we feel like it"?

186
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,800
Do I put it on the radio or not?

187
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,600
Yeah. OK, just get somebody
out here, please. Thank you.

188
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,100
Calm.

189
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Good morning. You called about
a winter cover for your pool?

190
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,800
What? No, I'm sorry. This house is sold.

191
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,300
Unless my husband may have called.

192
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,800
- Yes, it was your husband.
- But, no. He'd have told me about this.

193
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,700
If you scream, your children will come
home and find you in a pool of blood.

194
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,700
Please, what do you want?

195
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Hey, there's a swimming pool
in the back. And it's heated.

196
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,100
- Someone left a bikini on the grass.
- That's my daughter's.

197
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,100
Oh, yeah? How old? Is she cute?

198
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Keys to the station wagon?

199
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,800
- The keys?
- I can help you. You're scared now.

200
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,100
The fear will pass.
You'll feel proud of yourself.

201
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,300
And I'll feel proud of you.

202
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
The keys.

203
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
No one's gonna hurt you.

204
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
I promise.

205
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
OK? You're gonna learn to trust me.

206
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,800
You probably can't absorb
any of this right now.

207
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,700
But you and I are gonna be friends.

208
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Would you like to go upstairs
and put something else on?

209
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,600
Albert! What are you doing up there?

210
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,700
Albert, were you in Nora's bedroom?

211
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,300
You are never to enter that bedroom
without Nora's permission.

212
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,100
I parked the Jag in the garage.

213
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,100
Let's just take the car and go.
I don't like it here.

214
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,300
Then you leave.

215
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,800
You're only here because when I was
in prison, my brother needed your help.

216
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I want you to go through the house.
Look for money and jewellery.

217
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Nora, sit down. Sit down.
I wanna reassure you.

218
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,700
- You have a daughter, May?
- How did you know her name?

219
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,600
I was going through
your husband's letters, and... She's 15.

220
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,300
- Then there's the younger child.
- Zack, he's...

221
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,000
He's eight? They come home
from school around what time?

222
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,200
Nora, don't make me resent the kids
before I even meet them.

223
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Zack gets dropped off around three.

224
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,500
- By a carpool?
- Yes.

225
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,800
Does the parent come to the door?

226
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,800
No. Picking the children up is hectic
enough without dropping them off.

227
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,900
Give me a break, lady.

228
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,900
Do you think you could
speak on the telephone without crying?

229
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If you can, we can be outta here
a hell of a lot faster.

230
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,900
- Yes, anything.
- You're a strong woman, Nora.

231
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,100
- Smart men love strong women.
- What if they tap Nancy's phone?

232
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,900
She's a victim. They'd never suspect her.

233
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm a very fair man, Nora.

234
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,400
I'd never hurt anyone
unless they were trying to hurt me.

235
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I swear it.

236
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,900
Here's what I want you to say:

237
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,700
"Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.
Just called to gossip. Nothing important."

238
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,100
And I want you to leave her
this number. All right?

239
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
Now you try it.

240
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,400
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

241
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,200
- Just nothing important. Just called...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,900
I want you to smile.
OK, there. That's it. Big smile.

243
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,500
You've got a beautiful smile.

244
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,600
You try it.

245
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,600
Smile.

246
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,600
Hi, this is Nancy. Please leave
your message after the beep.

247
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,500
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

248
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,800
Nothing important. Just called to say hi.

249
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Call me back at 555-4810.

250
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Bye.

251
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,100
Good girl.

252
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,400
Nora! Nora!

253
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Come on, open up, Nora.

254
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Open the door.

255
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
Come on. I want to apologise.

256
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I'll camp outside.

257
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,400
I once waited in line two days.

258
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,100
Tickets for the World Series,
so I mean business.

259
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,700
Open up! I'm gonna break in,
like the big, bad wolf.

260
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,500
Nora!

261
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm not gonna ask again.

262
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Open up!

263
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,000
Hey! Anyone home?

264
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,000
Nora?

265
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,900
Hey. I wanna apologise for this morning.

266
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,200
- Tim!
- No! No!

267
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,800
Enough! Enough!

268
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,800
- He was gonna use it on me!
- Enough!

269
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,900
- Albert, you're frightening Nora.
- I don't give a shit.

270
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,900
Everything's under control.

271
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,700
Timmy's got the idea.

272
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,600
- He's gonna do exactly as we say.
- Are you gonna be all right?

273
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,000
What the fuck is going on?
Who are these guys?

274
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,300
He's gonna be just fine,
as soon as he figures out the rules.

275
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Here's $500.

276
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,000
MasterCard. Visa. Take it. Take it all.

277
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Are you considering the options now?
Force? Negotiation?

278
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,300
Maybe a little psychology?

279
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,100
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting for my fiancée.

280
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,700
I just want a place to relax.

281
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,000
- What if the police followed you?
- I won't lie to you.

282
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,900
If they touch me, they touch you.

283
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,400
- Why here? Why my house?
- Fate.

284
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,900
Besides, this isn't your house any longer.
I saw a "for sale" sign out front.

285
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
- There's a kid out there.
- "For sale" is a trouble sign.

286
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,100
We can leave now. Take me as a hostage.

287
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
- You think before you act.
- Mom, I'm hungry!

288
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,800
Hit him. You want to beat Tyson?

289
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,700
- Yeah.
- Duck and hit from the same side he did.

290
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm not even past Bald Bull.

291
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,000
When you get your start button,
use it as soon as you get it.

292
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,600
Hey, Zack, what's goin' on?

293
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,300
- Mom? Mommy!
- Don't ever touch my kid!

294
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
- Mommy!
- Zack.

295
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,500
Let's all relax. I got
some questions I want answers to.

296
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,100
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- It's not safe with the kids around.

297
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,900
You're not around here
to protect Nora any longer.

298
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,900
Did you get a gun when Timmy left?

299
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
No guns.

300
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,100
So, is there any chance that anyone
from your office would be stopping by?

301
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,100
What does a man like you
do to have all this?

302
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,800
I was a corporate lawyer, but I quit
so I could defend psychopaths like you.

303
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,500
Wally, I want you to take the brat
into the other room. Now.

304
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,900
- What are they gonna do to me?
- It's OK. We'll play some TV.

305
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,300
I won't hurt him. It's OK.

306
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,300
- Move it, Wally.
- Mommy!

307
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
It'll be OK.

308
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,700
You were once a successful lawyer
and you gave it all up

309
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,300
to work for something more meaningful?

310
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,900
- Gee, why did you do that?
- You wanna know the truth?

311
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,600
I watched too many Westerns.
I wanted to be the sheriff.

312
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,300
Nora, what did you have
prepared for dinner?

313
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I have a turkey.
Anything else you want?

314
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:21,100
I'd like to wash. Nora, you don't suppose
Timmy has any fresh shirts in the closet?

315
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,100
I like to dress for dinner.

316
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,300
- How did he talk you into this, Wally?
- Nobody talked me into nothing.

317
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Really? Seems to me
you're in deep shit, kid.

318
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,300
A man is not a gentleman unless
he knows how to mix a proper martini,

319
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
or tie a proper bow tie.

320
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.
Nothing important.

321
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,200
Just called to say hi.
Call me back at 555-4810.

322
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
555-4810.

323
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,000
- Where's the heat in this place?
- It doesn't work.

324
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Better be careful with these things, Sheriff.

325
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,300
You could get yourself hurt.

326
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,100
Shouldn't your girlfriend
have called by now?

327
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,900
And yours?

328
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Mike! Michael, it's the news!

329
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,000
Attorney Nancy Breyers
says it's a miracle

330
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,700
escaped killer Michael Bosworth
did not kill her.

331
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,500
- Police report she's cooperating...
- I knew we should get out of here.

332
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,900
She's cooperating.
I told you she would do that.

333
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,500
- You heard that, right?
- Now for the latest weather...

334
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,500
You're as thick as two bricks.

335
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,700
Don't you see that
the more she cooperates

336
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,800
the more they're going to
think she's a victim?

337
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,200
Will you do me a favour, Wally?

338
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,900
- Don't think.
- Don't talk to me like Albert.

339
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,300
- I'm your brother.
- Right, come here.

340
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,600
Don't you understand, huh?
Listen to me. Look at me.

341
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,300
I love her. She's the only person
that I'd die for.

342
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,100
Now you get it together.

343
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,500
- Look at you. You're blushing.
- Is he gonna come in?

344
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,600
He never does.

345
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
- She's some piece of work.
- Don't hurt her. Don't let him.

346
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,100
I didn't mean any disrespect.

347
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,800
I would never hurt
your daughter, or any girl.

348
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's the old spirit, Tim.
Take it all the way. Come on.

349
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,600
If that kid comes in here,
I'm gonna start with you.

350
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,500
Hi, Kyle. Hi, honey.

351
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,400
- Daddy, hi.
- Hi.

352
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,800
- You mad at me?
- Mad at you? No. I love you.

353
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,900
I love you. Hey, you know what?

354
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,300
Look, why don't I buy you guys dinner?
Just go and have some fun.

355
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,900
Mom wants you to spend the weekend
with me. I'll see you over at my place.

356
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,200
I can't. I work tonight, sir.

357
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,700
Take the night off.
I'll pay double time. Go on, take it.

358
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,500
Hey, May! May!

359
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,200
May! Come back. May!

360
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,700
There's nothing we can do, May.

361
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,300
Give me back my Walkman.

362
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,900
No!

363
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,100
Easy, Albert! Easy, easy! Easy, Albert!

364
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,700
- What?
- Easy.

365
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,700
What the fuck is going on here?

366
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,800
May, I'm getting really angry.

367
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,200
You wanna point your gun at someone,
point it at me.

368
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,500
- Wanna threaten someone? Threaten me.
- Sheriff, you just don't get it.

369
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
May, listen to me. You do as they say.

370
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,600
They're very dangerous.

371
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
They're fucking idiots.

372
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,400
- Stop it!
- No, Daddy!

373
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,300
Albert, put him down.

374
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,900
No! Daddy!

375
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,200
Stop it!

376
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,700
- It's not over.
- I promised Nora no one's gonna get hurt.

377
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,900
Nora, please sit down.

378
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,900
- Zack.
- Yes, Daddy?

379
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
Now it's way past your bedtime.

380
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,300
- OK, Daddy.
- Zack.

381
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,100
- What?
- What do you wanna do?

382
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,100
- I don't know. Play Nintendo, maybe.
- You're going to bed. We have rules.

383
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,900
You're not giving the orders
in the house any more, Timmy.

384
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,300
There's too many rules.
Zack, go play.

385
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Live a little.

386
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,700
- Good night, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you.

387
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,000
- Daddy, don't let him hurt us.
- I know. Come on, come on.

388
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,300
Be strong, kid. I'm proud of you.
You're gonna be fine.

389
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,700
No, Daddy, please.
I don't want to go. I'm scared.

390
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,500
You're gonna be fine. Come on.

391
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,500
- Come on.
- OK.

392
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,500
OK, OK.

393
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,300
Hey, Zack, where you goin'?

394
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,100
I'm goin' to bed!

395
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,500
You live by too many rules.

396
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,500
- I certainly feel sorry for Nora.
- Take your hands off her.

397
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,700
- Is that another rule, Tim?
- You bet.

398
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,500
There's a guy out there!
I think he's a plumber or something.

399
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,000
From the heating company. Somebody
was supposed to come this morning.

400
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,900
You get rid of 'em.

401
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,000
- I called you this morning.
- You're my fifteenth service call today.

402
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,100
You have to pay whether I come in or not.

403
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,100
- It's too late! My kids are already asleep.
- You still have to pay. $48,06.

404
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,100
I have to get a cheque.

405
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,700
48 bucks, for not doing a damn thing.

406
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,600
That's why America's becoming a
second-rate country. I wouldn't pay him.

407
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,000
What difference does it make?
I thought you wanted him to go!

408
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
It's the principle.

409
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,800
You could have been 1,000 miles away.

410
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,200
- Now you're trapped here.
- You're tryin' to fuck me up.

411
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm not listening.

412
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Write another cheque.

413
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,000
You get rid of him.

414
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,700
- Want a receipt?
- A cancelled cheque will be fine.

415
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,100
You OK?

416
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,100
Liar.

417
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,800
Nora?

418
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,300
Hey! Hold it! I know how to use it.

419
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,700
Let her go!

420
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,400
May, go upstairs. Now.

421
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,500
Let her go, Wally.

422
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,500
Let her go, Wally.

423
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,700
Albert, huh? Albert for Nora?

424
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,900
I read your letters to Nora, Tim.

425
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,600
You both want to rekindle
your passion for life.

426
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,000
Hey, I know that feeling.
I know that feeling.

427
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,700
And you're both liars. Mendacity is
the great sin that's destroying America.

428
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,800
And I'm a living reproach to you,
cos I'm an honest man.

429
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,700
You wanna destroy me,
but you're no match for me.

430
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,100
It's a judgement call, Tim.

431
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,000
Huh? It's your move.
You wanna play this game?

432
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,200
But you gotta be willing to go all the way.

433
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,800
Come on. Come on.

434
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,000
Come on.

435
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,900
Don't hurt him!

436
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,100
I really like this family,
but you're pushing my patience.

437
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,600
- He was gonna cut my throat.
- So what?

438
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,900
Albert! Albert!

439
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,100
- What are we doing?
- You idiot!

440
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,900
You see what happens
when you lie, Nora?

441
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,600
You're lucky he's still alive.

442
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,700
Get Timmy upstairs now.

443
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,900
You need stitches.
May, help me with this. May!

444
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,200
- Are you OK, Dad?
- May!

445
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,700
Put your finger up there.

446
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,800
Tim, you can't go on
taking chances like that. You can't.

447
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,000
- You just don't know...
- There's nothing else to do.

448
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,500
- Move your hand, Zack.
- I'm gonna be OK.

449
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,100
Everything will be fine. They'll leave soon.

450
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,000
- Rip me off some tape.
- Why not shoot them with Mommy's gun?

451
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,300
What? You got a gun?
Where'd you get a gun?

452
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,300
- I bought it when you left.
- Why?

453
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,500
I was scared at night. I was afraid at night!

454
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,800
- You got a gun?
- Pull me off some tape.

455
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Where's the gun, Mom?

456
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,600
Clipped on top of that cabinet.

457
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,200
More tape. Tape! Hurry, Zack.

458
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,700
- I'm trying, Mommy.
- Quietly, OK?

459
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,100
- Here?
- More.

460
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,400
- Mom, the gun is not here.
- It is up there somewhere.

461
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,400
One of the retards must have found it.

462
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,000
I'm sure Bosworth doesn't know, anyway.

463
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,600
May, remember when you jumped
from here to the garage roof?

464
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,600
She broke her arm.

465
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,000
I was a little girl then. I could make it now.

466
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,900
It's a closer angle from Zack's room.
Can you try it? Just jumping off.

467
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,100
Daddy, I'm too scared.

468
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,600
You know heights make him dizzy.
I won't let them take the chance.

469
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,500
- What if they fall or get caught?
- They're in the same situation as now.

470
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,500
Isn't it worth a chance?

471
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,600
Thanks.

472
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,500
- Zack, don't try till it's light.
- No. No!

473
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,100
- OK.
- What if Bosworth is telling the truth?

474
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,000
What if he really doesn't mean to hurt us?

475
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,800
Michael wants the children to sleep
in their own room tonight.

476
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,700
Zack, come on. I'll tell you a story.

477
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,200
Zack, I'll tell you a story.

478
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,300
Zack.

479
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
See you in the morning.

480
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,700
If they make it out tonight, we won't be
Bosworth's favourite family any more.

481
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,700
I hold you responsible
for everything that's happened, Tim.

482
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,800
He kept his word.

483
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,700
Nobody got hurt
until you broke your word.

484
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Nora, everything that happened
up to now doesn't matter, doesn't exist.

485
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,500
Yesterday we were bickering about
who got to keep the golf membership.

486
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,000
You can't believe him, Nora.
You have to trust me.

487
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,400
You have to trust me.

488
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,800
I just wanna go to sleep.

489
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,100
I just wanna go to sleep
and never wake up.

490
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,300
Here.

491
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,200
I love you.

492
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,000
- She's going to cross the state line.
- Of course she is.

493
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,300
I hate it when you talk like
you already know what's happening.

494
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,200
Hate is a strong word, Bob.
Just stay with her.

495
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,400
The primary's stopping at a phone booth.

496
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,900
I can't make out the number.

497
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,900
I'm sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialled.

498
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,200
Please check the number and dial again.

499
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,500
Tell Tail-End Charlie to pick up
the number on that payphone,

500
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,600
call the phone company
and find out who she called at 7.15 am.

501
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,500
Goddammit. Stay with her.

502
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,300
This bitch is gonna get us killed.

503
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,100
We're losing her.

504
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,700
Let the state police book her,
but make sure they keep it quiet.

505
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,100
I want Bosworth to be expecting her.

506
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,700
While Romeo waits,
we'll have a chat with Juliet.

507
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,200
You answer it.

508
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,600
Hello.

509
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,900
Hello, Kyle.

510
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,100
I'll have to see if she's here. Hold on.

511
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,200
It's for May.

512
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,500
May?

513
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,700
- May!
- Wally, bring the kids down, now.

514
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
I'm here.

515
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,400
Hi.

516
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,500
Hi. I'm sorry, Dad.

517
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,300
You're sorry about what?

519
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:08,200
- Sorry to be here with people like you.
- May, it's Kyle.

520
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

521
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,200
I called you at your dad's.

522
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,500
He went out of town.

523
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,100
Do you want to meet me
at the lake in an hour?

524
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,600
No, I'm busy.

525
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,500
You were going to be with me today.

526
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,200
Well?

527
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,100
Hello?

528
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
- What are you being such a bitch for?
- Because I am.

529
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,700
Now, you can't stay here much longer.

530
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Somebody's bound to notice.
People see things.

531
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,900
People see what they wanna see.

532
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,700
Hey, May, why don't you
make us some coffee?

533
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,400
Go on, honey. Go on.

534
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,500
- I'll go with her.
- It's OK, I'll go.

535
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,300
What about the other kid?

536
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,600
Go upstairs and get him.

537
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Michael!

538
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,000
Hey, Mike! Mike!

539
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Zack!

540
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,300
I don't know if you should be
climbing around like that.

541
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,200
- Hey, that's a big drop.
- Hello.

542
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,100
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?

543
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,800
Is Mrs Cornell in?

544
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,400
I'm Ed Tallent, her real-estate man.

545
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,100
Somethin' wrong here?

546
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,300
Nothing's wrong, real-estate man.
Get in here.

547
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,500
Ed! Christ, Ed.
What the hell are you doing here?

548
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,300
Ed, for God's sake.

549
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,000
I just came by to tell Nora there were
some problems with the closing.

550
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,600
I think that we may not be able
to make escrow by Christmas.

551
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,100
- Zack, May. Go upstairs, now.
- But...

552
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,600
Don't argue with me! Get outta here.

553
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,200
This is not good, Michael.

554
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,100
Now, look. Ed can stay with us till you go.
He won't be a problem.

555
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,900
There's a lady raking leaves,
looking over here.

556
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,600
Albert, now is not the time
to do something dumb.

557
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,200
- I say he cannot stay here.
- Albert!

558
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,600
You won't be here that much longer.

559
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,500
Ed can stay in the basement if you want.

560
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,300
We can all stay down there if it
makes you easier. I give you my word.

561
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,800
Come on, I swear it.

562
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,300
Now maybe you'll understand.

563
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,600
God. Oh, God.

564
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,000
- What is she doing? Jesus Christ.
- Calm down, Albert.

565
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,400
Albert, just calm down.

566
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,100
He doesn't care about you, Albert.
You're not part of his planning.

567
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,700
- He's gonna kill you too.
- You know, Albert, you're so dumb.

568
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,300
I can't take it here, Michael.

569
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,600
We're gonna go right now.
And I'm not foolin' around.

570
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Albert, where did you get the gun?

571
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,300
Where'd you get the gun, Albert?

572
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
I found it.

573
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Nora. Hey, Nora, did you lie to me?

574
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,900
I didn't mean to lie to you.

575
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,600
I didn't mean to lie, but you lied to us.
You said you'd be gone by midnight!

576
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,500
Shut up! Shut up!

577
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,700
Goddammit, Albert,
gimme the gun. Gimme the gun.

578
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,600
I can't handle this. It's too much.

579
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
I'm going.

580
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,400
Well, why not?

581
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,700
- You can go.
- What are you talking about?

582
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,700
It's best we split up now.

583
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Do me a favour before you go, Albert.

584
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,700
- Get rid of the dead.
- You mean that...

585
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,400
I can go?

586
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,700
Yeah.

587
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Yeah, you head south.

588
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,200
And we'll all meet up in Juárez.

589
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,800
What the hell's goin' on here, Mike?

590
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,900
I'm killing two birds with one stone.

591
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,500
Timmy and his family want us to leave.

592
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,200
Then they're gonna have to help us.

593
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,600
- How?
- You're gonna have to drop by the bank.

594
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,400
- Ten thousand would be just fine.
- I don't have that much money.

595
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,300
- You gonna start lying to me again?
- Someone's gonna have to go with him.

596
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,300
- He's gonna go straight to the police!
- What did I tell you?

597
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,900
Stop thinkin'. He's goin' all by himself.

598
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,300
He's mad, but he's scared.

599
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,100
Come on.

600
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,800
I'll see you guys in Mexico.

601
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Mexico. Definitely Mexico.

602
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,400
I've never been alone.

603
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,700
Not since...

604
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,100
I met Wally when we were little kids.

605
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Get the door.

606
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,400
Got only one thing for you
to think about out there.

607
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:30,100
Any red-light show,
any sirens, they get it first.

608
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Not you, them. You think about that.

609
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,500
Good morning, sir.

610
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,100
- Sorry.
- She was next.

611
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,500
We usually require your wife's signature.

612
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,600
My wife's not well.
I've been banking here for 14 years.

613
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,900
I opened the account myself
and I want to close it out myself.

614
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,800
- I'll have to talk to Mr Nelson.
- Is he in? Good.

615
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,100
Mr Cornell? You know there's a penalty
for cashing these certificates out?

616
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,200
I know that. But it's unavoidable, you see.

617
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,600
I just need the cash. It's an emergency.

618
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,400
If you'll sign right there,
I'll cash you out, Mr Cornell.

619
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,000
- Cashiers' cheque?
- No, cash, please.

620
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,100
Cash.

621
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,600
And one more, please.

622
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,100
- Very kind of you. Thank you.
- It'll be a moment.

623
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,300
Here you are, Mr Cornell.
But please count it.

624
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,900
I'm sure it's OK. Thanks.

625
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,900
Thanks a lot.

626
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,300
Who's next, please?

627
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,700
The FBI announced today it will not
file charges against Nancy Breyers

628
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,300
in connection with the escape
of accused killer Michael Bosworth.

629
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Breyers was not available for comment.

630
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,200
We'll keep you posted
with further information as it b...

631
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,600
- She's in control.
- So why doesn't she call?

632
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,300
She will.

633
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,700
She will?

634
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,200
What do you find so amusing?

635
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,000
You.

636
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,100
Wally.

637
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,900
Looks like you won
the Vietnam war all by yourself.

638
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,800
That's a good boy.

639
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I knew you wouldn't take any chances.

640
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
- What have you got?
- I'm not sure.

641
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,600
A body's been found
in the south of the county.

642
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,300
A real-estate agent named Ed Tallent,
shot at point-blank range.

643
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,100
- It may mean nothing.
- Where was he found?

644
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,100
In a riverbed. His car is on the scene,
about five hours from here.

645
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,500
Probably does mean somethin'. Get me
the addresses of all his residential listings.

646
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,400
It's my opinion Bosworth believes
he can escape from anywhere.

647
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,200
I'd like to start settin' up
roadblocks in the area.

648
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:23,300
Request denied. Bosworth's in a house,
and there sure as hell are hostages.

649
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,000
That's the way he plays.

650
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,500
Your orders are to wait for me
to give you more orders.

651
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,500
Thank you, ma'am.

652
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,700
Maddox!

653
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,500
If you learn anything, don't drift away!

654
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,000
I'm just a cheap float in a stormy sea.

655
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,300
Yeah, it was beautiful. It was great.

656
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,400
I'll call you later.

657
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,700
Hey.

658
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,300
Which way are you guys goin'?

659
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,600
Sorry.

660
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,100
What college do you go to?

661
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,500
- Fuck off.
- Aw, come on.

662
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,900
I just need a lift a little ways. That's all.

663
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,900
- Go away, please!
- Come on.

664
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,700
Lisa, call the police now! Run! Run!

665
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,700
Get away from me!

666
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,700
We got a report of a man
covered in blood harassing two girls

667
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,600
at the gas station on Waxman Road.

668
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,300
We're there.

669
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,500
You, in the water!

670
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,400
Drop your weapon!

671
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,300
Hey! You, in the water!

672
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,500
Drop your weapon!

673
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,600
I'm not gonna tell you again!
Put the gun down!

674
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,000
Put the gun down!

675
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,900
That gun the kid was carrying
is registered to a Nora Cornell,

676
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
on Whitney Drive, which is right here.

677
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,500
Give me those residential listings.

678
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,700
On that call the primary placed from
the phone booth - it went to a residence.

679
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,500
Timothy and Nora Cornell,
1448 Whitney Drive.

680
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,900
You answer now.

681
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Start talking.

682
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,800
- What?
- Is Michael there?

683
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,700
Yes, he is.

684
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,900
If this is a trick,
you can kiss your family goodbye.

685
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,500
- Yes?
- Michael?

686
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,600
Nancy?

687
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,900
- Nancy! Where are you?
- I'm close.

688
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
- Did they believe you?
- Of course they believed me.

689
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,900
Baby, you're brilliant. Oh, you're brilliant!

690
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,200
Oh, God, I miss you.

691
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,700
We're at 1448 Whitney.
How long will it take?

692
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:26,700
- I can get there in less than an hour.
- You just be careful. You stay calm.

693
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,400
- Just think about us together.
- I will.

694
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,000
- I love you.
- I love you too.

695
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,200
She's on her way.

696
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,100
She's on her way. It's almost over, Timmy.

697
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,600
I'll be out of here in less than an hour.

698
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,700
What about us?

699
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,300
Timmy, have I ever
broken any promises to you?

700
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,800
Let's go!

701
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,500
- Where is she?
- She's back at the command post.

702
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,900
OK, let's have it. But make it fast.

703
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,800
All right. Right now,
she's officially just an innocent civilian.

704
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,400
- No charges.
- If she cooperates.

705
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,000
And if you send her in there
and anything happens tonight,

706
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,200
they'll have our ugly asses in court.

707
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,700
No, only one ass is involved.

708
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,600
Mine.

709
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
And what's ugly about it?

710
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:40,100
We've got exigent circumstances here.
The rules don't apply.

711
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,500
We've got a ticket to ride.

712
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,500
I just don't think it's worth the chance.

713
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,300
The guy is a fuckin' maniac.

714
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,000
- He's not afraid to die.
- Maddox is right.

715
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:58,400
It's only a matter of time
before we go tactical on this shithead.

716
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,700
Listen closely while I pull rank on you.

717
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,300
We're doin' it my way.

718
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,800
We will discuss it no more, for ever.

719
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,900
Get it off her. He'll search her.

720
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,300
- He trusts me.
- Get it off.

721
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,900
Remember now, all you have to do
is to get him to leave.

722
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,800
Once you're well away from here,
stop at some rest room down the road.

723
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,500
- We'll take it from there.
- I understand.

724
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,700
If you don't, you know what's
gonna happen to you, don't you?

725
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,600
I told you. I want to live.

726
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,300
- My knees are shaking.
- I can hear your knees.

727
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,500
You do this, no charges will be brought.
You can't turn your back now.

728
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,600
- If you do, we're gonna take casualties.
- I know. I know.

729
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,700
You think she'll think straight
when she's with Bosworth?

730
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,100
She's got her brains between her legs.

731
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,500
I can be inside that house in one minute.
Flashbangs at the door.

732
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,600
- We make a three-point entry, it's all over.
- We're givin' that family a chance.

733
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,500
The way they played along, maybe
they don't have any chance coming.

734
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,500
You don't give a damn, do you?

735
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,700
If it goes sideways,
we'll waste the whole neighbourhood.

736
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,700
Don't forget to smile when you see him.

737
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,000
He might want me to...

738
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,300
Well, smile when you do that too.

739
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,500
Oh, God, I can't.

740
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,600
You can.

741
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,500
- I'm not ready to die.
- Then you make sure

742
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,100
you do just what I told you.

743
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,200
What happens when we come outside?

744
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,700
What if he realises what I'm doing to him?

745
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,200
I want a gun, or I won't go in. I won't.

746
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,200
I just put my ass on the line.

747
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,500
Now you get outta here.
My earrings are killing me.

748
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,600
I'm in a real bad mood.

749
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,700
You be careful.

750
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,100
I'm passing command to you.

751
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,600
If you fuck this up, you'll leave
your badge in a manila envelope.

752
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,800
'Cause I don't want to see you
when I get back.

753
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,000
I'm goin' to the observation point.

754
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,800
Subject is on the scene.

755
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,200
I know that they tried
to get you to betray me.

756
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,400
Let me introduce you to the Cornells.

757
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,800
I got this wacko in my sights.
I think I can take him.

758
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,400
That's Zack, and May.

759
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,100
And Nora. This is
the greatest woman in the world.

760
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,400
My God, what are you doing?
You must be insane.

761
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,700
- You shut up!
- Zack, go upstairs, now.

762
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,300
Nancy, I have somethin' that I wanna...

763
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:37,600
I wanna give to you. It's gonna keep us
together for the rest of our lives.

764
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,500
- I can't take that.
- This used to be Nora's.

765
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,900
- What's going on?
- Turn around.

766
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,900
- I gotta get through to see somebody.
- We got a problem with the traffic.

767
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,900
Hey!

768
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,900
Jesus Christ! We've got company.

769
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,100
Goddamn son of a bitch.

770
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,400
It's too late. See what he does.

771
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,700
- May!
- Who's that?

772
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,900
It's May's boyfriend.

773
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,100
Come on, May, open up.

774
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,100
Hi, Kyle. How you doin', kid?

775
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,600
I'm sorry to stop by so late, but I...

776
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:57,500
May and I had a fight, and if she could go
for a ride with me, I'd really appreciate it.

777
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,600
She may still be angry, pal. I'll ask her.

778
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,500
- I'll wait for her here.
- OK, you bet.

779
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,000
He wants to take May for a ride.
He won't leave without her.

780
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,000
- That's one less we gotta worry about.
- Then you call her.

781
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,900
May!

782
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,900
May, come down, please.

783
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,400
May, Kyle's outside.

784
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:43,600
He wants to make it up with you.
Now, you have to go. Now.

785
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,500
Go on with him.

786
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,200
I'm not leaving
unless my mom stays here.

787
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,800
Nora's comin' with me.

788
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,900
- What for?
- So you don't call the cops when we go.

789
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,100
Bosworth, you are so close.
Don't blow it.

790
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,200
If she doesn't go,
Kyle will make a scene. I know it.

791
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,900
Let her go, Mike, please.

792
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:12,300
You and I have a date with destiny, Tim.
You'll be comin' with me, after all.

793
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,000
I could trust Nora
more than I could trust you.

794
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,600
Dad, what about you?

795
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,200
We're gonna win if you do as he says.

796
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,600
I love you, Daddy.

797
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,400
I love you.

798
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,700
Go.

799
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
OK, OK.

800
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,100
You go with your boyfriend, May.

801
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,900
You go far away.

802
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,400
Otherwise I'm gonna kill your daddy.

803
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,800
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

804
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:04,300
I don't know what's goin' on,
but let's get outta here.

805
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,100
Right. You move it. You get the car.

806
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,800
Mr Cornell, I'm Special Agent Brenda
Chandler, FBl. We're here to help you.

807
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,900
You can't do that.
You'll get my family killed.

808
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,600
We're gonna let them drive away.

809
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,200
No, I'm going with them.
Bosworth and his brother and the girl.

810
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,500
- You're hurt.
- No, I'm not.

811
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,700
I'm OK.

812
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:17,500
Don't take long in there.
He's gonna go suicidal any minute now.

813
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,800
- Why are you doin' that?
- A wild idea. You have to trust me.

814
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,100
Mr Cornell.

815
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:38,100
If we have to go tactical,
we're gonna take casualties.

816
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,400
It's one more chance I'll have to take.

817
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,600
- How come I didn't hear the car start?
- No key.

818
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,700
Put your arms up.

819
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,300
What is this? Huh? What's this?

820
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,500
- Huh? What the fuck is this?
- I found it on the seat of her car.

821
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,800
I was... I was scared.

822
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,400
All right. You get goin' now.

823
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,700
I wanna say goodbye to Zack.

824
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:19,400
Hey, Daddy.
There's people with guns outside.

825
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,500
- I saw them. I'm scared.
- Shh.

826
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,500
You must be quiet.

827
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,900
You can't do this to me.
You've got to speak quietly.

828
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,100
- Are they gonna shoot us?
- No, no. They're here to help us.

829
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,300
I know you're scared.
But we mustn't let the men know.

830
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,800
OK, I'll be back soon.

831
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,900
- Tim.
- What?

832
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,300
Tim,

833
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,700
there's so many things I want to tell you.

834
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,900
- And I don't have time to tell you.
- I know. Me too.

835
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:23,300
This place is a tomb.
You two get out first. Get in the back.

836
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,500
Nancy, start the engine.
Don't turn on the lights.

837
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,500
- Shit.
- Nancy, what's wrong?

838
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,900
No!

839
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,800
Hold it! Hold it!

840
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,500
Hold it, Bosworth!

841
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,100
- Where are you hit?
- In the ego!

842
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,800
Get me a bullhorn!

843
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,600
- What if they shoot Daddy?
- They won't.

844
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:46,900
- You betrayed me!
- Michael, no!

845
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,600
Michael, please.

846
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,200
I did all this for you!

847
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,000
You shut up. Shut up. This ain't over.

848
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
You watch him.

849
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:11,400
This is Michael Bosworth speaking.
So before you start with your bullshit,

850
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,100
I want a car here to take three,
no, four people to the airport.

851
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,600
- I want a plane with five hours of fuel.
- I'll see what I can do on that.

852
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:27,800
Don't you start lying to me.
I know who's in charge out there.

853
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,300
You listen to me. I want all your people
out of there in ten minutes,

854
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,400
or I'll kill the whole family.

855
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,700
- We can't negotiate him out.
- There are four hostages.

856
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,100
- Bosworth needs killing.
- We don't violate the rules

857
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,400
until they don't work.

858
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,100
Everyone's alive. So far,
this is still a potential win.

859
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,100
Someone bring a four-door car
to the house. Now.

860
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,600
Be careful, Zack. Be careful, honey.

861
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,800
It's OK, Mommy, don't worry.

862
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,300
- Be careful!
- I love you. You'll be OK.

863
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,100
Drop him!

864
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,600
They're gonna get us outta here yet!

865
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,400
Wally!

866
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
- Give me the gun.
- Nora!

867
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,500
- Nora!
- You're dying, Wally.

868
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,600
- You're dying. You're not going anywhere.
- Nora!

869
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,400
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

870
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,500
Goddammit! Get over here!

871
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,300
- Get over here!
- No!

872
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,700
Wally!

873
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,300
Oh, God.

874
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,700
I have decided
I love your family too much.

875
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,500
You're all coming with me.
The more the merrier, right?

876
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,700
You're through, Bosworth. It's over.

877
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,600
You stay right there
or you're going to kill your wife.

878
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,400
- Tim!
- It's OK, Nora.

879
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:38,500
- Tim.
- I'm still in control, Timmy.

880
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,300
- Tim!
- Nothing can happen to you, Nora.

881
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,100
If you never trusted me before,
you have to trust me now.

882
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,100
I'll blow her brains right across the room.

883
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:56,500
You know what size hole this calibre
bullet makes when it exits the other side?

884
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,700
He can't hurt you, Nora.

885
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,900
He can't hurt you, honey.

886
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,500
Your car is waiting, Bosworth.

887
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,500
Do not move!

888
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,200
Stay down!

889
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:52,600
Do not move! We'll come to you!

890
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,300
Nancy!

891
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,500
Blade, get her out of here, will ya?
