376
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,314
- Oh Jesus, I forgot to ask

377
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,186
about that.

378
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,404
- And there are people

379
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:01,362
in the world who would give

380
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,406
their right arm

381
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,755
for this anchovy.

382

383
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,063

00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,979
that is wonderful, Clive.

385
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,069
Here's to the champion

What were you doing?

397
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,175
- Nothing, I just didn't really

398
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,655
know what they were.

399
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:20,571
[chair thuds]

400
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,008
- No...

401
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,096
I mean, what were you

402
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,619
doing over there?

403
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,056
- Oh, it's my history project.

404
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,623
- Your history project.

405
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:31,278
- Yeah, it's the pieta,

406
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,496
Michelangelo.

407
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,585
It's Mary holding Jesus but he's

408
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,588
dead, but... It's no big deal.

409
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,112
- Don't tell me you're really

410
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,549
a genius too.

411
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,943
- Not really.

412
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,380
Um, were you watching me?

413
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,947
- A little.

414
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,383
- I didn't do anything weird,
did i?

415
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:50,862
- [moving boxes, she grunts]

416
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,952
Nope.

417
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,823
- Sometimes I do.

418
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,781
- Here.

419
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:04,659
[thud]

420
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,227
Come here, little brother.

421
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,535
I had to move here.

422
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,190
It was my only choice.

423
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,238
- You sleep here?

424
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,980
- Yeah.

425
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,418
I'll tell you another secret.

426
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,855
I like you, little brother.

427
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,030
You and me, we have

428
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,250
this connection, you know?

429
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,338
You know more

430
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,469
than everybody thinks.

431
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,689
- I do?

432
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,908
- Yeah.

433
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:42,827
- I could bring you

434
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,177
food, Sandra!

435
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,441
- That'd be cool, you know?

436
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,790
I wish Clive was as cool

437
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,184
as you sometimes.

438
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,489
I wish.

439
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,883
- I'm really not that cool.

440
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,365
- Yeah, you arE. [exhales]

441
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,670
Question.

442
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,455
Does Elliot ever bug you?

443
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,239
- [chuckling] Oh, I dunno,

444
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:06,547
I mean... Not really, but...

445
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,375
Oh, sometimes, I guess.

446
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,377
- Well, he bugs me.

447
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:11,726
- Yeah?

448
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,644
- Clive is so superior to him.

449
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,472
I mean, Clive really is a genius

450
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,343
and Elliot's the farthest

451
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,084
thing froM. [exhales]

452
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:27,394
- Yeah, I hear you.

453
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:28,699
- Did he ever tell you

454
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:32,094
about us?

455
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,008
- Who?

456
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,228
- Clive.

457
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,359
Did he ever tell you

458
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,883
about he and i?

459
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,973
- No.

460
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,671
- He didn't?

461
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:44,759
- No.

your parents about me,

466
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,071
are you, William?

467
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,985
- No... No way.

[door upstairs opens]

469
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,292

470
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,165
anybody, not even Clive?

471
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,731
- Clive doesn't know?

472
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,908
- Of course, he knows, genius.

473
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,953
It's good practice,

474
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,041
keeping your mouth shut.

475
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,825

476
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,305
I get the feeling you could

477
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,873
use some.

478
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,920
All right, I'll tell ya.

Thank you.

Why, that's very kind of you.

Chopin died at age 39.

Does your brother ever speak

that language of his at school?

541

- Sometimes.

543
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:55,689
of it?

544
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:56,733

they understand.

546
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,128
- Is there some key to it,

547
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,870
some kind of dictionary?

548
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:04,132
- Well, if there was,

549
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:08,354
he wouldn't tell me about it.

550
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,268

755
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:12,593
- It is?

756
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:13,637
- Yeah.

757
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,900
My generation has a lot

758
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:17,511
to learn from your generation.

759
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:20,644
Yup.

760
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,342
[hose turns off]

Your father.

765

Will you ever forgive him?

770
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,296
- Yeah, I forgive you, dad.

I just want you to know that

775
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:17,876
I want you to know that.

776
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,225
Why, I'm proud you don't

777

symbol of approval for something

780

its own sake, anyway.

Affirmative, sailor?

- Affirmative, captain.

783
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:37,808
- In 100 years, no one

784
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:41,160

Chet will leave Clive alone

Agreed?

Chet here, agreed?

What is it about this country?

814
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,250
When I was a girl, we called

815

our teachers "professoR."

816
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,731
We revered them.

817

We all wanted to be like them.

818

Now, in America,

We attack it, the great

854
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,012
mean exactly, Mrs. Messerman,

855
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,187
"twice baked"?

856

Mom?

858

- [laughs] Well, I spoon
the potato back into the skin

859
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,413
and bake it again.

860

- What a great idea.

861
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,417

862
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,984
for the potato, does it not?

863
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,423

You're a great mother.

a good cook, Sandra?

879

880
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,710
actually, Mr. Messerman.

881
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,102

You're welcome, I guess.

he tell you?

1125
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,396
- Well, he said that, you know,

1126
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,963
you're just trying to understand

1127
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:17,486
your life.

1128
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,748
- Clive: I hear ya.

1129
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,489
- Elliot: It's true, you know.

1130
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:22,056
He's right.

1131
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,231
We have to lead them

1132
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:25,886
through this stuff.

1133
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,062
- Clive: No, we don't.

1134
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,237
We don't have to lead

1135
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:33,589
anybody anywhere.

1136
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:34,895
- [inhaling]: We have

1137
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:38,681
to educate them.

1138
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,771
Hold it in.

1139
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,513
- We don't have
to educate anybody.

1140
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:45,514
Hold it in.

1141
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:46,733
[William sputters]

1142
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:47,734
- Elliot: You been studying

1143
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,518
the rosetta stone?

1144
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:54,306
- A little.

1145
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,265
- Elliot: <i>Hazudozo.</i>

1146
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,051
- Have you found
the meanings yet?

1147
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:03,793
- No, I haven't been looking.

1148
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:06,448
- Of course you have.

1149
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:11,453
By the way, little brother,
you are dressed kind of nice.

1150
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:12,933
You going somewhere?

1151
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,587
[chuckling]

1152
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,894
[lighter clicks]

1153
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:24,205
- Judy: This is why I wanted

1154
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:25,424
to bring a map.

1155
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:27,208
- I used to find our way in the

1156
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:29,210
east china sea among Japanese

1157
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:32,039
subs in mined archipelagos.

1158
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:34,389
- Yeah, with a map.

1159
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:35,260
- The test started

1160
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:36,348
15 minutes ago.

1161
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:37,392
- Well, that leaves us

1162
00:48:37,566 --> 00:48:41,440
an hour and 45 minutes.

1163
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:42,702
Ah-ha.

1164
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:43,877
- Look, he's welcome to do what

1165
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:45,096
he can in the time that's left.

1166
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,140
- The others have been at it

1167
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:47,707
for 45 minutes already.

1168
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:49,274
That's just officious,
is what it is.

1169
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:50,623
- It's not fair to the others.

1170
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:52,320
- Look, it was my fault,

1171
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:53,365
not my son's.

1172
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,627
I forgot to bring a map.

1173
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:55,671
- Well, maybe next time,

1174
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:57,456
you'll bring one then.

1175
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,718
- There won't be a next time

1176
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:01,329
is what we're telling you.

1177
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:04,202
- Clive, what do you think?

1178
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:06,117
- Sounds fine.

1179
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,857
- O.K., quick.

1180
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:08,858
- Just let me get

1181
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:14,342
a drink of water.

1182
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:18,303
[metal clinks, water runs]

1183
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:25,658
- Good luck.

1184
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,312
[door opens]

1185
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:28,487
[Judy sighs]

1186
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:30,968
[rock music plays...]

1187
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:36,669
- You guys, I can smell that

1188
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,801
that all the way downstairs!

1189
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,413
[Clive and Elliot laugh]

1190
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:47,593
- Hey, William.

1191
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:48,463
I've been looking

1192
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:49,682
at the rafters.

1193
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:50,857
Have you ever noticed them?

1194
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,599
They're made of all these...

1195
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:56,384
Intricate pieces.

1196
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:59,692
[Elliot and Clive snicker]

1197
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,959
[William chuckles]

1198
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,744
- Clive and Elliot have...

1199
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:13,097
Told me some of their words.

1200
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:17,884
<i>Servoos.</i>

1201
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,104
- <i>Servoos.</i>

1202
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:22,541

<i>Birkahoosh</i>...

1205
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,507
- <i>Szer</i>...

1206
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:37,730
- <i>Szer</i>...Eto.

1207
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:38,687
- Did they tell you

1208
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:39,601
what they mean?

1209
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:42,648
- No, not yet.

1210
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,823
- Little brother,

1211
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:45,042
the old man here has just

1212
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,044
tried his first doob.

1213
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:48,219
- Yeah, I don't know what

1214
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:49,089
this marijuana's supposed

1215
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:50,047
to do, William.

1216
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:52,745
- [snickers]

1217
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,051
- You tried it, dad?

1218
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:58,316
- Yeah, I did, sailor.

1219
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,884
And watch out, Sheshevsky.

1220
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,412
- Here.

1221
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:08,456
Take it.

1222
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,633
[music continues...]

1223
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:12,939
- Dad?

1224
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,245
- [scoffs]

1225
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:19,902
That's interesting.

1226
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,165
Didn't anybody ever teach

1227
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,863
you how to smoke a cigarette?

1228
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,125
You didn't inhale.

1229
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,126
- Yes, I did.

1230
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,997
- He never has.

1231
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,260
- [laughs]

1232
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:30,348
- Do you know, your brother

1233
00:51:30,522 --> 00:51:31,784
won the cuyahoga county

1234
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,525
finals this morning?

1235
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:36,571
- Dad, I was there, remember?

1236
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:38,791
- Oh...

1237
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,097
Yeah.

1238
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:42,925
- Congratulations, Clive.

1239
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,449
- Thank you.

1240
00:51:44,623 --> 00:51:46,233
[makes kissing noise]

1241
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:50,019
- By the way... I dried
the lunch dishes for you.

1242
00:51:54,807 --> 00:52:01,466
- Clive: [snickers]

1243

1245
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:06,297
- Mrs. Cubano: Takes me days
to plan a meal.

1246
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:07,950
- William: It's really
great, mom.

1247
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,256
- Thank you.
- Mr. Cubano: Now, I'm telling

1248
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,518
you, he's a criminal.

1249
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:11,780
He sent his henchmen into that

1250
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,347
hotel and all those clowns in

1251
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:15,044
his cabinet were complicit.

1252
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,176
He's gonna be impeached,

1253
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,395
you mark my word.

1254
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:18,570
- Thank you for this lovely

1255
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:20,049
meal, Judy, it's so good.

1256
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,225
- [muffled]: William?

1257
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:22,965
- Hmm?

1258
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,664
- Can you open up that
window for me, please?

1259
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,013
- Uh, sure.

1260
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,841
- Simon, it's 40 degrees out.

1261
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,059
- [slurring] We could use some

1262
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,498
cool air in here, could we not?

1263
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:39,634
[glass breaks]

1264
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:40,766
[laughter]

1265
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,725
[neighborhood dog barks]

1266
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:46,467
- Very nice, Simon.

1267
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:47,512
William, would you close

1268
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:50,993
the window now, please?

1269
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,343
- Sure.

1270
00:52:55,215 --> 00:53:00,046
[Simon pours...]

1271
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,569
- [drunkenly] Now, let us try

1272
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:04,920
the red wine.

1273
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,226
"that is why I have come

to California, for soil

the color of a dark sea.

1276
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:14,582
Too many years on ships and

1277
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:21,023
you forget the taste of women...

1278
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,548
And wine.

1279
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:29,118
In the earth we shall find...

Mmm, a hidden sourcE."

- [chuckles]

1282
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,778
- Here's to the champion

1283
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:38,911
of cuyahoga county.

1284
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:40,652
- Here, here.

1285
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:41,696
- Mrs. Cubano: Here, here.
- William: Cheers.

And here's to the hidden sauce.

1288
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,487
- Source.

1289
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:54,448
- Yup.

[laughter]

1291
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:01,412
My wife is... Right.

1292
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:06,982
And I only have one son left.

1293
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:14,468
- What is that supposed

1294
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:16,818
to mean, Simon?

1295
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:19,995
- Well, I don't know.

1296
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:23,434
I'm surprised myself.

1297
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:25,740
- You're drunk.

1298
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:30,615
- Indeed I am.

1299
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,618
But that's not alL. [laughs]

1300
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:42,017
- So, Clive...

1301
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:43,715
Tell us what the math

1302
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,109
finals were like.

1303
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,633
- Math is just concentration,

1304
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:50,722
Mrs. Cubano.

1305
00:54:50,896 --> 00:54:53,464
Math is... Simple steps,

1306
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,640
one after the next.

1307
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:59,426

- No, he doesn't and I don't

1680
01:17:10,147 --> 01:17:12,540

1687
01:17:27,338 --> 01:17:28,774
- Yeah.

1688
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:32,169
That's what I mean.
