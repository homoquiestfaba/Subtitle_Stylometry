0

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,582
Moved right through here. We all spooked
and so they were leaving right away

00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,082
that's too bad. You know as
well as I do that they

00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:04,540
have nothing to fear from bears if they
properly store their food and lock in bear boxes

00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,498
right. You know what I don't get?
It's their description.

00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:12,498
I mean black bears don't get
that big. What they described was more like

00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:16,498
a Volkswagen size than a bear.
Only Alaskan brown bears get that big

00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:20,458
and there have been no grizzlies in the
states since nineteen twenty nine.

00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,498
Long time ago. Maybe it was a prank.
Remember the guy with the big-foot outfit?

00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,498
Rolly almost shot him?

00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:32,624
Or maybe old sasquatch is back for another
round of scaring the tourists. Eh?

00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,458
Whatever happens. If you see
him, don't get all trigger happy.

00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,540
That outfit was amazing. I think he actually
used bear skin from that freak show they

00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:45,249
closed back in Chicago. Confiscated
that so unless he made another one

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,333
did you?
I don't think its the same guy.

00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:53,498
Hey wait right there! Park
rangers!

00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:57,958
Whatever it is. It's quick!

00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:10,333
Man. We're gonna be at this all
night long.

00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:15,333
I think it's the same old boy
with a new costume. I say we come back

00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,458
tomorrow. We

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,498
tomorrow. We'll track him to
the site, we'll confiscate the suit

00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,665
and we'll just give him a citation.
Sounds good to mo

00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:27,498
it's at least two miles back to
the patrol car

00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,291
let's go.

00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:35,498
Hey hold it right there.

00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:38,790
Look at him!

00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,790
Sir. Are you lost? Are you all right?
The man!

00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:49,624
You guys have to run now! You
have to follow me!

00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,957
Follow me! Follow me!
Where we going?

00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:58,499
[Growling]
Oh no not again!

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,166
[At pink Princess. We want the
public to know]

00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,041
[That the employee who tampered
with the Princess

00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:26,124
[pack talking software has been
terminated. We continue to]

00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,041
[Warn the public packs
manufactured last month must be ]

00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:34,291
[Be returned for exchange. Some
of the statements made will be ]

00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,333
[Very inappropriate. Pink
Princess has been America's]

00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:42,498
[Little sweetheart for thirty
years. And we want you]

00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:47,041
[To know we will still be you pretty]

00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:51,082
[Pink Princess]

00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,458
And we're back

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,041
so Helga now knows how to
properly maintain the leather

00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:02,499
of her leiderhosen. Which you can find
in my unabridged guide to the outdoors

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,124

00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:23,291
You go!
No Helga. Go out there.

00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:27,416
Go. Out. There. Go.

00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:30,916
Yes. Thank you.

00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:35,041
Awesome. Let's go to our first
caller.

00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,707
Cause our lines are loaded right now.

00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,498
Big out survival. Stanford
James. How can I help you?

00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:46,665
[Yeah. I'm going to the park to
do some back country hiking and I hear]

00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,498
[Bears can be pesky. What
should I do if I run into one?]

00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,249
Great question. You know what.
I'm gonna consult my book, the unabridged

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:01,458
guide to the outdoors. One time was a almost
bestseller. Let me look it up. We're gonna look up

00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:04,498
survival and then maybe death.
No

00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:08,665
we don't want death. We don't want to die
on this one, all right let's do B for bears

00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:13,041
that would be the best part. [Why do
you always have to look at your book?]

00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:16,790
[Didn't you write it?]
Yes. I did write it, caller. I did.

00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:21,124
You know what caller. I'm gonna
have to just leave you, all right. Bye.

00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,957
You go out there. All right.
Let's go to our next caller.

00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,208
All right. Big outdoor survival.
Stanford James, how can I help you?

00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,916
[Oui... I mean yes. I wondered
the same thing. Every time]

00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:37,916
[Someone call. You always have
to check your book. What, are you stupid?}

00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:41,707
[no wait. You are a]

00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,498
[Fraud. A phoney]
Excuse me?

00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:49,166
Excuse me. Hello, you know
what, I wrote the book

00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:53,499
I wrote the book. I wrote the
book. I'm the one who wrote the book

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,416
okay. All right, good. All
right. Fine.

00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:00,498
Folks. You go out there and
figure it out yourself, cause

00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:05,665
unfortunately. You don't like anything I'm saying, and
you call and remind me about this so you know what?

00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,582
Forget it. You all just go out
there.

00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,458
Here we go again. Doesn't that
moron know

00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:17,374
anything about the outdoors?
You know his ratings? They drop

00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,498
every week. I mean. If we lose
our last client, pretty pink Princess

00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:24,665
I am pulling the plug.
Then you have to put your nose

00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:30,291
you have to cup the nose. You have to cup the nose,
you have to put your mouth to the mouth of the bear

00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:33,916
come down and go...

00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:38,208

00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:54,166
Pretty pink Princess just

00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,707

Fantastique. Au revoir mssr

Nothing. Lets see if has any
real survival

00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,166
skills.

00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,208
And that is how you chase down
and capture a wild

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:45,999
thimbleberry without popping it
and staining

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,291
your high quality parka. And
now on to how to clean the mud

00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:54,333
out of your amazing rubber
soled leather boots.

00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:58,999
[Oui! Oui }
You use a hairy snipe tail feather

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,166

00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,832
Hey guys. I'm filming a show.
Can you please wait...

00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:10,874
Normally they do this during
the production break so that people can...

I dislike you!

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,999
A lot!

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,999
Chris. What is going on here? I
mean where did these

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,790
es car go crazy idiots come
from? They're interrupting

00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,957
my show. I mean I've been on
semi public television for almost ten

00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,498
years. Listen Stanford. You’ve
been faking it for ten years

00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,916
everybody know you don't know a thing about the
outdoors. As a matter of fact. You don't even

00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,957
know which end of the match
starts the fire. Oh and another thing

00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,498
your last clients? Guess what.
Pretty pink Princess called and

00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:02,916
canceled. Well. I'm canceling
you too

00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:06,874
sorry Stanford. You're finished
at pu studios. Don't talk to us again.

00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,498
Unless you actually know what
is going on about the outdoors and survival

00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,333
I wrote the book. I did the
research

00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:19,208
this chaveau guy. He has been
prank calling my show

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,665
since the beginning and
sabotaging it. This is not my fault.

00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:27,374
Look. Research is one thing, but knowing it
by memory is another thing all together.

00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,582
Clear out will you? I have
French cooking exercise show

00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:36,124

Hey Sammy. Hi buddy how are you?

00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,749
Good. Hey I want to ask you a
question. You wanna go camping with me?

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,333
Uh. Well for a couple of days.
I got some time off

00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:30,540
from the show. And I really wanted to go
out and learn some good survival techniques

00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:35,041
to wow them back in the big
city. And I thought you'd wanna go.

00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:39,498
Well. I'm gonna go someplace
beautiful

00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:42,665
someplace magnificent.

00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:47,499
Ask your mom if you can come
for a couple of days. It's okay?

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,498
Oh good.Great.

00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:54,707
Okay. Bring your video camera,
okay, and I'll pick you up tomorrow morning

00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:59,499
and bring whatever else
you think we may need. Remember Sammy.

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,333
You go out there!

00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:07,832
Okay. Bye Sammy. Tomorrow

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,498

maggot infested, trash picking

00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:48,374

I've ever seen bum!

I'm gonna keep you forever!

You're gonna be the best little buddy!

00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:32,541
Oh. No!

00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:40,625
You walk away like it was nothing!

00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:52,666
I suck at live!

00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:05,583
Hello buddy

00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,498
so where are we going. Uncle
Stanford?

00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:17,666
Reclaim my dignity

00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,082
oh dear..
Oh frank!

00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:55,498
Do you see what you did by not
putting coolant in the car like I asked?

00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:59,416
But I brought the...
Look. What are we going to do?

00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,707
We're in the middle of nowhere!
Uncle Stanford. Watch out!

00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,957
Oh dear. Honey, I think we have
to

00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,916
move the car off the road

00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:15,540
why didn't you tell me there could have been
traffic here? Ppbut I did... wait a sec...

00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:20,458
Frank. Get out of the way,
I'll move the car.

00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:23,957
But...

00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:28,498
Oh dear...
Sammy are you OK?

00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:32,499
Yeah.

00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:44,500
Tori. Come on!

00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:59,124
I'm documentary filmmaker Thad
Marr. We are here at the behest

00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,499
of the department of the exterior to document
the diverse group of tourists who are visiting

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,957
the park for the reprising of
the historic and famous firefall

00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,957
it was discontinued in the park in nineteen sixty
nine due to changes in department of exterior policy

00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,208
stopping supposedly unnatural
events. The park

00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:19,874
management has been made aware that the people
who saw this amazing event originally performed

00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,874
for over a hundred years are
getting old. And dying.

00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,499
To honor the support of the
park. The famous firefall

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,582
a dropping of flaming embers off iceberg
point. Will be done one more time

00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,498
for all who want to come see
this Friday night. Our film crew has been

00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:39,874
randomly pulling vehicles out of line and
will assign five film crews to them.

00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,790
Our cameras will follow these
groups for the next few days

00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,832
up until the firefall. Each
group will also be given their own

00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,874
video camera so they can record
their own films and images for

00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,749
everyone to see from their own
eyes. And we will also enlist

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,333
award winning photographer
David ashcraft to prowl the park and get

00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:04,458
magnificent still shots of our
selected guests. Hi David.

00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:10,874
Hi Thad. I'm gonna get some
great shots out here. It

00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,957
wait. Photo op!
Great, here is our first group!

00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,665
Wait. Photo op!
Great, here is our first group!

00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,208
Okay...

00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:23,458
We are the bird family from Wisconsin

00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:27,249
I'm fay and my husband frank is

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,249
an insurance adjuster. I... we
decided

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,416
to travel out here to see what is called

00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:39,124
the most amazing park in the world.

00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,374
This is my husband frank. And
our wonderful daughter

00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,916
Tori. And our son Jason. Who we
just call

00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:51,208
Jay bird.

00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:56,125
Sure is pretty here.
Beautiful... and we... Quiet!

00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:03,249
Wow you chose us. That is so spiffy. My
name's Hugo Armstrong, this is my wife

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,540
dora. And we are ready to challenge this
place. I mean it could be dangerous here.

00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,624
Boulders could fall on you. The
rapids are world famous,

00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,498
and hear there are wolverines.
Mountain lions, and big

00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:19,582
dangerous bears. You know dora
and I have been in some amazing places

00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,749
you might recognize me. I was
mister buff pump up three years

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,916
running. You know mister buff
pump up? World welter weight

00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,957
body building champion? I had a
song and everything

00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:36,082
well. That was before my injury...
What frank is trying

00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:40,498
to say is that we're going to
enjoy camping here

00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,291
at the park. I guess... Shut up!

00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:48,333
Hi. I'm Stanford James, I'm
from San Francisco

00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:52,208
you've probably seen me on TV.
I am.. I've been

00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:56,166
an outdoor TV show host. I'm
here in the park to film my

00:21:56,167 --> 00:22:00,498
back outdoor skills with the
help of my nephew Sammy Stuart.

00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:04,166
My sister's son. From
Bakersfield. His father

00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:08,498
ran away with the secretary.
They're in Tahiti. They've been gone

00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:11,999
for years. Anyways... you've
probably heard of my

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,624
bestselling book. Survival and camping
book, called the unabridged guide to the

00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:21,458
outdoors. UGO - it's in my TV
show.

00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:24,498
It

00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:26,082
It's my motto. You probably
know it, you go out there!

00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,458
UGO! You go out there!

00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:32,999
You've heard it! I'm Robert
MacDonald but you can call me brick

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,498
this bonny laddy. My climbing

00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:40,582
partner Angus Gordon. We're the
free climbing champions for the

00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,707
highlands of Scotland. We'll be
taking a boatload of

00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,957
of pictures for you with the
camera you lent us.

00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,166
The kids are going to enjoy biking

00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:57,291
and hiking and taking pictures

00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,498
and climbing and relaxing

00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:04,874
oh. We heard that they are
going to redo the firefill one more time

00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,540
for the last time. And that's
really neat too.

00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,624
We never seen that except for
pictures from the nineteen fifties.

00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,499
That'll be sick. Fire falling
from a seven thousand feet cliff.

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,082
Flames shooting all over the
place. Possible death. Possible destruction

00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,208
awesome! Reminds me of my video
game attack

00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:29,540
of the galactic artini woman vampire zoid

00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,291
you little kidster

00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:37,333
sorry about frank. He's not a
big talker

00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:41,582
sorry. Dear? Do you have
anything to say?

00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,832
Tori? As you can see.

00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:49,707
I. We have brought all the fun
things you could think of for camping

00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,416
right frank? Frank!

00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:57,624
Yes dear.
If you saw me on my cable show.

00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:01,082
Big outdoor survival. I want

00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,498
let you know something. I can
track. Let's get something straight.

00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:09,124
Those escargot crazy frenchies.
They're rude.

00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:13,498
All right. Who puts exercise
and cooking in a show together anyway?

00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,790
I don't understand...
Uncle Stanford. Relax.

00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,416
But I can still do it all. Can't I dora? I
used to put Arnold in his place, didn't I?

00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:25,498
I can't wait to get down in that
glacially carved valley.

00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,999
Almost as carved as I used to
be. Huh dora?

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,333
And that firefall being redone. That
could be amazing. I might have to use my

00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:37,458
speed and agility to dodge all
those falling embers and flames.

00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:42,498
Joe. The best advice I could
possibly give you is always

00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:47,291
have two handcuffs. There could
be multiple suspects around, you never know

00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:51,498
and... we have to do this too?

00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:55,333
You rolling? Oh. OK.

00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:58,624
I'm head ranger Jeff Fauntleroy

00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:02,498
you can call me Raldy. To my
left here is ranger spud Washington

00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:06,749
we're law enforcement rangers. The
department of the exterior. I graduated first

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,124
in my class from Quantico. I
been here at the park for twelve

00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:14,458
years. And we are completely
dedicated to

00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:19,166
maximum excellence in the protection of this
wonderful environmental treasure from the

00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,499
polluting hand of irresponsible
human beings

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,291
spud? I think most of the people are
here to see the beauty of the park Raldy

00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,498
you know soldier. You're
absolutely right.

00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:34,790
Except for the fact they're not!

00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,041
We be planting our mark here and
all the mountains. And we're going to

00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:43,498
break all the climbing speed
records. We aren't using ropers

00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:47,498
ney ropes. Aye?
Ney ropes aye!

00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:51,916
Ney ropes. Aye!
Aye for Scotland

00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,208
for Scotland!

00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:59,498
Ooh. I wanna see the animals,
warm and cuddly, don’t you

00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:03,499
I want to see the pretty
waterfalls. In fact

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,498
they pollute. Drop trash and
even

00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,291
even urinate on the soil near the trees.

00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:15,374
Well. Hi, I'm ranger spud
Washington, but you can call me

00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:19,291
spud. I been working here at
the park for about five days

00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:23,333
I just transferred here from
green mesa national park after the

00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:27,999
last eight rangers they sent
here disappeared without a trace.

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,458
There is an investigation.

00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,832
No we're really looking for
them. But it's really a mystery.

00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:39,416
I used to fire up all those body building fans.
Didn't I dora? Ppoh honey, I don't think...

00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:44,208
Falling flames. Rapids, huge
boulders, big rocks to climb, danger

00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,790
animals! Big things.

00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,498
Big things. This is my kind of
place.

00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:55,916
My kid of place see. I'm gonna
teach Sammy in the way of nature

00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:59,790
it's not a true native child of the

00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:04,291
forest. Like I am, isn't that
right Sammy?

00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:08,583
No one is. Because I am!

00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,790
Just startled me. I mean. It
was right there. You guys

00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:19,957
can cut that right? You can
edit around that?

00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:23,957
That really scared me. I can do
it again.

00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:28,124
I can do it again. I do love
nature. I do.

00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:31,874
Let me. Okay. Lets do another
take.

00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:36,082
The two new female rangers
behind are rangers so

00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:40,416
krochnibler. And ranger Cecelia
Studebaker

00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,790
what? But I really am excited

00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:48,749
to be working here at the park!
Get out of the car! Get out!

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,166
Come on.

00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:56,498
I'm taking you into custody of
park ordinance

00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:00,958
putting toxic illegal waste

00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,333
rolly that spray was on the windshield.

00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:12,041
As a result of the motion. Thrusted over the rental
windscreen that's should be its appropriate target.

00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:16,374
And on the vital habitat of
spotted marching pumpkin bug?

00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:20,498
It's breeding season for the
little creature.

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,707
Hey dudes. Psst. Whatcha
filming?

00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,749
You filming a movie? Wow

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,624
dude. Hey. I think you should know I was
a pretty big singing star back in the

00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,999
days of peace and love. I'm Sid.

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,499
Sid Sapperstein?

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,624
You know. Indian love song.
Well...

00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:48,874
Until the man closed down my gig.

00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,458
It was the man. The man!

00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:56,498
Well. He's not gonna get me
now. I been here for.. I...

00:28:56,499 --> 00:29:00,874
I don't know. But anyway, he
closed down my gig dude.

00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,999
Hey dude. That just ain’t right.

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,208
It's the ghost!
The man!

00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:13,499
Get after him Raldy?

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,499
[Heavy breathing]

00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:28,582
Where in the world could he
have disappeared to?

00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:32,498
I was right on his tail as we
went up that draw.

00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,790
There aren't any easy holds on
the face of that cliff. Oh god.

00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:40,624
What are all these stinky
little paper bags?

00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:44,166
On the base of the rock?
Those? Those are bomb bags.

00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:48,458
When climbers been on the wall for two or
three days. And need to defecate, they do it

00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:52,540
in bomb bags. They shout bomb
bag! And toss it down. That's why you don't

00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,624
want to be anywhere near that cliff face.
So these are all

00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,498
poop? They throw them down.
Hopefully in an area which we

00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:05,041
aren’t standing. Climbers are
usually a thoughtful group. But sometimes

00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:09,498
they aim anywhere near to the
rock. Notice

00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:13,498
how far away I'm standing.

00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:17,707
Look out below laddies

00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:21,707
og hdo

00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:25,875
sorry!

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,832
Crap.

00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,498
;Et

00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:38,958
let's go get you changed

00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:45,707
are you going to use all of
this in your movie?

00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:49,498
Oh just some?

00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,999
Oh. You may cut what I say?

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,624
Oh.

00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:02,125
Is this my good side?

00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,749
I love my RV. I think Arnold
has one just like it.

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,957
But you know it's got all the storage
for the things that are important like

00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,832
the weights. And the bench,
and the bikes and the raft, and everything

00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,957
to just do big things here. You
know. When I was mister buff pump up, I did

00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,874
a photo shoot for pump me up
magazine in a woods just about like this.

00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:29,749
I was back east and there weren't quite
as many big trees as there are here

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,333
and not near as much danger

00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:37,458
but I really worked that camera
with my immaculate flexing.

00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:40,874
Big things. I'm going to be
able to do big things here.

00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:45,498
Tomorrow. I'm gonna ride up to reflection
lake. They say that climb is a thousand feet

00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:49,498
in less than a mile. Piece of
cake. Dora. Remind me to

00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:53,790
shoot those rapids sometime before I leave.
OK dear.

00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:57,665
Big things. This is gonna be
great.

00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:02,498
Things sure are easier here than at home.

00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:06,208
Birds.

00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:09,957
Like us. Are everywhere.

00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:13,707
I saw this cute little point here

00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:17,957
and his girlfriend in the
Meadow on the way in

00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:21,707
what they were doing. I had to
grab

00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:25,957
little jaybird's head and turn
it. I'm glad Tori

00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:30,666
wasn't watching. Cause, she's so
innocent

00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:38,708
I think I'll pump

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,917
dora!!!

00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:18,917
Ah. That was good.

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,499
Big things!

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,249
Some people say. That uh

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,208
food tastes better in the out
of doors due to

00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:38,291
perkier taste buds. Uh, from
the, the fresh air.

00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:43,125
Cleaning out your sinuses and
nasal openings.

00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:50,582
I think I smell better than at home.

00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:54,832
I think my sniftier is niftier

00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:59,250
ha! I made a funny!

00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:07,334
I think. Toasted hot dogs will be simply
scrumptious for dinner, couldn’t you

00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:22,707
I am so excited

00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:26,498
to stay at the Awachoochie hotel

00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:30,582
this was early days of the
park. This is so cool.

00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,499
Exquisite architectural
masterpiece. Oh.

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,498
For survival for someone to
save their energy

00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:44,374
for said survival. Cause...

00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,916
When you go out there. You'd
better

00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,749
be well rested. That's what I'm
talking about. I can't wait

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,374
to study all the edible parts
of the hotel's walls furniture. Floors

00:34:56,375 --> 00:35:00,208
no. We're not gonna eat the
hotel, Sammy

00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:03,540
come on. You gotta think. No.
No, we're gonna do it

00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:08,498
after dinner. Study all the edible plants
that have the chemical qualities that makes

00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:11,874
things like flairs. And medical
compresses

00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:16,124
I mean that's important stuff. Sammy,
and my backpack is very well equipped

00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:20,498
they're on the roof. They're on the roof.
How'd they get up there?

00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:25,417
Get off the bloody roof. Come
on lets go.

00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:33,459
For Scotland!

00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:41,499
These hotel walls were too tempting

00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:48,458
and get their knickers in a
twist. Let's get a wee breakfast

00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:52,498
free climb. You could be sure
we ne'er be climbing any more

00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:57,208
halls made by the hands of man.
At least not on this trip

00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,999
nay halls. Eye?

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,499
Just walls. Aye! For Scotland!

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,749
Park rangers fall in!

00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,041
Attention!

00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:25,374
Washington. Crochnabler,
Studebaker, new park recruits

00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:29,333
you were chosen from the common masses

00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:33,333
as elite soldiers. Warriors in
the ongoing

00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:37,208
battle to protect the park. The
shock troops

00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:41,832
a company of Valiant souls who
are on the front lines

00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,498
save a squirrel

00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:49,499
protect the porcupine. Defend
the deer

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,790
and guard the grasses. Never
rest

00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,749
never stop. Never quite.

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,790
We never. Never compromise

00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:06,208
and never. Never surrender.

00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:10,375
Yes sir!

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,249
We got everything for the fire. Right we got all
the wood, so it's gonna be a really big fire I think

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,374
the guests are really gonna like it.
Hey look at that ranger's name!

00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:30,166
No way.

00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:34,499
Hey krochnibbler!

00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,082
Long o. Long I

00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:46,082
it's German. You get it right!

00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,916
Snap out of it. I'm so sorry!

00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:53,916
Somebody a little sensitive?
Seriously?

00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:58,374
Lets get out of here that's real mature.

00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,582
I hope your mom's proud

00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:06,124
Zoe. I’m so sorry, it's not that
big of a deal. Come on honey

00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,749
you're better than them. A
pretty girl

00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,291
I don't like my name.
I know but nobody likes their name.

00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:18,833
I'm named after a car. I love
you.

00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,499
So let me guess ranger

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,041
Washington. The girls set the
fire?

00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,957
Looks that way.

00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:43,458
You know I will be glad when we can make
wood artificially from washed up seaweed

00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:47,582
that way. It can decompose
naturally on the forest floor

00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,291
and become for our little insect friends.

00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,999
He Raldy. What's that on your
belt, that's not standard issue, is it?

00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,208
That’s nothing. Come on. If we're gonna be partners. You gotta be able to trust me.

00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:03,749
Right?
Well. It's

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,832
just a broken compass. My
grandfather

00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:11,749
gave it to me just before he passed away

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,832
he called it his compass of
destiny. He swore

00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:20,082
that it led him to meet my
grandmother. He said

00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,790
one day it would do the same for me.

00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:27,498
But as you can see there's no
ring on my finger yet.

00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:32,124
That's really neat. You're lucky to
have an heirloom from your grandfather

00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:36,333
so what. Is the needle just
broken.

00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:40,416
Yeah. Maybe I'll fix it someday.

00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:44,916
I couldn't help overhearing

00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:48,957
about your compass. Don't ever
give up hope, sir

00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:53,498
you never know what joy the
future may bring...

00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:57,458
The presentation...

00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:01,707
And its rolly. Not sir.
Okay

00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:05,917
rolly...

00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:17,082
Come on. Let's get up front

00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:21,208
I hear they talk about wild animals.
I don't care.

00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:25,832
Now Tori dear... come on frank.
Don't dawdle.

00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,499
Yes dear.

00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,416
Hi. We're from Wisconsin.

00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:36,707
Hey dora. Let's sit here front
and center

00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:40,498
I bet they're gonna talk about big
dangerous things we can do her eat the park

00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:44,832
okay. Sweetie. Look, I brought your big fluffy
coat, it might be getting cold later this evening.

00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:48,999
Are you kidding me dora. I still have
magnificent circulation. My body core

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,249
heats up like a furnace. I just
don't get cold. Remember that shoot

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,041
we did up in Alaska for pump me
up magazine? Not all of me

00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:02,375
was shriveled.

00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:20,957
Hey Sammy. I bet they started that campfire
with scaping magnesium powder and a cotton

00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,498
fluff tender application to the sparked
embers. I bet you're right uncle Sanford

00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:29,458
I know I am. Chapter
six. Woah. You're right

00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:34,499
chapter six in my book. Good job buddy.
Welcome to the park

00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:42,333
in the park you can call me Roldy.
Baldy?

00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,832
No.
Ballsy!

00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:49,498
Rolly's an R. I'm the head ranger for law enforcement
and environment protection here at the park

00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:53,458
here's my new partner. Spud
Washingtonpphi folks, glad you came

00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:56,916
it's so great to see so many...
You're sitting in the camp amphitheater

00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:01,582
in the central Meadow area between the eight
thousand foot height of crome dome. The two thousand

00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:05,665
falls. And the seven thousand
foot tall iceberg point.

00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,416
The park has over three million
visitors each year.

00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,498
With three thousand two hundred crimes
committed and an average of six hundred

00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:17,999
and twenty visitors incarcerated...
What ranger is telling you is

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,498
this is a beautiful place where
loads of our

00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:26,082
loads of our friends come to visit and
get back to the wonders of nature.

00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:30,791
Just smell that fresh pine
scent in the air

00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:37,498
we have a pioneer history
center and native American houses called

00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:41,790
umachas. Oh and the animals here...
Mountain lions. Skunk, mosquitoes, poison

00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:45,999
snakes. Sucking ticks, and even
some very large dangerous

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,499
bears. Wow. Mom, dad,
bears! Large bears dora!

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,999
Dangerous bears! Yes! I know about bears.
Chapter one sixty four in my book

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,707
chapter one sixty five. Uncle.
Chapter one sixty five.

00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:01,498
That's right. How to use sound
and movement to hypnotize an angry bear

00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:05,707
chapter one sixty five. You can buy my book.
Unabridged guide to the outdoors everybody

00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,957
it's really good. Thank you. Thank
you everybody. Thank you appreciate

00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:14,916
that. In fact. We've got a
ghost story, a mystery in the park

00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:19,540
oh dude!

00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:23,916
Here we go again. It's the man!

00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:28,209
It's the man.

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,498
Gotcha! Nine years ago one of our
law enforcement ranges traveling

00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:39,499
found a hideous crime on the valley floor

00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,291
it was an illegal squirrel feeding

00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:47,498
he was driving so fast he
accidentally hit a large bear cub.

00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:50,874
With the bumper of his patrol
vehicle. That ranger

00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:55,208
said he felt the bump. But thought something
was wrong his car motor, continued on

00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:59,499
to the place where the squirrel
feeding crime was being committed.

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,582
The bear was evidently struck hard enough

00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:07,832
by standers said the bumper tore off

00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:12,459
the whole side of his face.

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,916
Those who have been in the

00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:32,208
clutches of the bear. Few, proud

00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:35,498
still bear his mark

00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,498
but the bear. He did not die,
he grew into a huge two thousand

00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:43,790
five hundred pound bear that
lurks in the shadows of cliffs and

00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:47,540
he is seen on rare occasions but has never

00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:51,665
been able to be followed by
wildlife or ranger personnel

00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,499
somehow. He just disappears
every time he's tracked.

00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,208
Some of our law enforcement
rangers and visitors of the last

00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:03,665
years disappear without a trace

00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:07,707
some were hiking. Some were in
their cars, and some...

00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:11,498
Were drug from their tents
while peacefully sleeping

00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:15,957
some say the cause of these disappearances
may be the same huge rogue bear

00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:20,498
a giant. Frighteningly angry
disfigured mutant bear

00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:24,499
and we call him

00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,624
and we call him

00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:28,707
fuzzy wuzzy

00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,958
fuzzy wuzzy!

00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:51,498
But that was a story folks. Don't be
afraid. As for the rules and regulations

00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:55,999
there's no use of chainsaws or cut wood. No
walking in the meadows, no biking in the meadows

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,540
no feeding the deer. Birds,
squirrels, foxes, weasels, no petting

00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:05,250
skinks. Skunks snakes and drakes

00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:12,333
what is these. Little fairy

00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:16,916
oh.. You're a big fairy. Oh
you're a big fairy. Oh yeah

00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,249
you're a big big fairy

00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,790
oh. Hi

00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:28,540
oh. I'm on fire! I'm on fire!

00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:33,459
Angus. Fire, shelaliegh!
Aye shelalieh!

00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:44,498
Oh no!

00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:49,499
Stop. Drop and roll, uncle!
Stop drop and roll!

00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,499
I can't roll!

00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,499
Really sold out of all your other

00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,458
packs? Sorry. Sir, the
firefall crowd we were rushed

00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:16,499
and everything was sold. I'm
surprised we have anything left at all.

00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,749
We sold the last little boys'
happy furry chipmunk pack

00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,291
before you came. And all we
have left is the

00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:28,624
pretty pink Princess.

00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:33,541
Kinda interesting. Says things
when anyone whistles

00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:40,874
all right. Um. I'll take one.

00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:44,916
I'll take one of those. I can
make it work

00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:49,458
I know it's pink. But I can
make it work.

00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,498
I'm Stanford James.

00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:56,498
I'll be fine uncle Stanford. It'll get
dirty while we're out there surviving

00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:00,957
my pack can hold most of the
things we need. Remember chapter thirteen?

00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:05,208
Pack light but compete.
Yeah. Chapter thirteen

00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:09,750
right. All right buddy. Let's
go.

00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,124
Look at that pwetty pink
pwincess. Isn't so cutsie wootsie.

00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,707
[Doll] I'm pretty. I'm pink,
I'm the pretty

00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,499
Princess

00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,624
look at the loser that's wearing me!
Let's just go back to the hotel and pack

00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,416
for our hike.

00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:41,498
Where are the batteries on this thing

00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:45,498
hey. Check out those guys climb

00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:49,832
they're in kilts.
Wait a minute

00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:54,083
[growling]

00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,041
And so. We see that the
glaciers' steady carving

00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:08,916
the valley floor in a special u
shaped. Stones and boulders

00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:13,498
scored the valley floor that we see
today. Pphey on that big glacier...

00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:17,498
Frank! You're interrupting the ranger
it's OK I don't mind

00:50:17,499 --> 00:50:22,082
so I was wondering is this the
first time the glaciers have moved

00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:26,498
through he valley?
Mom!

00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:30,500
Tori...

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,583
Do they know where they're going?

00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:06,416
Are you OK honey?

00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:10,498
Is everything all right?
No.

00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:14,082
I'm not OK. I'm sick. I

00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:17,999
am completely fed up. You sick? I hate mom.

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,707
And I hate you too for letting
her be the way she is.

00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:26,291
The way she is... I can't tell her
how to behave. She walks all over

00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,582
you. Every day. You never stand
up to her.

00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:33,916
The more you give in. The more she
dominates her. You have to stand up to her.

00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:37,832
We always do what she wants. We
go where she wants to go. We

00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:42,665
see what she wants to see. We
even eat what she wants to eat. You're

00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,540
such. An milquetoast.

00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:51,083
I don't like confrontation.

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,374
My parents. Your grandparents

00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:02,374
they fought all the time when I
was a child

00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,999
and it hurt me really badly and
I never wanted

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,624
you and your brother have to
see the same things that I had to see

00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:14,540
I'm sorry.
You are sorry

00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:19,082
you'll always be sorry. I hate
that

00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:23,375
you're sorry.

00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:30,749
Well. Maybe I'll

00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,498
was wrong about a lot of things

00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:38,957
but we're gonna go back and join everyone else cause
we're still gonna try to get the top of crome dome

00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:43,374
after lunch. OK. Come on.

00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:47,499
Let's go

00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:03,041
woah dude

00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:07,124
are you making movie too?

00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:11,082
Wow. What's it about?

00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:14,749
Oh. A documentary. Hey...

00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,707
Do it on me. Dude. I've been
there man

00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:22,498
I been there. You remember when
Bob Dylan

00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:27,208
started a concert with an
electric guitar? That was my

00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:31,082
I never got that back.

00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,498
But I was down in Hollywood

00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:38,832
at capitola records. And Elvis
was gonna jump up and down on

00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:42,832
stage. I told the colonel,
dude, have him

00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:46,749
shake his hips. Man. The chicks
dig that.

00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:51,416
And Jim Morrison. He was gonna
name his band the

00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,790
windows. I said Jim,

00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:59,333
what are all the entrances in
life? The important

00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:02,832
passageways. Doors. Dude!

00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:06,832
Doors! And when I was in
England eating breakfast

00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,749
in Liverpool. I told the
busboy, an get that band

00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,707
put together. And later Paul
told me he George and John

00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,957
to play. And finally they got
Richard to drum. That kid

00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:23,416
Starkey. He was a great
drummer, a real star

00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:27,041
wonder if they ever made it.

00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:30,707
Oh me.\? After managing thirty
four bands

00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:35,166
I got this gig playing the
Indian love song her in the park

00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:39,082
during the firefall. Great gig.
Steady

00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:43,041
gig. Show every night for
years. Then the

00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:46,790
man closed it down. The man
closed down the

00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:51,833
gig. Dude. It was the man. You
have to Stand up to the man

00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:12,291
I just... I just really enjoy

00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:16,498
seeing all the people
experience the park. The nature.

00:55:16,499 --> 00:55:20,416
The geology. The history, it
makes me so happy.

00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,999
That's my favorite part of the
job. Really makes me

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,832
feel good to see the guests enjoy the
amazing scenery. And the beautiful

00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:32,458
waterfalls. Its the best.

00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:37,916
So. Spud, I hear that you're
originally from the area?

00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,749
Yeah. I was raised in Fresno, I
went to Clovis high school

00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:46,166
I really liked science in
school. But I guess I just always really

00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:50,041
loved animals
oh I love animals too! Back home

00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:53,874
we used to have horses. And
dogs and cats, and I even

00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:58,458
had a pet goat. His name was Brutus.
Me too. His name was Billy.

00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:02,208
Yeah. I had to kick him once,
because

00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:06,874
he tried to butt me. He never
tried that one again.

00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:10,498
Silly goat.

00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:14,374
[Radio] Meet me at reflection creek.

00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:18,249
There's a Scottish flag flying
off the cliff there.

00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,333
I'll drop you off spud. I
really enjoyed our little chat.

00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:27,041
It's kinda scary how much we
have in common. But I like it.

00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,540
You're very nice.

00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:35,459
I think you're really nice too Cecilia.

00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:42,333
Well dora. Ready to do big
things? I hear that ride up to

00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:46,458
reflection lake is world class
climb. And we're gonna be right

00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:50,082
under crome dome.
Did you remember to hydrate well. Like I

00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:54,208
reminded you this morning? You bet I did.
My body is coiled and ready to spring

00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:58,374
up that canyon like the wind. I
feel like a Bengal tiger. Say. Did ya pack

00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:02,249
any snack we can have at the
top? Maybe some of the goop? I love that

00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,582
goop. It's gorp. Honey. And yes, I
brought the kind that you love with the

00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:10,333
candy o the top.
Great. Back when I was mister buff

00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:14,498
pump up I did a photo shoot with Britta
Hilgendorfer she was miss European

00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:18,124
buff pump up. They put us on a
bicycle built for two. And it was

00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:22,498
great. You should have seen the muscles on
display that day. But of course that was before

00:57:22,499 --> 00:57:26,458
I met dora. And I really didn't
like Britta that way. She was. She was

00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:30,333
nice and all. But she never shaved her
pits, and she had a real low voice

00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:34,707
uh... I never could figure that out. I
thought it was because she was east German.

00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:39,498
Honey. Lets get going so we can
be back before lunch.

00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:43,291
All right let's go.

00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:47,708
Big things. Dora. Big things.

00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:07,498
[Panting]

00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:11,665
This. Uh, this is amazing

00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:14,208
[panting]

00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:19,707
We're starting to get to steep part. Make sure to
breathe deeply to get extra oxygen in your muscles.

00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:23,582
'Kay dora.

00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,958
[Panting] Amazing!

00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:35,958
You're slow fatty.

00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:47,498
Breathe honey you're almost there

00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:51,498

00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:55,540

keep those buff legs pumping!

00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:04,167
Keep on pumping! Keep on
pumping!

00:59:23,499 --> 00:59:27,832
Hugo are you all right. You
just made quite a

00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:31,832
climb.
I did it dora.

00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:35,707
I knew it. Big things.

00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:39,582
Sir are you all right?
Oh yes.

00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:43,582
He's always been a great athlete.
OK

00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:48,417
Excuse me...
Hugo. It's snack time

00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,291
excuse me. Ranger...

00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,874
Crotch...

00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:04,291
Nibbler...
It's krochnibler

01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:07,916
long o long I

01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,498
it's German.
Okay... well...

01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:15,498
This flag fell off that cliff.
And it hit my friend.

01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:20,374
Those guys again. I've been
seeing a lot of these lately

01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:24,499
krochnibler

01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:56,583
he's got your pipes!

01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:04,498
He's a Piper. And he's bustin up

01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:08,498
what a bonny Piper

01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:12,708
for Scotland!

01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:09,167
He learned the way as fast as
an Englishman.

01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:21,166
For Scotland!

01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,582
Hey!

01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,832
Learn to plant your flag better!

01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:32,498
Oh. Oh y, they’re...

01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:36,374
Wearing kilts...
Mom. Dad I want a kilt!

01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:40,582
Are we Scottish? Are we a clan?
Can I learn the bagpipes?

01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:45,374
That's cool.
Here. Take the flag honey.

01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:49,124
Cool.

01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:53,499
OK on to crome dome

01:02:57,334 --> 01:03:01,499
frank. Come on!

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,498
Now. Remember to use both your front and your
rear brakes when you go down the mountain, honey

01:03:16,499 --> 01:03:21,625
take it slow. You so deserve it
with that performance up the grade.

01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:28,874
I'm gonna bomb it. Try to keep
up

01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:33,498
dora. Here we go.
That's not a good idea. Hugo!

01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:37,833
Hugo slow down!

01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:10,042
Look out!

01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,166
Are you OK?

01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:21,874
I didn't get a good look at the
guy who almost hit ya

01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:26,167
for Scotland!

01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:33,790
Ranger baldy. Are you OK?
Benjy! Gt over here!

01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,250
Raldy. I'm coming

01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:50,334
here grab my hand.

01:04:53,541 --> 01:05:00,458
What the hell. Can you believe
that?

01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:05,041
Those free climbing scots.. That was my
father's father's hat. And it's gone.

01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:09,498
I'm sorry.
It's gone. Gone with the wind.

01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:13,791
See. Raldy... you

01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:25,498
thank you Zoe.
Your abs...

01:05:25,499 --> 01:05:29,416
I mean. You're welcome.

01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:34,000
Spud. Let's get me changed.
Again.

01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,999
Hello friend.
Hello. Wanna give you some help

01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,208
sure. My goodness. So I have a feeling
our Scottish friends left these for us

01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:21,333
yes. Aren't they so sweet?
Oh yes, I have been picking them up all day

01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:26,249
me too. I think we could line
our entire ranger station with them.

01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,249
I believe it.

01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:34,041
So on the way over I saw raldy
and spud heading over to the office again.

01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:37,166
No another uniform change?

01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:42,499
Yeah. A tourist on a bike ran raldy off
the bridge and he fell in the creek

01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:50,208
I know I pulled him out. When I
held his hand, I felt something

01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:53,458
yeah. Something wet!

01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:58,333
Oh no. Please tell me it wasn't
from the bomb bags, that's so gross.

01:06:58,334 --> 01:07:02,458
No. I mean... I felt

01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:06,498
something...
Oh

01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:10,374
that something!

01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,957
Yeah. He looked into my eyes

01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:18,416
and oh. I know he felt it too.
It was kinda cute

01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:22,749
he got all shy and turned red.

01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:26,498
OK.

01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:30,790
So. I got a confession

01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:34,498
OK.

01:07:34,499 --> 01:07:37,832
I kinda like spud.
Really.

01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:42,333
He's so friendly. Most guys
make fun of me for the way I talk

01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:45,582
or ignore me completely. But
spud he cares

01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:50,249
I mean at least about me as a person. Not
just a professional that he works with

01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,498
like. To him I count. And we
have a lot in common.

01:07:54,499 --> 01:07:58,999
That is so great. Spud is such
a nice guy

01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,082
yeah. He is.

01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:05,790
I just wish he felt something
for me the way raldy feels it for you.

01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:09,790
You really think raldy feels something for
me? You don't think I'm just imagining it?

01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:14,665
No I seen the way he looks at you. He did a
double take at you at the fire last night.

01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:18,540
He double took. Okay that it
good.

01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:23,333
Okay. Let's put these flags
back to the

01:08:23,334 --> 01:08:27,333
station.

01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:30,832
[Growling]

01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:34,874
Oh you know what else? Raldy
doesn

01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:39,499
look half bad with his shirt off.

01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:46,498
So as you can see. Some plants
are edible

01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:50,166
and can be used for outdoor
survival chapter seventy two of my book

01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:54,458
chapter eighty two. Uncle. Remember. See,
I'm still not sure that's a skunk cabbage.

01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:58,498
This is. It kinda looks like a
bladderwort. It is a skunk cabbage

01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:02,458
if it was bladderwort. I would
have diarrhea already, and I feel fine.

01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:06,249
Okay. I'll remember that. It's important
to know what you can eat, where

01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:10,416
you're going. And if you're in any danger in
the area when you're hiking. Very important

01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:14,999
take that hiker for instance right there. He
may be someone you want to watch out for.

01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,498
He's someone that may be a
threat if provoked.

01:09:19,499 --> 01:09:22,874
Kinda like some wild animals

01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:27,707
[hey big boy] Keep walking
who keeps talking to me?

01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:30,624
[Not me]

01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:35,498
The birds are setting it off
I know the birds are setting it off

01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:39,374
hey hot mamma!
Why you!

01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:43,458
[I like it rough }
Oh my god! Run!

01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:44,582
[I like it rough }
Oh my god! Run!

01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:48,083
Come back here you pervert

01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:55,498
hey. Hey.

01:09:55,499 --> 01:09:59,582
Hey guys. Come here. I think
he's gone

01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:03,498
okay listen. [Stomach gurgling]

01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:07,498
Ooh. My stomach doesn't feel
too good.

01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:11,790
OK. I think I'm gonna go off
the trail

01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:15,249
and dig a little cat hole.

01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:19,374
Chapter thirty four. Sometimes
these intestinal things happen

01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:24,417
due to physical activity that
changed my body chemistry

01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:56,499
weee!

01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:04,498
[La la look at me!]

01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:08,291
Squeek!

01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:12,498
Oh. I'm not gonna make it!

01:11:12,499 --> 01:11:16,666
Oh my god!

01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:32,498
Ouch!

01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:36,582
[Spank my naked Fanny!]

01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,665
Stinky perv!

01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:44,958
I'm so sorry!

01:12:04,499 --> 01:12:09,209
Why did I have to eat this
thing? Why me

01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:16,790
oh. I'm done. Oh my gosh, I'm
done!

01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:21,292
Oh. No! Nonononono!

01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:32,874
Oh. Ow!

01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:37,417
Oh I hate the wilderness!

01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:45,124
Oh. Relief!

01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:48,999
Thank you! I'm done!

01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,499
No. I'm not! No, I'm not!

01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:08,498
Ah. Sweet relief

01:13:08,499 --> 01:13:13,416
that had to have been a
bladderwort I ate. Had to have been.

01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:17,498
Oh no. No tp.

01:13:17,499 --> 01:13:21,498
Oh.

01:13:21,499 --> 01:13:25,498
Oh.

01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:29,541
No.

01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:41,708
[Bunny scream]

01:13:53,499 --> 01:13:56,874
Uncle Stanford! Was that

01:13:56,875 --> 01:14:01,291
a rabbit screaming? It sounded
like it was in trouble.

01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:05,416
No tp. Remember chapter one
fifty six?

01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:09,498
No! No not chapter one fifty
six!

01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:14,042
I'm not proud. I'm not proud.

01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,499
Nearly there. Nearly there.

01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:26,209
I have to sit down.
Oh lord.

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,124
Come on mom!

01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:37,499
Whoops!

01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,832
All right. Hey honey. Now that
we're

01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:46,417
here. Let your mom sit.

01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:58,291
I never thought we'd make it up
to the top of the rock! Dandy view!

01:14:58,292 --> 01:15:00,707
Isn't it.

01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:05,498
Oh man it's great. Think of how splattered your
body would be after you fall off the edge. I mean

01:15:05,499 --> 01:15:09,249
you'd look horrible after you
hit the bottom. Splat!

01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,999
All right kids. Make sure you drink you
water... ppyeah drink a lot of water.

01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,665
It wouldn't do to be dehydrated.

01:15:17,666 --> 01:15:21,957
You get bowels.
Gotta watch out for lumpy bowels

01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:26,498
I want lumpy bowels. It could
be fun

01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:29,916
sweetheart.

01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:34,416
Hey. Let's take a picture.
A family photo

01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:38,498

01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:42,082
Hey. Hi excuse me!

01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:46,166
Would all mind helping us take a picture

01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:49,582
it's for a movie. So the
camera's on

01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:53,999
and this is how you take the
picture. And it'll focus on its own.

01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,498
OK. Got it? Everybody let's
gather together.

01:15:58,499 --> 01:16:01,790
Frank. Come on. Frank!

01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:06,665
All right. Make a memory here
everybody let's get together.

01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:10,707
Wisconsin

01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:14,707

01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:19,000
For Scotland!

01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:26,166
Hey look!

01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:30,498
There's squirrels up here.
Big whoop. Big fat rodent

01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:34,498
pest begging for junk on a stupid rock

01:16:34,499 --> 01:16:38,749

01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:46,498
Did you see that? See if you
can get another one to do it.

01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:51,209
OK. Hey little fella. Here's a
cheesy poo

01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:06,999
we're being bombed by flying squirrels?
Squirrels. Aye

01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,540

01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:15,249

01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:39,208
I love wildlife.
Now that is what I call free climbing

01:17:39,209 --> 01:17:43,500
I wish I was a squirrel.

01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:51,416
That's sixteen. I that's all of
them

01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,498
that was really fun.

01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:59,333
Yeah. Y'know you're not so bad
for a little brother. A litter hyper

01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:03,708
but not so bad.
Squeee!

01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:11,750
I wonder if it would work on people...

01:18:19,459 --> 01:18:22,540
Wow dora. Actually gonna do it

01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:27,166
finally gonna challenge the
whitewater rapids of the famous park river

01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:30,582
make sure you get out before
the big rapids

01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:35,498
you only have three miles before you
have to get out... big things! Big

01:18:35,499 --> 01:18:39,208
B I G big dora. Well.

01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:43,874
See you downstream. I'm getting in.

01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,582
Oh dora!

01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:51,624
This is a much better spot here. Think all
this paddlings gonna pump up my pecs?

01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:56,125
This is gonna be epic!

01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:12,250
[Singing]

01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:34,916
That is how you make waterproof flares
out of fireberries. I mean it's perfect

01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:39,499
and you can use lichen berries to make tie
dye tee shirts. And you can find it all

01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:44,208
in my unabridged guide to the
outdoors. U G o

01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:48,499

01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:04,333
Run run run run!

01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:08,249
Oh Sammy I'm so sorry

01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,707
oh. Are you OK?
No, no!

01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:15,498
OK. We're gonna have to carry.
We need to find a place

01:20:15,499 --> 01:20:20,249
to go. We gotta find a place to
get in. It looks like it's gonna rain.

01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,833
It hurts.
Put your hand up here.

01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:41,042
[Thunder]

01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:52,166
Kids. All right

Kids. Come on. Get up

01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:03,665
to get up here. We're not
leaving now.

01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:08,166
It's going to be a full moon tonight. And what
an adventure, to walk down in the moonlight.

01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:12,291
Look. There's lightning on the
horizon, come on kids, get up, let's go.

01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:16,374
I said. We're not going. What
part of that did you not understand?

01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:20,498
That's it. I've had enough of
you. Do you want our kids to die?

01:21:20,499 --> 01:21:25,082
Don't you raise your voice at me!
I'll do more than that!

01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,498
Frank!
Come on kids!

01:21:28,499 --> 01:21:33,374
All right dad! Oh. I want her
do dodge the lightning bolts.

01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:37,499
Put me down!

01:21:41,499 --> 01:21:45,249
Angus lad

01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:49,374
we're at the last pitch

01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:53,540
if we didn't finish

01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,707
ID

01:21:56,708 --> 01:22:01,458
Even counting fer the squirrels
I'm for finishing

01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:05,624

01:22:13,499 --> 01:22:17,791
Up the wall!

01:22:25,499 --> 01:22:29,707
Hugo. It's starting to rain

01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:33,249
uh oh.

01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,832
You're getting close to the rapids Hugo

01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:41,958
Hugo!

01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:57,916

01:22:57,917 --> 01:23:02,167

01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:16,498

Dora!

01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:53,498
Oh. Dora!

01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:57,582
Thank you lord. Oh dor!

01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:01,333
I'm so thankful.

01:24:01,334 --> 01:24:06,000
Oh dora. It's not important
without you

01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:13,957
it

01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:17,916
S OK

01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:22,083
Sammy

01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:45,498
guess. What I'm trying to say, ranger
Washington, is you have something special. A gift

01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:48,832
something I haven't seen in a long time.

01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:53,916
I appreciate that. I think it comes down
to the great training you provided me.

01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:57,374
I agree. Well said.

01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:01,498
Well. As you know, I graduated
first in class at Quantico

01:25:01,499 --> 01:25:05,498
and I know a thing or two about
a thing or two.

01:25:05,499 --> 01:25:10,291
Ever tell you a story about me
or actually it was

01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:13,749
two guys...

01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,082
Ranger. A cougar jumped us on
the

01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,874
trail. Stanford James and Sammy steward
were chased up to the top of park falls

01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:25,498
I don't know if they made it or fell off. I
heard one of them yell in pain, they need help!

01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:30,333
Don't worry. We'll handle it.
Go get out of the rain. Go!

01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:33,582
Ranger krochnibler

01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:37,498
we have a code forty nine atop
park falls. Code three

01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:41,916
drop our duty weapons. And
putting on our rescue gear. Have ems ready

01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:46,498
ten four. Wish us luck Zoe.
Be safe raldy

01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:50,666
let's do this

01:26:02,499 --> 01:26:06,917
[bagpipe playing]

01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:14,707
We did it! For Scotland!

01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:18,916
For Scotland!

01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:22,208
Frank!

01:26:22,209 --> 01:26:25,540
You'll never act like a tyrant
again in this family.

01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:29,707
Again. Do you hear. Your controlling and
domineering ways nearly killed the children

01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:33,499
but I was just... you were just nothing.
All these years I tried so hard to be

01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:38,333
understanding and to listen to you but you got
worse and worse. Well that's all over. You got

01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:43,249
it? You got it? I got it.
All right kids. Let's go

01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:47,417
now!

01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:23,166
It's good to see you're awake
Sammy. You've been asleep for almost

01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:26,790
two hours.
How bad is my leg?

01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:30,498
Well. It's a bad sprain,
there's no broken bones.

01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:34,041
But you're not gonna be walking
without crutches for at least a week

01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:38,790
how we gonna get off this mountain. Though? I
figure the camera crew is already down there so they

01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:42,499
know we're up here. And on the
way here. I saw some

01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,582
fireberries. Above the cave on
the hill. That means I can go up there

01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:51,208
and make some flares with
those. Remember chapter two twenty seven?

01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:55,540
Yeah.
I gotta tell you something. Sammy

01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:59,749
I lost my show.

01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:03,582
I. Um

01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:07,291
I'm unemployed.

01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:11,540
I didn't come here to take my research to

01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:16,167
heart. Or to any wildlife

01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,498
I'm not an outdoors-man. You're
more of an outdoors-man than I am.

01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:27,498
What I know. I read in your
book, uncle.

01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:31,790
You are a great outdoors-man.
You really are.

01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:36,334
I wanna be. I'm gonna be.

01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:44,082
I've been reading my book. I'm gonna learn
it front to back. I'm gonna know it all

01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:47,498
love you Sammy.

01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:51,874
You're like a son to me.
There's no one else

01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:56,124
I'd rather do this with but you.

01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:59,999
I love you too. Uncle.

01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,665
Sammy. When I get my show back

01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:07,291
and I am gonna get my show
back. I want you

01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:12,374
to do it with me. I want you to
be there with me. Cause who knows my book

01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:15,291
better than you?

01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:19,416
All right. I'm gonna go up there and get
those flares made. And I'm gonna get

01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:24,249
them up here. We're gonna get
out of this OK don't worry. One more thing

01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:28,166
I want you to remember.

01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:32,498
Go out there! OK. I'll see ya

01:29:32,499 --> 01:29:38,209
[growling]

01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:17,498
Sammy. I presume. Are you all
right? Where is Stanford James?

01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:21,624
Probable sprain. I think he'll
be back in a minute

01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:25,498
raldy. Look around this cave,
this is where

01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:29,832
the missing ranges were taken.
Look at that do you think it belong

01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:34,498
to the ghost?
The ghost of fuzzy fuzzy

01:30:34,499 --> 01:30:38,291
raldy!

01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:42,333
See that face before?

01:30:42,334 --> 01:30:46,041
Grab the boy and run!

01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:49,999
We're near the top of the park falls!

01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,458
There's a ledge out here! Come
on out!

01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:58,499
Come on you monster!

01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,499
Do or die.

01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,833
Back fuzzy!

01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:31,083
You monster. Let's see what you've got!
I'm with you partner

01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:38,665
[i want you to hug me]

01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:42,124
Chapter two twenty seven

01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:46,416
watch this Sammy. Chapter one
sixty five, watch this bear

01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:50,624
fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy
wuzzy had no hair

01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:54,458
fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy was he?

01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:58,874
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy
wuzzy had no hair

01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:03,166
on the side of his face!

01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:06,540
Uncle. No!

01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:11,499
[I'm pink. I'm the pretty pink
Princess]

01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:22,498
Chapter one sixty one! Roots! You used
the roots to hang on after you went

01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:26,291
over the edge. Chapter one
sixty one! Uncle you are so

01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:30,208
smart now. How'd you know about the roots?
You were never near the edge

01:32:30,209 --> 01:32:34,624
that's true. But I knew that there were
bomb bags at the base of small ironwood

01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:38,416
tree. I knew that the roots
would go out all along

01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:42,832
long and stringy because of the
unnatural fertilizer at the bottom of this

01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:47,458
so in effect. We were all saved
by bomb bags

01:32:47,459 --> 01:32:51,498
that's pretty cool.

01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:55,708
Spud!
Raldy!

01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:35,375
[Frank!}

01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:54,291
do you see that? That's so
awesome

01:34:54,292 --> 01:34:58,459
yeah.

01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:21,957
Raldy?

01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:25,499
This is for you. You dropped it
when you were

01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:30,249
knocked off the bridge near crome
dome yesterday you found my compass?

01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:34,498
Thank you Zoe. It means a lot
to me

01:36:34,499 --> 01:36:38,958
you repaired it? It works!

01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:46,958
It's so beautiful

01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:55,083

01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:18,874

01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:26,874
Wow.

01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:31,292
Look at it now.

01:37:59,209 --> 01:38:01,665
For Scotland!

01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:06,458
