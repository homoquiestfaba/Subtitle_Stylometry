I'm really sorry.

31
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,328
Gorgeous, too.

00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:19,029
I mean, perfect bodies.

Ray, I mean,
if we're out of beer,
let's just split.

39
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,278
Are you kidding me?
I wanna see these girls.

40
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:36,380
Women, not girls.

41
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:38,948
Besides, I got another
six-pack in the car.

42
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,085
Why don't you
go get it for us?

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,786
Come on, Ray.

44
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,423
I'm hungry.
Let's just, um...

45
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,125
Let's go get something
to eat, okay?

You're always hungry.

00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:53,464
What did I tell you about
watching your figure, hmm?

48
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,832
Why don't you get
a nice little workout
down the hill?

49
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,134
There you go.
That a girl.

50
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:58,135
Ya!

You know,
fuck Phillip.

You can do so much
better than him.

You don't know
they're lezzies, man.

59
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:50,254
Maybe they're sisters.

60
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,555
You ever kiss
a girl like that, Jen?

61
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:53,090
[Jennifer]
No, of course not.

62
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,259
You ever touch a girl's hair
the way she was doing before?

63
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,228
Just come off it, Ray.

64
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,295
You see?
I told ya.

65
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,896
They're fuckin'
lesbians.

66
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,566
Couple of
daddy's girls, too.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,934
Brand-new jeans
to go camping in,
for Christ's sake.

68
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,709
You know what we ought
to do, Timmy?

69
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,245
We ought to pop 'em.
[laughs]

70
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:15,812
What?

71
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:17,982
Pop 'em.

72
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,721
You see, Jen,
you don't get it.

73
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:26,889
You never shot
a rabbit before.

74
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,559
Tim and I have, though.

75
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:32,396
One minute
everything is fine.

76
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:36,799
Hey. We're hopping down
the bunny trail.

77
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,435
The next minute, pow!

78
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:39,902
Rabbit hell,
and you caused it.

79
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,572
You took him there,
and he ain't coming back.

80
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,542
So, Jen, you gotta think like,
"What would it feel like?

81
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,114
What would it fucking
feel like to shoot a person?"

82
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,950
Lezzies?
Who gives a fuck?

83
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,918
They're not gonna
have kids, right?

84
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,288
Who's gonna miss 'em?

85
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,256
You don't know
they're lezzies.
Not from just...

86
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,857
you know, getting naked
and stuff.

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,427
Shut up, Tim.
Maybe they're European.

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,330
No. I heard about
these European chicks,

89
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,599
and they got this custom
where they just get
naked together.

90
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:10,434
You are so fucking
full of shit, Tim.

91
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,435
You don't know, man.

92
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,802
I just wish
that I could

93
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,605
completely just
hate him, you know?

94
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:17,474
But it's just that he really
is so sorry afterwards.

95
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:20,244
Oh, God.
Come on, Lisa.

96
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:21,944
He's already done this
to you twice.

97
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,781
Do you really think
he's not gonna
do it again?

98
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,082
Yeah, I know.

alive out here tonight.

I packed bug spray.

104
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,296
Even if he hadn't
hit you,

105
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,830
you know it wasn't gonna
work out, right?

106
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:42,533
Yeah, I guess.
You guess?

107
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,635
God, don't you remember
Johnny Norman?

108
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,403
He was exactly
like this guy.

109
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,439
I mean, he was cute
and he was popular,

110
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,140
but he was fucking
full of himself

111
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,709
you couldn't even
stand him for two months.

112
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:56,313
Yeah, you're right.
I don't get it.

Why do I always
do this to myself?

everything right.

just not doing it

the right person yet.

We're gonna
bury 'em, Tim.

Then we're gonna pack up
all their gear,

and we're gonna
dump it.

ever know they were here.

a plan to you?

in the storage shed.

00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,275
No, man,
it belongs to a friend.

711
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:34,444
Well, may I speak
to your friend, then, please?

712
00:42:34,478 --> 00:42:36,513
Actually,
he's in the john.

713
00:42:36,547 --> 00:42:37,781
He's in the john?

714
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:39,216
Yeah.

715
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,818
Well, then will you
get him for me, please?

716
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:42,920
Sure.

717
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:46,690
[knock on bathroom door]

718
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:50,127
Officers, is there
some problem?

719
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,230
Hey, Ray. You mind
if we all come in and
hang out for a moment?

720
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,531
I guess you
have a warrant.

721
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:56,066
Why would we have
a warrant

722
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,401
for a simple
noise complaint, Ray?

723
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,403
No, we just
want to come in
and have a chat

724
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:00,704
like you and I
did yesterday.

725
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:05,108
The guy who killed
those two young girls.

726
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:06,209
[Girl]
What?

727
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:07,444
The guy that looked
a lot like you.

728
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:10,914
Uh, listen, Officer,

729
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:12,883
we're just having
a little party here,

730
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:15,252
and we'll turn down
the volume, okay?

731
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:17,854
I apologize personally
if we disturbed anyone.

732
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,823
You smell something
funny, guys?

733
00:43:19,856 --> 00:43:21,858
I kinda do, now
that you mention it.

734
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:25,395
You smoking weed, Ray?

735
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:27,564
Nope. What you smell
must be cigarettes.

736
00:43:27,598 --> 00:43:30,400
Oh. My buddy here?
Great cook.

737
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:32,436
He burned a pan
on the stove
making popcorn.

738
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,371
Oh, making popcorn?
Yeah.

739
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,040
Burnt pan?
That's right.

740
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:39,409
All right, you guys,
the party's over.

741
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:41,778
You know, I don't think
you can do that.

742
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:43,580
Sure I can, Ray.

743
00:43:43,614 --> 00:43:45,083
You know, I'm
looking around here

744
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:47,618
and probably
three-quarters of these
kids are minors.

745
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:50,420
From right here,
I can see empty cans,
bottles, beer.

746
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:52,756
You want us to come in
and start I.D.ing
everybody,

747
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:54,524
make them walk the line?

748
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:56,094
I mean,
it might take a while,

749
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:57,894
but we got plenty of
time, right, guys?

750
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,696
I.D.ing everybody
would be fun.

751
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,432
Stretch out your hand,
touch the tip of your nose,
all that, sure.

752
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:03,767
Jesus Christ!
What did you say, Ray?

753
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,770
Nothing.
You religious?

754
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:09,606
[chuckles]
Jesus?

755
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,109
You know the way
that you said that

756
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:13,276
could be construed
as a curse word.

757
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,778
Are you using curse words
in the presence

758
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,580
of officers
of the law, Ray?

759
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,117
No, not at all.

760
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:21,718
Okay, well, uh,
you heard the man.

761
00:44:21,752 --> 00:44:23,153
The party's over.

762
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:45,109
Okay, Miss,
let's go.

763
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:46,977
Well, I'm staying here.

764
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,146
Your mom and dad
know that?

765
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,913
I'm 20 years old.

766
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:52,016
Could I see
some I.D.?

767
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,188
Um...

768
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:02,994
Okay. Sorry to have
troubled you, Miss Fitch.

769
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:05,129
Hey, Ray.
Buddy.

770
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,197
I will definitely
see you around.

771
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,398
All right, killer.

772
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:12,402
Good night.

773
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,383
Uhh!
Aah!

774
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:29,920
Aah!

775
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:34,591

776
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:50,741

00:45:57,914 --> 00:45:59,217
Ray?

778
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:09,593
Look, I-- I know
how you feel, I really do.

779
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:13,597
And it was-- it was
a great party, too,

780
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,399
until they came along.

781
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:20,837
Look, just...just...

782
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:23,406
just talk to me, okay?

783
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,375
Okay? And then...

784
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,943
And then maybe,
in a while,

785
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:28,578
we'll clean up
the place, all right?

786
00:46:28,612 --> 00:46:31,515
And then...

787
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:34,951
and then we'll plan
an even bigger party, okay?

788
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:39,790
Just--I mean, maybe
for the weekend, okay?

789
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:42,226
That'll show 'em.
Won't it?

790
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,760
Won't it?

791
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,000
Did you think it was
a really great party?

792
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:52,170
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
Everybody did.

793
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:54,038
Yeah? What were you
doing standing
by the window,

794
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:55,806
fucking sulking
with Timmy, then?

795
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,375
Oh. Um, I was--
I was just a little tired.

796
00:46:58,408 --> 00:46:59,976
That's bullshit!

797
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:01,745
Okay, I just--
I just...

798
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,547
Ray, I just
got depressed, okay?

799
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,116
That's all.

800
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:08,119
You know, it's like all those
other girls were here, okay?

801
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:10,087
And that Dee Dee,
you know?

802
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,722
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

803
00:47:12,756 --> 00:47:14,424
It's--

804
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,894
It's just that you know
how I feel about us, right?

805
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:20,430
I just got a little
depressed, that's all.

806
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,133
I couldn't help it, okay?

807
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:26,237
And I know it's dumb
because-- because I love you,

808
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,307
and I know that
you love me back, okay?

809
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,675
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

810
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,511
Take off your blouse.
I wanna see your tits.

00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,814
Jen, take off your blouse.
I want to see your tits.

Come on!

813
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,497
Undo me.

814
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,043
You want them
all the way off?

815
00:48:06,077 --> 00:48:08,212
Did I say I wanted them
all the way off?

816
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,873
You know what?
Fuck it. Just forget it.

817

Just get out of here.

Just-- You know what?
Just fuck it.

820
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:17,881
Get your stuff
and go home.

821
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,117
Fuck. Ray, come on.
This-- It happens.

822
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:22,452
It doesn't happen to me!
No, it doesn't!

Look, I've got an idea.

824
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:26,756
Why don't you just let me
help you clean up the place?

825
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,393
And then maybe
in a little while,

826
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:30,627
we'll just take
another shot at it.

827

No! No, all right?

828
00:49:32,296 --> 00:49:34,065
No, Jen, no.

829
00:49:34,098 --> 00:49:36,434
We will not take another
fucking shot at it!

of you to go right now.

Ray gave it to you?

gives up hash.

00:54:59,757 --> 00:55:00,724
Doing fine.

886
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:02,092
What would you
like to drink?

887
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:04,762
I'll take a scotch
and soda.
Banana daiquiri.

888
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,063
Thank you.

889
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:14,605
Ahem.

890
00:55:14,638 --> 00:55:16,540
Do you want to play
a little game?

891
00:55:16,573 --> 00:55:18,008
What kind of game?

892
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:19,109
It's called Truth.

893
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:21,111
I ask you
a question.

894
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:23,414
You have to answer it
completely and truthfully,
no bullshit.

895
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:24,947
Then you can
ask me a question.

896
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:27,117
I'll run a tab
for you?

897
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:28,118
Please do.

898
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:29,386
So what do you think?

899
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,288
Okay.
I'll give it a shot.

900
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:37,194
Do you wear make-up?

901
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,965
Oh!

902
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,703
Yeah. Sometimes.

903
00:55:45,736 --> 00:55:47,338
But you know,
when you play in a band,

904
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:50,607
you gotta know about things
like hair color and make-up.

905
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:53,143
I mean, it's just
part about being serious
about what you do.

906
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:56,347
I don't overdo it,
and most people
never even notice.

907
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,148
It's my turn, right?
Mm-hmm.

908
00:55:59,316 --> 00:56:01,352
What do you really
think about me?

909
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:07,424
First of all, um,
I hardly know you.

910
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,493
You're funny.

911
00:56:09,526 --> 00:56:10,794
[laughs]

912
00:56:10,828 --> 00:56:12,730
Yeah.

913
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:14,164
Quirky in a way
I kinda like.

914
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:16,333
Good-looking.

915
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:17,900
Conceited.
Conceited?

916
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:20,471
Okay, in this game,
you're not allowed
to interrupt.

917
00:56:20,504 --> 00:56:21,705
Okay.

918
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:24,007
And you hang around
with a bunch of losers.

919
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,176
But then again,
you know...

You have secrets.

923
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,384
You talk a lot,
but don't say much.

924
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:37,020
I find that
kinda interesting.

925
00:56:37,054 --> 00:56:40,124
Is that all?
Yeah, yeah, for now.

926
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,892
It's my turn.

927
00:56:42,925 --> 00:56:44,894
Are you actually
fucking Jennifer?

928
00:56:44,927 --> 00:56:46,196
No.
No?

929
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,998
Absolutely not.
Never?

930
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:49,233
That's another question.

931
00:56:49,266 --> 00:56:50,868
So now it would be
my turn again, right?

932
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,169
Sure.

933
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:53,470
Are you
attracted to me?

934
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:57,040
You see? I told you
you were conceited.

935
00:56:57,074 --> 00:56:59,143
Those two questions
were both about you.

936
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:00,377
No, they're not.

937
00:57:00,411 --> 00:57:03,046
I was just trying to see
how you see me is all,

938
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,716
you know, like your own
personal perception.

939
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:07,384
That's different, right?

940
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:10,454
Okay, yeah.

941
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:14,057
I find you attractive.

942
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:17,428
That doesn't necessarily
mean I'm gonna do
anything about it.

943
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,832
But yes. In a strange
sort of way, yeah, I do.

948
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,428
I trashed a house once.
I was 17.

949
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,564
Timmy and I both
ran away from home.

950
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:55,732
It just seemed
like a cool idea.

951
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,701
Just run away.

952
00:57:57,734 --> 00:57:59,336
Just get the hell
out of there, you know?

953
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,472
Timmy knew this place
up on Stir Fire Road

954
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:03,640
where his dad had done
some work as a carpenter.

955
00:58:03,674 --> 00:58:05,275
It was way the hell
out in the boonies.

956
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:06,877
The owners only use it
in the summertime.

957
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,312
And here it was winter,

958
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:10,113
so the two of us
broke in there.

959
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:14,384
I mean, all they had
to eat was SpaghettiOs,

960
00:58:14,418 --> 00:58:15,986
but the liquor cabinet
was full,

961
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,889

996
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:41,264
My mom was diagnosed
a paranoid schizophrenic

997
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:43,767
a couple of years ago,

998
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,469
and she went from being

999
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:48,271
this terrific painter
of Abstractionist--

1000
01:00:48,305 --> 01:00:50,074
She even had shows
in New York--

1001
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:51,308
She went from there
to thinking that

1002
01:00:51,341 --> 01:00:53,977
the entire art world
was out to get her.

1003
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:55,779
Not just the art world,
but the cops, too.

1004
01:00:55,812 --> 01:00:56,981
One Saturday afternoon,

1005
01:00:57,015 --> 01:00:58,882
my mom's
in one of her rages.

1006
01:00:58,915 --> 01:01:00,384
and she's off
her medication again.

1007
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,618
It was a nice day,

1008
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:03,754
and she was digging up
violets and begonias,

1009
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:05,956
insisting I help
and yelling at me to

1010
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,624
"go and get a shovel,
God damn it,

1011
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:09,226
because there's somebody
buried in there."

1012
01:01:09,259 --> 01:01:15,133
Finally, I was just
so sick of all this
crazy bullshit.

1013
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:16,833
So I told the lie.

1014
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:20,303
I told her that my dad
had come into the room
the night before

1015
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:22,639
and said that he was
leaving her and moving now.

1016
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:24,975
"So fuck her
and her bodies
buried in the garden.

1017
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:27,111
She can just go
dig them up herself."

1018
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:30,148
It was kind of
the last straw...

1019
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,948
not being able
to trust my father.

1020
01:01:31,983 --> 01:01:34,618
So this one night,
my mom snuck
into the kitchen.

1021
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:36,154
She turned
the grill on high,

1022
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:38,889
waited until
it was really hot.

1023
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:42,959
Aah!

1024
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:51,169
The idea was that
she was trying to burn
away her fingerprints.

1025
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:53,870
She wouldn't let my dad
touch her, just me,

1026
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:57,075
but I didn't know
how the fuck to deal
with burns that bad.

1027
01:01:59,509 --> 01:02:01,678
She never painted again
after that.

1028
01:02:03,947 --> 01:02:05,049
Damn.

1029
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,051

Sure!
It's not too cold.

1099

No swimsuits, Ray.

a swimsuit?

It's possible.

Does that bother you?

Not unless
it bothers you.

1104

of a leech on your dick--

to take its chances.

keep the leeches down.

Enough with
the leeches, Ray.

to go in first

nasty leeches
by yourself.

Maybe...

like, a snake or two.

1114

I thought this was your idea
to go in the pool.

right in after you.

around a little.

Because you won't
face it at home, right?

You know, this isn't
my style, Ray.

01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,552
What?

01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:16,087
Just fuck me.

For what?

1134
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:31,861
That was a little fast.

1135
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:33,830

01:09:46,177 --> 01:09:49,146
You remember last night?

1140
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:52,483
When you asked me
what the worst thing
I ever did was?

1141
01:09:52,516 --> 01:09:54,385
I told you about
trashing that house?

1142
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:55,718
Mm-hmm.

1143
01:09:57,321 --> 01:09:58,622
It was a lie.

1144
01:09:58,656 --> 01:10:00,157
The trashing the house?

1145
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,326
No, we trashed
the house.

1146
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:09,400

thing I ever did.

I don't know what
to say to you, Ray.

1148
01:10:18,209 --> 01:10:20,277
I don't know whether
to believe you, either.

1149
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:22,346
It's pretty fucked up, though,
you know, either way.

1150

I'm pretty fucked up.

1151

I've been fucked up
for a while.

1152
01:10:26,684 --> 01:10:28,918
So you didn't tell me.

1153
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:34,325
What did it feel like?

1154
01:10:38,028 --> 01:10:40,863
I did tell you.

1155
01:10:40,897 --> 01:10:43,833
No.

1156
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:46,136
Tell me what
it felt like after.

1157
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:50,608
Not then.

1158
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:53,810
At the time, not when you were
out there killing people.

Jesus.

1160
01:11:00,251 --> 01:11:03,886
Do you, uh...

1161
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,390
do you really
want to hear this?

1162
01:11:06,423 --> 01:11:08,726
I guess I must.

1163
01:11:08,758 --> 01:11:10,927
I'm asking, huh?

1164
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:21,238
Okay.

1165
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:22,905
Uh...

1166
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:30,681
It felt scary.

1167
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:38,322
It felt dangerous,
and it felt scary.

1168
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:49,533
But I gotta tell you.

1169

I gotta be
honest with you.

It also felt like
I had all this this
power all of a sudden.

1171
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:04,148
Like I could scare them
or, uh...

1172
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:07,418
or wound them
or whatever.

I started shooting,

I could stop
and let them live,

doing what I was doing.

she suffered?

go now, Ray.

to do.

San Francisco first
thing in the morning.

you could say exposed.

I feel like people
are staring at me.

older than my dad.

So you're gonna get
drunk on me now?

You got a reputation
to think about.

I'm leaving it
in its tracks.

live in this town

Don't fuck around
with me, Ed.

1235
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:01,585
I just don't feel
like the way I did.

1236
01:16:01,618 --> 01:16:03,520
I just think that--

1237
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:06,523
I was wondering
maybe I don't...

1238
01:16:06,557 --> 01:16:10,227
Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this and...

1239
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,863
maybe I shouldn't
be doing this.

1240
01:16:12,896 --> 01:16:15,432
So you want
to call it quits?

you're so young.

Don't say that to me!

It's not my reputation
that you're worried about.

01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,074
It's your reputation,

1246
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:26,376
and you're putting that
in front of us.

to open up to me

and worries me bad,

1363
01:24:29,659 --> 01:24:31,694
is what does a guy
like that do

that he's been betrayed, hmm?

in the shootings of
Elise Hanlon and Lisa Steiner.

I think you said

and you were.

about the other thing?

were sleeping with him.

lie about you and Ray?

Ray give you that?

1406
01:26:23,673 --> 01:26:25,975
It's...

1407
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,211
It's a diamond.

1408
01:26:27,244 --> 01:26:30,880
No, sweetie,
it's not a diamond.

1409

[laughs]

1410
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,985
No, that's
an Austrian crystal.

1411
01:26:35,019 --> 01:26:37,988
You know, if you
hit that with a hammer,

1412
01:26:38,022 --> 01:26:39,190
it'll shatter.

1413
01:26:39,223 --> 01:26:40,823
Probably shouldn't, though.
Kinda pretty,

1414
01:26:40,857 --> 01:26:43,561
even though it's
not really a diamond.

1415

Uh...

1418
01:27:09,386 --> 01:27:12,022
I'm sorry
for your loss, sir.

1419
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:13,823
Thanks.

Is-- Is Kath--
Is she available?

1421
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:18,696
I just wanted to give her
my condolences.

1422
01:27:18,728 --> 01:27:20,664
Certainly.
Come inside.

1423
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:22,233
Thank you.

1424
01:27:22,266 --> 01:27:24,535
Someone's here
to see you, Kath.

1425

Hi, Kath.

Hi.

1427

What are you
doing here?

1428
01:27:48,459 --> 01:27:50,561
We just got back

Come on.
Come outside with me.

1431

I bought these
for you.

1432

Thanks.

1433
01:28:00,204 --> 01:28:02,506
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

1434
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:04,441
I really missed you.

1435
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:08,978
Man, you don't--
you don't even know
how much I did.

1436
01:28:09,013 --> 01:28:10,247
Why didn't you
call me?

1437
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:12,149
I couldn't
call you, Ray.

1438
01:28:12,182 --> 01:28:14,018
Why not?
A phone call?

1439
01:28:14,051 --> 01:28:16,186
Look, Ray,
we'll talk, okay?

1440
01:28:18,855 --> 01:28:20,790
I'll call you tomorrow
once we're settled in.

1441
01:28:20,823 --> 01:28:23,060
Christ, Kath,
I mean, like, tomorrow?

1442
01:28:23,093 --> 01:28:24,894
It's been going on for,
like a whole week?

1443
01:28:24,927 --> 01:28:26,297
Tomorrow?

1444
01:28:32,469 --> 01:28:33,771
I'll call you tonight.

01:28:47,718 --> 01:28:51,622
Kath. Great.
How you doing?

1450
01:28:51,655 --> 01:28:52,822
I'm fine.

1451
01:28:52,855 --> 01:28:53,890
How's your dad?

1452
01:28:53,923 --> 01:28:56,126
He's okay.

1453
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,128
I made some dinner.
We watched some television.

1454
01:28:58,162 --> 01:28:59,797
Fairly normal evening.

1455
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:01,165
Well, he'll be okay.
It just takes time.

1456
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:03,467
I've got a little
present for you.

1457
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,135
I think you'll like it.

1458
01:29:05,169 --> 01:29:07,137
I thought maybe
you could come over,
we could hang out--

1459
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:09,972
I can't do this anymore.
Huh?

1460
01:29:10,007 --> 01:29:11,141
I mean, I like you,

1461
01:29:11,175 --> 01:29:13,143
and we had a good
time together.

1462
01:29:13,177 --> 01:29:14,778
I just don't think

1463
01:29:14,812 --> 01:29:17,648
we should keep on
seeing each other.

1464

I love you.

I'm saying, Ray.

You're just hearing

hear, you know that?

01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,422
Aah!
Stay fucking right there!

1753
01:43:51,455 --> 01:43:53,457
What are your names?

1754
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:55,492
[Man]
Ken.

1755
01:43:55,526 --> 01:43:58,996
Ken.
Ken Wellman.

1756
01:43:59,029 --> 01:44:00,364
This is my wife--

1757
01:44:00,397 --> 01:44:03,434
Don't tell me--
Aah!

1758
01:44:03,467 --> 01:44:04,867
Is it Barbie?

1759
01:44:04,901 --> 01:44:05,902
Is that your
fucking name?

1760
01:44:05,935 --> 01:44:07,870
Her name's
Elizabeth. Liz.

1761
01:44:07,904 --> 01:44:11,175
Don't you fucking
come near me, man!

1762
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:12,576
Really?

1763
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:14,877
Well, that's just
fucking great.

1764
01:44:14,911 --> 01:44:17,514
I hope everyone's having
a fucking great time!

1765
01:44:17,548 --> 01:44:19,717
Wow.

1766
01:44:19,749 --> 01:44:21,719
You got movers
coming in tomorrow?

1767
01:44:21,751 --> 01:44:22,752
[Ken]
Yes.

1768
01:44:22,785 --> 01:44:25,322
What time?
8:00.

1769
01:44:25,356 --> 01:44:28,092
Listen, I don't know
what you want here,
but for God's sake--

1770
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:30,060
For God's sake
fucking what?

1771
01:44:31,629 --> 01:44:33,731
Listen,
you be cool, okay?

1772
01:44:33,763 --> 01:44:35,432
You be fucking cool,
my man.

1773
01:44:35,466 --> 01:44:38,068
You just do as you're
told, you'll be okay.

1774
01:44:38,102 --> 01:44:39,936
[crying]

1775
01:44:39,969 --> 01:44:41,705
My business
is with the girls.

1776
01:44:41,739 --> 01:44:43,274
This is my fucking
business, Kenny!

1777
01:44:43,307 --> 01:44:44,907
These are
all my girls.

1778
01:44:44,941 --> 01:44:46,776
Don't you fucking--
Aah!

1779
01:44:49,946 --> 01:44:51,515
Don't fucking move!

1780
01:44:51,548 --> 01:44:53,916
Where's the fucking plug?

1781
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,719
Don't fucking move!

1782
01:44:55,753 --> 01:44:57,421
I can see you,
you know what I mean?

1783
01:44:57,454 --> 01:44:59,956
I can see what you're
fucking doing!

1784
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:02,593
Right?

1785
01:45:02,626 --> 01:45:04,061
Whoo!

1786
01:45:04,094 --> 01:45:05,962
Get the fuck over there
and fucking stay there!

1787
01:45:07,797 --> 01:45:09,266
Okay.

1788
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,070
Kenny...

1789
01:45:13,103 --> 01:45:14,772
your old lady.

1790
01:45:14,837 --> 01:45:16,806
She's pregnant, man,
isn't she?

1791
01:45:16,839 --> 01:45:18,975
That's cool.

1792
01:45:19,009 --> 01:45:22,446
Good for you, man!
Good for you.

1793
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:24,481
You know why guys
like pregnant women?

1794
01:45:24,515 --> 01:45:25,783
A wife and kids?

1795
01:45:25,815 --> 01:45:27,084
I thought about it.
It's easy.

1796
01:45:27,117 --> 01:45:29,653
It's because a guy looks
at a pregnant woman

1797
01:45:29,687 --> 01:45:30,654
and wants a little kid,

1798
01:45:30,688 --> 01:45:32,056
he knows they
can be fucked!

1799
01:45:32,089 --> 01:45:33,890
You know what I mean?
So they can be fucked!

1800
01:45:33,923 --> 01:45:35,858
I mean, someone's fucking them.
You know what I'm saying?

1801
01:45:35,892 --> 01:45:38,162
How far along are you?
Three months.

1802
01:45:38,195 --> 01:45:40,097
I bet you folks
want a boy, right?

1803
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:43,500
We don't care.
either way.

1804
01:45:43,534 --> 01:45:44,668
Either way,
you're happy, right?

1805
01:45:44,702 --> 01:45:46,470
Why don't you guys
give me a hand?

1806
01:45:46,503 --> 01:45:48,572
You're all silent.
That's what I need.

1807
01:45:48,605 --> 01:45:50,940
See, I want you
to give me a hand
with the girls.

1808
01:45:50,973 --> 01:45:53,077
I got some serious talking
to do to them.

1809
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:54,944
I want them to pay
close fucking attention.

1810
01:45:54,977 --> 01:45:56,347
Like you right now.

1811
01:45:57,648 --> 01:45:58,982
Like you fucking
right now!

1812
01:45:59,016 --> 01:46:00,317
Pay the fuck
attention!

1813
01:46:00,351 --> 01:46:01,819
Think you can give me
a hand, Kenny?

1814
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:04,188
What do you say?

1815
01:46:04,221 --> 01:46:06,223
You're a pal, Kenny.
What do you say?

1816
01:46:08,225 --> 01:46:10,160
Uh, you know...

1817
01:46:10,194 --> 01:46:12,596
Did you know
that Sharon Tate was
pregnant, Kenny?

1818
01:46:12,629 --> 01:46:14,798
You know Sharon Tate,
the movie actress,

1819
01:46:14,832 --> 01:46:17,000
got herself gutted
by the fucking
Manson family.

1820
01:46:17,034 --> 01:46:21,638
Amazing, terrific
piece of ass.
The fucking best!

1821
01:46:21,672 --> 01:46:23,873
I think she's further
along, Liz, though.

1822
01:46:23,906 --> 01:46:25,309
I don't even remember.
Does it matter?

1823
01:46:25,342 --> 01:46:28,278
She's dead.
She's fucking dead.

1824
01:46:28,312 --> 01:46:29,847
Kenny, I can't afford--

1825
01:46:29,879 --> 01:46:31,515
I'm losing my fucking
patience, Kenny!

1826
01:46:31,548 --> 01:46:32,516
What do you say?

1827
01:46:32,549 --> 01:46:34,118
All right.
I'll do what you want.

1828
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:35,652
Lizzie?

1829
01:46:35,686 --> 01:46:36,720
All right.

1830
01:46:36,754 --> 01:46:38,955
All right? Yes!

1831
01:46:38,989 --> 01:46:40,457
The other two, maybe,

1832
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:43,060
you could maybe
see it coming,

1833
01:46:43,093 --> 01:46:44,894
but Jennifer...

1834
01:46:47,998 --> 01:46:50,067
He's been with
Jennifer forever.

1835
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,035
Listen, kid,
where else would he go?

1836
01:46:52,069 --> 01:46:54,405
[weeps]

1837
01:46:58,742 --> 01:47:00,344
There's
this drummer Roger,

1838
01:47:00,377 --> 01:47:03,080
but see, Roger's
deep into drugs and...

1839
01:47:03,113 --> 01:47:04,681
You know, I-- I...

1840
01:47:04,715 --> 01:47:08,085
I can't see him
risking having Ray
there and-- and guns.

1841
01:47:08,118 --> 01:47:10,387
The only other guy
I can think of,

1842
01:47:10,421 --> 01:47:14,558
the only other one,
is Sammy Nardoni.

1843
01:47:14,591 --> 01:47:16,894
He's the one that
gives us the hash.

1844
01:47:16,926 --> 01:47:18,862
Okay. You know
these people's addresses?

1845
01:47:18,896 --> 01:47:20,564
I don't know them exactly,

1846
01:47:20,597 --> 01:47:23,100
but I have them
written down at home.

1847
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:24,735
Get on that phone,

1848
01:47:24,768 --> 01:47:26,770
call Mommy and Daddy
at home,

1849
01:47:26,804 --> 01:47:28,272
and get me
those addresses.

1850
01:47:28,305 --> 01:47:30,707
Lieutenant Anderson and I
are going outside for a minute.

1851
01:47:30,741 --> 01:47:32,942
We'll be right back.

1852
01:47:38,482 --> 01:47:39,917
Lieutenant Anderson?

1853
01:47:39,949 --> 01:47:42,119
It's a force of habit.
Sorry.

1854
01:47:42,152 --> 01:47:44,421
And I like their names.
Gus is right.

1855
01:47:44,455 --> 01:47:46,023
Who's gonna let this kid
into the house

1856
01:47:46,056 --> 01:47:47,758
with three scared girls
held at gunpoint?

1857
01:47:47,791 --> 01:47:49,426
Gotta be nuts.

1858
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:52,796
Unless that Nardoni
character's some kind
of real hard case.

1859
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:55,432
Maybe then.
Mm-hmm.

1860
01:47:55,466 --> 01:47:58,202
If he's still cruising around
in that Buick, we'll get him.

1861
01:47:58,235 --> 01:47:59,770
Yeah.
Question is when?

1862
01:47:59,803 --> 01:48:01,104
I think I know.

1863
01:48:01,138 --> 01:48:02,773
I think I know where
he might take 'em.

1864
01:48:02,806 --> 01:48:04,775
Okay, her next.

1865
01:48:04,808 --> 01:48:06,443
Lizzie, Lezzie,
Elizabeth.

1866
01:48:06,477 --> 01:48:08,579
Her next!

1867
01:48:08,612 --> 01:48:10,280
Get your fucking
cunt-ass over here!

1868
01:48:10,314 --> 01:48:12,149
I'm not gonna fucking
tell you again!

1869
01:48:12,182 --> 01:48:14,084
You wife, man,
look how fucking
jittery she is!

1870
01:48:14,117 --> 01:48:15,819
I mean, she looks
as if she can run out

1871
01:48:15,853 --> 01:48:18,121
and just, like, fucking
bolt on me any minute.

1872
01:48:18,155 --> 01:48:19,823
I won't run,
I promise.

1873
01:48:19,857 --> 01:48:21,658
You do?
You fucking promise?

1874
01:48:21,692 --> 01:48:22,993
Do you fucking promise?

1875
01:48:23,026 --> 01:48:24,161
Get your fucking ass
over here!

1876
01:48:24,194 --> 01:48:25,963
Whenever you're
fucking ready!

1877
01:48:25,996 --> 01:48:28,632
Why not her? Why me?

1878
01:48:28,665 --> 01:48:29,967
Uh, well, you know,

1879
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,469
I kinda got something
planned for Sally, Lizzie,

1880
01:48:32,503 --> 01:48:34,037
and to be honest with you,

1881
01:48:34,071 --> 01:48:35,305
I don't think you'd like it.

1882
01:48:35,339 --> 01:48:36,940
You should probably
just have a seat, Lizzie.

1883
01:48:36,974 --> 01:48:38,609
I mean, I'm not gonna
hurt you or anything.

1884
01:48:38,642 --> 01:48:40,978
Shut the fuck up!
Oh!

1885
01:48:41,011 --> 01:48:44,948
Kenneth? You're
not gonna get all mousy
on me, are you, cowboy?

1886
01:48:44,983 --> 01:48:46,750
Move on,
you piece of shit.

1887
01:48:46,783 --> 01:48:48,318
[weeping]

1888
01:48:48,352 --> 01:48:49,319
You know what?

1889
01:48:49,353 --> 01:48:50,487
I'll be honest
with you, brother.

1890
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:51,655
I don't really
like you anyway.

1891
01:48:51,688 --> 01:48:53,123
[gunshot]

1892
01:48:53,156 --> 01:48:54,691
Aah!
Aah!

1893
01:48:59,596 --> 01:49:02,165
Oh! Yeah!

1894
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:05,402
Aah!
Aah!

1895
01:49:07,404 --> 01:49:09,172
[humming]

1896
01:49:11,508 --> 01:49:13,210
No!

1897
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:49,413
[Jennifer]
Please!

1898
01:49:49,446 --> 01:49:50,581
No!

1899
01:49:54,151 --> 01:49:55,352
Aah!

1900
01:49:55,385 --> 01:49:58,655
Aah!

1901
01:50:12,603 --> 01:50:13,737
Just like Sharon.

1902
01:50:48,271 --> 01:50:51,109
Uhh!
Aah!

1903
01:50:51,141 --> 01:50:54,277
[women screaming]

1904
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:55,278
Bitch!

1905
01:50:57,081 --> 01:50:59,249
Aah! Uhh!

1906
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,088
You fucked me up,
you know that?

1907
01:51:06,057 --> 01:51:07,025
I mean you really did.

1908
01:51:07,058 --> 01:51:09,559
Fuck!
This fucking hurts!

1909
01:51:09,593 --> 01:51:11,095
Man, do I have
taste in women.

1910
01:51:11,129 --> 01:51:12,763
I just knew
you'd be something.

1911
01:51:12,796 --> 01:51:15,766
From the moment
I saw you, I knew.

1912
01:51:15,799 --> 01:51:17,334
I just knew you'd be
something else.

1913
01:51:17,367 --> 01:51:19,469
Uugghh!

1914
01:51:19,503 --> 01:51:20,604
Just like
Kath over there.

1915
01:51:20,637 --> 01:51:22,639
I ain't seen you
naked yet, though!

1916
01:51:22,673 --> 01:51:24,408
Only one of my girls
I haven't.

1917
01:51:24,441 --> 01:51:26,276
I'm not one of
your girls, Ray.

1918
01:51:26,309 --> 01:51:27,978
You are now,
you fucking cunt!

1919
01:51:28,012 --> 01:51:31,381
Take off
the fucking blouse!

1920
01:51:31,415 --> 01:51:33,216
Come on, you got your
girlfriend's brains
all over it!

1921
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:35,185
Take that fucking shit off!

1922
01:51:37,954 --> 01:51:40,323
You--
What? Huh?

1923
01:51:40,357 --> 01:51:41,491
You don't need
the gun, Ray.

1924
