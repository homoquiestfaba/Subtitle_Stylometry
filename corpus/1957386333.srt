[computer beeping]

4
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,638
The coast is clear, Chief.

5
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,612
Give the agent the go ahead,
Miss James.

6
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,991
Okay, Sam, you heard the Chief.
Mission's a go.

7
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,210
[shuddering]

8
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,955
Coast is still clear,
but the window of opportunity is closing.

9
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,724
We're five by five,
but time is of the essence.

10
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,625
I'm going as fast as I can.

00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,895
[Bondi over radio] <i>We'll be
monitoring you the whole time.</i>

12
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,704
Yes! The crowd cheers as he
totally sticks the landing.

13
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,540
Don't leave me hanging.

14
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:47,979
Miss James, please.
This is a serious mission.

15
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,047
Sorry, Chief.

16
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,149
Nice landing.

17
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,750
You earned a banana
for that one.

18
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:55,086
Mmm. [grunts]

00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:32,190

[Bondi on radio]
<i>According to the blueprints,</i>

21
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:47,939

[groans]

27
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:23,707
If our info's correct,
you should find an accessible data port

28
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,809
<i>at the tower
closest to the door.</i>

29
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:30,048
Tell him it's imperative
we have that data.

30
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:33,817
He knows, Chief,
we've trained for the situation.

31
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:37,155
The future of our democracy
may depend on it.

32

[gulps]

33
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:58,842
Take five
and let me work my magic.

Hm.

[Bondi] <i>We're in business,</i>

36
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,184
<i>sit tight and we'll have you
out of there in no time.</i>

- What on earth are you doing here?

40
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:27,906
- [computer beeping]
- We got it.

41
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,806
Grab that drive
and get out of there.

42
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,442
How did you get in here?

43
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,278
Zip line grappling hooks,
snuck by the guards

44
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,380
- and through the ventilation shaft
- A talking ape?

45
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,948
I prefer chimp.

46
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:43,421
Monkey?

47
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,392
Get him!

48
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,469
We've been breached!

49
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,738
Lock it down, lock it down!

52

Freeze!
[grunts]

53
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,022
Um, a little help.

00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,392
[alarm blaring]

55
00:06:58,263 --> 00:07:00,565
[chuckles] Silly bad guys,

56
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,167
you can't have a lock down
when there's a fire alarm.

57
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,801
Everybody knows that.

[cat calls]

69
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:13,624
So how'd you
get into this line of work?

70
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:15,693
I got recruited, just like you.

71
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,362
No, but, I mean,

72
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:21,165
you-you know, have you always
wanted to work with a monkey?

73
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,001
He's not a monkey,
he's a chimpanzee,

74
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:26,571
a member of
the great ape species.

75
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:28,372
And he hates
being called a monkey.

76
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,575
Oh, my bad.

77
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,009
I hate it, too.

78
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:35,279
Oh, uh, I... of course.

79
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,281
And, I mean, I totally agree
with you, you know?

80
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,317
And-and I do, you know,
it's just I thought

81
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,786
it was kind of funny
because, you know.

82
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,423
No, I don't.
It's funny why?

83
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,428
Sam, buddy, you really got
some moves out there.

84
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,362
[clicks tongue]

85
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:56,200
[bones cracking]

86
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:58,703
I'd like to thank you both

87
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,137
for attending this little

88
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,707
team-building exercise today.

89
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,075
Happy to be on the team, Chief.

90
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,409
Yeah, happy to be here.

91
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,645
Camaraderie is important

92
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,381
for any well-oiled organization

93
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:13,684
as it is maintaining an appropriate
level of physical training.

94
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,767
[applause]

95
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:38,576
He appears to have developed
a bit of a fan club.

96
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:42,280
- Bit unseemly for a secret agent.
- [phone ringing]

97
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,115
We got to go.
Dad's here.

98
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:47,818
Oh, okay. Um, it was nice
hanging out with you.

99
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,353
Outside of work, I mean.

100
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,088
Sure, you bet.

101
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,381
[Mr. James] Did you have fun
with your friends today?

102
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:20,751
They're not friends, Dad,
they're co-workers.

103
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,820
You and Sam are friends
and co-workers, right?

104
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:25,256
- [grunting]
- Yeah, but that's different.

105
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:26,858
Sam and I are family.

106
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:29,460
Hm, family's
important to you, huh?

107
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,228
It's not to you?

108
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,497
Sweetie, about that.

109
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,433
I know you're not very happy
with me these days,

110
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,769
but your mother and I can't
have you doing what you did.

111
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:43,341
I don't know
what you're talking about.

112
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:46,277
Do you remember that time when you were
little and you ate that chocolate cake?

113
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,513
When I asked you
what happened to the cake,

114
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,415
you told me, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

115
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,218
You said it with cake
and frosting all over your face.

116
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,687
Come on,
that wasn't even the same.

117
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,857
Then you admit you did it?

118
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,725
Well, of course I did it.

119
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:02,393
Who else could have done it?

120
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:14,538
But I only did it because I didn't
want you and Mom to get divorced.

121
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:18,409
I understand that, sweetie.

122
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,746
And I'm sure you understand that the
love your mom and I used to share,

123
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,651
it's just not something you can
hack into a computer and fix.

124
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,687
Well, give me
a big enough computer.

125
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,389
[chuckles]

126
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,591
I mean, you can
hack into the system,

127
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:36,827
and you can delete all records
of our impending divorce.

128
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,798
But you can't change how we
feel in our hearts, sweetie.

129
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:46,804
People fall in love
and sometimes they fall out.

130
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:56,714
Yeah, Dad, people fall in love
with each other.

131
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,516
Sometimes,
only one of them falls out.

132
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:00,952
Sweetie.

133
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,555
[sighs]

134
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,696
She's not too happy with me,
is she?

135
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,632
She just needs some time.

136
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,434
Look after our girl, Sam.

137
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:28,646
Okay.

138
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,349
[soft chuckle]
Sam, now don't be rude.

139
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:33,852
That's disgusting.

140
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,486
Eh...

141
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,291
Bondi, young lady,
what did I just say?

142
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,896
- Hm.
- [phone ringing]

143
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,003
Hey, Bondi, you know that I
hate phones at the dinner table.

144
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:56,007
Mom, you know, the office
has to be able to reach me 24/7.

145
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,477
- [sighs]
- Oh, it's not from the office.

146
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,378
It's a text from unknown number.

147
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,015
[inhales]
Somebody's got a crush on you.

148
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,885
[exclaims] What? What?

149
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:09,386
People don't say that word?

150
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,489
- Mom.
- I mean, who is it?

151
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,891
I don't know.

152
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,359
I did say it was
an unknown number, didn't I?

153
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,430
Yes, you did, dear.

154
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:20,932
You know what, though,
since I've already said

155
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,034
that I don't like phones
at the dinner table,

156
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,437
maybe you put the phone down
and finish your dinner.

157
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:08,379
I wanna thank you all
for coming on such short notice.

158
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,447
We are paid to be here, Chief.

159
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:13,384
And it's first thing
Monday morning, Chief.

160
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,654
Quite right.
Where was I? Oh, yes.

161
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:19,423
We learned something troubling
from the intelligence

162
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:21,792
we retrieved
from our last mission.

163
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:23,895
I direct your attention
to the screen.

164
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:28,365
This is the earliest
known photo of Daniel Hawthorne,

165
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,701
and I'm being
quite literal about that.

166
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,904
There's no record
of his existence

167
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,840
before he was arrested
and had this mugshot taken.

168
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:39,376
- What was he arrested for?
- Loitering.

169
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,146
Hanging around with no purpose.

170
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,981
Some guys are just born bad.

171
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:45,816
This is Hawthorne again,

172
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,618
on the occasion
of his second arrest.

173
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:48,854
What for this time?

174
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:52,023
- Loitering with intent.
- Upping his game.

175
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,426
He looks sad.

176
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,429
Of course, he's sad,
he's a bad guy.

177
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,398
Bad guys are sad by definition.

178
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,535
If they weren't sad,
they wouldn't be bad guys.

179
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:08,639
Yeah, I know, but trust me on this
one, Chief, this guy's sad.

180
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:12,443
Be that as it may,
we now have evidence he must be stopped.

181
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:15,881
- So stop him, we will.
- Mm-hm.

182
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:21,819
If you're not vigilant,
milk can sour before you know it.

183
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:26,892
Sure, it smells all right today,
but what about tomorrow?

184
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,826
- You wake up one morning...
- [chuckles]

185
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,728
...pour a tall glass

186
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:34,132
and that's when
it hits you, pow!

187
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:37,035
A mouthful of injustice.

188
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,038
Finish your milk
before the expiration date,

189
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:45,176
before it turns on you.

190
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,445
[chuckles] He's doing his
Patton thing again.

191
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:52,117
What I'm trying to say
is this guy is milk

192
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,186
with an approaching
expiration date.

193
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,925
We have to stop him before
he becomes completely sour.

194
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,501
[both laughing]

195
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:12,836
All over
the milk metaphor, Chief.

196
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,112
This is a photo of him

197
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:25,649
when he adopted the nickname
"Alpha Dog." [scoffs]

198
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:29,988
Intelligence indicates he's
embraced the role of arch villain

199
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,857
and is attempting to build
some sort of new weapon.

200
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,826
New weapon?
What's that even mean?

201
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,663
That we don't know.
Intelligence is patchy at best.

202
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,968
But we know with his unit
in the Council of Crime,

203
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:46,071
he's intending on using
whatever it is

204
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,605
to unleash his evil scheme.

205
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,609
His secret base is located
on this island.

206
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:56,480
He calls it "Wolfhound Island."

207
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,519
Okay, partner,
this is our biggest mission yet,

208
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,122
and our most important.

209
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,790
We can't let Alpha Dog
complete his plan.

210
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:09,894
We've had plenty of training with
the jetpack in simulation mode.

211
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,863
Are you confident
you can do this for real?

212
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:14,065
[clicks tongue]

213
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,135
Like always, I'll be with you
every step of the way,

214
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:19,703
so when you're safely on the
island, just find a place to hide

215
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:23,108
until I'm back at command
and online, okay?

216
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,609
Make sure you
come back to me, Sam.

217
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,678
You mean more to me
than this mission.

218
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:48,900
Bondi, you checked these waters
for sharks, right?

219
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,769
[Bondi on radio]
<i>Yep, 100% shark infestation.</i>

220
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,637
[gulps]

221
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,307
Well, at least they're
down there and I'm up here.

222
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:58,176
[jetpack sputters]

223
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,610
[grunts]

224
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,679
[growling]

225
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:05,250
[whimpering]

226
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,230
[grunting]

227
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,321
[man] Doctor.

228
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,924
Doctor Devious.

229
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,261
Devious!

230
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,031
You trying to scare me to death?

231
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,735
And what do I owe the pleasure
of this visit to my lab?

232
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,738
Make no mistake, Doctor,
this is my lab.

233
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:35,907
- Oh, please.
- And the work...

234
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:42,380
The work you're doing here
is at my discretion.

235
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:45,682
Oh, really,
I totally forgot.

236
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,685
Thanks for reminding me
every time you get a chance.

237
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,990
[sighs] Let's not get caught up
in semantics, Doctor.

238
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,959
Instead, let's inspect
the troops, shall we?

239
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,664
- Yes.
- Excellent.

240
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,369
There's been a few setbacks,
I'm afraid.

241
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,045
[laughing] Yes!

242
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:17,015
Handsome specimens, Doctor.
Yes, yes.

243
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:18,749
[laughing]
[mimics growling]

244
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:21,252
What are their names?

245
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,787
- Names?
- Yes.

246
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,223
They're robots,
they don't have names.

247
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,458
[groans] Yes, surely,
since we created them,

248
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,093
we could give them some names.

249
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:32,931
They're not people,
they're robot dogs.

250
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:36,935
[groans] Yes, but Doctor,
I can't just say, "Dog, attack."

251
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,870
And what if both dogs attack
the same thing

252
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:41,072
and there's multiple things
that need to be attacked.

253
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,041
And then we're not winning
the attack,

254
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:45,210
the next thing you know,
it's total chaos.

255
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:47,512
Oh, attacking, is that part of the plan?
I didn't know that.

256
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,481
Is attacking part of the plan
to take over the world?

257
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:52,016
Is that a serious question,
Doctor?

258
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,484
Yes, from time to time,
we may need to

259
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,853
attack something here and there.

260
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,822
[scoffs] Clearly you're new
to this whole evil thing.

261
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:00,757
[exhales]

262
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,262
Listen, I only took this job,
because you promised me

263
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:07,298
unlimited funding
for development.

264
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:09,800
Yes, yes, whatever,
just show me the dogs.

265
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,302
Bring them to life.

266
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:16,241
Okay. Oh, well, let me
introduce you to them.

267
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:17,875
- I have named them.
- Mm.

268
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:21,412
- This one's named Number One.
- Oh.

269
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,216
And Reginald Cornwell...

270
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,784
No, I think we'll
go with Number Two.

271
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:29,988
You like them?
Named them myself.

272
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,394
Number One... heel.

273
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,930
[whirring]
[beeping]

274
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:39,897
[sighing]

275
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,909
Number Two, heel.

276
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:55,446
Oh! [laughs]
Very nice, Doctor, very nice.

277
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:06,124
Number Two, fetch.

278
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,997
[chuckles]
[clears throat]

279
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:15,967
Okay, back to Number One.
Let's see what you can do.

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,069
- [beeps]
- [whirring]

281
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,081
Doctor, do you think
I want to be a laughing stock?

282
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:32,150
Do you think I wanna take over
the world with laughter?

283
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,519
No!

284
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:37,855
Okay, Number Two,
it's all up to you now.

285
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,361
Number Two.
Number Two!

286
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:47,098
It's safe to say
that we can call them both

287
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:49,367
big stinking piles
of number two.

288
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,170
Good job, though.
[blows raspberry]

289
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:54,005
[door buzzing]

290
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:05,450
Doctor, you assured me this
was well within your skill set,

291
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:08,019
but prototypes
are not exactly inspiring hope.

292
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:10,421
I know, I think...
I think it's a problem with the AI.

293
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,590
What do I care about AI?

294
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,592
I want weapons,
not thinking soldiers.

295
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:18,396
You want me to make
brainless robo-dogs? [scoffs]

296
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,598
What do I want
with a thinking canon ball?

297
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:24,135
I don't know, maybe so it
won't aim for the wrong target!

298
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:25,903
Doctor, as far as I'm concerned,

299
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,672
as long as it's aimed in
the right direction,

300
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:29,507
there are no wrong targets.

301
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:31,642
This guy...

302
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,382
- Hi, there.
- [exclaims]

303
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:39,117
Where'd you come from?

304
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,389
Are you one of my dad's
test subjects or something?

305
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:49,260
Are you spying on Dad
and that creepy doctor guy?

306
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:58,569
Code Red, agent discovered.

307
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,705
I repeat,
agent has been discovered.

308
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:03,007
Calm down, Miss James,

309
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,077
the agent is an expert
at covert operations.

310
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,281
Remember the time he posed as a Hollywood
producer and actually won an Oscar?

311
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:14,552
Yeah, you're right.

312
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:16,220
We still laugh about that.

313
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,461
<i>Obviously, you're not one of
my dad's ridiculous robot dogs,</i>

314
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:28,099
<i>but what's this weird thing
on your head?</i>

315
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,471
Trust me, nobody would blame you

316
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:36,140
for wanting to escape
this creepy place.

317
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:38,276
Only reason I'm down here
is I'm trying to find my dad

318
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,611
to see if he even remembers
it's my birthday today.

319
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:50,688
Oh, that's nice.

320
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:53,391
Thank you.

321
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,397
Happy birthday.
[chuckles]

322
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,098
You talked.

323
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,301
[door opens]

324
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:14,712
Pumpkin, I thought I heard
something out here.

325
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,113
What are you doing down here?

326
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:18,216
Haven't I told you
not to come down here?

327
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:20,451
You know this is
just like you, Dad,

328
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:22,653
to assume
I'm doing something wrong.

329
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,388
It never occurred to you
I might be so bored,

330
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:26,457
I'd want to explore
this stupid island?

331
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,259
Sweetie, I'm not accusing you
of anything.

332
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,660
I just didn't want you to...

333
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:31,429
And anyway,
it's raining outside,

334
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,499
so even if I wanted to go
someplace else, I can't.

335
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:36,267
So where am I supposed to go?

336
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,069
Honey, I don't know
where this is coming from.

337
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:40,271
Can-can we
talk about this later?

338
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,373
Go talk to your robots.

339
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:48,579
[sighs]
Must be difficult

340
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:51,082
balancing the responsibilities
of fatherhood

341
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:54,385
with the obsessive demands
of creating criminal robots.

342
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:00,525
Doctor, it would appear
we're both having

343
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,261
programming problems
with our creations.

344
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:06,764
Although, I fear yours is going to
be much easier to fix than mine.

345
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:10,801
But first,
I have guests to attend to.

346
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:12,703
[laughing]

347
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:30,354
[clattering]

348
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:39,130
- Whoo.
- [chuckles] Hey.

349
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,100
Seriously, what's that thing
on your head?

350
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,671
Are you a secret agent
or something?

351
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,543
Will this allow me
to communicate with aliens?

352
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:57,782
Uh... [sighs]

353
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:03,487
[Bondi sighs]
Disaster averted.

354
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:05,556
I never had a moment's doubt.

355
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,159
Awesome. Still gotta feel
sorry for her,

356
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,527
having no friends like that.

357
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:22,239
[phone buzzing]

358
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,275
Oh, um...

359
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:27,144
I've told my mom
not to text me during work.

360
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:29,647
Miss James.

361
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,416
Beyond issues
of professionalism,

362
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,186
I must ask to see your phone
due to security.

363
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,389
Honestly, you've been
warned about this.

364
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:42,293
Well, now who is this
secret admirer?

365
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,663
For heaven's sake, Miss James,

366
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:49,400
he's announcing right from the
start his identity is a secret.

367
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:53,638
How can you possibly trust somebody
whose identity is a secret?

368
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,782
[rock music playing]

369
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:26,804
[laughing]
What are you doing?

370
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:28,172
[sighs]

371
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:31,175
Forehead.
[chuckles]

372
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:36,948
Queen Evil.
[chuckles]

373
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,452
Chrome Dome.

374
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:47,191
Crimson Ghost, so spooky.

375
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:54,632
Welcome to Wolfhound Island.

376
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:55,733
You know,
perhaps maybe you all

377
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,501
should think of
changing your names

378
00:30:57,535 --> 00:30:59,236
to something a bit more
dog-related,

379
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,440
since I am the Alpha Dog leader
of this Council of Crime.

380
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:04,943
- No.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should add some chamomile

381
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:07,545
to your decaf there, Forehead, old buddy.
Bring it down a notch.

382
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:10,848
Anyway, just the name thing,
just something to think about, ponder over.

383
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:13,350
Why did you summon us
here today?

384
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,653
I had to miss a spa appointment.

385
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:18,422
And I had a book club
I was looking forward to.

386
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,992
Oh! I just started
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> myself.

387
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:23,260
Ooh, that's a good one.

388
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,965
What?!

389
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:31,435
Tell you the truth,
we didn't think you could read. [laughs]

390
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,370
Well, I can read well enough
to know the difference

391
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:36,807
between push and pull
on the conference room door.

392
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,577
It was one time.

393
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,580
All right... [bangs table]
children.

394
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:45,416
I called you
all here today to tell you

395
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:49,320
that we are going to
take over the world.

396
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,057
- [all groaning]
- Oh, that again.

397
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,759
Yes, how many times
will that make it this year?

398
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,863
Quite a lot, actually, uh,
about as many as you have exes.

399
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:02,000
That was supposed to be
between us, Forehead.

400
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,969
[stuttering] What is even
happening right now?

401
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,971
What is this,
some type of therapy group?

402
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:10,407
Listen, this time is different.

403
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:12,409
I have a foolproof plan.

404
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:15,713
But first,
I must attend to something.

405
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:18,516
You're my guests,
make yourselves comfortable.

406
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:19,885
Keep your feet of the furniture,

407
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:22,087
TTFN.

408
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,555
[groans]
They're like a bunch of tweens.

409
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:27,558
[sighs] "He said this,
she said that. I like K-pop."

410
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:28,960
[chuckles] Actually,
I do kind of like K-pop.

411
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,469
This is my room...
supposedly.

412
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:39,837
Really, it's more like
my dad's room

413
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,640
because he's the one
who designed it.

414
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:46,044
I think it's his weird way of
trying to put me in shrink wrap

415
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:47,913
and make me stay
his little girl.

416
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:51,715
See what I mean?

417
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:55,553
He thinks I still
play with stuffed animals.

418
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,422
Sometimes I think he wishes
I was a stuffed animal.

419
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:01,026
Then he could keep me
in a cabinet forever.

420
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:07,464
[chuckles]
You guys could be brothers.

421
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:08,666
Hm. [grunts]

422
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:09,968
I wish I had a brother.

423
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:12,871
Or a sister.

424
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,942
Or that my mom was still around.

425
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:19,677
[knocking on door]

426
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:21,612
[grunting]

427
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:23,747
Pumpkin?

428
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,618
- Dad.
- Well, I thought I heard you

429
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,020
talking to somebody in here.

430
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:32,823
That's a stretch,
there's nobody to talk to.

431
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:36,127
Hey, didn't I tell you
to stay out of the lab?

432
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,063
Honey, I'm sure the doctor's
looking for this.

433
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,866
I-I didn't.

434
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,401
[sighs] You know, I know that
being stuck here on an island

435
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,537
is not ideal,
especially at your age.

436
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,173
I mean, look at your room.

437
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,774
Yeah, I got to admit,
this is one of the better designs I did.

438
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:54,179
Yeah, this room is fantastic.
I mean, look at your bed.

439
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:57,715
I remember when you were little.
Your stuffed animals.

440
00:33:57,748 --> 00:34:00,651
[exclaims] Look at these.

441
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:06,157
[laughs] I remember
all these little guys.

442
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:09,460
Hi, little puppy dog.
[laughs]

443
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:12,063
Oh, there's a little sloth.
Oh, you're so cute.

444
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,497
[laughs]

445
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,469
[growling and barking]

446
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,028
Wait a minute, what is this one?

447
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,564
This monkey
is remarkably lifelike.

448
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:49,034
- I-I...
- What do you want, Dad?

449
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,973
Pumpkin... I owe you an apology.

450
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:58,642
You know, I-I barked at you
in the hallway outside the lab

451
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:01,146
and-and you didn't deserve that,
all right.

452
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:04,082
It's just that, uh,
that dog in me.

453
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:07,919
So what I did is something
we haven't done in a while.

454
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:11,089
I set us up
to have dinner together.

455
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:13,791
- Really?
- Yes, I set the whole thing up.

456
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:19,097
What are we having? Chateaubriand?
Lobster Thermidor?

457
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,764
All right, all right.

458
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:23,567
No, we're having your favorite;

459
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,872
chicken tenders, tater tots,
and pistachio ice cream.

460
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,242
You remembered.

461
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:33,610
Of course,
I remembered, pumpkin.

462
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:36,948
I even got 'em to get that little zesty
honey mustard sauce that you like.

463
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:38,649
Not too zesty.

464
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:42,586
Not too sweet,
just like you pumpkin. [laughs]

465
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:46,157
Does the pistachio ice cream
have real pistachios?

466
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:50,128
Of course, there's real nuts
in the pistachio ice cream.

467
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,064
[both laughing]

468
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:00,071
Kitchen, I need real pistachios
on the ice cream.

469
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:03,807
I repeat, real pistachios
on the ice cream.

470
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:05,176
[girl]
Who are you talking to, Daddy?

471
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,710
No one, sweetie.

472
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:13,118
[man on radio] <i>Alpha Dog,
I can't locate any pistachio nuts?</i>

473
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:16,287
[groans] Well, then I suggest
you relocate yourself

474
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,189
to the local purveyor
of said nuts,

475
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,790
or a lack of pistachio nuts
is going to be

476
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:20,892
the least of your worries.

477
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:23,094
Do you understand me?
[barks]

478
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,263
- Who are you talking to, Daddy?
- Oh, nobody, sweetie.

479
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:27,165
You there, where are you going?
Never mind, I don't care.

480
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:28,867
Take this back to the lab.

481
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:33,670
Oh, no.
Did you hear that, Chief?

482
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,106
We have to go in.

483
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:43,214
No, he didn't activate
his emergency beacon.

484
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,884
We let him do the job
he trained for.

485
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,719
What do we do in the meantime?

486
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:52,823
We wait.
That's all we can do right now.

487
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,132
Nobody.

488
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,368
[chuckles] Nobody.

489
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:05,103
Nobody!

490
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:08,173
Did you hear that?
He called me "nobody."

491
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,141
Hey, don't worry about it.

492
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:12,277
Sometimes it's best
not to stand out.

493
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,081
That's easy for you to say.
I'm the Wolfhound chef!

494
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:19,350
I have to plan the meals,
monitor supplies,

495
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:23,221
buy the groceries, prep, cook the
food, and clean the kitchen.

496
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,223
Sometimes he changes the menu
on a whim.

497
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:28,625
And whose fault is it if I
don't have his demands?

498
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,329
Mine!

499
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,932
First one up in the morning,
the last one to go to bed,

500
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:36,733
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

501
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

502
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:42,173
Don't forget about leap years.
That adds a day.

503
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,312
You are not helping!

504
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,380
- [radio static]
- [Alpha Dog on radio] <i>Hello there.</i>

505
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:52,283
- <i>Alpha Dog.</i>
- Yes, sir.

506
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:55,153
<i>I just wanted to let you know
that you left the intercom on.</i>

507
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,788
Perhaps you can stop whining
about the pistachios.

508
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,290
I can always have
one of the men in the armory

509
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:01,825
stuff you into a cannon
and shoot you across the island.

510
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,395
- No, sir.
- <i>We'll see you soon enough</i>

511
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:06,763
<i>with that wonderful
pistachio ice cream</i>

512
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,333
<i>with the real nuts, of course.</i>

513
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:11,436
<i>And uh, uh, uh,
over and out, Chef.</i>

514
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:13,004
<i>That means hang up.</i>

515
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:16,141
Now what's wrong?
He called you "Chef."

516
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:19,310
Yeah, but he coulda said,
please though.

517
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,346
Dude, he's a super villain.

518
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,448
"Please"
ain't in his vocabulary.

519
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:27,718
Well, someone ought to tell him
politeness goes a long way.

520
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,388
Again, super villain.

521
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,895
[grunting]

522
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,830
[moaning]

523
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:55,380
Hmm.

524
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,019
[beeping]

525
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:05,156
- Alpha Dog told me to give this to you.
- [gasps]

526
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:07,959
Thanks.

527
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:11,262
[scoffs]
Evil genius, schmevil genius.

528
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:13,498
[mumbling]

529
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,799
Stupid. [grunts]

530
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,404
I need to recharge.

531
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:23,274
[breathes deeply]

532
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:25,009
[snoring]

533
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:34,886
Pumpkin, do you have the salt?

534
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,487
- Sorry?
- The salt!

535
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:38,456
Oh, yeah, it's right here.

536
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,191
Butler, salt!

537
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,760
Go! [growls]

538
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,366
Thank you, sweetie.

539
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,869
Dad, do you have the sauce?

540
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:53,004
Uh, what's that, sweetie?

541
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:54,906
- The sauce.
- The sauce?

542
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,841
- Yes.
- Butler, sauce for my daughter!

543
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,843
Hurry up,
my daughter needs sauce.

544
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:04,848
There you go, honey.

545
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:08,386
Sweetie, how are the carrots?

546
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,255
- Oh, they're-they're great.
- Oh, wonderful.

547
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:12,390
Butler, carrots!

548
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,226
Why are you so slow?

549
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,995
[growls]

550
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:19,796
Dad, why do I have to sit
all the way down here?

551
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,233
What's that, sweetie?
You're too far away, I can't hear you.

552
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:25,003
Why do I have to sit
all the way down here?

553
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,939
- Uh, one more time.
- Down here.

554
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,533
[snoring]

555
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,179
- Hey!
- [gasps]

556
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:11,382
What do you think you're doing?

557
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:15,086
It's my turn
to ride the merry-go-round.

558
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,121
And I'm telling grandma.

559
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,525
[snoring]

560
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,303
I knew you could do it.

561
00:41:32,337 --> 00:41:35,907
I think our agent's
back online, Miss James.

562
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,610
Jeez, it's like being
on a Tilt-A-Whirl.

563
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:43,381
[sighs] Okay, partner, I've got
to sign off and head home.

564
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:46,951
Apparently, the adults are talking
and I'm expected to attend.

565
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:51,089
Stay hidden until I get back.

566
00:41:58,463 --> 00:41:59,630
- He'll be all right.
- [chuckles]

567
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,467
I know, I just hate it
when he's out all night.

568
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,035
I worry about him.

569
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:06,637
He'll know what to do.
He's smart like you.

570
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:10,208
Thank you, you're sweet.

571
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,643
It's just I feel like
everything in my life

572
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,479
is changing right now.

573
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:19,450
It's my parents, this job,
nothing is constant but Sam.

574
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:20,985
I can always count on him.

575
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:24,622
- And-and me.
- What about you?

576
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:28,092
You can always count on me.

577
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:30,161
I know we didn't start off
on the right foot,

578
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:34,198
but you can always
count on me, Bondi.

579
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,701
Now just go home and deal with
what you need to there.

580
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,970
I'll stay here
and make sure Sam is good.

581
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,638
Thank you, Johnny.

582
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,922
This is tiresome!

583
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,094
Typical powerplay,
making us wait.

584
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:06,431
What do you expect from someone
who calls himself "Alpha Dog?"

585
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:10,935
[chuckles] Indeed, Queen Evil.

586
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:16,607
Cracking wise, Chrome Dome.

587
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:21,746
I have no pretension
regarding my <i>nom de guerre.</i>

588
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:26,250
I'm not hiding who
or what I am from anyone.

589
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:28,352
Need I point out, my friend,

590
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:31,222
you'd be hard-pressed
to hide from anyone.

591
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:33,491
[laughing]

592
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,026
Oh, of course.

593
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,729
Jokes about my shiny bald head,
how original.

594
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:44,302
I chose to shave
every last hair.

595
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:47,605
[laughs] Oh, yes,
all three strands of hair,

596
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:50,007
- if I remember correctly.
- [laughing]

597
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:53,778
Guys, guys, guys, and ladies, and...
we're better than this.

598
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:56,514
- No, we're not.
- [chuckles]

599
00:43:56,547 --> 00:44:01,052
Although I hate to agree,
she's right.

600
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:03,187
We are super villains,
after all.

601
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:06,757
Vindictiveness is in
our job description.

602
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:12,630
Oh, well, how foolish of me
to think that a group of people

603
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:16,567
that want to take over the world
could possibly work together.

604
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,436
It's like expecting children
to share a toy,

605
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:22,106
except in this case,
the toy in question, me,

606
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:26,010
is running the greatest criminal
conspiracy the world has ever seen.

607
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:28,346
Now...

608
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:33,017
I have an idea.

609
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:39,657
[chair scraping loudly]

610
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:46,364
[exhales]

611
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,465
Why am I always standing?

612
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:50,635
Okay, here's my idea, all right.

613
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:52,537
I mean,
we're all friends here, right?

614
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,739
I mean, roll with it, okay.

615
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:56,541
We're always lashing out
at each other

616
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:58,809
because of our,
your, insecurities.

617
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,646
So what I'm thinking is
perhaps maybe we just...

618
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,784
Let's go around the room and say
something about the other that we like.

619
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:10,788
I'll-I'll start. I'll start.

620
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:15,693
Chrome Dome, why don't you say
something that you like about me?

621
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,733
This is madness.

622
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:27,171
How dare the four of you
slander the name of Villainry,

623
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:32,410
a name we fought
so hard to keep?

624
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:36,213
I will not be a part of this,
so stop it.

625
00:45:37,648 --> 00:45:40,551
All right, so first round,
pretty good so far.

626
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:42,820
Little negative in one area,
we'll work on it.

627
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,189
But, you know,
why don't you guys all,

628
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,192
you know, keep at it for a little
bit, I mean, it'll get a bit better.

629
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:50,728
I-I really believe that
this is going to work for us.

630
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:54,599
I am just going to go somewhere
a little less sad.

631
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:56,801
[chair scraping loudly]

632
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:58,636
[groaning]

633
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:04,542
[Alpha Dog exhales]
Oh, that was exhausting.

634
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:08,546
[beeping]

635
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:28,633
Eureka!

636
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:31,168
[laughs]

637
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:41,512
Remarkable.

638
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:45,783
Oh.

639
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,820
Remarkable.

640
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,193
Hey, Dan... I mean, Alpha Dog...

641
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:01,832
your presence is requested
in the testing chamber.

642
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,170
Immediately.

643
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:20,484
Doctor, I certainly hope
you have some good news.

644
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:24,655
Hmm. Sometimes I find
the best solution to a problem

645
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:28,492
is to think outside the box.

646
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:30,428
Hm.

647
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:32,730
Well, spare me
the suspense, Doctor.

648
00:47:32,763 --> 00:47:34,532
What is it
that has you so excited?

649
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:39,004
Consider; is a trade
for a soldier

650
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:44,575
really that bad
if he was a touch... insane?

651
00:47:46,912 --> 00:47:49,014
Okay, easy, Doctor.

652
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:52,017
But I think... I think I know
what you're getting at.

653
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,785
Rather than fix the problem,
we should...

654
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:59,991
Yes, precisely.
Don't correct it, harness it.

655
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:02,760
- Hm.
- That led me to my latest discovery:

656
00:48:03,995 --> 00:48:05,763
Nanobots.

657
00:48:06,998 --> 00:48:10,434
Nanobots,
to control the dog-bots?

658
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:14,505
Well, think of it
as a high-tech leash.

659
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:16,540
- Watch.
- [beeping]

660
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:18,309
[whirring]

661
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,478
Heel.

662
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,483
It... It just heeled.
Do it again.

663
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:26,851
Oh, and you're gonna love this.

664
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:29,386
Roll over.

665
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:34,025
- What? Stop it. He just rolled over.
- I know.

666
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,726
When you told him to roll over,
he rolled over.

667
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,830
Did you see it?
It was amazing. [laughing]

668
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:43,869
Devious, you mad genius!
Congratulations!

669
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,403
You know, you have truly proven
that every dog

670
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:50,307
does indeed have its day.
[laughing]

671
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:53,344
Would you consider it premature
to tell the sponsors

672
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,513
that we are back on track
for our original deadline?

673
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:56,882
Oh, no, not at all.

674
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:58,449
And now that I've surmised
what the problem was,

675
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,683
I feel like putting it
all into motion

676
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:01,452
shouldn't take any time at all.

677
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,388
Outstanding!
[laughs]

678
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:06,824
This country will rue the day that it
turned its back on Daniel Hawthorne.

679
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:08,692
I mean... [clears throat]
Alpha Dog.

680
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,494
- [barks]
- [sighs]

681
00:49:10,528 --> 00:49:13,430
<i>Why do you have to do that all the time?
You always bark.</i>

682
00:49:13,464 --> 00:49:16,034
- <i>We-we just had this moment and it was all perfect...</i>
- <i>It's my thing.</i>

683
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,003
<i>And then you ended it with barking.</i>
[barks]

684
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:20,838
<i>Alpha Dog, it's a theme.
The outfit goes with it.</i> [barks]

685
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:24,809
Okay, team, it looks like
the game is officially afoot.

686
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:28,646
We all have jobs to do.
I suggest you do them.

687
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,951
Miss James, tell the agent to sit
tight and await further orders.

688
00:49:32,984 --> 00:49:35,519
I shall instruct
the science team

689
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:40,658
to look into how best to defeat these
so-called nanobots straight away.

690
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,900
You there! Yes, you!

691
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,902
Do you know
who let the dogs out?

692
00:49:50,936 --> 00:49:53,138
I did!

693
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:55,639

698

cooking up a solution.

00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:29,773
In the meantime, keep an eye
on that crazy doctor,

700
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:33,711
but more importantly,
be careful, partner.

701
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:39,951

take care of yourself.

702
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:42,620

705
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,565
You, uh...

706
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,167
got a little something
there in your eye.

707
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,804
Your third eye.

708
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,678
I can't see!
[cries]

709
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:17,755
Mr. Alpha Dog, might I interpret
this ill-timed intrusion to mean...

710
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,959
Wait, what is it you have there?

711
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:25,964
Greetings, fellow followers
of felonious fascination.

712
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:28,166
As our crimson compatriot
has noticed,

713
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,935
even though the rest of you
have not...

714
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:33,637
You're getting a dog?

715
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:36,074
We're all getting dogs.

716
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:38,109
The doctor has done it!

717
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,946
Unlike previous models,
his new robo-dogs

718
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:44,082

to follow instruction.

We're off the leash.
No more leashes!

720
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:52,656
So this-this is the reason
we're here on this island.

721
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:59,264
You've obviously overcome
the obvious cognitive failure.

722
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:01,066
But what leads us to believe

723
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:03,935
they're capable
of following further direction?

724
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:08,772
Yes, how do we know they actually run
any smoother than the previous lemons?

725
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:12,077
Yes, yes, yes.
I oversold before, I'll admit it.

726
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:17,115
But these new models surpass
all previous claims by a mile.

727
00:52:18,116 --> 00:52:19,750
Meaning?

728
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:24,555
I mean, they are
fully self-aware and compliant.

729
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:27,158
And waiting for us
to tell them what to do.

730
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:32,596
- We want to see it.
- Yes, show us.

731
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:36,034
- Where are they?
- Let us see what they can do.

732
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:40,905
You will see their full power
unleashed...

Hey, honey, can you get off your
phone at least to go to sleep?

737
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,988
You're still waiting
on a response, aren't you?

738
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:35,260
He said he was a secret admirer,

739
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,594
but then he didn't bother
to respond.

740
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:40,664
Yeah.

741
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:43,134
I mean, I know where
you're coming from there, hon.

742
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:50,141
You know,
when your dad and I first met.

743
00:53:50,175 --> 00:53:52,576
Yeah, well,
where did that end up?

744
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:55,679
He left us.

745
00:53:57,248 --> 00:53:58,249
He left me.

746
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,886
No, honey.

747
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:05,290
Your dad's not completely gone.

748
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,094
And he's still gonna
be in your life.

749
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,362
He's... [sighs]

750
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:17,102
just a guy trying to...
figure out who he is.

751
00:54:19,304 --> 00:54:23,007
Yeah, well, he should
figure out he's my dad.

752
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:54,239
Hi, there.
I wondered where you got off to.

753
00:54:56,074 --> 00:55:00,677
My mom used to bring me out here
to fly kites and collect rocks.

754
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:03,014
She said by doing both,
you could have

755
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:05,716
your head in the clouds
and your feet on the ground.

756
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,754
Yeah, I know.

757
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:12,457
My dad, right?

758
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,225
My mom was so much
smarter than him.

759
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:15,894
Mm-hm.

760
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,931
That's the thing,
my dad never started

761
00:55:19,964 --> 00:55:22,766
this whole stupid thing
until after she died.

762
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,436
It's like her cancer
made him so mad at the world,

763
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,139
he decided to take it over
to punish it.

764
00:55:29,407 --> 00:55:31,876
She's out here, you know?

765
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,678
My mom, I mean, she's...

766
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:41,886
My dad had her cremated and we
spread her ashes in the surf.

767
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,988
That way I can
always visit her out here.

768
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:48,426
I like to think a little of her
is in each one of these rocks.

769
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:55,166
Hey, look at this one.

770
00:56:11,082 --> 00:56:13,151
You know,
we are pretty good at this.

771
00:56:13,184 --> 00:56:15,920
Of course, we're good at this,

772
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:19,090
we're getting paid by the CIA
to do what we'd be doing

773
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:21,059
if we were in our homes
eating frozen pizza.

774
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:23,861
Oh, man, I would be
on my computer, no doubt,

775
00:56:23,895 --> 00:56:26,197
but I definitely wouldn't be
eating that frozen pizza.

776
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:28,967
You crazy?
You don't like pizza?

777
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,437
I was talking about hacking
for good instead of, you know.

778
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,441
Pizza is negligible.
Crust, sauce, toppings.

779
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:38,443
It's what you
do with it that counts.

780
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:40,178
You bring frozen
into the picture,

781
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:41,879
you're talking about
processed food.

782
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:45,416
And that is where
I draw the line.

783
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:49,354
Okay, I got the president
breathing down my back

784
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:51,956
and he's got a golf game
at 11:00,

785
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,260
so he's expecting us
to give him an answer by 10:59.

786
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,462
- You, with the hat.
- Well, sir, before I start,

787
00:56:57,495 --> 00:57:00,965
- can I just say how much I appreciate...
- No time.

788
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:01,899
You, with the phone.

Sorry to interrupt.

790
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:05,470
It appears that
you're more concerned

791
00:57:05,503 --> 00:57:07,804
with your social media presence

792
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:10,341
than you are with helping solve
this problem confronting us.

793
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,311
Sorry about the phone, Chief.
Helps me think.

794
00:57:13,344 --> 00:57:15,213
You wanna take down
Alpha Dog's plan.

795
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:19,150
Ironically, it was that devious
doctor dude that gave us the idea.

796
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:22,086
I mean, it's like we were
just talking about frozen pizza.

797
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,457
There's nothing wrong with pizza as long as
you're talking about the basic ingredients:

798
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:31,262
the crust, the sauce,
the cheese, and the toppings.

799
00:57:31,296 --> 00:57:36,334
But when it's processed and loaded
with salt, that's when things go wrong.

800
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:39,237
So you're saying a Trojan horse?

801
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,072
Well, what you would call
a "Trojan horse,"

802
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:43,308
we would call a "worm,"
but same difference.

803
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:47,145
Well, in this case,
the worm is the salt.

804
00:57:48,146 --> 00:57:51,582
I like it. Make it so.

805
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:55,320
I'll alert the president,
we have a plan in place.

806
00:57:55,353 --> 00:57:58,122
Then I shall have
a spot of lunch.

outside right now.

858
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,477
Is he crazy?

859
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:44,715
I mean, what could he
possibly need right now?

860
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:47,184
Things are... even though,
I'm busier than anybody.

861
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:49,820
I don't know.

862
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:52,790
He never tells me anything.

863
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,527
Hmm. Huh?

864
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:59,463
[groaning]

865
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:05,169
Hey... father-daughter relationships
can be problematic, I...

866
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:08,439
Okay.

867
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:13,277
Why don't I go see
what he wants?

868
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:14,445
Don't touch anything.

869
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:29,627
Okay, I got rid of the doc
and bought you some time,

870
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,330
but don't count on him
being gone long.

871
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:37,735
I guess this is goodbye then.

872
01:02:37,768 --> 01:02:39,637
[Sam grunting]

873
01:02:41,672 --> 01:02:42,773
See you later?

874
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,175
Count on it.

875
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:52,450
Man, that girl needs a friend.

876
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:54,685
[sighs]

877
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,853
[grunting]

878
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:05,529
Okay, locate the server.

879
01:03:19,477 --> 01:03:21,212
Target acquired.

880
01:03:23,247 --> 01:03:26,484
You may be sly, but so am I.

881
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:32,556
Miss James, can we
accomplish the task before us

882
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:36,394
without bad James Bond dialogue
accompanying it?

883
01:03:36,427 --> 01:03:39,563
Oh, come on, Chief,
where's the fun in that?

884
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:43,601
This is a serious business,
but a little levity is good for us.

885
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:46,437
The Trojan horse is in, Chief.

886
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,874
Now we just need time
to unleash the worm.

887
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,948
<i>How am I supposed to get
any work done?</i>

888
01:03:56,982 --> 01:03:58,449
<i>Wild goose chase.</i>

889
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:00,886
[rattling]

890
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:06,223
Houston, we have a problem.

891
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,969
You know, Einstein,

892
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,337
I'm beginning to think
that Alpha Dog

893
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:22,773
can't complete
this plan successfully.

894
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:24,575
[hisses]

895
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:29,647
He wants this place
to be his doghouse.

896
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,782
Nah, brother.

897
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:34,485
I should be running
this operation, me.

898
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:37,956
I wouldn't use robo-dogs.
[scoffs]

899
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:40,892
Too predictable
or unpredictable.

900
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,627
No, I would build an army

901
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:46,965
of the most loyal
and deadly of creatures.

902
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:52,536
So small they could get
in and out unnoticed.

903
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,674
So quiet,
you'd never hear them coming.

904
01:04:56,707 --> 01:05:00,344
And so adorable,
you'd never suspect a thing.

905
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,550
Yes, I create an army of...

906
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:09,787
robo-guinea pigs.

907
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,724
- [Sam laughs]
- I'd be the greatest criminal boss you'd ever seen.

908
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:17,028
[laughs] Can't you just imagine
it, Einstein?

909
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:18,562
Einstein, huh?

910
01:05:19,898 --> 01:05:20,899
What?

911
01:05:24,903 --> 01:05:26,270
What's wrong, buddy?

912
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:28,907
Hmm?

913
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,508
Oh, you.

914
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,911
[spitting]
[yells]

915
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:35,379
[gasps] Hot.

916
01:05:35,412 --> 01:05:38,382
[groans] I think I melted off my
tongue, that's gonna leave a mark.

917
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:39,283
[groans]

918
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:41,418
That's what I oughta create,

919
01:05:41,452 --> 01:05:44,455
is a weapon that could
shoot hot coffee.

920
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:49,560
Everyone would be in terror of
the powerful dark roast Inferno.

921
01:05:51,897 --> 01:05:53,697
We're so close.

922
01:05:53,731 --> 01:05:55,066
Don't let him touch that drive!

923
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,335
[gasps]
[grunts]

924
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,387
[mug shatters]

925
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:19,623
Oh, no, what have I done?

926
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:21,960
[groans] Oh, my favorite mug.

927
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:24,428
[grunts]

928
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:34,371
[sighs] That was close.

929
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:40,411
We're in business, partner.
Let's do this.

930
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,126
[satellite pinging]

931
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:07,939
- [barking]
- [seagulls squawking]

932
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:49,613
Glorious day, isn't it?
[chuckles]

933
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:51,715
I would like to thank all of you
for taking time

934
01:07:51,749 --> 01:07:54,152
out of your busy schedules
to be here today.

935
01:07:54,185 --> 01:07:57,856
I assure you it will prove to be
well worth your while.

936
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:01,059
I have spent considerable time and at
considerable expense, I might add...

937
01:08:01,092 --> 01:08:02,227
[laughs]

938
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,895
...building the perfect weapon.

939
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:06,697
A weapon so insidious
that when I unleash it,

940
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:11,202
all will tremble at the fearsome
bark of Alpha Dog.

941
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:13,071
[barks]

942
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:17,976
The only trembling you're
currently inspiring is of laughter.

943
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:19,476
[laughing]

944
01:08:22,213 --> 01:08:24,983
Ah. [chuckles]
Chrome Dome.

945
01:08:25,016 --> 01:08:27,018
Hm. Anyway... [clears throat]

946
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:28,086
Yes, where was I?

947
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:30,956
Oh, yes,
ours is a modern world.

948
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:34,491
Villainy is as old
as mankind itself.

949
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:36,161
So I started thinking,

950
01:08:36,194 --> 01:08:38,096
"What is a good old weapon

951
01:08:38,129 --> 01:08:41,232
that I can use to combine
with some new technology

952
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:44,601
to create a greater weapon?"

953
01:08:44,635 --> 01:08:46,704
In that spirit,
friends and colleagues,

954
01:08:46,737 --> 01:08:51,775
I give you my robo-dogs.
[laughing]

955
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:53,078
Yes.

956
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:06,024
Look at them,
glorious, magnificent.

957
01:09:06,057 --> 01:09:08,792
[laughing]

958
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:23,274
Man's oldest, best-known weapon
is the famed Trojan horse.

959
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:26,844
Man's best old-known friend
is the loyal dog.

960
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:30,647
My genius
was to combine the two.

961
01:09:31,648 --> 01:09:33,151
[barks]

962
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:37,022
Without further ado,
Devious, hit it.

963
01:09:38,822 --> 01:09:40,191
[beeping]

964
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:42,693
[laughing]

965
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,967
[Bondi]
Kind of ironic, eh, Chief?

966
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,238
This Alpha dork guy
builds robot dog Trojan horses,

967
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:56,041
and we use our own Trojan horse
to shut 'em down.

968
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:59,310
What a tangled web we weave

969
01:09:59,344 --> 01:10:02,579
when first we practice
to deceive.

970
01:10:02,613 --> 01:10:04,115
And don't say dork, Miss James.

971
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:08,719
It is a word used by bullies
and nobody likes a bully.

972
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:11,022
Check it out.
I think we have lift-off.

973
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,594
What? No. No, no.

974
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:24,135
No. Okay, take it easy...

975
01:10:25,336 --> 01:10:26,938
[no dialogue]

976
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:34,913
[gasps]

977
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:43,321
[screeching]

978
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:47,225
I need to meditate.

979
01:10:52,864 --> 01:10:54,099
[yells]

980
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:06,810
[grunting]

981
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:09,247
[grunts] Devious, what...

982
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,982
Why are my robo-dogs
going insane?

983
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:13,717
I thought you said the
behavioral problems were fixed.

984
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,187
[nervous chuckle]
It was. I did.

985
01:11:16,221 --> 01:11:18,323
I don't understand.

986
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:19,324
[grunts]

987
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:23,862
You...

988
01:11:25,762 --> 01:11:27,165
[blows raspberry]

989
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:33,071
Let's us take our leave.

990
01:11:33,104 --> 01:11:37,442
It appears Alpha Dog once again has proven
that his bark is worse than his bite.

991
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:39,743
[scoffs] Right behind you.

992
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:41,946
I made an appointment
at a day spa.

993
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,248
My treat.

994
01:11:52,723 --> 01:11:56,394
Oh, no, no, please don't go,
I have a wonderful dinner planned.

995
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:58,930
- [chuckles]
- If this is any indication

996
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:00,298
of your catering skills,

997
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:02,799
I wouldn't risk
the food poisoning.

998
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:05,836
What's that?
Uh. Oh, oh, this?

999
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,907
Pfft, it's nothing at all.
Just a small, minor setback.

1000
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,910
We'll get the kinks worked out and
get it up and running in no time.

1001
01:12:11,943 --> 01:12:13,144
Better than ever really.
[laughs]

1002
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:15,846
If you honestly believe that,

1003
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,849
than this robotic dog,
as pathetic as it is,

1004
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:21,818
isn't the only one
who's lost his mind.

1005
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:24,956
Oh. [sighs]

1006
01:12:38,069 --> 01:12:40,038
Hm. Hm.

1007
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:49,347
Hey, it's a heart-shaped one.

1008
01:12:52,217 --> 01:12:55,153
I bet my mom left this
especially for you to find, huh?

1009
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:56,221
[Sam grunting]

1010
01:13:00,525 --> 01:13:03,928
I guess those weird people aren't gonna
be friends with my dad anymore, huh?

1011
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,197
[Sam grunting]

1012
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:08,499
I bet that means we'll move off
this stupid island,

1013
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:10,834
and I can finally
have friends of my own.

1014
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:12,803
[Sam grunting]

1015
01:13:14,105 --> 01:13:17,108
Something tells me it also means

1016
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:19,810
you'll have to go back
to wherever you came from.

1017
01:13:25,183 --> 01:13:29,053
I wonder what my mom would say if she
were here to see my dad's latest disaster.

1018
01:13:32,023 --> 01:13:34,058
She always said
he was a dreamer.

1019
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,894
[knocking on door]

1020
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:39,897
[sighs]

1021
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,270
Hold it right there,
you simian savior.

1022
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:49,907
Think I owe you
a bit of gratitude.

1023
01:13:49,941 --> 01:13:53,311
If it wasn't for you
ruining my day today,

1024
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:56,114
I wouldn't have realized
what's truly important.

1025
01:13:58,316 --> 01:14:00,885
I've been so focused
on taking over the world

1026
01:14:00,918 --> 01:14:04,956
that I didn't realize that I had
the whole world

1027
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:06,524
right in front of me
the whole time.

1028
01:14:08,993 --> 01:14:10,128
Thank you.

1029
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:28,212
You know, actually, your mother
called me a "schemer."

1030
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:32,250
Schemer with a head
full of rocks

1031
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:34,886
and a heart full of gold,
to tell the truth.

1032
01:14:36,587 --> 01:14:38,289
She was 100% right.

1033
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:43,194
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

1034
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,566
Can a tired, old arch villain
get a hug from his daughter?

1035
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:32,143
Here we are.

1036
01:15:34,345 --> 01:15:36,247
Go ahead, Sam, I'll catch up.

1037
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:48,059
I just wanna say I'm sorry
for the way I've been acting.

1038
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,995
I've been selfish.

1039
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:57,201
I know it hasn't been easy
on you. I'm sorry.

1040
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:01,639
I just wish things
would have stayed the same.

1041
01:16:01,672 --> 01:16:04,142
Just you, Mom,
and me living together.

1042
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:10,114
Happy. Just like
when I was a little girl.

1043
01:16:11,549 --> 01:16:13,184
We can still be happy.

1044
01:16:13,217 --> 01:16:15,253
That doesn't have to change,
sweetie.

1045
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:20,191
I'm here for you,
no matter what.

1046
01:16:20,224 --> 01:16:23,194
I'm still in the city,
and I'm just a phone call away.

1047
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:25,363
I know.

1048
01:16:27,131 --> 01:16:30,234
I am so proud of you, Bondi.

1049
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:32,737
You're becoming
the strong young lady

1050
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,405
that I knew you would be.

1051
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:37,041
I love you, Dad.

1052
01:16:37,074 --> 01:16:38,911
I love you, too, sweetie.

1053
01:16:49,654 --> 01:16:52,056
- See you next week.
- It's a date.

1054
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:07,705
- [laughing]
- [indistinct chatter]

1055
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:09,373
Johnny, have a sandwich.

1056
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:12,176
- Oh, here.
- Sam made 'em.

1057
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,012
Oh... [chuckles]
sounds, uh, yummy.

1058
01:17:15,046 --> 01:17:17,215
Johnny,
they are messing with you.

1059
01:17:17,248 --> 01:17:19,250
I made the sandwiches.

1060
01:17:19,283 --> 01:17:23,454
Mm, Bondi, you never told me,
who's the secret admirer?

1061
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:29,794
[all laughing]

1062
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:31,596
- Oh, my.
- [Rebecca] Hi, guys.

1063
01:17:31,629 --> 01:17:33,564
Thanks so much
for inviting me.

1064
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:35,266
- [Mom] Here you go.
- Thank you.

1065
01:17:35,299 --> 01:17:36,634
Have a sandwich.

1066
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:39,103
[laughing]

1067
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:48,312
[upbeat music playing]

1068
01:18:16,841 --> 01:18:18,209
[music stops]

1069
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:27,051
What's that, Einstein?

1070
01:18:28,352 --> 01:18:31,556
You have a dream
for world domination.

1071
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:34,492
[laughs] Me, too.

1072
01:18:34,525 --> 01:18:38,396
Great minds do think alike.

1073
01:18:38,429 --> 01:18:42,400
We only need to
burst out of these walls.

1074
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:45,836
No, we tried your idea,
and I didn't fit in the toilet.

1075
01:18:45,871 --> 01:18:47,071
What?

1076
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:56,314
Oh, that's a great idea.
Splendid, yes.

1077
01:18:56,347 --> 01:19:00,685
Once we're escaped,
we'll take over the... the world.

1078
01:19:00,718 --> 01:19:05,423
No, dare I say the universe?

1079
01:19:05,456 --> 01:19:08,426
I dare. Universe.

1080
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:11,262
[laughing]

1081
01:19:11,295 --> 01:19:12,597
Patience, my friend.

1082
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,231
- [woman] Doctor.
- [gasps]

1083
01:19:15,232 --> 01:19:16,734
Do I know you?

1084
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,669
- No.
- [grunts]

1085
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:20,338
I'm here because I have
studied your work

1086
01:19:20,371 --> 01:19:22,306
on nano-bot technology.

1087
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,475
[sighs]

1088
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:28,512
Nano-bot, my one true love

1089
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:31,716
till some monkey
turned them against me.

1090
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:33,284
[chuckles]

1091
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:34,819
Be it what it may.

1092
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:40,324
The company I represent
is most interested

1093
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,393
in getting you out of here

1094
01:19:42,426 --> 01:19:46,497
and investing monies
in your ideas.

1095
01:19:48,265 --> 01:19:52,136
We just need to know
what you would require from us.

1096
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:07,184
C... I... Ape.

1097
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:11,756
[music playing]
