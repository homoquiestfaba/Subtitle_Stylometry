00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,510 
Dear diary ... 

2 
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:11,322 
Now I am sure that my parents 
do not care if I die. 

3 
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,649 
Last night I went to the room 
while watching television. 

4 
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,367 
Fell dead on the floor. 

5 
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,511 
And they did nothing! 

6 
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:27,056 
I think the TV ruins everything, 
up with spontaneity. 

7 
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,364 
When my parents are seeing the 
news of the nine, turn off everything. 

8 
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,979 
Sometimes even sleep! 

9 
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:37,617 
Dear diary ... 

10 
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,490 
Today I spoke with Walt Stilman 
about masturbation. 

11 
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:44,191 
He said I had to be careful 
not to spill sperm in hand. 

12 
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,039 
We put a little in the microscope 
and found some crazy moves! 

13 
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:51,697 
I do not believe that 
make us be deaf. 

14 
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:53,481 
Well, I hope not. 

15 
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,415 
Would be the worst thing in the world 
can not listen to Diana Ross! 

16 
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,271 
She is my favorite singer! 

17 
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,649 
I had already decided to be Diana 
Ross on Halloween! 

18 
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,408 
Diana suffered much prejudice 
in early career. 

19 
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,468 
This is what will happen to me. 

20 
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,290 
Dear diary ... 

21 
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,191 
I became the best friend of 
Pinky Farraday. 

22 
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,027 
You think a guy named 
Pinky would be, well ... 

23 
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,928 
You know ... But it is not! 

24 
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:53,859 
He is the team intermediate 
of baseball! 

25 
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:56,861 
Being his friend is so important 
for me! 

26 
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:00,400 
It is almost like being popular! 

27 
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,450 
I think if someone appeared 
with a gun 

28 
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,225 
and threaten to kill the Pinky 

29 
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,983 
I offered to die in 
dee place. 

30 
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,022 
He really deserves life! 

31 
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,676 
Dear diary ... 

32 
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,547 
Everyone invited to Cathy 
Quinn to go to motel. 

33 
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,357 
But Cathy Quinn invited me! 

34 
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,155 
She said she did not mean anything. 

35 
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,815 
It would be a control experiment only. 

36 
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,950 
But to tell the truth ... 

37 
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000 
I have no problem 
I check in! 

38 
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,742 
Not that that is not attractive. 

39 
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,316 
Because I have other 
concerns. 

40 
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,256 
Dear diary ... 

41 
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,536 
Already decided what I will be. 

42 
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,985 
And I spoke to the Pinky 
I decided. 

43 
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,474 
I said ... 
- Pinky ... 

44 
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,133 
I decided that I will be 
actor of theater. 

45 
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,556 
Cool. 

46 
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,418 
Pinky is so comprehensive! 

47 
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:09,379 
He encourages full 
my decision. 

48 
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,087 
Great! 
Again! 

49 
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,224 
Dear diary ... 

50 
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,157 
Last night was 
completely happy! 

51 
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:59,961 
Pinky took me home 
after the test. 

52 
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,771 
I told the stupid of Wallt 
Stiltman that felt by Pinky. 

53 
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,110 
He said I should be careful 

54 
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,519 
because he had heard of that 
boys were with each other ... 

55 
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:21,445 
It was something gross. 

56 
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,124 
And I could end 
makes me a pervert. 

57 
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,174 
Or worse! 

58 
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:40,280 
I decided to do the treatment sessions 
of shock voluntarily. 

59 
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,478 
I hope that I stop to make 
to have erotic dreams with men. 

60 
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:46,579 
And with Pinky. 

61 
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:52,915 
Dear diary ... 

62 
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,582 
Today Mary and Zapatelli 
Fancine Antoniello 

63 
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,677 
They told me that boys 
were talking about me in the back! 

64 
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,029 
They said I was like 
a girl. 

65 
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,633 
I could kill me by 
of it! 

66 
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:06,300 
Of course I denied it! 

67 
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,864 
Even said I could show 
that was not true! 

68 
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,532 
And when finished, turned their backs ... 

69 
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,412 
And my friends were watching me 

70 
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420 
As if I actually had 
killed me! 

71 
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,138 
So I decided to no longer Diana 
Ross on Halloween! 

72 
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,701 
Dear diary ... 

73 
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:28,201 
Today rehearsed my 
funeral. 

74 
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,169 
It was one of those days! 

75 
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,858 
The worst day of my life! 

76 
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,095 
I called home to Pinky 
last night. 

77 
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:38,493 
His mother answered. 

78 
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:40,867 
She said the Pinky 
could not talk. 

79 
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,439 
I should not try to talk 
with him again. 

80 
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:47,195 
Decided to write for a long Pinky 
letter telling what happened. 

81 
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,621 
I know that he knew nothing. 

82 
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,902 
The next day, I gave the letter 
for Pinky. 

83 
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,905 
s for lunch, he gave me another. 

84 
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,030 
He said I was a fag. 

85 
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,468 
A pervert. 

86 
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,728 
And perhaps I do not deserve 
even alive. 

87 
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:11,476 
Ok, I have ceteza ... 

88 
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,790 
But perhaps it means I 
Pinky and the ... 

89 
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:15,976 
We are not friendly? 

90 
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,275 
For those interested to ... 

91 
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,471 
Now I am prisoner of my 
own life! 

92 
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,076 
My mother found my diary. 
And read. 

93 
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,642 
My father also read. 

94 
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,142 
I am now without a future. 

95 
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:11,810 
A concern to most! 

96 
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,179 
Pray for me! 

97 
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:17,316 
Bye! 

98 
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,994 
Father Jon came in 
visit today. 

99 
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,107 
He took me for ice cream. 

100 
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,203 
Should have known! 

101 
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,133 
I mean, we are not religious! 

102 
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,826 
But only after I asked for 
my Sunday, 

103 
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,049 
Sitting in the front seat of the car 
him as a goofy, 

104 
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:40,679 
it was realized that everything had 
been combined with my parents! 

105 
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,063 
The penis begins to grow ... 

106 
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:45,924 
Getting tough. 

107 
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,941 
And then the man falls 
the vagina of women, 

108 
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,314 
that is already naturally lubricated. 

109 
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,416 
I swear it was something repulsive! 

110 
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,474 
And when I thought it was 
the most disgusting possible, 

111 
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:05,260 
I would never think that making sex 
the rest of my life horrible, 

112 
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:08,400 
Trevor ... 

113 
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,401 
You had hope ... 

114 
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,681 
I am talking about sexual desire ... 

115 
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:17,878 
the other kid? 

116 
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:21,843 
Be honest with me. 

117 
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,135 
Can you help me if honest. 

118 
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:26,551 
Already, for example ... 

119 
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,591 
another boy wanted to play as ... 

120 
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,906 
I am not wanting to suggest anything ... 
But, as .... 

121 
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:36,762 
Pinky Farraday? 

122 
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,843 
I decided to start a new life. 

123 
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,029 
I will change. 

124 
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,990 
First, I painted my hair 
and eyebrows. 

125 
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,532 
After ... change of name. 

126 
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,630 
My identity. 

127 
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,015 
After ... change of school. 

128 
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,333 
E. .. Maybe go to Mexico, 

129 
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,755 
And from today, for sure 
change of religion! 

130 
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,585 
Trevor. 

131 
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:09,749 
Dear diary ... 

132 
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:14,860 
Today in English the teacher 
asked me to read my writing. 

133 
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:16,842 
The topic I had 
chosen 

134 
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,636 
was the loss of innocence, 
as represented in literature. 

135 
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:27,763 
The loss of innocence is 

136 
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,799 
for an experience 
without explanation. 

137 
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,208 
The character needs 
experiencing the loss. 

138 
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:37,071 
Must be involved 
in their experiments. 

139 
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,991 
Need to react with 
spontaneity. 

140 
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,689 
To be injured. 

141 
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,075 
Need to survive ... 

142 
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,744 
The experience must be important 
enough to be remembered. 

143 
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:52,811 
Must cause a change 
in character ... 

144 
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:56,900 
The teacher gave me ten 
by writing. 

145 
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,875 
Nobody knows who copied 
everything from a book. 

146 
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,825 
Pinky still ignores me ... 

147 
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:04,211 
I must be invisible ... 

148 
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:09,121 
Dear diary ... 

149 
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:14,752 
Sometimes I imagine that I live 
somewhere exotic in the tropics. 

150 
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:16,701 
Sometimes ... 

151 
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,562 
I imagine that I will be famous ... 

152 
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,647 
and that everyone will want to take 
photos by my side. 

153 
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,290 
Sometimes I imagine that ... 

154 
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,120 
I will die soon. 

155 
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620 
And everyone will regret. 

156 
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,235 
Everyone at school is 
saying that I am gay. 

157 
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,527 
You should be giving the man! 

158 
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:45,026 
But when I look not 
I see nothing different! 

159 
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:47,649 
I do not understand! 

160 
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,875 
My life is now a 
obvious tragedy! 

161 
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,631 
Dear Mom and Dad ... 

162 
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,171 
I do not want to think not 
I thought about it much ... 

163 
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:00,973 
I thought ... 

164 
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,904 
I tried to kill me, but not 
said ... 

165 
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,078 
Do not think that the fault is yours. 

166 
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:07,719 
Happens ... 

167 
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:14,056 
Please give my collection of Diana 
Kristin Ross to Manistera ... 

168 
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,933 
like that of Diana as much as me. 

169 
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,785 
And, please ... 

170 
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,318 
If you can ... 

171 
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,553 
Tap Endless Love 
at my funeral. 

172 
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,774 
It is my favorite song! 

173 
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,036 
And do not cry much. 

174 
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:31,099 
It would be much worse if I 
still alive. 

175 
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:33,264 
His beloved son. 

176 
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:34,932 
Trevor. 

177 
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:12,041 
The hospital told me that ... 

178 
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:15,943 
Nobody is taking kills many 
aspirin. 

179 
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,525 
But I guarantee that ... 

180 
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:21,181 
I would not have a headache 
by at least a year! 

181 
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,013 
I think they were kidding. 

182 
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,444 
Well, I found that nurses 
in the hospital .. 

183 
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,548 
His name is Jack. 
He is super cool! 

184 
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,844 
Actually, Jack is just a volunteer. 

185 
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,472 
But it is as a nurse. 
Well younger! 

186 
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,349 
Jack told me that when the 
people try to kill ... 

187 
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:39,881 
They have to go back and live 
all over again! 

188 
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:44,656 
And the idea of having to live with my 
parents in a life outa me depressed. 

189 
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:49,529 
Jack said I would not have to go back 
in the same family ... 

190 
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,154 
And I said, with the luck I have, 
back! 

191 
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:59,259 
Jack told me that from now on 
I should live my life day to day. 

192 
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:04,965 
Thus, in the blink of an eye, 
come tomorrow. 

193 
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,430 
Honey ... 

194 
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,831 
- I want to go now? 
- In a minute, Mom. 

195 
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:20,032 
And when Jack thought that I invite 
for some heavy festivals 

196 
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,044 
to suicidal gay teens ... 

197 
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:25,527 
He showed me two tickets 
for a concert of Diana Ross! 

198 
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:26,633 
Cool! 

199 
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:32,529 
Okay, I do not know if out of tickets, 
or because of Jack. 

200 
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,681 
But decided to live! 

201 
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:37,200 
At least until tomorrow.
