1
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,349
Shit!

2
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,452
<i>- Late again.
- Story of my life.</i>

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,889
<i>My first job interview in ages.</i>

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,657
Oh, shit!

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,459
<i>And with Mike Reddy, no less,
hottest media mogul in the biz.</i>

6
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,895
Shit.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,696
<i>I need to pull it together.</i>

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,464
<i>I'm pulling it together.</i>

9
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:31,465
<i>I got this.</i>

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,599
Oh, thanks.

11
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:37,204
Look out, world,
today is my day.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,477
Oh, oh. Oh.

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,479
Shit. Damn it.

14
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,613
I got it.

15
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,149
Oh, my goodness,
that is very kind of you.

16
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,718
Of course.

17
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,028
What kind of person would I be
if I didn't?

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,453
Oh, thank you.

19
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,326
Did you hear Mike pulled a Karen
on Karen?

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,194
He went off on her.

21
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:05,767
Oh, this place used to be
so much fun.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,169
Uh, Mike Reddy wouldn't know fun
if it kneed him in the balls.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,273
Well, I got my feelers out
and when I land something,

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,976
- I'm gonna bounce.
- Okay.

25
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,248
I know I'm two minutes late.

26
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,817
There was a lot
of elevator traffic,

27
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,151
which I could have avoided,

28
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,053
but then there
was this old lady...

29
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,588
Sorry, elderly lady.

30
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:29,089
Anyways, it was
a real ethical Sophie's choice.

31
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,825
Zucky, I... I have to go,

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,961
but you know,
this is why no one likes you.

33
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,764
He's so meta.

34
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,366
All right, your uncle
speaks very highly of you.

35
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,268
I looked through your résumé.

36
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,705
Top of your class at BU.
Very nice.

37
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,206
I also went to college
in Boston.

38
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,142
Emerson.

39
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,511
Very funny.

40
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,580
Two years out of school
and still no job.

41
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,849
- Your parents must be...
- Dead.

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,484
- Oh, I...
- No, I'm kidding.

43
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,021
Well, no, I'm not,
they are dead.

44
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,589
Um, I don't know
why I said that.

45
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,658
What I meant to say is
if they were alive,

46
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,894
they would probably blame
this post-pandemy economy.

47
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,097
Am I right?

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,698
Fair point.

49
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:13,768
So tell me what um, excites you
about Heywood Media?

50
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,302
So many things.

51
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,405
A media company whose CEO
is also the founder

52
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,241
with over 200 employees
in offices across the country.

53
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,176
Or should I say "globe"?

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,630
Congrats
on the new London office.

55
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,313
Looks like you did
your homework,

56
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,248
but anyone can Google.

57
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,217
What do you really know
about my company?

58
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:36,490
Well, um,
I didn't wanna go here,

59
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:40,260
but since you asked,
word on the street is

60
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,864
company morale is low.

61
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,866
Our employees
are some of the highest paid

62
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,333
in this industry.

63
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,745
Studies show that money
doesn't replace fun.

64
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,336
People wanna feel appreciated.

65
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,948
Are you telling me how
to run a company

66
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,716
- that I started from scratch?
- Of course not.

67
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,441
I... I'm just
keeping it fortune 100.

68
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,111
And I know not everyone
can be Sara Blakely

69
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,856
taking her team to Hawaii
on a private jet.

70
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,748
- She... she does that?
- Yes.

71
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:03,316
But little things, like bowling

72
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,421
or softball or a company picnic,
they go a long way.

73
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,323
In over 20 years,
I've never had someone

74
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,794
come in for an interview
and talk to me like this.

75
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,962
I'm sorry.
I was just speaking my mind.

76
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,564
And you might be right.

77
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,398
I admit I have become
a little bit of a...

78
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,434
- Tight ass?
- Don't push it.

79
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,971
But you do make a valid point
and I do respect honesty,

80
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:26,373
so what the hell?

81
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,912
Let's do this.

82
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,148
Um, so embarrassing.

83
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,684
Let me just uh...
I'm so sorry.

84
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Holy shit!

85
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,557
My TikTok is blowing up!

86
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,192
Oh! Well, congratulations.

87
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,569
You know,
we are a media company.

88
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,294
Let me take a look.

89
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,831
<i>So boycott Vikki's,</i>

90
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,866
<i>because you vote
with your dollar.</i>

91
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,501
<i>Plus, I heard
they found the prototype</i>

92
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>for these bras
on Epstein's island.</i>

93
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,368
<i>Ew.</i>

94
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,556
I read that in the comments.

95
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:03,376
Our company made this ad.

96
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,981
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

97
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,957
I spoke with Mike.

98
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,326
Ah, now I get it.

99
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,628
I really tried!

100
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,402
You know,
not every single thought belongs

101
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,496
on the internet.

102
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,967
Can I get
a tequila on the rocks?

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,503
- Extra limes. Make it a double.
- She'll have an iced tea.

104
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,938
Tío, this is a time for alcohol.

105
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>Oh, si, como no?</i>

106
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,408
Poor millennial
blowing yet another interview

107
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,745
your rich Tío set up for you.

108
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,181
Will some avocado toast
make you feel better?

109
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,382
First of all, I'm Gen Z,

110
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,119
and secondly,
it wasn't my fault.

111
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,693
Uh, maybe I'm just not cut out
for a traditional 9:00 to 5:00.

112
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,792
Ariana, you're educated,
smart, charming,

113
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,161
so why do you keep getting
in your own way?

114
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,129
Do you remember
what your parents always said?

115
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:56,697
No empiences.

116
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,700
Show me your friends
and I'll show you who you are.

117
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,269
But I don't have any friends.

118
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,770
That's the problem.

119
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,505
I'm doing a lot of traveling,

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,508
so I spoke to the head
of Gilmore Country Club

121
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,912
and I'm gifting you
a seasonal membership.

122
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,181
Tío, you might enjoy
showing off your timepiece

123
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,050
with those nepo baby boomers,
but I could never.

124
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:19,220
I planned a party at the club
for your birthday

125
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,988
and I fully expect you
to fill it

126
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,256
with all your new friends.

127
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,490
Yeah, I'd love to,

128
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,391
but I have a root canal
that day.

129
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,660
Look, I'm serious.

130
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,562
IQ isn't enough,
you need to have EQ.

131
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:28,806
And your stuffy country club

132
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,131
is gonna give me
emotional depth?

133
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,331
It's worth a try.

134
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,568
If you prove that you've matured

135
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,004
and surrounded yourself
with high-quality friends,

136
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,106
I'll get you another interview
at Heywood.

137
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,676
Besides I think
it would do you good

138
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,377
to get back
to some family traditions.

139
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,714
And if you don't, well...

140
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,883
I'll have no choice,
but to cut you off.

141
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,251
You can't do that!

142
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,953
All because
I don't wanna assimilate?

143
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:55,056
Gilmore is full of lawyers,
doctors, business owners.

144
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,993
I want you to surround yourself
with that caliber of friends.

145
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,963
<i>- Ensenyame tus amigos...</i>
- And you'll show me who I am.

146
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,831
You already said that.

147
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,776
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
use my dead parents

148
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,568
as emotional manipulation.

149
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:11,505
Ariana... that accident
wasn't your responsibility.

150
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,442
What you do
with the rest of your life is.

151
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,947
You know what you have to do.

152
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,681
Go drown my sorrows
in Postmates tequila,

153
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,917
and self-loathing?

154
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,419
Mr. Peters will be expecting you
at noon tomorrow.

155
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,856
Don't be late.

156
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,124
I'll consider it,

157
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,260
but you're not
my favorite tío right now.

158
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,392
Oh.

159
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,730
I'm your only tío.

160
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,574
Oh, this day
couldn't get any worse!

161
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,441
[birds chirping in background

162
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,211
Ariana?

163
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,649
- Oh, fuck me.
- Oh, my God, girl!

164
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,742
I haven't seen you
since you dropped out of kappa!

165
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,552
Yeah.

166
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,721
- Ooh, you're...
- Pregnant!

167
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,590
On purpose?

168
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,058
You always were the funny one.

169
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,459
Of course, on purpose.

170
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,663
Harry and I.
You remember Harry?

171
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,931
Hung-like-a-horse Harry?

172
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,933
They called him that?

173
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,703
Anyway, we did Europe
after graduation

174
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,006
- and he proposed in Paris.
- Wow.

175
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,776
Yeah, planning a wedding,
while I was at Yale Business,

176
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,880
was no easy feat,
but it all worked out.

177
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,249
Whoa! Elon Musk could see
that thing from space!

178
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,484
Oh, you think?
I could ask him.

179
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,056
Congratulations on everything.

180
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,325
But I just gave you
my one-woman show.

181
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,626
What about you?

182
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,803
Are you just killin'
the PR world?

183
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,529
Uh, yeah, pretty much.

184
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,564
I just had an interview
at Heywood Media.

185
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,133
Congrats. When do you hear back?

186
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,467
Any day now.

187
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,112
But you know,
I pretty much crushed it.

188
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,538
Yes, you did.

189
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,773
And any boyfriends
or girlfriends?

190
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,710
I'm still looking
for the right guy,

191
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,279
but you know, can't hurt
to have fun in the meantime.

192
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,914
Aw!

193
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,482
And I went viral this morning.

194
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,852
- No big deal.
- That's nice.

195
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,357
I also just joined this
really exclusive country club.

196
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,759
It was super hard to get into,
but I pulled some strings.

197
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,195
Oh, my God, which one?

198
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,730
Gilmore Country Club.

199
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,265
Get out. That's my club!

200
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,401
Whoa! What are the chances?

201
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,937
Oh, you'll love it!
It's a great place to network.

202
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,739
I mean it has to be, right,

203
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,508
to make up for
that 100-grand initiation fee.

204
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,110
Oh, you could stop
climate change

205
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,779
- with that kinda cash.
- Well, listen, I have to run.

206
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,715
So uh, let's meet up at Gilmore.
I'll introduce you to the girls.

207
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,984
You'll have margs,
I'll have tea.

208
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,419
It'll be great.

209
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:41,122
Yeah, great.

210
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,566
Oh,
even your hair smells perfect.

211
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,091
Okay, bye.

212
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,626
Can't wait!

213
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:58,406
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

214
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,742
Oh, hi, over here.

215
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:04,912
Romeo.

216
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,049
Men are so fickle.

217
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,894
<i>I know I've only known Damien</i>
for 10 minutes,

218
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,554
<i>but we're for sure soul mates.</i>

219
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,890
<i>Hell yeah. Soul mates!</i>

220
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,259
Pfft! I call bullshit.
Right, Romeo?

221
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,896
<i>I just wanted to show Damien
my best side, right?</i>

222
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,232
<i>So I'm not telling him
about the three kids I have.</i>

223
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,356
Romeo, you're my friend, right?

224
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,168
Shit.

225
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,060
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Employee parking's around back.

226
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,185
I'm actually a member.
My tío is George Alvarez.

227
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,690
Ms. Alvarez, I'm so sorry.
Mr. Peters is expecting you.

228
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:23,858
It's Ariana.

229
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,127
Oh, let me park the car for you.

230
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,762
- It's okay. I'll do it myself.
- Of course, yeah!

231
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,575
Uh, just right over there
in between that uh,

232
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,333
the Porsche and the Cadillac.

233
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,934
Mm hmm.

234
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,705
Phew!

235
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,999
Oh, I said dressing on the side.

236
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,233
I'm sorry, Mrs. Harrison.

237
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,868
I will have the kitchen
fix that.

238
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,514
Oh, Skyler, mine is on the side.
We can switch.

239
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,872
Don't be ridiculous,
she can bring me a new one.

240
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,408
And no croutons. Thank you.

241
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,543
Mm hmm.

242
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:22,759
Since when does staff
get to walk

243
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,984
through the main building?

244
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm calling Mr. Peters.

245
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,657
No, that's Ariana!
We went to college together.

246
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,157
She's a member.

247
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,860
Honey, members know
how to dress at Gilmore.

248
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,828
She's new. And she's very funny.

249
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,264
- Just give her a chance.
- Well, I wanna meet her.

250
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,879
Ugh, golf.

251
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,250
Eh, Ms. Alvarez!
Thanks for comin' in.

252
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,383
I'm Richard Peters,

253
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,386
the General Manager here
at Gilmore.

254
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:02,856
Your uncle has spoken
very highly of you.

255
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,858
Well, either you're lying
or he is.

256
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,269
But either way, I appreciate it.

257
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,429
He also said you were blunt

258
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,798
and that you'd need help
with the dress code.

259
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,002
So, let's go to the pro shop,
and pick out some proper attire,

260
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,671
and then I can show you around.

261
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,173
Yeah, I actually worked
really hard on this outfit.

262
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,784
I know it looks
like I just threw it together,

263
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,176
but that's like
kind of the point.

264
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,712
Well, your uncle also mentioned

265
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,946
that you
have oppositional behavior.

266
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,782
- Okay, now, who's the blunt one?
- Shall we?

267
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,325
Jason,
this is Mr. Alvarez's niece.

268
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,462
We need to get her
into proper golf attire.

269
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,245
- Jason.
- Oh, hi. I mean...

270
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,347
Why don't you pick out
a few things

271
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:01,982
and head out to the patio
for a drink,

272
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,551
and I'll meet you there?

273
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,623
Wow! He seems fun.

274
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:11,125
He's strict, but great.

275
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,069
You don't have to stare.
I'm not gonna steal anything.

276
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,072
- No, Ms. Alvarez, I wasn't...
- And it's Ariana.

277
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,441
Uh, last names only.
It's club policy.

278
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:30,244
Oh, gosh, what is this place?
Some kind of cult?

279
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,888
'Cause that might make it
more appealing.

280
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,749
Woah! $90 for a skort!

281
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,083
Are you kidding me?

282
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,519
They're really comfortable.

283
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,587
Uh, I mean that's what
all the ladies say.

284
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,589
For 90 bucks,
it better make me squirt

285
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,723
and do my taxes.

286
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,526
Uh, I can check with my manager.

287
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:48,530
I mean it is pretty cute.
And I'm a sucker for pockets.

288
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,264
Almost makes me
wanna hit some balls.

289
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,399
- Have you ever played?
- Yes.

290
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:55,402
Mini golf
with a bad online date.

291
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:56,538
If you're interested,

292
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,640
I could set you up
with some lessons.

293
00:13:58,773 --> 00:13:59,973
I appreciate the hustle,

294
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,842
but I'm just here
for the day-drinking

295
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,477
and the patriarchal dress code.

296
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,611
Fair enough.

297
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,315
Charge it to my tío's account.

298
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:10,918
Wow!

299
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,390
Okay, ladies, I win again.
That's 200 from both of you.

300
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,528
Ariana! You made it.
Good to see you.

301
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,831
Come meet everyone.
This is Skyler.

302
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,065
Harrison. Also club champion.

303
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,079
Five years running,
but it's not that important.

304
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,303
Of course not
or you wouldn't mention it.

305
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,839
Well, the champion does get

306
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,048
their yearly membership
dues waived.

307
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,675
So, it keeps the hubby happy.

308
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,210
Skyler, you're so bad.

309
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,547
And this is Jenny.
Recently married.

310
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:40,749
The wedding was stunning.

311
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,950
Hey, I've seen you before.

312
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,019
Wait, you're on Lusty Lagoon!
You're a Dallas cheerleader!

313
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,591
That's me! Or was me.

314
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,493
I'm retired now.
Also, keeps the hubby happy.

315
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:54,128
What about you, Air-Anna?

316
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,430
- It's Ariana.
- Same, same.

317
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,666
Becky has really
sung your praises.

318
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,900
Becky?

319
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,033
So what are you?

320
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,671
Married? Divorced? Children?

321
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:04,905
I'd like to say

322
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,282
I'm a connoisseur
of dating apps.

323
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,643
So, single. How surprising.

324
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,043
I'm not worried.

325
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,780
Marriage is basically
legal prostitution

326
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,232
that's been romanticized into
this billion-dollar industry.

327
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,987
- But congrats, Jenny!
- Aw, thank you so much!

328
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,322
But tell me,
how much locker-room action

329
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,792
do you cheerleaders really get?

330
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,760
- Ariana.
- Oh, come on!

331
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:28,262
53 big, chiseled men.
How many can you count?

332
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,532
Jenny, no,
you don't have to answer that.

333
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,667
Ariana, that...
That's not appropriate.

334
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,436
Jenny's married
to a highly-respected attorney.

335
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,704
Twenty-two.

336
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,506
Yeah, threesomes, foursomes.

337
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,518
And don't even get me started
with Super Bowl Sunday.

338
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,209
- Jenny!
- It was wild.

339
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,521
Jenny, what has gotten into you?

340
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,545
Come on, Becca!

341
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,955
Like you don't let Harry
in the back door

342
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,314
once in a while!

343
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,783
Oh, only on special occasions.

344
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,250
Ladies, that's enough!

345
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,523
Good afternoon, ladies.

346
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:58,125
Ms. Alvarez, are you ready
for the grand tour?

347
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,258
I can't wait.

348
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,765
- Lovely to meet you all.
- You, too.

349
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:04,898
Bye.

350
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,869
Well, that got way
off the rails.

351
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,403
I don't know what came over me!

352
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,577
Sounds like a lot of people
from what you just said.

353
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,106
Please, stop!

354
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,142
This is exactly the kind
of vile behavior

355
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,645
someone like Ariana brings out
in all of us.

356
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:21,266
Your friend may clean up nicely,
but she's not Gilmore material.

357
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,483
She's not my friend.

358
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,820
We just knew each other
from college.

359
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:27,087
I understand.

360
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,824
You.

361
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,826
Come here. What's her deal?

362
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,495
- How'd she get in here?
- Mr. Alvarez's niece?

363
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,731
He's sponsoring her
for a seasonal membership.

364
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,999
I see. So, she's not a member.

365
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,300
She's a member's guest.

366
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:41,836
What difference does it make?

367
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,071
All the difference in the world.

368
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,173
She won't last a week.

369
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,775
Cheers, ladies.

370
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,747
I get it.

371
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,525
I don't know what came over me
and then you were like

372
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,250
Jenny, enough.

373
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,623
Thanks for saving me.

374
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,691
Did they welcome you
with open arms?

375
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:04,825
Not exactly.

376
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,997
Yeah, I didn't think so.
But they'll warm up to you.

377
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,298
Or they won't. It's a tossup.

378
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,734
So where's Mr. Peters?

379
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,667
Did you knock him off
for the insurance money?

380
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,604
Uh, I was about to,

381
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,773
but then he got pulled
into a meeting.

382
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,775
Oh, love a plot twist.

383
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:24,779
So, now, it's my job
to give you the grand tour.

384
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:29,017
I was given orders to explain
some very important rules.

385
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,318
Okay. This is a cult.

386
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,387
Could be.

387
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,623
Um, but listen,
the trick is knowin'

388
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,225
which rules matter
and which ones don't.

389
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,429
Alright, so, rule number 1.

390
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,097
The dress code is everything.

391
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:49,436
And no public intoxication,
no gambling, and no cursing.

392
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,883
Fuck! You little cock-sucker,
you cheated!

393
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,685
Take a chill pill, Dad.

394
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,321
I'm sorry, son,
but you can take that chill pill

395
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,189
and shove it up
your little 8-year-old ass,

396
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,758
okay?

397
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,738
I guess
that rule doesn't matter.

398
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,462
Yeah, we try to keep that
to a minimum.

399
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:18,265
But you catch on quick, Alvarez.

400
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,267
A loophole
to the last-name policy.

401
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,435
I'm impressed.

402
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,505
Okay, what's next?

403
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,042
Yeah, um, sorry about all that.

404
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,913
Um, but we do
have one of the top courses

405
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,213
in the world,

406
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,717
which is, of course,
wasted on you.

407
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,554
Unfortunately, yes.
I hate the sport. Do you play?

408
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,990
Presently, no.
It's not really for me.

409
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,092
But I am one hell of a caddie.

410
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,341
So, uh,
this is our men's lounge,

411
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,145
and per rule number 5,
no women are allowed in.

412
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,082
It's a deeply problematic
tradition.

413
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,085
Yeah, it's almost like
our forefathers hated women.

414
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,192
And this is the main
dining room.

415
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,529
Wow! Fuck me!

416
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,866
Uh, excuse me?

417
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:32,439
And that is the perfect segue
to our last rule.

418
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,709
No fraternizing with the staff.

419
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:35,977
Fraternizing?

420
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,812
No hookin' up, dating

421
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:40,048
or falling madly and deeply
in love.

422
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Hmm.

423
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,450
You know, fraternizing.

424
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:48,455
Ms. Alvarez, my apologies,

425
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,958
but I'm sure Jason
has properly introduced you

426
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:54,227
- to Gilmore.
- Yes, he was very informative.

427
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,897
It was my pleasure.

428
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,300
Well, just in case, here
is everything you need to know.

429
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,569
Please read it, thoroughly.

430
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,303
- It'll help you...
- Assimilate?

431
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,873
- Fit in.
- Hmm.

432
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,976
Your uncle is family here.
So that makes you family, too.

433
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,080
Just respect the rules
and we'll all have a great time.

434
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,115
Oh, I will be on
my best behavior.

435
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,348
Good.

436
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,051
Jesus Christ, Peters!

437
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,921
No wonder we can't attract
any fresh blood around here,

438
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,222
you're scaring off the youth.

439
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,358
Ms. Alvarez,
this is Ms. Archebold.

440
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,494
The name is Stella, my dear.

441
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,463
- Ariana.
- Very nice to meet you.

442
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:31,199
Welcome to Gilmore.

443
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,900
Come to the luncheon
this afternoon.

444
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,569
You can sit at my table.

445
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,847
I will let you get me drunk
and then I will start gossiping.

446
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,773
That's a tempting offer,

447
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,374
but I gotta catch up
on some light reading.

448
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,343
- Yes.
- It's all you can eat lobster.

449
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,477
Oh, I'll be there.

450
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,147
I look forward to it.

451
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,688
Looks like Ariana's
really getting

452
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,255
her uncle's money's worth.

453
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,493
- I feel a little under-dressed.
- You look fine.

454
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,197
So, I've heard a lot about you.

455
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,767
Yes, I'm a liberal,
no, I did not get a boob job,

456
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,136
and yes,
I binge-watch cat videos.

457
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,640
A little personality
will do this club some good.

458
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,154
Too many cardboard cutouts
around here

459
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,978
if you ask me,
which you did not,

460
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,046
but I'm never one
to withhold an opinion.

461
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,380
Mm, respect.

462
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:23,084
- My apologies.
- Oh!

463
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,620
I believe this belongs
to you, Ms. Archebold.

464
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,488
Jason, you're a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

465
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,057
Anything for my favorite member.

466
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:36,631
Oh, if I were 20 years younger,
the things I would do to him.

467
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,734
- Mm, no dating staff. Page 16.
- The rule book!

468
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,603
You read the rule book,
that outdated rag?

469
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:45,873
Yeah. Lots of rules,
not enough fun.

470
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,276
Well, you're right.
This place is a little stuffy.

471
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,677
I can overlook the stuffy part

472
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,746
as long as I can eat
and drink for free.

473
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,157
I'm gonna help my uncle
make his minimums.

474
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,816
Well, good for you.

475
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,449
So, which one's the cool table?

476
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:58,653
They're all cool table.

477
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:02,123
There are a lot
of wonderful people here.

478
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:04,992
It's just so much more fun
to talk about the bad ones.

479
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:08,395
- I'm listening.
- First, we have the Rockbridges.

480
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,531
Old money.

481
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,305
He's an idiot son
who inherited a fortune.

482
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,635
She's a former lingerie model.

483
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,671
And you've met the ladies.

484
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:19,173
I use that term loosely,
but only about of them.

485
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,342
That's new money
and a lot of it.

486
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,111
That Skyler
seems pretty intense.

487
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,515
I think you could take her.

488
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:30,117
And then there
are the young marrieds.

489
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,552
Meet the Smiths.

490
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:34,021
They have
the most perfect children

491
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:35,323
on the planet.

492
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,191
Watch what she does
with those olives

493
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:38,559
in her martini.

494
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:44,131
Wow! That would be genius
if it wasn't child abuse.

495
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:45,700
Mm hmm.

496
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,811
Of course, once you surpass
a certain income bracket,

497
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,436
we call it "character building."

498
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,473
Oh, I wasn't finished yet.

499
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:55,475
And you're supposed
to clear from the right!

500
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,678
What's going on with this place?

501
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:00,413
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Harrison.
- Do it again.

502
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,383
The correct way.

503
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,089
Much better.

504
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,727
Sorry.

505
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,328
Oh, man.

506
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,963
You don't have to be so mean.

507
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,666
Becky, I was teaching her
a lesson.

508
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,500
You'd think
they'd train them better here.

509
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,473
Yes, can I help you?

510
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,920
Didn't think so. Good idea.

511
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:41,053
I'm sure the dishwasher
could really use some help.

512
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:49,764
Oh, don't cry.
I'm sorry those women were...

513
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,832
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

514
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:53,577
We're not supposed to eat
in front of members,

515
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,945
but this was all
just gonna get thrown out.

516
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,469
No, please, eat!

517
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:59,941
- It is so good!
- Yeah.

518
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,376
I'm sorry those girls
were so mean to you.

519
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,578
Them? Nah.

520
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,681
Most people here are cool.

521
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:08,225
They just put me down,
because they know

522
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:09,526
without their husbands
they'd be back here

523
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,484
sneakin' lobster with me.

524
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,020
Honestly,
I feel kinda bad for them.

525
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,522
Really?

526
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:15,790
I'm a psych major.

527
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:18,125
So I don't take anything
personally.

528
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,329
- Wow, that's really freeing.
- Hmm.

529
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,764
What's the professional term
you'd use for Skyler?

530
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,234
Mm, cunty probably.

531
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,005
I'm sorry I shouldn't say that.

532
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,516
You're not gonna have me fired,
are you?

533
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,642
- Not a chance.
- Cool.

534
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:38,446
Oh, my God!

535
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,147
They're throwing away
the lobster!

536
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,983
Yeah. Happens all the time.

537
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,236
Well, can't they give it
to the homeless or something?

538
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,787
Food safety regulations.
If they get sick they could sue.

539
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,557
- It's a whole thing.
- That's not accurate.

540
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,425
That's a lie fed to us
by corporate America

541
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,828
to excuse capitalistic laziness.

542
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,596
Hell yeah.

543
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,632
Well, could I take some home
for my cat?

544
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,134
For your cat?

545
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,936
Sure.

546
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,538
I will pack some up for you.

547
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,274
Hey, would you wanna hang out
some time?

548
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,712
Um, I'm just really busy
right now,

549
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:12,956
like with school and work.
It's...

550
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,815
Oh, yeah. No, I totally get it.

551
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,384
But you never know.

552
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,477
Something could change,
my schedule could free up.

553
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:22,089
- Let me pack this up for you.
- Great, thank you.

554
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,333
Jason?

555
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,944
Please don't let me end up
on a murder podcast.

556
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,281
Jason?

557
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,682
What are you doing?

558
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,451
Oh.

559
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:52,586
Hey, uh, wine?

560
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,723
These stars look fake.

561
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:58,626
They're just so bright.

562
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,196
Oh, yeah, it's uh,

563
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,998
'cause there's no lights
on the course.

564
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,649
You're gripping it too tight.
Keep the pressure firm,

565
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:12,440
but only
in your three left fingers.

566
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,676
Well, excuse me, Michelle Wie.
How do you know uh...

567
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,912
Hang around long enough,
you pick up the lingo.

568
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,482
Okay.

569
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,787
Damn!

570
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,322
I thought you couldn't play.

571
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:32,359
Uh, yeah, I used to,
but uh, I don't play anymore.

572
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,428
It's a long story.

573
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,563
My favorite kind.

574
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,966
My stepdad
was a caddie at Gilmore.

575
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,869
He taught me how to play
and I was pretty good.

576
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:44,338
I got a full ride to Stanford.

577
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:47,542
Wow! So, you're like amazing.

578
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,578
Yeah, I was.

579
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,745
But I got to school

580
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:56,551
and I felt like everyone
was so privileged.

581
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:59,453
I was the only scholarship kid
without a trust fund.

582
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,489
I felt like I didn't fit in.

583
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,058
So, I dropped out.

584
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,927
My stepdad got me a job
at the club,

585
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:09,096
and rest is history.

586
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,298
And your parents were cool
with you quitting?

587
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,202
Um, no. they were pretty pissed.

588
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:19,073
But when I got there,
I felt like charity case.

589
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,376
- Like I...
- You didn't belong.

590
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:23,511
Exactly.

591
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah, I know the feeling.

592
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,450
I think my time at Gilmore
has come to an end.

593
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,918
Already?

594
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,821
Gilmore and me
are like post-breakup bangs.

595
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:37,958
Good in theory,
but in execution, big mistake.

596
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:39,436
I feel like you'd look good
with bangs.

597
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,428
Mm, no,
the receipts prove otherwise.

598
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:43,330
I could not pull it off.

599
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,832
Alvarez, we both know

600
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,467
you can pull off
anything you want to.

601
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:48,335
Operative word being "want".

602
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,304
Okay, so what do you want?

603
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,975
I'm still figuring it out.

604
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,046
Holy shit! Oh, my God!

605
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,948
Did you see that?
That was a shooting star!

606
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,318
- Am I in a fairytale?!
- Um, depends.

607
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:06,787
- Did you make a wish?
- Oh, shit.

608
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,756
No, it happened so fast.

609
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,261
What was that?

610
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:16,797
Uh, could be a rabbit.

611
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,334
Or a snake.

612
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,670
Or a coyote.

613
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,837
- Yeah, we should probably go.
- Yeah.

614
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,679
I hope you're hungry, Romeo,
because we hit the jackpot!

615
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,780
We're gonna eat lobster
for weeks!

616
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,819
Tío! How's my favorite
jet-setting one-per center?

617
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,487
Uh, just landed in Paris,

618
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:42,389
and the driver talked
about this throuple

619
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,526
and smoked a cigarette
the whole time.

620
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:45,802
I don't know which was worse.

621
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:47,696
<i>Anyway, how are you?</i>

622
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,730
I'm good. Really good.

623
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:52,199
<i>Day one
and you already met a man?</i>

624
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,668
What? No!

625
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,136
I can hear your smile
from France.

626
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:59,440
Who is he?
Did you meet at Gilmore?

627
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,544
Yes, but it's not like that.
It's complicated.

628
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:03,744
He's not married, is he?

629
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,446
<i>Ew, Tío, no!</i>

630
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,649
But please just drop it, okay?

631
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:10,017
Besides, I could actually
use some advice.

632
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,819
You're asking me for help?

633
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,153
<i>Go on.</i>

634
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,089
I really
wanna give this place a chance.

635
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,558
Some people
have been really cool

636
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,425
and some have been...

637
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,994
Skyler Harrison.

638
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:21,962
I don't wanna name names,
but, yes.

639
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:25,099
<i>- And it's not just her,
- I feel like I don't fit in.</i>

640
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,569
Even today at the luncheon,
everyone was staring.

641
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,069
<i>What were you wearing?</i>

642
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:30,904
My new skort,
from the golf shop.

643
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,644
You still there?

644
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,378
Yes.

645
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:39,690
Uh, mijita, you have to dress
for the class you wanna be in,

646
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,181
not the class you are.

647
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,017
Was that Gandhi?

648
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,185
<i>These spaces
aren't always made for us,</i>

649
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,820
<i>but that doesn't mean
we don't belong.</i>

650
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,956
You gotta make one ally
at a time.

651
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,258
Walk in
with your head held high,

652
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,127
and for the love of God
never wear a skort

653
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,362
to the main dining hall again.

654
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:58,165
<i>- How'd I do?</i>
- Solid 10 outta 10.

655
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,500
<i>Great.</i>

656
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:03,003
And not to ruin the moment,
but um,

657
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:04,838
did you put your parents up?

658
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,875
Not yet.

659
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:11,412
Don't wait too long, mijita.

660
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:14,582
I know. I won't.

661
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:16,483
<i>Great. Now go give them hell.</i>

662
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,290
Romeo!

663
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,797
Christina. Christina.

664
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,831
- Christina!
- No! Stay back!

665
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,369
Oh, my God, Ms. Alvarez,
I am so sorry!

666
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:36,904
Holy shit!

667
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,372
Where'd you learn to do that?

668
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,207
Jiu-jitsu. My muscle memory
just took over!

669
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,276
Holy shit,
I just assaulted a member.

670
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,187
And not at all in the way
I pictured it would happen.

671
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:45,913
Are you okay?

672
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,448
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

673
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:50,484
I was just wondering
if you were free this afternoon.

674
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,522
Uh, actually, yeah, I am.

675
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:57,224
Today's your lucky day.

676
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,158
I hope no one saw that.

677
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,527
- Come on.
- Yeah.

678
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,230
The best consignment store
in town.

679
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,644
All the richest bitches
come here

680
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,467
to drop off
their last-season cast-offs.

681
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:09,671
Ooh!

682
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,573
This one feels...

683
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,040
Deeply problematic?

684
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:15,643
- I was gonna say racist.
- Yeah, yeah.

685
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,046
- This one's a maybe.
- Okay.

686
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,447
For home use only.

687
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,282
Hey, I don't slut shame.

688
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,719
I have the same one in red.

689
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:25,986
I feel beautiful.

690
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,222
Uh, there's a wine stain
on the back.

691
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,957
Oh, God, I think that's blood!

692
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,827
Oh, my God, ew!
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

693
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,696
Classic.

694
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,766
- I feel like a Bond girl.
- You look like a Bond girl.

695
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:38,966
This is it.

696
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,568
- Pish.
- Mm hmm.

697
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:43,814
Okay, if you don't buy that,
I will kill you.

698
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,878
And then I'll buy it,
and I'll wear it to the trial.

699
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:50,911
You look beautiful.

700
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,045
How do you feel?

701
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,449
Different, but good different.

702
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,587
Thank you for bringing me here.

703
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,088
Any time.

704
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,956
But we probably
should get going.

705
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,491
Some of us actually have
to work.

706
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,926
Yeah, let's go.

707
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,450
Hey, ladies!
Let's lunch soon.

708
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,490
- Wow! Uh, you clean up nice.
- Thanks.

709
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,991
I had a little help
from a friend.

710
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,445
I thought you didn't
have friends.

711
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:41,161
It's called "personal growth."

712
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,096
Ah! I'll have to try
that sometime.

713
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,534
- I had a lot of fun yesterday.
- Me, too.

714
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:48,837
Do you think you...

715
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,172
Okay, I'll be right there.

716
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:56,977
I should probably go,
but I'll see you soon, Alvarez.

717
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,885
Good lady,
a tequila on the rocks.

718
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:05,520
- Make it double.
- Oh!

719
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:08,055
I guess I'm a proper lady
of society now.

720
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,257
Well, you certainly look
the part,

721
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,926
but now you've gotta act it.

722
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,369
Well, you've spent a lot of time
around these bougie a-holes.

723
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:14,796
What should I do next?

724
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:16,841
Give up my voting rights
or start preparing a dowry?

725
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,465
Wow!

726
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,009
Uh, first, I'd start by getting
that chip off your shoulder.

727
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,435
Ouch.

728
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,004
Ariana, you are spending time
at an amazing club

729
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,305
on your tío's dime.

730
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,241
A million people
would kill to be here.

731
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,544
- Check your privilege, missy.
- You're right.

732
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:32,012
Consider the chip gone.
Any other pointers?

733
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,715
Ooh,
you're gonna hate this next one.

734
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:35,008
I don't wanna date old dudes.

735
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:37,284
It's worse. You have to golf.

736
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,786
I'd rather date an old dude!

737
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,680
I know, but it's a golf club.
You gotta golf.

738
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:42,265
From what I've seen,
it's a drinking club

739
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,825
with a golf course.

740
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,970
Listen, it's an amazing way
to earn the ladies' respect

741
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,905
and it shows the men that
you're not just here shopping

742
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:48,929
for a husband.

743
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:50,330
I'll consider it.

744
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,834
But I want the record to show
I'm not happy.

745
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,301
Noted.

746
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:57,839
And last but not least,
I'd enjoy this place

747
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,973
while it's still here.

748
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,542
Still here? Where's it going?

749
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:04,512
- Money problems.
- I have money problems.

750
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,346
Trust me, this place
is doing just fine.

751
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,248
No, girl, membership is down.

752
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,817
The older members are dying off

753
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:11,294
and they're certainly
not attracting any younger ones.

754
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:12,654
Well, boo-hoo!

755
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:15,355
The oldies can manifest
this place up in heaven.

756
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,725
- I sense a chip.
- Sorry, old habits.

757
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,794
Ariana,
it's not just the members.

758
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,361
Look around this place.

759
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:23,765
There's over 100 employees
that depend on Gilmore.

760
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,876
If something doesn't change,
this could be the last year

761
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,401
for all of us.

762
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:28,895
Well, I can think
of a million ways

763
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,090
to make this place more fun.

764
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:33,407
- Oh, no.
- I'm here for back up.

765
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,209
- What's going on?
- Hole in one!

766
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,712
- But that's a good thing.
- Mm-mm.

767
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,013
Not for us.

768
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,466
The entire club
gets a free drink.

769
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:42,068
- Which leads to more drinks.
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,417
- Here they come.
- Shit.

771
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,867
My martini, if you please!

772
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:02,169
There she is! Woman of the hour!

773
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,872
Sank that sucker
from 150 yards out.

774
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,239
I heard it was a lucky shot.

775
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,676
Lucky my ass,
you cheap son of a bitch!

776
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,770
Drink the only free thing
you'll ever get from me.

777
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:11,913
Hmm.

778
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,591
I heard it was windy
that probably did it.

779
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:15,349
Three divorces, Bill.
Wonder why.

780
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:18,519
Hey, Christina, a beer
before my wife gets here.

781
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:20,922
Thank you.

782
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:23,791
She's really got a tight grip
on your balls, huh, son?

783
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:27,862
Yeah, I mean more or less,
but mostly more.

784
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:28,996
Tough place.

785
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,799
Yes, I bet. God, I love beer!

786
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:32,933
- Kyle!
- Hey.

787
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:35,369
What are you doing?

788
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:37,672
Just uh, havin' a beer,
a little celebration.

789
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:38,805
Mm hmm.

790
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,508
It's time
to let your balls drop.

791
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,342
Bill, you would be
so much more attractive

792
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,311
if you talked
just a little less.

793
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,914
That's funny!
That's what Kyle says about you!

794
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:50,585
- Honey, can I talk to you?
- Yup. Yup.

795
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,854
Well played.

796
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:55,823
Well, gentlemen, it is time
for us to journey on.

797
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:57,157
Where's everyone going?

798
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,793
Oh, we're going
to the men's lounge!

799
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:01,929
There' just too much estrogen
out here.

800
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:03,497
It's my kryptonite.

801
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,900
Why not just stay here
and have another drink on...

802
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,300
On Mr. Alvarez?

803
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:10,138
Oh, we're goin' in there
where there's um, books.

804
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,707
- Oh, you read?
- Yeah. Do you read?

805
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,975
Romance novels?

806
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,810
- Good for you.
- Um...

807
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:16,943
Another time.

808
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:19,781
Honey, you want him to go.

809
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:22,083
Watching him drink
with his penis,

810
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:24,018
it's not for everybody.

811
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:25,385
Romance novels?

812
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,388
Oh, honey, it's <i>See Spot Run.</i>

813
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:30,357
<i>The Adventures of Dick and Jane.</i>

814
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,793
Dick likes his dick.

815
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,861
Bill likes his dick.

816
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,931
Maybe I could just have one
with the boys.

817
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,933
Honey,
I made us reservations at Fork.

818
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,367
She is a top chef.

819
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,879
- It took me months to get us in.
- Yeah, I know.

820
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,971
And I'll...
I'll still make it to dinner.

821
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,607
Okay.

822
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,317
But you know, I hate
when you hang out with Bill.

823
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,486
He's a creep
and he always looks at my...

824
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,646
I... I... I know, I know.

825
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,682
Hey, I promise, I'll be good.

826
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:56,150
Hmm?

827
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,350
- You better.
- I would.

828
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:58,519
Or I'll know.

829
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,521
I know you will. Love you.

830
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:01,655
Love you.

831
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,862
Hey, hey!
Who's bangin' the new chick?

832
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,109
Well, I don't know
if you're talking about reality

833
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,568
or what's happened in my mind,

834
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,621
because in my mind,
we're having our third child.

835
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,958
I'm gonna ride that thing
like a choo-choo train.

836
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:25,813
Hey, don't tell my wife.

837
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,448
Sometimes it sucks
to have a vagina.

838
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,586
What a stupid, archaic,
sexist rule!

839
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,731
I mean no wonder you guys
aren't getting any new members.

840
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:36,389
You are correct,
but it is a tradition.

841
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,659
Fuck tradition.
It was your hole in one!

842
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,762
You should be in there
celebrating!

843
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,864
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm too tired for that fight.

844
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:45,900
Then I'll fight it for you.

845
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,467
I'm goin' in.

846
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,904
Fine, well,
as the ranking board member,

847
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:51,215
I will tell you
that the tradition

848
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,040
is 125 years old.

849
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:54,776
Other than that, I know nothing.

850
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,477
Christina, hit me up!

851
00:37:58,846 --> 00:37:59,846
Hang on!

852
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,652
- You'll also need these.
- Thank you.

853
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,786
Good luck.

854
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,124
She's so plucky.

855
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,392
You don't come here
for the huntin', do you, boy?

856
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,497
- Fuck your tradition.
- Oh!

857
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,767
I'm here and I've got tequila.

858
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,170
- Tequila!
- Tequila!

859
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,675
Night, boys.

860
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:28,910
Bottoms up.

861
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
<i>Ono más.</i>

862
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:36,349
You said
she wouldn't last a week.

863
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,553
We may have to step things up,

864
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,721
but we'll find a way
to get her out.

865
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,398
Do you think she really wants
to have lunch with us

866
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,258
or was she just being nice?

867
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,294
You know,
she did seem pretty cozy

868
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:48,162
chatting it up
with Jason earlier.

869
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,296
I wonder...

870
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:51,132
This feels a little mean, girls.

871
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,433
Can't we just give her a chance?

872
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,570
- We could invite her to Fork.
- No! No.

873
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:58,039
Ladies, no, just trust me.

874
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,808
This club will never accept
someone like Ariana.

875
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:04,946
- Ariana! Ariana! Ariana!
- Ariana! Ariana! Ariana!

876
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,181
Ariana! Ariana!

877
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,549
Sure about that?

878
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:10,718
Ariana! Ariana! Ariana!

879
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:14,722
Hey, let me just squeeze
in there quick.

880
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,824
Hey, thanks for bringin'
the tequila.

881
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:17,692
This is fun.

882
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:18,659
- Stop.
- Oh, ticklish?

883
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:19,894
- Stop.
- Oh...

884
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,361
What? Oh, Kyle!

885
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:25,032
Your wife
is in the men's lounge.

886
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,769
You know the rules.
Next round is on you, jackass.

887
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:31,138
Kyle, we don't wanna miss
our dinner reservation.

888
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,940
Let's go. Now.

889
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,542
Yes, dear.

890
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:37,912
Come on, Sky,
we're just havin' some fun.

891
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,146
Hey, for the record,

892
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,215
your husband
can really pound the tequila.

893
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:44,218
For the record, that dress
looked great on me last year.

894
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,921
I bet you didn't notice
my initials on the inseam.

895
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:50,658
Okay, Skyler, men's lounge,
you out.

896
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,294
- But what about her?
- You don't know my pronouns.

897
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:01,102
- Ariana! Ariana!
- Ariana! Ariana!

898
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:04,138
- Ms. Alvarez!
- Ariana! Ariana!

899
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,141
May I speak with you, please?

900
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:09,276
Privately.

901
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,215
Ms. Alvarez, your behavior
in the men's lounge

902
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:15,616
was totally unacceptable!

903
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,151
You know what's unacceptable?

904
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,520
Separating genders
like it's the 1900!

905
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:22,156
- It's a tradition!
- Well, it's regressive.

906
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,926
Even so, I've already received
too many complaints about you.

907
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:26,761
I have no choice
but to contact your uncle.

908
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's not do anything rash.

909
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,967
Mr. Peters, word on the street
is the club isn't doing great.

910
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,603
So why don't we make a deal?

911
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:37,456
I'll help you
get your membership numbers up

912
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,207
and you keep this whole incident
on the DL.

913
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:41,776
Let's leave Tío Jorge out of it.

914
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,911
What happens in Gilmore,
stays in Gilmore.

915
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:46,814
Excuse me. This club
doesn't need your help.

916
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:49,650
We both know it does.
Gilmore needs to change.

917
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:53,154
If not, lots of jobs go bye-bye,
including yours.

918
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:02,396
Well... the annual
new member drive is comin' up.

919
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,032
I could recommend you
to the committee.

920
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:05,967
Great.

921
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,601
It's run
by Mrs. Skyler Harrison.

922
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,570
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
Let me guess.

923
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,639
Charity auctions,
wine-tasting parties,

924
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,274
and black-tie events.

925
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,676
And the women's golf tournament
at the end of the season.

926
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,979
Boring, boring, boring!

927
00:41:18,112 --> 00:41:20,548
You want new members,
you need new ideas.

928
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,850
We gotta think
outside Skyler's box.

929
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,654
-I'm listening
-Oh, now? Oh, okay.

930
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:29,623
Uh, well, just spit balling here.

931
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,661
I think you need to appeal
to a younger demographic.

932
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:36,697
They don't want galas,
they want yappy hours.

933
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,432
- Yappy hour?
- Yes!

934
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,500
You know, like drinks and dogs!

935
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:43,637
You take care of Skyler
and the committee,

936
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,082
I'll take care
of the new members.

937
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,508
And Uncle George
stays none the wiser.

938
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:52,279
You really think
you can pull this off?

939
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,115
I think I can save this place.

940
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,283
Then you got yourself a deal.

941
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,257
The parking lot is packed.
Where is everyone?

942
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,959
<i>Welcome Gilmore members
and guests!</i>

943
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,695
<i>Let's get ready to play
The Price is Right!</i>

944
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:09,130
I love that show!

945
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,009
My grandma won a trip
to the Grand Canyon.

946
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,134
She didn't take me though.

947
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:23,044
Skyler!

948
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:24,578
Oh, I'm sorry,

949
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:26,213
I don't see your name
on the list.

950
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:28,315
But you're more than welcome
to wait in line.

951
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,117
What the hell is going on?

952
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,020
It's new member week.
And we all have to do our part.

953
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,322
<i>Give a round of applause
to Kyle Harrison</i>

954
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,324
<i>and his brand-new peloton!</i>

955
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,759
I'm gonna get Mr. Peters.

956
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:40,670
Oh, don't bother.
I'll go in and grab him for you.

957
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:42,005
In the meantime, feel free
to check out all

958
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,330
these activities I have planned.

959
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:46,000
S'mores bar and stargazing?

960
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,201
- How romantic!
- Hmm.

961
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:48,602
Harry would love that!

962
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,037
Oh, my God! A yappy hour!

963
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,972
Spots are filling up quick so...

964
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:54,875
And don't forget to follow
the hashtag Gilmore 2.0

965
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,410
for the most up-to-date news.

966
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:58,112
<i>And please welcome to stage,</i>

967
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:01,782
<i>our wonderful hostess
Ariana Alvarez!</i>

968
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,819
Gotta go, duty calls.

969
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,757
<i>Ladies, come through</i>

970
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,210
<i>for tomorrow's
self-defense class.</i>

971
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,761
<i>Gilmore
is a no-pussy-grabbing zone!</i>

972
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:16,163
This means war.

973
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:22,837
25 new pledges. A club record.

974
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,839
What do you say you take me out
to celebrate?

975
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:27,308
I'd say meet me after my shift.

976
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,742
Hmm.

977
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,144
I'll text you!

978
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:37,384
Yes, maybe, yeah.

979
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,589
Hey, um, we'll start
with a flight of ales

980
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,990
and a couple of pretzels,
please.

981
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:45,359
Flight? I want one of those.

982
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,097
Are you sure
you can handle all that?

983
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:51,665
You scared?

984
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,502
We'll take two of those, please.

985
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,003
A good choice.

986
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,640
So, this place is cute.

987
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:01,008
Yeah, I love it.

988
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,144
The food's good
and the beer's cheap.

989
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:04,957
And there's no chance someone
from the club

990
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,647
will see us together, right?

991
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,382
I see your angle.

992
00:44:08,517 --> 00:44:10,384
Trust me, it's for the best.

993
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,852
It's a stupid rule.

994
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:14,188
People should be allowed
to fall for each other.

995
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,056
No one should lose their job
over it.

996
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:18,659
Is that what's happening?

997
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,961
We're falling for each other?

998
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,564
I don't know. You tell me.

999
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,335
Let's play a game,
truth or drink.

1000
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,573
Well, I already plan
on drinking, but okay.

1001
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:32,740
Gentleman, first.

1002
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:35,676
When we met,

1003
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,546
what was your first thought
about me?

1004
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:40,447
That you were fucking hot. You?

1005
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,249
Hmm.

1006
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:43,918
Drink?

1007
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:45,452
Wow, you can't answer that?

1008
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:49,823
It was the second grade
and Jimmy just yelled,

1009
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,492
"He's goin' in his pants!"

1010
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:55,429
And for the next three years,
that was my cross to bear.

1011
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:56,864
Did you ever poop your pants?

1012
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,201
Drink. Oh, no!

1013
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:03,237
Definitely Zac Efron cover
of Rolling Stone.

1014
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,006
Ah! That was
your sexual awakening?

1015
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,343
Yeah, and it was glorious. You?

1016
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:10,476
Drink!

1017
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:11,512
I am.

1018
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,368
If a genie suddenly appeared
and gave you one wish,

1019
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:26,460
what would it be?

1020
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:28,171
That's not how genie's work.
I get three.

1021
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:30,699
Mm, this is
a post-pandemic recession genie.

1022
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:31,832
You get one.

1023
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,167
I'd ask for 100 more wishes.

1024
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,469
- Ugh, boring!
- Fine.

1025
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:37,871
Uh, I guess
a part of me still wonders

1026
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:39,740
what if I hadn't quit Stanford?

1027
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,408
Would I be pro?

1028
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:44,646
So I'd wish I could go back
and do it all over.

1029
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:45,779
It's never too late.

1030
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,315
Sometimes it is. What about you?

1031
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,618
What's your wish?

1032
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,354
Um, I wish...

1033
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,123
Drink, come on.

1034
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,277
- Fuck, Marry, Kill.
- Uh-huh.

1035
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:08,836
Skyler, Rebecca, and Jenny.

1036
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,605
- Marry Rebecca, fuck Jenny.
- Okay.

1037
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,807
And gently, non-problematically,
and non-violently kill Skyler.

1038
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,210
- Same. Come on.
- Bottoms up.

1039
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,712
Ooh!

1040
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:25,019
So, are we falling
for each other?

1041
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,757
I'm gonna guess, you're not.

1042
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:37,231
My sexual awakening
was Ryan Reynolds.

1043
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,166
I pooped my pants
at a 4th grade sleepover.

1044
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,968
I don't do well with dairy
as I found out.

1045
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,504
When we first met,

1046
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:43,880
I honestly thought
you were the ballsiest person

1047
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:45,039
and you weren't even trying.

1048
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:46,775
- I know what I'd wish for.
- What?

1049
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,442
From the genie, my wish.

1050
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,546
I'd ask to have my parents back.

1051
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,491
They died in a car accident,
comin' to visit me

1052
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:54,815
when I was in college.

1053
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,419
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

1054
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:00,622
I just needed
to say it out loud.

1055
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,960
Ariana,
I'm one 1,000% falling for you.

1056
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:24,244
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1057
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:26,947
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1058
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:33,987
One of us smells like mustard.

1059
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,422
What?

1060
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:41,195
Hot? Sweet?

1061
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:45,632
Spicy.

1062
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:50,471
Hot. Very hot.

1063
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,452
- Hey.
- Hey.

1064
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,223
Hello, Ms. Alvarez.

1065
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,226
You slept with Jason,
didn't you?

1066
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,596
I can't stop smiling.
I feel like I'm in a rom-com.

1067
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:16,765
Okay, I love this for you,
like amazing,

1068
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,700
but I would keep that on the DL.

1069
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,433
If Skyler finds out
about the two of you,

1070
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:22,002
she will be sure to ruin it.

1071
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:23,437
Speak of the devil..

1072
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,571
Good luck.

1073
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,307
- Skyler, so glad you made it!
- Oh, my goodness,

1074
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:29,443
I wouldn't miss it
for the world!

1075
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:32,212
What's good for the club
is good for everyone, right?

1076
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:33,346
Right.

1077
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:34,492
It's a great turn out,
by the way.

1078
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:35,517
Thanks, Rebecca.

1079
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,384
Yes, can't wait
to see how it goes.

1080
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,062
Well, you shouldn't have
to wait too much longer.

1081
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,988
Our instructor
will be here any second.

1082
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,222
Wonderful.

1083
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,360
Will she?

1084
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,576
Aw, Ariana,

1085
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:04,178
seems like your instructor
is a no-show.

1086
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:05,580
I'm so sorry it's a bust,

1087
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:07,347
but this is why we
have a committee.

1088
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,150
Not everyone has the skillset
to plan club events.

1089
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:17,024
Oh, there she is!
The woman of the hour!

1090
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,477
Everyone,
give a round of applause

1091
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,861
for Christina.

1092
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,164
- What are you doing?
- I owe you.

1093
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,900
You all know her
as a fabulous bartender

1094
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,501
and server,

1095
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:28,913
but what you don't know
is that she's highly trained

1096
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:30,237
in the art of Jiu-jitsu.

1097
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:35,844
Uh, uh, yes. Hi.

1098
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:40,214
Thanks you, Ariana,
for that wonderful intro.

1099
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:44,184
Um, and I'm so sorry
that I'm so late.

1100
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,422
But I'm really excited
to empower you all today,

1101
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:51,358
both physically and mentally.

1102
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:54,294
Okay. Alright, everyone up.

1103
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:56,598
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

1104
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,602
Mrs. Harrison, come on up.

1105
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,304
So, let's all pretend

1106
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:07,007
that I am walking alone
in a parking lot

1107
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,409
and Mrs. Harrison
is following me.

1108
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:11,513
I don't know why I'm
in the employee parking lot,

1109
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:12,646
but okay.

1110
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:14,959
Alright, I want you
to come up behind me

1111
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,116
and grab my shoulder.

1112
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,722
Touch me again

1113
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:22,924
and I will put you
in a shallow grave!

1114
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,293
Okay.

1115
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:27,896
So, that's how it's done,
ladies.

1116
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:32,299
First, you attack physically,
and then psychologically.

1117
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:33,001
Alright?

1118
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,201
Eve, great!

1119
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:35,970
Uh, Eve's gonna assist me.

1120
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,238
- Alright, who's next?
- Me!

1121
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:41,074
Nice. With one move.

1122
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,243
I was parallel parking

1123
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,078
before you were
in your father's nutsac,

1124
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,648
- so back off!
- You heard me!

1125
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:48,016
I heard you, I heard you!

1126
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:49,517
Let's go!

1127
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:50,785
Uh-huh.

1128
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:53,487
My belly's not a petting zoo,
so hands off!

1129
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:55,757
And my name's Rebecca,
not Becky!

1130
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,124
Yes!

1131
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,058
Yeah, Rebecca!

1132
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:04,164
I will shove my dick
so far up your asshole

1133
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:07,100
that it will split in two
out of your nostrils,

1134
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,538
you mansplainin' waste of space!

1135
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:17,177
Cheer leading was hard.

1136
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,816
Okay. Okay.

1137
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:23,817
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:30,758
That was fun.

1139
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:33,160
- Thanks for organizing.
- Hey, thanks for coming.

1140
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:35,697
Oh, and see you guys Friday.

1141
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,132
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1142
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:43,403
- I like your hair.
- Thanks.

1143
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,844
You must really be
enjoying this.

1144
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:51,378
I am.

1145
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:53,514
Especially since you tried
to sabotage my event.

1146
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:55,358
What'd you do?
Call the instructor and cancel?

1147
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,217
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1148
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,553
Gilmore's a family.

1149
00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:00,420
When one of us succeeds,
we all succeed.

1150
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:02,657
Oh, in the spirit of family,

1151
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,659
I'd love to see you
at Friday's mini golf.

1152
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,294
It's sold out, but I could
make an exception

1153
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,363
for the club's reigning champ.

1154
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:14,334
Just remember this, Ariana,
I win.

1155
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,803
I always win.

1156
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,179
I hope more people are coming.

1157
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:32,086
I mean, I'm sure more people
are coming.

1158
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,731
Wait, I thought you said
it was sold out.

1159
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:36,289
Uh-uh, that's Ariana's event.

1160
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:38,893
I've been thinking I know people

1161
00:52:39,027 --> 00:52:40,828
who can make people like her
disappear.

1162
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:42,929
You know Criss Angel?

1163
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:48,468
<i>Hey, Gilmore fam,</i>

1164
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:50,004
<i>the party
is just getting started.</i>

1165
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:52,607
<i>The music's loud
and the slushies are strong.</i>

1166
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,341
<i>So even if you hate golf
as much as I do,</i>

1167
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:55,576
<i>you'll still have fun!</i>

1168
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:01,816
Oh, my God, I love this song.

1169
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:04,217
Oh, damn, me, too.

1170
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:08,188
But not as much as a harpist,
obviously.

1171
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,000
What are you two talking about?

1172
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:18,599
Just how I'm feeling
so nauseous.

1173
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,069
Morning sickness
isn't just for the morning!

1174
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,838
- Who knew?
- Totally!

1175
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,573
And I'm also feeling sick.

1176
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:27,775
I think
it might be sympathy pains.

1177
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,244
Lovely party, Skyler.

1178
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,814
We'll see you tomorrow.

1179
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:33,981
Wait, Becky...

1180
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:36,316
Rebecca,
what am I supposed to do?

1181
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,685
Host this all by myself?

1182
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:42,724
I think you'll manage.

1183
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:45,793
Bye.

1184
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:53,568
No, thank you. No.

1185
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:55,401
Go!

1186
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,281
Thanks for coming.

1187
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,493
Oh, there's drinks over there.

1188
00:54:09,517 --> 00:54:11,753
You made it! Have fun!

1189
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:16,591
Well, this is quite
the turn out.

1190
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,731
Your uncle would be very proud.

1191
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,094
Mm, the night is young.

1192
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:21,672
Still plenty of time for me
to screw it up.

1193
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:23,831
Ariana, take the compliment.

1194
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:25,166
Thank you.

1195
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,902
These clubs are too damn small!

1196
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:31,005
It's called "mini golf",
Ms. Archebold.

1197
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,405
Yes, but you know,

1198
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,442
I only like to play
with big things, Peters.

1199
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:37,578
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

1200
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,013
Oh, I'm not done with you.

1201
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,116
Ari!

1202
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,417
Ah! Oh, guys!

1203
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:48,421
This is so much more fun
than Skyler's party.

1204
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:50,323
The harp is so boring.

1205
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,960
- Don't tell her I said that.
- That's very sweet, Jenny.

1206
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:55,163
How many of those red slushies
have you had?

1207
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:58,699
Mm, this is my third!

1208
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,636
Oh shit. I have to pee.

1209
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:05,239
See you soon, girly!

1210
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:06,941
I should probably
make sure she's good.

1211
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,375
Yeah.

1212
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:10,945
You always did know
how to throw a party.

1213
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:12,412
Keep doing new.

1214
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:14,882
Gilmore loves you.

1215
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,016
Thanks, Rebecca.

1216
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,327
Those rat bastards!

1217
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,002
Want to play a few rounds later?

1218
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:36,971
Loser takes the winner home.

1219
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:39,207
I thought you didn't play.

1220
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,473
I could make an exception.

1221
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,408
Okay, fine.

1222
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:49,584
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1223
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:55,355
It's good.

1224
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:56,489
Thank you.

1225
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,306
I'll take a club and a bucket,
please.

1226
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:01,829
Skyler, you made it!

1227
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:03,598
Yes, thank you for the invite.

1228
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:05,333
It's quite the party.

1229
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:07,034
Thanks?

1230
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:10,605
So, Jason, my cousin Summer
is coming into town next week.

1231
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:12,940
She's the hot one in the family
and very sweet.

1232
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:15,176
But I haven't been single
in so long,

1233
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,178
I... I don't know
all the fun bars.

1234
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:19,347
I could, um, recommend a few.

1235
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,015
You're such a doll.

1236
00:56:21,148 --> 00:56:23,450
But it might be easier
if I gave her your number.

1237
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:24,952
Maybe you could show her around.

1238
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:27,755
Who knows?
You two might really hit it off.

1239
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:30,423
Um, of course, Ms. Harrison.

1240
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:32,226
Anything for our club champion.

1241
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,561
You flatter me.

1242
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:35,796
See you later, Ariana.

1243
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:37,765
Thanks, Jason.

1244
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:42,270
- Ariana, I had to...
- No, you don't have to explain.

1245
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,338
I totally understand.

1246
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,806
I better go make my rounds.

1247
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,243
Damn.

1248
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,383
Two tequila shots. Doubles!

1249
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:56,851
You got it!

1250
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,786
Ariana, this place is poppin'.

1251
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,289
I haven't seen it like this
in years, girl!

1252
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,623
You should be really proud.

1253
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Oh!

1254
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,696
Whoa, okay.

1255
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:11,165
Um, are we sure this
is a good idea?

1256
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:13,744
Oh, you're j...
You're just gonna keep going.

1257
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:14,808
They're all for you. Okay.

1258
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:16,871
Hey, is everything alright?

1259
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:18,004
Never better.

1260
00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:21,307
I'm gonna be holding her hair
later.

1261
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,884
- Hey, do you wanna dance?
- Fuck yeah!

1262
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:35,655
Yeah.

1263
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:38,125
Oh. Yeah.

1264
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,427
Oh. Uh, stop!

1265
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,861
What? Come on, Ariana.

1266
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,263
The tension is killing me.

1267
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:43,564
No, you're married.

1268
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,299
I know, right?

1269
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,804
You fucking slut!

1270
00:57:50,738 --> 00:57:52,707
Skyler, it's not what you think.

1271
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,175
-You slimy-
-MEMBERS: Oh!

1272
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,110
Duplicitous hoe bag!

1273
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:58,079
It's not what you think!

1274
00:57:58,212 --> 00:57:59,947
Come out here
and face me like a woman!

1275
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:03,317
- Skyler, he tried to kiss me!
- Liar!

1276
00:58:03,451 --> 00:58:05,386
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

1277
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,054
- Oh!
- Oh!

1278
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:13,794
You're the one trying
to ruin every second of my life!

1279
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:19,000
That is because you,
Ariana Alvarez,

1280
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:22,203
are insignificant trash
and everyone knows it!

1281
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,872
Not even the damn caddie
will commit to you.

1282
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:26,040
That's right, everyone!

1283
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,275
Jason is sleeping
with this whore.

1284
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:32,313
Which according to page 106
is against the code of conduct!

1285
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:33,614
Jason, is this true?

1286
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:38,519
Jason, are you gonna tell them?

1287
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:42,088
Ms. Alvarez,

1288
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,958
I think you've had too much
to drink.

1289
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,731
Fuck you, Jason.
And fuck you, Skyler.

1290
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:53,768
And fuck this whole
fucking place!

1291
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:56,637
I quit, effective immediately.

1292
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:00,808
Uh-uh!

1293
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:02,301
Don't even think about it,
homeboy.

1294
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:10,651
Back to the party, guys.

1295
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,742
Looks like
it's just you and me, Romeo.

1296
00:59:51,926 --> 00:59:56,163
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1297
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:16,750
Jason, go away.

1298
01:00:20,821 --> 01:00:21,655
Rebecca,
what are you doing here?

1299
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:22,990
I was in the neighborhood

1300
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,959
and I thought
I'd make us breakfast.

1301
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,193
Do you still like pancakes?

1302
01:00:27,094 --> 01:00:28,629
- I love pancakes.
- Great.

1303
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:30,331
Is your kitchen this way?

1304
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,540
Rebecca,
what are you really doing here?

1305
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:40,542
- I quit the club.
- I know.

1306
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:42,843
Skyler was on fire last night.

1307
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:44,478
Yeah, Kyle tried to kiss me.

1308
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:48,048
Yup, he's a creep and deep down,
Skyler knows it, too.

1309
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,318
Uh, where are your mixing bowls?

1310
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:53,320
Look around.
Does it look like I bake?

1311
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:54,655
I need a mixing bowl!

1312
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:56,290
I can't make pancakes
without them.

1313
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:59,493
I... I need to do something
with these stupid, chubby hands!

1314
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:00,928
You're not chubby, you're...

1315
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:02,796
Gonna have a baby.

1316
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:05,833
I'm not ready for this.

1317
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,637
Rebecca, of course, you are.

1318
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,838
Look at you, you're perfect.

1319
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,274
Your husband's perfect,
your life is perfect.

1320
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:14,875
I bet your vagina
is gonna snap back

1321
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:17,512
into place perfectly.

1322
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:19,246
I'm not ready to be a mom.

1323
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:25,654
Look, I'm not exactly an expert
in that department,

1324
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,087
but for what it's worth,

1325
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,356
I think you're gonna be
a great mom.

1326
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,127
You kinda remind me of my mom.

1327
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,328
In a good way.

1328
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:37,898
God, I miss her.

1329
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:40,602
I know you really
miss your parents.

1330
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:42,503
I'm sorry.

1331
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:43,737
Thanks.

1332
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,975
Look, you're gonna do
the best you can.

1333
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:49,508
You're gonna give them
lots of love,

1334
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:51,045
and teach them right from wrong,

1335
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:54,848
and what they do with their life
is up to them.

1336
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:57,751
That's really sweet to say, Ari.

1337
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,186
Thank you.

1338
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,022
But are you... are you really
leavin' the club?

1339
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:04,892
Skyler may be cruel,
but she's not wrong.

1340
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:08,028
- I'm not Gilmore material.
- Bullshit.

1341
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:10,297
You belong at that club
just as much as anybody else.

1342
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,733
Skyler's just insecure,
because she met Kyle

1343
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:15,803
when she was a waitressing
at Scooter's Wild Wing Shack

1344
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,004
and married him.

1345
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,773
Wait, Skyler was a waitress?

1346
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,742
Yep, and now her whole life
is that club,

1347
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,844
and her man's a dog,
it's complicated.

1348
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,348
But she's wrong about you.

1349
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,950
You are not trash.

1350
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,086
And don't you forget it.

1351
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,388
Thanks, Rebecca.

1352
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,458
What are friends for?

1353
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:53,566
<i>Hi, Mr. Reddy,
it's Ariana Alvarez.</i>

1354
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:56,349
I was wondering
if you were free tomorrow.

1355
01:02:57,746 --> 01:02:59,246
Great.

1356
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:19,534
And she's back.

1357
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:22,870
Can't get rid of me that easily,
I'm like a roach.

1358
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:26,407
- Wait, let me try that again.
- Yeah.

1359
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,342
No, no, no, no, no. You quit.
I heard you.

1360
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,512
Everyone did.
And you don't even golf!

1361
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:32,647
I... I... is there a problem here?

1362
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:34,415
Section 5, paragraph 3,

1363
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:37,117
"A member must submit his
or her resignation in writing

1364
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,119
and it must be accepted
by the board."

1365
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:40,821
She's actually right,
Mrs. Harrison.

1366
01:03:40,954 --> 01:03:42,657
She is not stepping foot
on that course.

1367
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:43,924
I'll file a complaint!

1368
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:46,126
For fuck's sake, Skyler, relax!

1369
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,129
It's just golf.
We're not curing cancer.

1370
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:51,832
What's the matter, Skyler?

1371
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:53,702
Worried
about a little competition?

1372
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:57,013
The only thing I'm worried about
is where I'm gonna put

1373
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:59,206
- this year's trophy.
- You better hope so.

1374
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,075
Because if I remember correctly,

1375
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,944
the champion gets their dues
waved for a year.

1376
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:07,981
So, when I win,
I won't be going anywhere.

1377
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:17,991
Those are literally the rules.

1378
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,462
- Aren't you a bartender?
- I'm multi-faceted.

1379
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:26,433
You go, girl.

1380
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:35,510
Ariana, what're you doin' here?

1381
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:36,877
It's Ms. Alvarez.

1382
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,146
And I'm not here for you,
I'm here to play.

1383
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:41,649
You're playing? Against Skyler?

1384
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,117
Yes.

1385
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,930
And I'll obviously need
a different caddie.

1386
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,788
Perhaps one who isn't a coward

1387
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,865
that would rather watch people
play his whole life

1388
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,525
than go after what he wants.

1389
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:52,726
Thanks.

1390
01:04:59,032 --> 01:05:01,201
That was harsh.

1391
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:04,171
- Of course, she's right.
- I know.

1392
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:07,207
Let's take a walk.

1393
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:12,179
Jason, I have watched you
grow up at this club.

1394
01:05:13,147 --> 01:05:16,216
You are young, bright, talented.

1395
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,052
What do you want?

1396
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,757
Well, I played in college
and I really miss it.

1397
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:24,291
Competition.

1398
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:26,628
Hanging with the other players.
I don't know.

1399
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:29,531
A part of me still thinks
I could go pro.

1400
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:32,600
- You think so?
- I do.

1401
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:35,135
It's an expensive sport.

1402
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,970
You'll need sponsor.

1403
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,845
Take this card,
call my office on Monday,

1404
01:05:43,977 --> 01:05:45,479
and we will arrange a try-out.

1405
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,982
- Ms. Archebold, this is amazing!
- I know!

1406
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:53,020
Listen, honey, aside from you,

1407
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:54,923
your stepfather
was the best caddie

1408
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:56,957
that this club ever had.

1409
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,959
And he always thought
that his boy

1410
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,961
could be the next Tiger Woods.

1411
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,664
So, let's prove him right,
shall we?

1412
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:04,905
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

1413
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:07,034
No, you won't.

1414
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:11,639
Two things I never mess with,
my money and my martinis.

1415
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:14,074
I've seen what you can do
with the martini.

1416
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,043
Now, let's see what you can do
with my money.

1417
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:21,148
Mike! So, glad you made it!

1418
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,818
Thank you for the invite.
It's a beautiful course.

1419
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:25,520
And the drinks aren't half bad.

1420
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:28,013
- Let me get the first round.
- Well, I don't wanna be rude.

1421
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:30,725
- Tequila?
- Always.

1422
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,359
Two tequila sodas, please.

1423
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:35,162
Thank you.

1424
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,664
I don't wanna
talk too much shop,

1425
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:38,398
but I've been thinking
about your company

1426
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:40,373
and I have a great idea
on how to boost morale.

1427
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:42,737
- I'd love to hear more.
- I'll cheers to that.

1428
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:48,743
Now, I've got to go take care
of something.

1429
01:06:48,877 --> 01:06:50,512
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

1430
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,448
Bezos, I told you I'm golfing.

1431
01:06:54,582 --> 01:07:00,387
It's a great day here
at Gilmore Country Club!

1432
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:01,522
Yes!

1433
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:07,327
Welcome to the annual
Women's Championship Round!

1434
01:07:08,262 --> 01:07:09,797
Good Lord, is that thing today,
Dan?

1435
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:11,398
Hey, Bill.

1436
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:13,577
You think I need a quick night
in before you tee off?

1437
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:14,945
- Not gonna happen today.
- Alright.

1438
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,236
There's a tournament.

1439
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:17,939
Well, you wanted something
from the bar,

1440
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:18,940
- but you'll get a gin and tonic.
- Sure, I'll do gin and tonic.

1441
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:20,307
Alright. Double?

1442
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,141
- Thank, Bill. Sure, Bill.
- If I know you.

1443
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:22,610
Thanks, Bill.

1444
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:24,946
Each participating golfer
will start a full 18.

1445
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:27,481
Golfers will be eliminated

1446
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,049
when it's
mathematically impossible

1447
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:32,152
to catch up or take the lead.

1448
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:33,521
- Hey, Dan, real quick.
- Yeah.

1449
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:35,095
It's uh,
mathematically impossible...

1450
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:36,891
- Uh-huh?
- For me to be interested.

1451
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:38,191
All right.

1452
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,894
Can't we just
make this one hole?

1453
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:41,428
- No, we're not.
- Oh.

1454
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:43,541
This is important to me.
I... I enjoy doing this, so...

1455
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:45,098
Can't blame a fella for trying.

1456
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:46,610
Yeah, I'll thank you to leave,
Bill.

1457
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:47,634
Appreciate.

1458
01:07:47,702 --> 01:07:51,104
All right,
all lady competitors...

1459
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,750
I didn't know
it was gonna be a full 18.

1460
01:07:52,774 --> 01:07:55,142
I thought it's like one hole,
kind of a mercy.

1461
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,754
- Yeah. That's not at all.
- All right.

1462
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:58,378
It's 18 holes women,
it's gonna be great.

1463
01:07:58,445 --> 01:07:59,924
I already finished my drink.
You want another?

1464
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:02,817
Yeah, you can have mine.
Thanks. Thanks, Bill.

1465
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:08,856
All right, all lady competitors,
please step forward!

1466
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:20,233
Okay.

1467
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,537
So, looks like
we got ourselves a twosome.

1468
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:26,206
Let the golf begin!

1469
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:55,168
Oh, wow.

1470
01:08:56,537 --> 01:08:57,739
Wow.

1471
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:59,232
Yeah, she's consistent,
she's good.

1472
01:08:59,339 --> 01:08:59,941
- She's consistent...
- Yeah, babe!

1473
01:09:00,074 --> 01:09:01,174
She is.

1474
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:05,513
Smooth! Wow.

1475
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,153
Okay, this is it.

1476
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:14,732
Yeah, y... I am... I am...
I am brimming.

1477
01:09:14,756 --> 01:09:17,457
I'm... I'm a cup of excitement
for this day.

1478
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:19,272
- Dan. Dan!
- I'm full... a drink-up today.

1479
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,628
Dan!

1480
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:21,972
You're gonna give yourself
another stroke.

1481
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:23,330
- Just calm down.
- Yeah.

1482
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:24,098
Just calm down.
I should probably bring it down.

1483
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:25,231
It's hard.

1484
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:27,845
I got a good feeling about this.

1485
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:28,736
- Hmm.
- Me, too.

1486
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,190
- Yeah.
- Yeah, there's something,

1487
01:09:31,072 --> 01:09:32,072
And a glow, an orb.

1488
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:33,240
- Okay, yeah.
- Dan.

1489
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:34,485
- Right? All right.
- Right, sorry.

1490
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:35,576
Extra, but I'm with you.

1491
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,870
- Right, thanks.
- Okay, stop!

1492
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,237
Not what you were expecting,
was it?

1493
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,873
Neither were they.

1494
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,340
Yes!

1495
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,443
- Oh, my God!
- Woo-hoo!

1496
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:11,445
- Oh, yes, she did it!
- Wooh!

1497
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:13,581
Yeah.

1498
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:14,715
This is gonna be good.

1499
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:17,852
- But you can't... I...
- I can, and I do.

1500
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:21,856
I used to play every weekend
growing up with my parents.

1501
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,356
After I lost them,

1502
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,935
I never thought I'd set foot
on a course again,

1503
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,427
but now that I'm here,
I feel right at home.

1504
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:30,297
Plus, I'm still a 4 handicap!

1505
01:10:36,204 --> 01:10:38,271
Now, I won't bore you
with the details of a full 18.

1506
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,240
So, I'll just give you
the highlights.

1507
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:42,242
Skyler, of course,
was off to a great start,

1508
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,443
but so was I.

1509
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:44,858
My short game wasn't bad either.

1510
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:54,286
- Oh!
- Oh!

1511
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,058
- Nice!
- Yes!

1512
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:58,358
Okay!

1513
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:18,780
- Oh!
- Oh!

1514
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:20,447
- Oh!
- Oh!

1515
01:11:26,888 --> 01:11:27,922
- Oh!
- Oh!

1516
01:11:42,103 --> 01:11:43,370
Okay.

1517
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:46,240
We're all tied up,
heading into 18.

1518
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:48,910
Swing like a girl.

1519
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:51,211
Got it.

1520
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:56,551
- Bitch is goin' down.
- Oh, that was aggressive.

1521
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:01,388
18 is gonna be fun. Real fun.

1522
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:35,890
- Oh!
- Oh!

1523
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:40,827
Shit.

1524
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:44,599
Aw, Ariana,

1525
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:46,332
maybe you should quit
while you're ahead.

1526
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,193
Tough shot.

1527
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,500
- Oh!
- Oh!

1528
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:34,515
Hey, Skyler,
maybe after the tournament

1529
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,384
we could go for...
Oh, I don't know,

1530
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:38,085
Scooter's Wild Wing Shack.

1531
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,689
- Who told you that?
- Don't worry.

1532
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:43,057
Your secret's safe with me.

1533
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:07,148
- Oh!
- Oh!

1534
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:20,761
Phew!

1535
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:25,498
Fucker!

1536
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:26,801
Oh, my gosh.

1537
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:38,679
Your shot.

1538
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:45,953
Go, Ariana!

1539
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:46,854
You got this!

1540
01:14:46,988 --> 01:14:49,190
Show 'em how it's done!

1541
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,491
You got this, Alvarez.

1542
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:06,374
Yes.

1543
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,309
Wow.

1544
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:23,324
Thank you.

1545
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:24,825
I'm so proud of you!

1546
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:26,394
I knew you had it in you!

1547
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:29,509
We're so proud,
we're so proud of you.

1548
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:37,848
- You really put a good show.
- Just got outplayed.

1549
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:40,074
Oh, don't cry, Stella.

1550
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:41,342
I have to cry.

1551
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:45,613
Shit.

1552
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:56,457
Skyler.

1553
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:07,201
- The club is all I have.
- That's not true.

1554
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:09,470
You have perfect skin!

1555
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:11,806
That's the Botox.

1556
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:13,974
A... and so many friends.

1557
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:16,444
They don't really like me.

1558
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,813
And Kyle?

1559
01:16:18,946 --> 01:16:20,915
Yeah, Kyle's a dirt bag.

1560
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:25,386
But I wouldn't be here
without him, so...

1561
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,655
Yeah, he is a dirt bag.

1562
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:30,991
But you're still you
without him.

1563
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:37,665
I hate this lounge. It's so...

1564
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:40,067
Problematic. Sexist.
Misogynist.

1565
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:41,570
Yes!

1566
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:44,271
Wait, did we just agree
on something?

1567
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:47,875
Crazier things have happened.

1568
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:50,211
You know,
if you really hate something,

1569
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:52,012
you can change it.

1570
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:55,316
Yeah. I guess you're right.

1571
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,418
Look, I'm sorry
for getting all caught up

1572
01:16:57,552 --> 01:17:00,221
in this like high-school drama.

1573
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:03,157
Sometimes it's easy to forget
who the real enemy is.

1574
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,290
I know.

1575
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:07,895
And I'm truly sorry
about your parents.

1576
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:12,666
Thanks. Truce?

1577
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:15,668
Congrats on the win.

1578
01:17:15,703 --> 01:17:17,171
Thanks.

1579
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:20,040
Our new Gilmore Women's Club
champion!

1580
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:25,412
Hey, smile for the newsletter.

1581
01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:33,387
- Look at that.
- Great, wow!

1582
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:34,655
- Amazing.
- Congratulations.

1583
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:36,228
It's pretty.
You did a very good job.

1584
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,934
It wasn't just
for the newsletter,

1585
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:49,103
they put it all over the club.

1586
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:50,905
And you both will love this.

1587
01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:52,673
I blinked.

1588
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:56,010
But I don't know,
I kinda like it.

1589
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:01,382
Oh shit, I gotta go.
Big day at the office.

1590
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:03,284
Can't be late. Te quiero.

1591
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:10,491
Yes, and uh...

1592
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,060
So, here's the final contract,
as discussed.

1593
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,862
The top 20
Heywood Media employees

1594
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:16,565
will get yearly memberships
to Gilmore.

1595
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,497
And the day passes
for the rest of my company?

1596
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,669
Also in the contract,
last Saturday of every month.

1597
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:22,136
Perfect.

1598
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:24,038
Any videos I should know of?

1599
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,273
Ha, very funny.

1600
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:30,377
So, just sign the dotted line
and we can have some whiskey.

1601
01:18:30,512 --> 01:18:32,947
Ariana, it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1602
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,717
Yes, we're very lucky
to have Ariana

1603
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,852
as our new Membership Director.

1604
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:40,087
Yes, you are.

1605
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,822
Jason Handley used to work here?

1606
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:44,959
- Didn't he just win the open?
- He did.

1607
01:18:45,092 --> 01:18:46,393
He's a talented up-and-comer.

1608
01:18:46,528 --> 01:18:48,004
I think he could be
the next Tiger Woods.

1609
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:49,028
He's got quite a swing.

1610
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:50,329
Hopefully not the same libido.

1611
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:54,401
Uh, I'm so sorry,
I have to take this.

1612
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:55,536
Elon.

1613
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:04,378
Ariana, that is 500 members!

1614
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:06,747
I mean, we are officially
in wait-list status.

1615
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,315
I'm so excited!

1616
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:09,850
But the work is just beginning.

1617
01:19:09,984 --> 01:19:11,553
Okay,
we have to plan the Fall Ball.

1618
01:19:11,686 --> 01:19:12,987
And I wanna revamp happy hour.

1619
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,522
I'm thinking...

1620
01:19:14,656 --> 01:19:17,491
Uh, uh, we are not doing
a Lusty Lagoon watch party.

1621
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:20,261
You can't tell me no,
on today of all days.

1622
01:19:20,394 --> 01:19:22,029
Fine.

1623
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:23,362
- Great.
- I'll think about it.

1624
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:26,333
Oh, uh, and Ariana...

1625
01:19:27,669 --> 01:19:28,669
...happy birthday.

1626
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:30,403
Thanks.

1627
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,541
Cheers to me.

1628
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:38,345
Oh!

1629
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:39,780
Yep, yep.

1630
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:42,382
Hoo!

1631
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:56,497
I'm proud of you, nena.

1632
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:58,566
Well, I wouldn't
have gotten here without you.

1633
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,700
So, thank you.

1634
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:03,304
Tío Jorge,
these are all of my friends.

1635
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:04,437
Hi!

1636
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:06,106
Friends,
some of you already know him,

1637
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,417
but this is my uncle
and the reason we all met.

1638
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:09,043
- Hi.
- Hello.

1639
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:10,344
- Hello, tío.
- Join us.

1640
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:11,955
- Oh, come, come on.
- This is for you.

1641
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:13,080
Yeah.

1642
01:20:13,213 --> 01:20:14,315
I know what you like.

1643
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:15,593
- Cheers.
- Oh, yeah, happy birthday.

1644
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:16,751
- Cheers.
- Oh, yeah!

1645
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:18,152
Happy birthday.

1646
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,055
And welcome back. Oh, yeah.

1647
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:22,188
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1648
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:23,625
So, good to have you back.

1649
01:20:23,758 --> 01:20:26,427
Ariana, I hope you don't mind,
I invited a guest.

1650
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,095
Oh, a date?

1651
01:20:30,732 --> 01:20:31,832
Not exactly.

1652
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:33,067
Surprise.

1653
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:35,502
Happy birthday, Ariana.

1654
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:37,171
Jason Handley!

1655
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:39,507
That was quite a round
on Saturday.

1656
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:40,742
Oh, thank you.

1657
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:42,777
Uh, my sponsor certainly
thinks so.

1658
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,078
She does, indeed.

1659
01:20:44,211 --> 01:20:45,979
So how did you get
into the sport?

1660
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:47,214
I played since I was a kid.

1661
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,584
I just didn't pursue it
seriously

1662
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:52,687
until someone showed me
what it means to be brave.

1663
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:54,021
She sounds incredible.

1664
01:20:54,154 --> 01:20:55,557
And beautiful.

1665
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,957
She is.

1666
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:59,193
She's smart, funny,

1667
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:01,730
and always her authentic self.

1668
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:03,631
So where is she?

1669
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:05,299
Oh, I screwed it up.

1670
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:10,355
The only way I can see her now
is if I beg a mutual friend.

1671
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,576
The thing is I'd really love
a second chance.

1672
01:21:16,009 --> 01:21:17,378
Mira Jason, I don't know you,

1673
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:19,279
But I do know
that life is short,

1674
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:21,516
Time is precious,
and love is rare.

1675
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,890
So, if you really love someone,
you have to go after 'em.

1676
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,589
But only
if they feel the same way.

1677
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,391
Use your common sense.

1678
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:32,259
Do you think
she might be interested?

1679
01:21:33,994 --> 01:21:34,995
She could be.

1680
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,305
Okay.

1681
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,439
Yes!

1682
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:50,310
- You could have warned me.
- Yes, I could've.

1683
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,079
But where's the fun in that?

1684
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:58,452
- Oh, look at that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1685
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,487
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, it's gorgeous!

1686
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,123
- Nice.
- Gorgeous.

1687
01:22:03,257 --> 01:22:05,593
- Beautiful.
- Should we sing?

1688
01:22:05,727 --> 01:22:06,994
- Oh, God, no.
- Yes.

1689
01:22:07,127 --> 01:22:08,663
But that's so anti-climatic.

1690
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:11,666
- Yeah, how about a speech?
- Yep, speech.

1691
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,677
Oh, yeah, give a speech.
Give a speech, speech, speech.

1692
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:15,502
Alright.

1693
01:22:15,637 --> 01:22:19,841
Um, my parents used to say,
"Show me your friends

1694
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:22,409
and I'll show you who you are."

1695
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:24,579
And I think
if they were here today,

1696
01:22:24,712 --> 01:22:26,180
they would be
really disappointed.

1697
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:28,248
Okay. Yeah, sounds about right.

1698
01:22:29,149 --> 01:22:30,852
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1699
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:32,304
I think
they would be really proud

1700
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:33,555
of who I've become.

1701
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:35,723
I know I am.

1702
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:39,527
Oh!

1703
01:22:41,763 --> 01:22:42,763
Hey!

1704
01:22:42,797 --> 01:22:44,298
Happy birthday!

1705
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:47,468
<i>Well, I did it.</i>

1706
01:22:47,602 --> 01:22:48,469
It's incredible.

1707
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:49,704
<i>I got a job.</i>

1708
01:22:50,905 --> 01:22:52,306
I got some great friends.

1709
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,408
Oh, my God!

1710
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:55,643
<i>And got out of my own way.</i>

1711
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:59,480
<i>Tío Jorge was right all along.</i>

1712
01:22:59,614 --> 01:23:02,316
<i>Okay, please don't tell him
I said that.</i>

1713
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:04,218
<i>Also,
I'm not cut out of the will,</i>

1714
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:06,955
<i>so he's my favorite tío again.</i>

1715
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,828
You got plans tonight?

1716
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:15,496
What did you have in mind?

1717
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:18,766
There they go.

1718
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,900
They're in love.

1719
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:24,404
You know, I can't guarantee
you'll see a shooting star.

1720
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:27,441
I know.
But a girl's gotta try!
