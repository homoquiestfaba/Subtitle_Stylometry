1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,335
Yeah?

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,704
Hey, it's Johnny.
Listen, Jesse wanted me

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,965
to finish this deal,
so that's why I'm calling.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,941
Okay, all right.
You got the address?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,671
- Yeah, I got it.
- I'll see you in 20 minutes.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,110
All right, I'll be there in 20.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,700
A Subtitle by R3V0LV3R.

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,893
For the Georgetown
bank robbers.

9
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,724
This one's for you.

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,422
Come on.

11
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,248
Enjoy your workout, man.

12
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,444
Thanks, man.

13
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,751
Uh, wait a second.

14
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,783
Your card...
it's not going through.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,794
- Do you mind scanning it again for me?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,625
Did it work?

17
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,064
Let's try something different.
Uh, what's your phone number?

18
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,695
Just use my work code... 00493.

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,740
- You work here?
- Weekends, usually.

20
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,071
Um, all right. You're all set.

21
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,511
- I guess I'll see you around.
- Bye.

22
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,578
"Stephanie."

23
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,458
Wow! It must be
a pretty special girl.

24
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,561
Oh, she's just a girl
from the gym.

25
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,301
No big deal. Actually, I did need
your opinion on something.

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,400
All right.

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,310
This one here
or this one right here?

28
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,138
- I like that one.
- Okay.

29
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,514
That's all right.

30
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,418
Mom's choice anyways, right?

31
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,424
It looks good.

32
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,451
Let's see what this is about.
It's kinda nerve-racking.

33
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,157
- Hey! How are you?
- Hi! I'm okay.

34
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,291
- Oh, good to see you.
- Okay, cool.

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,404
- Pretty cool, huh?
- It... it's crazy stuff.

36
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,102
I'm liking it though.

37
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,236
Some of these guys
are really good,

38
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,474
but just wait till
you see my brother.

39
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,779
- Your brother's the leader of the pack?
- He's the best one.

40
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,519
Oh, here he is.

41
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,261
Whoo! Yeah!

42
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,496
- He's the best one. Definitely best.
- That guy's a nutcase.

43
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,373
That was awesome. Come here.

44
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,211
Thanks, sis.

45
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,877
- Hey, Jesse, this is Johnny.
- What's up, man?

46
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,215
Dude, Jesse Meyers, man.
We went to school together in Burbank.

47
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,917
You were a senior
when I was a freshman.

48
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,119
Fuck that place.

49
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,684
Dude, you were
in my metal class.

50
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,696
You always used to come
all banged up. I understand why.

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,459
It's insane what you do, man.

52
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,365
Yeah, I do kinda
remember you now.

53
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,427
Yeah, Jesse doesn't hang out
in Burbank much anymore

54
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,837
since he always
gets in trouble.

55
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,465
Gotta love this girl.

56
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,339
Always looking out
for her big brother.

57
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,039
- Aww.
- Look, man, I gotta get back out there.

58
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,480
- Catch up with you afterwards.
- It was great seeing you, man.

59
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,540
- Whoo!
- Don't get her pregnant.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,711
Mom will be pissed.

61
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,849
- Thanks. Thanks, bro.
- Sweet bike.

62
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,122
Dude, drive one of these things,
for sure you're getting pussy, dude.

63
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,858
Bye.

64
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,661
See you later, bro.

65
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,602
And that's my brother.

66
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,940
- Hey, Steph. It's been awhile.
- Hey, David.

67
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,703
- How have you been?
- How are you?

68
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,075
Everything's good.
Who's the lucky guy?

69
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,011
- This is my friend Johnny.
- I'm Johnny.

70
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,606
He just wanted to come out here
and see what this was all about.

71
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,379
What do you think
about all this, Johnny?

72
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,249
This stuff's pretty
freaking awesome.

73
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,686
Beats a day job, huh?

74
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,655
God, yeah.

75
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,249
Hey, your brother's doing
really good since he came back.

76
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,158
- Thank God.
- Yup.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,127
You look good.
It's good to see you.

78
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,325
I'm gonna get back to it.
Take care, Johnny.

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,698
- Good seeing you again.
- It's nice meeting you.

80
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,363
- Everyone's really nice. This is great.
- Yeah.

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,067
Thanks.

82
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,750
It's like a couple of lunatics.

83
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,989
It's good, man.

84
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,997
What up, man? It's good.

85
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,625
- What up, bro?
- It's good.

86
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,669
How you doing?

87
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,500
A round of Jäger shots, man.

88
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,437
Dude, you don't
fuck around here.

89
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,771
The second you get here,
you're already ready to go.

90
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,141
Me and your sister haven't
even had a drink.

91
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,409
Well, I gotta get buckled
if we're gonna hump at midnight.

92
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,313
Are you ready for this shit?

93
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,318
- Yeah, dude.
- Here you go, princess.

94
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,786
- Thank you.
- To a wonderful evening, right?

95
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,482
To the best year ever.

96
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,287
Good riding today, Meyers.

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,454
Oh, dude. What's up, man?

98
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,691
Gonna be ready for FMX Games
this summer?

99
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,666
Why do you even
ask me that, dude?

100
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,066
- You know I grease it every time.
- I'm the boss, man.

101
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,765
- I have to ask you.
- All right, dude.

102
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,568
You know me, dude.
I'm gonna be there.

103
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,199
That's what I'm talking about.

104
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,904
So do me a favor, man.
Take it easy tonight, all right?

105
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,914
We've got a big week ahead of us and our
new bikes are coming in on Thursday.

106
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,712
- Yeah, no problem, man.
- All right.

107
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,777
Gotta tell you, man,
Rudy's talking shit, man.

108
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,981
- Huh.
- Telling me he's got some secret trick

109
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,991
- that he ain't gonna show you.
- I ain't worried about it.

110
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,492
I'll be there.

111
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,495
All right, man.
Have a good time tonight.

112
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,622
- All right.
- Hey, Steph, do me a favor

113
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,290
and babysit this guy for me.

114
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,994
- I'll try.
- All right.

115
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,365
- See ya, guys.
- See ya.

116
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,338
Fucking guy's such a buzzkill.

117
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,374
He's just trying
to encourage you, Jesse.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,569
Yeah, well, I'm fucking over it.

119
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,703
Hey, another round, please.

120
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,713
Yeah, make mine's
a double, please.

121
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,581
Look at him, dude. Starting to feel
real good about yourself, aren't you?

122
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,916
Well, it's gotta be
my favorite shirt.

123
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,081
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, don't mess with the shirt, dude.

124
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,682
But... cheers.

125
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,421
Whoo!

126
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,366
Yeah, man.

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,476
Yeah!

128
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,777
Listen, I think it's
my turn for another drink,

129
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,750
- so I'm gonna be at the bar, okay?
- Okay.

130
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,548
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah. Yeah, go.

131
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,121
Another sh... let's do another shot.
Yeah, a shot.

132
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,608
Hey.

133
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,804
Hey.

134
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,438
So, umm...

135
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,540
Almost happy New Year.

136
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,608
It is. It's almost New Year's.

137
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,483
- And...?
- And, uh, to a good year?

138
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,527
- And five...
- Four,

139
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,791
three, two, one!

140
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,231
Happy New Year!

141
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,462
Sorry, I'm suddenly...

142
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,593
See? You look good.

143
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,162
So do you.

144
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,672
Huh-uh.

145
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,236
God! Stop!

146
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,282
I told you I'm not ready yet.

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,046
God.

148
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,286
- The fuck's your problem?
- Nothing.

149
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,826
God. Leave me alone.

150
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,986
The fuck you do
to my little sister?

151
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,324
Nothing, man. I swear.

152
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,661
I didn't do anything.
What's your issue?

153
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,668
Then why the fuck's she laying
on the couch in the other room?

154
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,728
I did nothing to your sister, man.
Quit it, all right?

155
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,942
She just doesn't let me, man.

156
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,205
What a bitch, dude.

157
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,042
Hey, sis, why don't
you stop being such a prude

158
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,016
- and let this kid hit it?
- Jesse, you're an asshole.

159
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,109
So are you, dick.

160
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,752
So anyways, man,
where'd you get that shirt?

161
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,314
- Your sister.
- Oh yeah?

162
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,554
It's way better than
those lame-ass polo shirts

163
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,289
I always see you
trying to sport.

164
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,389
Yeah.

165
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,132
So anyways, you wanna
get out of here?

166
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,141
- And go where?
- To the IE, dude.

167
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,006
Sack up. Let's go.

168
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,773
The IE?

169
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,756
Hey, man, so when's the last time
you hit some puss, dude?

170
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,763
I don't know, man.
It's been awhile.

171
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,232
- Does porn count?
- Come on, guy. Are you serious?

172
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,792
- You know why, right?
- Why?

173
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,270
'Cause you do that whole
"relationship" thing.

174
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,136
You're, like, trying
to find the right chick,

175
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,143
take 'em out to dinner
and just "wifey" 'em, dude.

176
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,509
The bitches I hang out with,
straight up,

177
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,639
they come over,
they dumb you up

178
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,378
and they peace out, dude.
You don't gotta spend a cent on 'em.

179
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,716
That's... that's pretty cool, dude.
Pretty cool.

180
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,018
So speaking of that, I got two of them
on deck for this evening.

181
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,254
Are you... are you ready
to hang or what?

182
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,854
Oh, man, that... that sounds...
you know what?

183
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,297
It sounds super tempting,
but I don't know, man.

184
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,334
If your sister finds out,
I'm in deep shit.

185
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,267
Come on, guy. Are you
fucking serious, dude?

186
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,601
You really think I'd rat you out
like a little bitch?

187
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,334
You know who you're
hanging out with right now?

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,741
But don't get me wrong, man.
The second you do get some from her...

189
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,745
Oh, no no no, you don't
have to worry about that.

190
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,007
I mean,
your sister's so fucking...

191
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,515
So fucking what, dude?
Shut the fuck up.

192
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,108
She's my little sister.

193
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,619
My bad, man.
I got carried away.

194
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,282
All right, man.
Well, what about you simmer down

195
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,291
and fucking take a rip of this?

196
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,657
Are you serious?

197
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,992
What's the big deal?
Are you scared or something.

198
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,622
No, man, it's just that...

199
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,792
all right, fuck it, dude.

200
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,911
Hold up real quick.
Gotta handle something.

201
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,462
- What you got there?
- Got it.

202
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,396
All right.

203
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,537
The fuck were you doing, dude?

204
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,666
- You know that chick?
- No, just some bitch, man.

205
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,644
What was that?

206
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,579
- That's what it was... business.
- You're kidding, right, dude?

207
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,379
- You deal?
- Yeah, why?

208
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,147
- What's it to you?
- I don't know, man.

209
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,418
I just thought maybe you'd make enough
money off the motocross, that's all.

210
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,858
Yeah, I do, man.
I can't do that shit forever.

211
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,692
I like this shit.
This is where it's at, dude.

212
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,425
Don't gotta risk
getting all hurt,

213
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,296
fucked up, getting buckled.

214
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,959
Fuck all that noise, dude.

215
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,129
Besides, I do it
for this right here.

216
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,570
That's why I do it.

217
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,901
Wow.

218
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,069
Sick of all this whining
and shit, man.

219
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,306
It's party time.

220
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,449
- Here, man. Have a go.
- Oh no, dude.

221
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,285
That's cool, man. The weed's...
the weed's, like, whatever, dude.

222
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,882
But that... definitely...
no, you're out of your mind, dude.

223
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,428
I'm not messing
with that cocaine stuff.

224
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,759
Pfft. Whatever, man.

225
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,130
Dude, I can't even believe I'm in
this car with that shit in it right now.

226
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,395
You gonna be a bitch, dude,

227
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,835
or are you gonna sack up
and roll with the boys?

228
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,135
You know what?
Call those hos, dude.

229
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,505
See what's going on tonight.
I'm kinda down, actually.

230
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,271
Dude, I'm already on it.

231
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,370
You already knew I was
gonna change my mind.

232
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,778
That's funny.
Hold on, give me a second.

233
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,476
Oh fuck, dude.
It's your fucking sister.

234
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,246
- What a buzzkill, dude.
- Yeah.

235
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,650
It's like she's a psychic
or something, man.

236
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,689
Why she be calling right now?
What do I tell her?

237
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,224
Fucking voice-mail
that shit, dude.

238
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,817
We're rolling out, man.

239
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,490
Oh fuck, dude. I'm in so much
deep shit because of you.

240
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,362
Shut the fuck up.

241
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,390
Jesse's in the house!

242
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,598
250-foot jumps,

243
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,265
no shirt, smoking cigs, dude.

244
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,275
I like going big. That's how
I do this shit, you know?

245
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,040
- Dude, I got my boys coming. Hold on.
- What up, Jesse?

246
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,775
Here they are.
Yeah. What up, Jesse?

247
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,010
- Where you been, homey?
- Just cruising.

248
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,950
- Right on.
- Rudy, this is my boy Johnny.

249
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,885
- This is Rudy.
- What up, John? How you doing, bro?

250
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,049
- You having fun?
- This looks like a fun place.

251
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,490
Nice. Dude, hold...
hold on, dude. Hold on.

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,256
- What do you got? What is it?
- It's those fucking posers.

253
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,321
Those guys think
they fucking run this shit, dude.

254
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,161
- You take care of them.
- Hey, you motherfuckers.

255
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,133
The fuck you think
you're doing here, bro?

256
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,296
You heard me, man.
Get the fuck out of my house, bro.

257
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,341
Thought you could just
come and suck dudes off?

258
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,137
What the fuck's your deal, bro?

259
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,438
What did you say?

260
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,146
Yo, dude, fuck you.

261
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,647
Oh shit yeah.

262
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,484
Rough him up, Rudy.
You've got balls.

263
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,649
- You got it, man!
- Yeah yeah!

264
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,818
- Oh yeah, dude.
- Shit, he fucked 'em up.

265
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,656
Fucked 'em up big time.

266
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,095
Those fucking
dumb-ass posers, dude.

267
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,031
Fuck. They ain't
coming back here, bro.

268
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,899
I don't understand, man.
What did these guys do?

269
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,995
Dude, they're fucking nut riders.

270
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,267
They come in here,
acting like they ride dirt bikes...

271
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,969
they're lifted F1s...
thinking they're all sick.

272
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,602
All they do is
just ride our nuts

273
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,374
and we're
fucking sick of it, man.

274
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,108
I'll take a little bump.
Why not?

275
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,250
Yeah! Now I'm pumped up.

276
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,155
Dude, what sweet-ass hos
you guys wanna fuck tonight, man?

277
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,783
- I got 'em all.
- I'm fucking over it, man.

278
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,452
My dick's still sore
from last night.

279
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,088
If I fucked a chick
that was 200 lbs, man,

280
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,428
my dick'd be hurting
for a month, bro, but hey.

281
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,661
- Hey, fuck you, man.
- You want some?

282
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,135
Yeah.

283
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,662
My boy here, he's been on a dry spell,
if you know what I mean.

284
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,608
So you need to get him set up
with something, all right?

285
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,872
- Bro, I got you set up. Hey, Amber.
- Do you want any?

286
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,743
I don't really...

287
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,715
Dude, fucking hit it, you puss.

288
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,479
You're hanging out with us, man.

289
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,986
- Yeah.
- Whatever. Hey.

290
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,523
Take this,
take him to my room...

291
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,150
actually, not my room...
the next room to the right.

292
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,091
- Hey.
- Show this guy a good time, all right?

293
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,063
- Yeah yeah, I'm fine.
- You can't have a bad time with that.

294
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,655
Let's go party, bro.

295
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,667
- Fucking great.
- You're kinda cute.

296
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,566
- Really?
- Yeah.

297
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,662
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,798
Let's go.

299
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,365
Come on.

300
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,552
All right, watch me, okay?

301
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,858
All right, so go ahead
and put this on my back and sniff it.

302
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,629
- Okay.
- Ready?

303
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,014
It wasn't that bad, right?

304
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,218
- No, not really. No, it was fine.
- No. No.

305
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,228
Guess you'll never forget
the first time you did that, huh?

306
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,888
No.

307
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,022
You know weed's a natural
aphrodisiac, right?

308
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,591
- Is it? I should probably smoke.
- Mmm.

309
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,142
Breathe.

310
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,410
I think I'm ready.

311
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,672
Really?

312
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,245
Yeah, it's just that...
I mean, I know

313
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,717
it's been really bothering you

314
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,482
and I've made you wait so long.

315
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,284
I have an idea.

316
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,484
It actually might
help us out. Hold on.

317
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,657
What is it?

318
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,326
Just hold off a minute.

319
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,832
It's weed.

320
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,635
I heard it's like
an aphrodisiac.

321
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,575
Where did you get that?

322
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,210
Your brother gave it to me.

323
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,645
Babe, I smoke.

324
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,020
I do it every once
in a while just to relax.

325
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,485
Here, have some.

326
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,087
I don't want any.

327
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,291
Babe, don't act like
you've never done it.

328
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,358
I know! I just
don't want any, okay?

329
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,103
F...

330
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,503
fine. You know what?

331
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,872
All right, let's just fuck then.

332
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,240
What?

333
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,147
I... you know what? I...

334
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,547
I just... I gotta go.

335
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,356
The fuck, man?

336
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,736
Wait. Remind me why
I need a new car again?

337
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,710
I mean, my Nissan works
perfectly fine, man.

338
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,440
Man, you can't be
hanging out with me

339
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,141
in that piece
of shit Nissan, dude.

340
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,513
You're rocking with the best.
Don't you know?

341
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,348
- We gotta have image, style, you know?
- Come on.

342
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,521
So anyways, I heard about
what happened with my sister, dude.

343
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,562
What were you... what the fuck
were you thinking, man?

344
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,791
- Damn, she told you?
- Yeah.

345
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,698
Damn, I know, man.
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

346
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,702
Yeah, man, there's
way smoother ways

347
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,704
of fucking getting
yourself up in there, dude.

348
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,899
Expect you're gonna have
to try pretty hard,

349
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,771
especially since
she's a virgin and all.

350
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,073
Wait. She's a virgin, dude?

351
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,340
Yeah, she may not
look like she's a virgin,

352
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,405
but trust me, she is.

353
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,576
Um, damn. I really messed up.

354
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,450
That was coming in
way too hot, dude.

355
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,979
Hey, Jesse.
What's up, little pimp?

356
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,616
It's good, man.
It's been awhile.

357
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,627
Yeah, it has.
What you doing here?

358
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,925
Oh, just came over here.
This is my boy Johnny.

359
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,931
- He's looking for a new whip.
- Nice to meet you.

360
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,933
Johnny, Hector.
Pleasure meeting you.

361
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,265
So what are you looking for?
What are you in the market for?

362
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,100
Transportation?
You trying to get laid?

363
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,764
What are you trying to do here?

364
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,365
According to
my friend right here...

365
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,706
He needs to upgrade his image, man.
He's dorking out.

366
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,508
- Guess I'm trying to get laid.
- Yeah? Okay.

367
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,880
Well, right here is just
a little basic transportation

368
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,816
- for the nine-to-fivers.
- Yeah.

369
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,117
Let him know about
that stash you have.

370
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,124
Ahh, I got some
pimp shit over here.

371
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,591
I was holding it for my nephew,

372
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,355
but he's been
fucking up in college.

373
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,192
- This your boy, huh?
- Yeah, he's my guy.

374
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,824
- Dude, I'm co-signing it.
- This might be out of your league,

375
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,266
but if he's co-signing for you,
we'll work something out.

376
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,462
Come on, step over here.

377
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,472
Here you go.
This is next level shit.

378
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,008
Pimp pimp pimp and more pimp.

379
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,010
Actually, two steps
ahead of a pimp.

380
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,636
What did I tell you
about this guy?

381
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,149
Dude, this is...

382
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,911
No more dorking out
in the Nissan, dude.

383
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,351
If you wanna pull bitches,
you gotta upgrade.

384
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,548
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Watch your pussy ratio

385
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,285
go way up. You're gonna need to be
twins up in this motherfucker

386
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,917
much pussy as you're
gonna be getting.

387
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,518
- You got him, right?
- This is a sweet car.

388
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,857
Yeah, he's my guy.
I'm co-signing.

389
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,124
All right, let's handle this.

390
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,756
I got some other business
I gotta take care of.

391
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,596
- Yeah, buddy.
- You'll be rolling out in a minute.

392
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,431
Welcome to the big leagues.

393
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,054
Hey.

394
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,589
Look, I just want to apologize
about the other day, okay?

395
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,863
I mean, I don't know what...

396
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,962
I don't know what was
running through my head.

397
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,907
Babe, what is this?

398
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,911
I couldn't be picking up
my baby girl in a piece of shit Nissan.

399
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,676
- Babe, where did you get a new car?
- Don't worry about that, okay?

400
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,445
Look, let's just go for a ride.
You're gonna love this thing.

401
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,386
- Yeah, okay.
- Let's go.

402
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,987
Fuck yeah, dude.
This thing's sick.

403
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,426
- What I tell you?
- You like it?

404
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,987
Of course, man.
I helped you pick it out.

405
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,700
I thought it was
gonna be just us.

406
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,603
Baby, stop making it
such a big deal.

407
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,166
- It's not.
- Come on, dude,

408
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,678
fucking pin it.
Let's get out of here.

409
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,889
Johnny?

410
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,622
What are you doing, getting home
at 6:00 in the morning?

411
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,135
- Shit. It is?
- Yeah.

412
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,399
Hey, this is getting ridiculous.

413
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,171
Well, that you either
don't come home

414
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,473
or you come home at all hours
of the night like this.

415
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,742
I'm jus... I'm just.

416
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,181
- I'm very sorry.
- Come here.

417
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,343
Gimme those glasses.

418
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,815
- Look...
- What are you doing?

419
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,484
Are you doing anything illegal?

420
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,755
Illegal?

421
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,697
No, Mother, not illegal.

422
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,962
- "Mother." Okay.
- I'm... look,

423
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,027
I'm... I'm helping
my friend out with some...

424
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,369
he's just a motocross guy.

425
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,773
And he does these crazy jumps

426
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,710
and a lot of people come out
and cheer for him, whatever.

427
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,337
Anyways, besides that,

428
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,781
he... he... he...
he has these, um,

429
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,386
these events
that he's gotta do.

430
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,480
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, motocross stuff...

431
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,287
sponsorships and appearances.
And I just...

432
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,795
look, I just gotta be there to help him
and support the guy, okay?

433
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,922
- Do you understand me?
- All right.

434
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,489
You get me? All right?

435
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,331
- Mm-hmm.
- That's it.

436
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,972
Jonathan, here.

437
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,474
I will clean that up, okay?
Just...

438
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,668
I'm just glad you're home safe.

439
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,874
And you stink,
so just go on to bed.

440
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,797
Wow.

441
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,532
I didn't expect
to see you here.

442
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,733
I'm gonna be honest with you.

443
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,673
I don't know what to tell you.

444
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,438
I don't know what to say, okay?

445
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:44,209
You haven't called me
in two weeks.

446
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,012
I haven't even heard
from you in three.

447
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,747
You stood me up
for Valentine's Day.

448
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,016
Did you know that?

449
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,524
Look, I was out in the IE.

450
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,957
By the time I noticed,

451
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,291
it was... it was way
past time to get back.

452
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,921
I would've never made it back.

453
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,228
And you couldn't even
call and let me know.

454
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,765
I mean, you thought that
I would be okay with that?

455
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,836
No. No, not really.

456
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,939
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?

457
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,513
This. I...

458
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,552
ever since you started
hanging out with Jesse,

459
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,417
it's like you're pretending
to be someone that you're not.

460
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,787
- No, that's... that's not even true.
- Yes!

461
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,792
Dude, I know what happens
when he goes out!

462
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,885
I'm not stupid!

463
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,743
I can't do this.

464
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,803
You need to go.

465
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,817
- But I... I thought...
- No.

466
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,215
Oh fuck, man.

467
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,777
This was probably a bad idea.

468
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,382
I guess I'll just see you around.

469
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,257
Yeah, I guess. Whatever.

470
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,369
I ain't God. My boys can't make it
look like a goddamn Mercedes.

471
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,805
Man, call me back
when you get something real.

472
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,673
Fucking dick.
Ha. What up, Jesse?

473
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,179
What's good? Just came to do
that pick-up real quick.

474
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,078
- What's up, brother? Cool cool.
- What up?

475
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,276
Hey, you're the one with the Caprice.
How's she riding?

476
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,512
- Pfft! Like a fucking dream.
- Nice.

477
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,487
Fellas, can you
excuse us for a second?

478
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,113
We got some private shit
we gotta talk about.

479
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,817
Be two minutes.

480
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,620
So I'm a little concerned.

481
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,495
You've been outta
the game for a minute.

482
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,467
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, man, you know I got this shit.

483
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,733
What's up with your boys?
You usually handle this shit by yourself.

484
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,899
- I like it better that way.
- Yeah, I know,

485
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,068
but they're cool, man.
Don't worry about it.

486
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,635
They find out they're facing
five to ten if they get popped

487
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,011
and they turn rat, how cool
are they gonna be then?

488
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,482
Dude, I know these dudes.
They ain't gonna turn rat.

489
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,542
Yeah well, it's worth the money.

490
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,054
Hell yeah, five G's, right?

491
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,488
- Yeah.
- We get it next week, right?

492
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,856
Upon delivery.
Fool, don't come at me like that.

493
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,861
All right, man.

494
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,362
Yeah?

495
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,831
Hey, boss, Louis is
here to see you.

496
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,232
Good. He better have
some fucking good news too.

497
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,905
Okay.

498
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,404
All right, here's the keys...

499
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,377
and the address.
This one's down in Long Beach.

500
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,346
- All right, man, thanks.
- Okay, bro.

501
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,109
- Be seeing you real soon.
- All right.

502
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,278
All right, you fellas,
you have a good trip. Be safe.

503
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,551
I hope you've got
some good news, man.

504
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,150
Man, get the fuck out there.

505
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,562
Here, follow us.

506
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,030
Follow you for what, dude?
I thought I was coming with you guys.

507
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,397
Then how the fuck are
we gonna get back?

508
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,901
I'm leaving this piece
of shit there.

509
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,561
Dude, where are
we going anyways, guy?

510
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,901
- Long Beach.
- We're gonna go to Long Beach in this

511
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,340
piece of shit car. You know it's gonna
break down in the middle of the night,

512
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,038
- then we're fucked.
- It ain't breaking down.

513
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,081
We're going there,
we're getting paid,

514
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,083
and Hector told me
the drop-off spot.

515
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,415
- It's a house party.
- What if we're late for practice, dude?

516
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,785
You know David.
We were late one time before,

517
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,051
what did he do?
Fucking chewed you another ass.

518
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,559
You know what? Fuck David.
He ain't my fucking boss.

519
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,652
- Dude, I'm about to get paid.
- See you in Long Beach, bro.

520
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,892
All right? Killer, guy. Dork.

521
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,370
Don't worry, man. It's cool.

522
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,569
Motherfucker,
you wanna act like a bitch

523
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,269
and not give me
my motherfucking money?

524
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,009
You think I would let a bitch
like you get over on me?

525
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,981
Oh, come on, man.
What the fuck?

526
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,518
- Listen, man.
- You wanna act like a fucking bitch?

527
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,611
I'll treat you like a bitch,
like the bitch you are.

528
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,781
- Damn it!
- Motherfucker, two days.

529
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,724
Two fucking days, I gotta find
my fucking car around the corner?

530
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,262
Okay okay, man! I fucking
brought your shit, didn't I?

531
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,457
You're doing more of my motherfucking
dope than you're delivering.

532
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,831
You're lucky if I even
fuck with you again.

533
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,870
Get the fuck outta here,
you junkie.

534
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,269
Clean your shit up.

535
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,365
- I can fucking clean up, man.
- Get the fuck out of here.

536
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,264
- You Jesse?
- Yeah, it's good.

537
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,130
- Well, follow me.
- All right, dude.

538
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,033
I'll be right back.
You guys just chill.

539
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,578
Yeah.

540
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,345
- All right.
- Here.

541
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,252
- What's your name?
- Danielle.

542
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,723
Danielle.

543
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,226
Dude, if you guys ain't gonna
fucking smoke that shit,

544
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,387
- will you pass it already?
- Calm down, man.

545
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,057
I'm not trying to be rude. I'm trying
to introduce myself to the girl.

546
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,227
Give me a chance.

547
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,703
Where'd Hector get
this dude, man?

548
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,689
Oh, that's beautiful.

549
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,354
Sure is.

550
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,092
Yo, I heard you guys
got something for me.

551
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,998
Yeah, you know what?
Let's finish this

552
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,558
- then we'll take care of that business.
- All right, man.

553
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,764
Come on, let's just get this
and stack it over there.

554
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,874
Looks like we have
a lot in common.

555
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,881
Yeah, I guess so,

556
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,474
but you didn't even
give me your name, bad boy.

557
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,543
- Oh shit, I didn't?
- No.

558
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,019
Can you give it
to me right now?

559
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,057
Dude, hey, if you don't
give it to her, man,

560
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,286
I'm gonna take over
this shit. Sorry, buddy.

561
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,193
- What about me?
- You can join anytime.

562
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,227
Two broads is better
than one, buddy.

563
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,530
- Anyways... no no.
- Come on.

564
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,264
This guy... this guy...

565
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,737
Well, listen, my name is Johnny.
I'm Johnny.

566
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,072
- Johnny.
- Yeah.

567
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,271
It's a pleasure to meet you.

568
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,906
Oh, trust me,
the pleasure is all mine.

569
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,713
- I hope not.
- Fuck, man.

570
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,550
I have my moments.

571
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,955
So what's this moment?

572
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,263
Ah.

573
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,305
Ooh, that's some good shit.

574
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,967
Sit down, homes.

575
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,809
Now I don't usually ask
too many questions,

576
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,403
but when a guy comes
into my house,

577
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,210
that I've never seen before

578
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,513
and wants a piece, yo,

579
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,849
I get a little curious.

580
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,856
Yo, man, it's cool.
Hector sent us.

581
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,358
Have you ever used
one of these before?

582
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,223
What the fuck, dude?

583
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,195
What the fuck did you just say?

584
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,562
You think we're just gonna
hand you a loaded piece?

585
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,999
You know what?
Call Hector, find out if it's cool.

586
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,871
Sorry about that. It's cool.

587
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,373
Just... I guess we need it
for the next job.

588
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,965
Damn.

589
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,738
A job, man.

590
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,574
You know, just 'cause
you got a gun,

591
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,081
don't make you an armed-robbing
gangster, homes,

592
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,879
so you better be careful
fucking with Hector.

593
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,155
Hector okayed it.

594
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,094
Make sure the chamber's empty.

595
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,967
Damn. I guess you have
used one of those before.

596
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,306
Man. Look, lemme get
your number. Please?

597
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,403
You want my number?

598
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,107
- Yeah.
- Why?

599
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,480
So we can fucking
hang out and stuff.

600
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,081
You'd drive all the way out to fucking
Long Beach just to hang out with me?

601
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't be cute.
What's your problem?

602
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,755
I thought you liked me cute.

603
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,130
You like to tease, don't ya?

604
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,529
I don't tease.

605
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,236
Do you want my number or what?

606
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,272
Oh fuck yeah.
I want your number.

607
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,877
- See, that wasn't too hard.
- Whatever.

608
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,709
Yo, man, let's get the fuck outta here.
I'm done.

609
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,549
Dude, where the fuck
you been, man?

610
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,521
Hey, let's just chill
for a bit. Come on.

611
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,251
No, man, fuck that.
I'm leaving.

612
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,089
Look, let's just fucking chill
15 more minutes, all right?

613
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,356
- Come on, man.
- Fuck that. I got the keys, I'm leaving.

614
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,762
- If you wanna walk, that's fine with me.
- Let's go, dude.

615
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,563
- Fuck this, dude.
- You're outta here? Later, bro.

616
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,269
The fuck was that? Do you remember
what happened last time?

617
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,638
Dude, fuck off.
I was just flirting.

618
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,769
- Don't be stupid. They're Hector's guys.
- Whatever.

619
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,664
Yo, dude. I'm sorry
for being late, man.

620
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,362
You pull this shit again
and you're out of the fucking games.

621
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,870
- You hear me?
- Yeah, dude.

622
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,769
It's not gonna
happen again, all right?

623
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,673
- Thanks. Day just...
- Go get the rest of your gear on.

624
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,007
All right, man.

625
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,876
Yo, dude,

626
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,881
where's Jesse at, man?

627
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,281
He's chosen to be a fuck-up.

628
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,321
I'm glad to see you
back here though.

629
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,117
I got it, man.

630
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,351
At least you can keep
your priorities straight.

631
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,979
- Hey, sexy.
- What's up?

632
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,982
Yeah.

633
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,149
- Ready to hang out or what?
- Yeah, how are you?

634
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,193
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

635
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:12,335
I always wanted a boyfriend
with a nice car.

636
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,803
- Wait, what? Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

637
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,697
Park in the corner.

638
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,471
Is this close enough for you?

639
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,445
Because this is pretty fucking far
from the entrance of the mall.

640
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,482
It's good enough for me.

641
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,949
Is it good enough for you?

642
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,885
We'll just have to see then.

643
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,250
Yeah.

644
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,168
Did you come already?

645
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,741
Fuck, man.

646
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,547
Look, it usually takes me
a lot longer. I just...

647
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,778
Babe, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

648
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,786
So, you know,

649
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,125
I'm not doing this
with any other guy.

650
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,631
Cool. I mean, even if you were,

651
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,103
why does it even matter to me?

652
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,969
Because you're my boyfriend.

653
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,737
And it should matter,

654
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,971
because I don't
just fuck anybody.

655
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,981
Fuck. I'm sorry, okay?

656
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,246
Let's just get outta here.
I don't wanna be at this fucking mall.

657
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,286
- It sucks.
- Serious?

658
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,820
Where are you trying to go right now?

659
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,412
I don't know.

660
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,753
What's there to do
around your house?

661
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,056
Burbank? Honestly, I'm not trying
to go all the way to Burbank

662
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,959
and then bringing you
all the way back to Long Beach.

663
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,998
I don't think that's happening.

664
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:26,594
Okay, fine, then why don't I just
stay with you for a while?

665
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,831
I don't know. That's...
I don't think that's gonna work.

666
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,037
What?! You got another girlfriend
back in Burbank or something?

667
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,637
- No no no, stop being stupid.
- Don't want me to come stay with you?

668
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,876
Look, it's my mom.
She works long hours

669
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,180
and she just doesn't like me
bringing people home.

670
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,810
She's weird about things, okay?

671
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,582
- It's not gonna work.
- Whatever.

672
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,022
Just sneak me in through
the window or something.

673
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,890
I don't even care.
Your mom's not gonna know.

674
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,833
Fuck. You're trouble.
You know that?

675
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,451
Mom! Mom!

676
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,921
Mom!

677
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,656
It's okay. She's cool.

678
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,357
- Okay.
- Mom!

679
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,096
- What?
- Hey.

680
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,797
- Hi, baby.
- There's someone I'd like you to meet.

681
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,931
- This is Dani.
- Oh, okay. Hi.

682
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,168
My name's Julie.
It's nice to meet you.

683
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:43,145
Look, Dani and I are just gonna be
hanging out in my room for a bit, okay?

684
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,238
- Okay, that's fine.
- Yeah?

685
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,748
- Yeah.
- All right.

686
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,910
Oh, but can you guys
keep it down?

687
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,817
- I was gonna read my rosary.
- Yeah, of course.

688
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,753
- No problem.
- And it was nice to meet you.

689
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:56,259
- Uh-huh.
- See? That wasn't too bad.

690
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,361
So your mom is, like,
super Catholic, huh?

691
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,233
- She just goes to church a lot.
- I told you she wasn't gonna like me.

692
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,295
- She likes you.
- She thinks I'm a whore.

693
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,364
No, she doesn't.

694
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,808
Well, with you I can be.

695
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,277
- Wow, you...
- Shut up.

696
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,975
You heard your mother.
She doesn't want to hear a thing.

697
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,926
This is it, man.
I'm cutting you loose.

698
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,026
I'm getting Jesse back.
He's fucking good.

699
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,971
What, the young punk
with the fucking tattoos?

700
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,338
Come on, Hector.
He's a dead giveaway.

701
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,777
Listen, look at me. I'm clean.

702
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,077
Right? That kid's just
asking to be pulled over.

703
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,118
Now I know this town,
I know all the back ways.

704
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,120
- Jesse doesn't know shit.
- Are you fucking second-guessing me?

705
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,917
Like a I could give
a fuck what you think.

706
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,321
You remember what I told you?

707
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,484
You'd be lucky if you got
another chance again,

708
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,084
- so this is it.
- Don't worry.

709
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,188
I... I haven't been
doing so much shit...

710
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,892
- ...anymore.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

711
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,662
Why don't you just
go back to selling cars,

712
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,066
go back with your old lady, man?

713
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,832
You ain't cut out
for this driving shit.

714
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,100
I can't go back, man.
There's not enough money.

715
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,165
I mean, if I don't do this,

716
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,835
I'm gonna lose the house.

717
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,072
If I lose the house,
I'm gonna fucking lose her.

718
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,742
Yeah, well, this is it for you.

719
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,048
Be back at 8:00
and have my fucking money.

720
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,678
- All right.
- Hold on.

721
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,923
- What?
- Look, motherfucker.

722
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,550
- What the fuck?
- Have my fucking money.

723
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,857
Don't fuck with me.
I'll personally kill you myself.

724
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,693
Have my money, be back here by 8:00.
You got me, motherfucker?

725
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,529
- Okay, I got it. Fuck.
- Get the fuck outta here.

726
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,807
Fucking car business.

727
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,152
- Anybody order an Oldsmobile Cutlass?
- Ah!

728
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,493
- What's up, brother?
- What's up, bro?

729
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,056
- How you doing?
- All right. Fellas, just in time.

730
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,726
Sit down, have a drink with me.

731
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,201
Yeah, we'll do that.

732
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,300
Drinking that high-powered stuff.

733
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,069
That's how we do it here.

734
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,446
- Salud.
- Salud.

735
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,918
How'd it go, man?

736
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,217
Oh! The delivery went good.

737
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,087
Cool. Good to hear some fucking
good news for once.

738
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,289
Well, not all good news, homes.

739
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,782
Hey, Steph, how you been?

740
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,821
Good. So, um,

741
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,289
you're like best friends
with my brother now?

742
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,724
I mean, your brother's a cool guy.

743
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,125
He's just
showing me a few things.

744
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,925
He taught you how to ride.

745
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,660
You know, it'd be a great idea
if we all went down to the track

746
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,463
and I can actually
show you what I've learned.

747
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,095
- It'd be cool.
- Oh, uh, yeah.

748
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,665
Yeah, you know, it may be kind
of hard for me to get out there

749
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,836
with work and... you know.

750
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,340
So it was good
to see you, Johnny.

751
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,907
Yeah, you too.

752
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,259
Yo, what was your deal back there, man?
What's with the heat?

753
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,027
How about you don't
fucking worry about it?

754
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,831
We got places to be. Besides,
I thought you had a girl now anyways.

755
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,734
I do. It's fucking nothing, man.

756
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,571
Well, let's get
the fuck outta here.

757
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,075
So anyway, I spoke
with Mark and Gilbert.

758
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,413
They said you guys did
a real good job the other night,

759
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,510
real professional.
I appreciate that extra pick-up too.

760
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,077
Yeah, no problem, man.

761
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:23,616
Next time give 'em a heads up
so it can speed shit up a little bit.

762
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,355
Don't take this shit personal.

763
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,919
Gilbert and me go way back.

764
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,624
He's a real close homey of mine.

765
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,929
I'm gonna leave the distribution
of that up to you.

766
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,201
A'ight, cool.

767
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,606
Damn, dude.
Business is killing it, huh?

768
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,735
Hey, man,
shut the fuck up, dude.

769
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,279
Dude, what the fuck, man?

770
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,907
Pleasure doing business
with you, man. Till next time.

771
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,951
- Yeah, okay.
- See you later, man.

772
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,679
Hold up a second, fellas.

773
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,450
Gilbert did mention
one little problem.

774
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:56,924
His niece Danielle?
She ain't been home in about a week.

775
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,225
That shit just wouldn't look good
if one of my drivers

776
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,231
was nutting up my homeboy's niece,

777
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,631
especially her being 16 and all.

778
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,067
You guys don't know shit
about that, do you?

779
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,104
Oh hell no.

780
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,139
- Don't know nothing about that shit.
- Not me, man.

781
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,072
- No? All right.
- No.

782
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,201
See you next time.

783
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,904
Let's get outta here, guys.

784
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,648
And I moved myself exactly
under the center of the bed.

785
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,500
What the fuck, Johnny?

786
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,467
How old are you?

787
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,629
Don't fuck with me right now.
How old are you?

788
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,673
I'm fucking 17.

789
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,267
Fuck! Fucking Mark
and Gilbert spoke, man.

790
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,403
What the fuck?
How did you even find out?

791
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,141
Hector, the guy that owns
the dealership in the Valley.

792
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,046
Oh, fuck that guy.
He's an asshole.

793
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,314
Look, have you even talked to anybody
since you've been staying with me?

794
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,753
Babe, chill the fuck out, okay?

795
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,518
Look, you need to go. Now.

796
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,253
- What?! But you're my boyfriend. I...
- Boyfriend?

797
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,760
Get your fucking shit.
Let's go.

798
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,634
Still nothing, huh?

799
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,803
Well, boss, I've been
checking around.

800
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,870
Nothing.

801
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,940
See what I get for giving
that bitch-ass weasel another chance?

802
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,043
I should never have fucked
with him again.

803
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,486
Mr. Nice Guy, huh?
That's what I get.

804
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,046
So what you want me
to do, boss?

805
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,421
Hold on.

806
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,926
- This is Louis. You know what...
- Oh fuck.

807
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,295
Want me try to find him?

808
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,561
Piece of shit like that
can't get too far.

809
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,866
- Motherfucker.
- All right, here's what you do.

810
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,736
Go to his fucking house,

811
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,174
and as soon as that motherfucker
pulls up, you call me.

812
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,269
I got something for his ass.

813
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,314
Got it.

814
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,015
You've reached Jesse.
Leave a message.

815
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,213
Jesse, hey.

816
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,381
Soon as you get this
fucking message, call me.

817
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,017
I got another job for you.

818
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,615
- Let's fucking pin it, dude.
- What's your deal, dude? You good.

819
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,552
Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

820
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,351
Fuck. All right.

821
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,090
Dude, do you know
how fucking early it is

822
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,188
- to be doing that shit, dude?
- Seriously, man.

823
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,996
- Calm the fuck down.
- This is getting fucking ridiculous.

824
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:54,662
Get me out of this fucking...
get me out of the Valley, bro.

825
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,968
This is bullshit, dude.
I'm fucking over it, man.

826
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,302
You know what, dude?

827
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,366
- Both of you shut the fuck up.
- Fuck!

828
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,468
Johnny, just drive.

829
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,984
Is it here? I'll pull over.

830
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,801
Dude, I know one thing...

831
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,464
Jesse's gotta meet up
with this guy,

832
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,269
but this guy's fucking sketchy, dude.

833
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,814
What the fuck are you doing here?

834
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,285
I'm here to collect for Hector.

835
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,151
Just step away from the house, man.

836
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,212
You fucking punk.

837
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,985
Step away from the fucking house!

838
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,152
Ow! Fuck! Ah!

839
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,820
- Shit! Ah!
- Fucking whoa, Jesse!

840
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,591
- Jesse, what the fuck, bro?
- Jesse, what the fuck?!

841
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,427
Jesse, what the fuck, dude?

842
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,330
- Dude, get off him.
- Get the fuck off this guy.

843
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,767
- Junkie motherfucker.
- You punk, you want your fucking money?

844
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,862
- You motherfucker.
- Fuck you, fucktard.

845
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,839
- There!
- Let's go.

846
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,376
- You tell Hector to go fuck himself!
- Let's get out of here, bro.

847
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,241
We've got the...
dude, what the fuck, Jesse?

848
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,337
- Fuck this guy, man.
- Get off my fucking property,

849
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,974
- you motherfucking faggots!
- Fuck you, bitch.

850
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,979
Fuck, man.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

851
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,248
You get everything, bro?

852
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,619
You got it?

853
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,018
- Fuck you! Fucking motherfucker.
- Fuck you!

854
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,094
- Fucking count the money, dude.
- What the fuck was that about, man?

855
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,727
- Are you fucking crazy?
- It was business, dude.

856
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:36,863
- Fucking business.
- Business pistol-whipping someone?

857
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,498
Fucking just bitch-slap the guy.

858
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,236
You don't fucking pull heat, bro.

859
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,938
Dude, of course Hector
told you to do it, so you did, huh?

860
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,981
Hey, look, listen, motherfucker.

861
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,515
I ain't no one's bitch, dude.

862
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,710
I do Hector's jobs,
yeah, of course.

863
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,015
Only the ones I want to.

864
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,214
If I feel like pistol-whipping
his ass to get paid,

865
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,723
then that's what
the fuck I'm gonna do.

866
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,361
What the fuck?
What does she want, man?

867
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,455
- Yeah, what is it?
- Hey, I need you to come pick me up.

868
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,159
Are you serious? Why?

869
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,930
I got kicked out.
Can you come get me or what?

870
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,939
- I have no place to go.
- Oh man. Fuck.

871
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,908
Um, yeah yeah yeah, whatever.

872
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,569
I'll... yeah, I'll be right there,
all right?

873
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,909
- Fuck, man.
- Man, clip that bitch.

874
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,726
Jesse, it's David.

875
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,827
Yo, come in.

876
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,242
Somebody's having a party.

877
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,241
- Just hanging out, dude.
- What the fuck you doing, man?

878
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,715
I'm just chilling, dude.
Just hanging out.

879
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,917
You messed up, Jesse.

880
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,016
Yeah, I know, dude.
I fucked up big time.

881
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,925
Look, I want you to come back,

882
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,963
but I can't let you do this shit again.

883
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,828
Just blowing it, dude.

884
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:13,835
Look, whatever personal bullshit's
taking you away from your riding,

885
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,871
you've gotta get a handle on it now.

886
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,669
I want you to ride in the games.

887
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,673
- You do?
- Yeah, I do,

888
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,373
but all this better be over with.

889
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,607
Dude, I got a few things
I gotta handle

890
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,050
leading up to the 19th,

891
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,588
but I can assure you

892
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,589
that shit'll be handled by then.

893
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,023
I'll be there and I'm gonna
fucking kill it...

894
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,891
like I always do.
You know how I do it, man.

895
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,232
You gotta get that?

896
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,427
No, man, it's cool.

897
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,530
Look, I already gave you
a second chance.

898
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,336
Don't mess this one up.

899
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,640
I told you a long time ago
that I wasn't gonna give up on you.

900
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,146
Why not, dude?
Everyone else has.

901
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,307
Oh, cut the self-pity crap.

902
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,214
Let me tell you
something, Jesse...

903
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:06,381
when I watch you ride,
talent just pours off of you, man.

904
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,253
Kids would line this fucking street

905
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,451
and give you anything
for half of what you got.

906
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,724
But good comes easy for you.

907
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,662
And you and I both know
you can be great.

908
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,962
And that's the difference
between the rider who wins

909
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,763
and the rider who looks good
in practice

910
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,667
but can't perform when
it comes time to deliver.

911
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,798
Dude, you know me, dude.
I got this shit.

912
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:28,366
I told ya... I'm gonna have everything,
all this shit sorted out.

913
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,073
I'll be there and not only that,

914
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,581
I'm pretty confident
I'm gonna fucking win, dude.

915
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,345
All right.

916
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,909
Thanks, Dave.
I appreciate it, man.

917
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,581
- I needed that.
- Look, I'm not gonna give up on you,

918
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,215
because I know you can get there.

919
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,090
But you're gonna have to want this
more than anything,

920
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,992
especially more than this.

921
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,621
I do, man. I'm fucked.

922
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,165
Dude, this shit's fucked up.

923
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,634
Well, get it sorted out.

924
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,171
All right, dude.
Good looking out, man.

925
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:15,353
Fuck!

926
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,187
What up, guy?

927
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,953
It's good, man.
I brought you the shit

928
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,755
you're gonna need
when you take over my run.

929
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,659
Fuck, man, I was wondering
when you were coming.

930
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,756
I mean, my fucking money's running out.
My bills are stacking up.

931
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,858
It's like a fucking disaster.

932
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,165
Man, you're a dumb-ass.

933
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,797
I can't believe you've still got
that chick with you, man.

934
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,364
If you had any fucking idea,
you wouldn't even be talking.

935
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,239
So fucking worth it,
let me tell you.

936
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,211
Yeah, you're gonna think
it's worth it

937
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,214
when Mark and Gilbert
come and fuck you up.

938
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,682
Why the fuck would they even care
if they kicked her ass out?

939
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,548
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

940
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,780
And you're the fucking dumb-ass
that believed her.

941
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,982
Why wouldn't I, dude?
She wouldn't fucking lie.

942
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,888
Hey, first off, bitches lie.

943
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,927
The second shit goes down,

944
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,327
she's gonna throw you under the bus
to save her own cute little ass

945
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,332
and you're fucked.

946
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,062
Look, I'll just have her call
and tell her fucking peeps

947
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:34,967
that she's been staying at a friend's
house and that's fucking that.

948
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:38,132
- It ain't a big deal.
- Hey, you do what the fuck you gotta do.

949
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,300
Just don't let Hector find out,

950
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,140
especially if you're
taking over my run.

951
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,448
- All right.
- Look, bud, I gotta go.

952
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,144
You gotta break this shit up.

953
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,220
Rudy and David are waiting
for me at the track,

954
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,690
so I gotta get ready.

955
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,226
It's a fat-ass sack.

956
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,628
It's gonna be on
at the contest, dude.

957
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,637
- I'm winning my second medal.
- That's fucking sweet, dude.

958
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:12,141
Rudy's gonna be there. Your girl Steph
might make an appearance.

959
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,505
Fuck. Steph?

960
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,238
Yeah, Steph.
Can you handle that?

961
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:19,110
- Gonna get all emotional on me?
- Yeah, dude, it's whatever.

962
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,309
- I'll be there.
- Get it fucking handled, dude.

963
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,875
I don't wanna have to come
back here and beat your ass.

964
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,100
Get your head more
over the bars on that one.

965
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:25,645
Sweet!

966
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,498
A man came up with an invention

967
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,902
to make himself a lot of money.

968
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,669
He was a mean old man
and cared about no one

969
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,938
but himself.

970
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,613
This is Rod.
He goes to school...

971
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,987
Jonathan, can I speak to you?

972
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,056
- What is it?
- I need to speak to you alone.

973
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,491
Now.

974
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:23,102
- Hey, you.
- Oh my goodness.

975
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,408
That girl is not welcome
in my house anymore.

976
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,672
- Why? She's my...
- Oh, your girlfriend?

977
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,805
Johnny, I don't understand
what you're doing anymore.

978
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,611
You come home
at all hours of the night.

979
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,083
Sometimes you don't
come home at all.

980
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,017
I don't see you going
to school anymore.

981
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,146
And now you're hanging around
with a piece of trash girl?

982
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,249
Mom, you really act like you
don't want me to enjoy my life.

983
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,191
Of course I do, baby,

984
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,752
but not by behaving
irresponsibly and...

985
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,764
and stealing.

986
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,356
Stealing? I'm not stealing!

987
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,561
- Then where are you getting that car?
- Shh.

988
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,228
I don't give a shit.
Your phone?

989
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,933
Your clothes? Huh?

990
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,771
Look, I pay for things, okay?

991
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,039
I don't see you paying
for anything around here.

992
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,876
Maybe the things you want.

993
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,550
Johnny, look,

994
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,415
if you wanna
continue to live here,

995
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,681
there's gotta be
some changes. All right?

996
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,746
Starting with her.

997
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,953
What are you trying to say?

998
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,325
- You're kicking us out?
- It's girls like that

999
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,956
the reason your father's gone.
Don't you understand?

1000
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,692
Ohh.

1001
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,723
I love you.

1002
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:24,992
I love you too.

1003
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,120
All right.

1004
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,133
Come on.

1005
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,840
Yeah?

1006
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,883
Hey, it's Johnny.
Listen, Jesse wanted me

1007
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,781
to finish this deal,
so that's why I'm calling.

1008
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,786
Okay, all right.
You got the address?

1009
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,322
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right, well, my homey wants

1010
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,052
- a beach ball too. 250, right?
- Gonna be 300.

1011
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,991
- 300?
- I can't cut you down, man. I'm sorry.

1012
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,756
It's like a fucking
transportation fee.

1013
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,559
Transportation fee? Bullshit.

1014
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,691
Fucking 300
or no fucking deal, man.

1015
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,200
I don't have time for this shit.

1016
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,100
Whatever, man.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

1017
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,365
All right, I'll be there in 20.

1018
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,802
Fuck.

1019
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,407
Ahh.

1020
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,795
Here we are
in Temecula, California.

1021
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,898
72º outside
and we've got the world's

1022
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,001
greatest riders here
at the Pala Raceway,

1023
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,512
home of the 12th Annual
FMX Games.

1024
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,549
Look at that. Nice.

1025
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,348
Looks like the riders
brought their "A" game today.

1026
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,514
Let's see who's
gonna win this contest.

1027
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:46,228
- How are you feeling, bro?
- Yo, I'm good, man. I'm good.

1028
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,236
All right, listen.
Don't let this crowd

1029
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,737
get in your head
and fuck with you.

1030
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,739
Just stay loose and relaxed
and have fun out there, man.

1031
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:54,173
- Give 'em a show.
- I got this. Don't worry about it, dude.

1032
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:55,710
All right.

1033
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,302
How's the bike? Good?

1034
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,941
It's all good, man.
I'm killing it.

1035
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,430
Wow.

1036
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,898
Big double nac
for Ronny Faisst!

1037
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,959
Very impressive.
What a great run.

1038
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,904
That's gonna get him
into the next qualifying round.

1039
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,638
- Up next, Jesse Meyers.
- Whoo!

1040
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,414
And a near-perfect ride
from Jesse Meyers.

1041
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,729
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

1042
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,027
Hurry the fuck up.
Let's go, let's go.

1043
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,295
- What's up, man?
- Let's go.

1044
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,962
- We're wasting time, man.
- Go out, make a right right here.

1045
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,370
There's a fucking...
a fucking cop over there, man.

1046
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,305
Just fucking make a right
right here, dog.

1047
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:42,106
Sick, man!
Way to bring it, bro.

1048
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,152
Dude, thanks.
What did I tell you?

1049
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,018
- That was awesome. Nice run. Nice run.
- Told you I had that shit.

1050
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,990
- Nice run.
- Yeah. You killed it out there, man.

1051
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,651
- You looked so good.
- Thanks, pal.

1052
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,321
Hey, Rudy, you're on deck, bro.
Pull your balls out, man.

1053
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,023
You've got some shoes
to fill after that run.

1054
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,532
- Dude, I got this all day.
- Do it!

1055
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,001
Hey, dude, I couldn't say
with David being around here,

1056
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,970
but this phone's been
ringing off the hook, man.

1057
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:04,630
Hector?

1058
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,239
- Fuck, man.
- That's your deal now, buddy.

1059
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,108
I gotta ride.
I got a contest to win.

1060
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,705
All right, man.
Get some, pussy.

1061
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,181
Got this all day, guy.

1062
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,811
Go, Rudy! The best, baby!

1063
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,879
And up next, a rider
that's in it to win it...

1064
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,947
Rudy Bronson.

1065
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,668
Fuck!

1066
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,705
All right, so what's up?
Let's do this.

1067
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,641
- You got that white horse?
- You got that fucking money?

1068
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,144
I got that fucking money, man.

1069
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,579
- Calm your ass down.
- Let me see the money. Shit.

1070
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,887
Now where's the fucking rest,
you shiesty-ass bitch?

1071
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,979
What?! Hey,
do you know what, man?

1072
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:55,990
- Fuck your fake ass, motherfucker.
- No, fuck you, man.

1073
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,582
- Fuck me?
- This is a fucking waste of time.

1074
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,321
- Fuck me? Fuck you.
- I'm taking your ass home.

1075
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,919
- Fake-ass motherfucker.
- Fuck, man.

1076
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,896
Hey, homey, make a quick
left right here, dog.

1077
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,900
Fucking shit, man.
He's gonna burn me.

1078
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,004
- Yo.
- Where the fuck are you at?

1079
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:16,067
Yo, man, I'm at the fucking
contest right now, dude.

1080
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,772
I can have Johnny take care of it.

1081
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,280
Fuck Johnny! He's banging
my homeboy's niece.

1082
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,681
Think I'm gonna send
some little fucking shit like that

1083
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,015
- to do a big job like this?
- He can do it, man.

1084
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,520
- Fuck!
- Don't ever put

1085
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,580
your personal bullshit
over me, you hear me?

1086
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,591
You be available
when I fucking need you.

1087
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,559
You remember that?
It's part of the job.

1088
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,563
- Fuck, man.
- If you send Johnny to do this job,

1089
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,758
I'll have Gilbert and Mark
waiting for him there.

1090
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,130
- You got it?
- You know what?

1091
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,226
You know what,
you motherfucker?

1092
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,897
I'm on my way. Fuck you.

1093
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,541
So I got some more forks
coming on Tuesday

1094
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,377
to try out, yeah.

1095
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:56,350
Is that Jesse?
What the fuck's he doing?

1096
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,477
Hey, Jesse!

1097
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,756
- Make a right up here, man.
- Yeah, that's exactly

1098
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,319
what I'm gonna do
right now, all right?

1099
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:09,830
Right here.

1100
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,128
Yeah yeah yeah,
hold your fucking horses.

1101
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,396
- Jesse, where are you going?
- That's none of your business.

1102
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:19,270
- Jesse, please don't do this again.
- Look, I said...

1103
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,002
you wouldn't
understand, anyways.

1104
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,941
Jesse, please.
You're my brother and I love you.

1105
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,502
Please don't do this again.

1106
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,344
- I said just let me go.
- Jesse, no.

1107
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,647
No, please don't do this.

1108
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,091
Fuck. It's the cops, man.

1109
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,752
- Dude, pull over!
- They'll get us, man.

1110
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,489
- Pull over, pull over, pull over!
- Shit! Fuck!

1111
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,724
- Pull over! Pull over!
- Man!

1112
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,700
- Fuck you, man! Motherfucker!
- Maury, get out!

1113
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,533
- Fucking motherfuckers! Fuck, man!
- Stop, you're under arrest!

1114
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,232
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- Get out of the car!

1115
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,241
- Put your hands up! Get out of the car.
- All right! Fuck!

1116
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,072
What the fuck I tell you?
Get out of the car!

1117
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,442
- David, where is Meyers?
- I know, I know.

1118
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:00,107
- He'll be here.
- I have finalists that need to run.

1119
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,742
- If he's not here, he's out.
- Just give us five minutes.

1120
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,446
This is not his first rodeo.
If he's not here, he's gone.

1121
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,614
- Look, don't disqualify him.
- Meyers is out.

1122
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,521
Come on, don't do this to us!

1123
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,059
Fuck!

1124
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,924
- Fuck, man.
- Come on, man, take it easy.

1125
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,021
You got knives
or weapons on you?

1126
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,963
- No, I got no guns on me.
- Got any drugs?

1127
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,898
- No.
- Anything you wanna tell me about?

1128
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,061
- No, sir.
- Nothing, man. Just driving through,

1129
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,866
fucking trying to get home.
I'm fucking clean.

1130
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,032
- That ain't my shit, all right?
- It was in your pocket.

1131
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,735
- Any marijuana?
- No, I'm clean man.

1132
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,710
What's this?
Look at this. What's that?

1133
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,370
It is what it is. Fuck, man.

1134
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,677
Got a pipe over there.

1135
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,411
- This isn't your neighborhood.
- Relax, all right?

1136
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,214
- I'm not from the area.
- Fuck.

1137
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,118
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1138
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,282
You always walk around
with $100 bills in your wallet?

1139
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,088
- Gotta buy things.
- Would that test positive for cocaine

1140
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,128
- if we put a test on that?
- Let's go.

1141
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,847
- It's about time.
- Dude, don't give me no shit.

1142
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,509
I just came from Riverside.

1143
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,486
All right, man.

1144
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,615
Come check this shit out.

1145
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,526
You mind if I give it a taste?

1146
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,428
No, go for it.

1147
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,570
So what you do
out there in Riverside?

1148
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,731
I ride motocross.

1149
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,434
Mmm.

1150
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,500
I think we all good here, dog.

1151
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:40,147
Wanna do me a favor
and grab that other box?

1152
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,843
Sure, man. Why not?

1153
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,986
- Nice doing business with you.
- All right, man.

1154
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,942
Come on, man.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1155
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,778
Gimme that.

1156
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,617
- Fuck you, man.
- Fuck you, man!

1157
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,655
- Fuck you.
- Look at me. Look at me.

1158
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,992
Payback's a bitch, huh?

1159
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:51,113
I know, I know.

1160
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,165
Take off your shoes.

1161
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,771
All right, go through.

1162
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,994
Hello?

1163
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:43,657
Dani. Look, I'm so glad you...

1164
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,292
- you stuck around.
- Johnny, where have you been?

1165
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,735
Look, look,
just calm down, okay?

1166
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,865
- Look, as soon as...
- Jesse's dead.

1167
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,671
He left in the middle
of the fucking games.

1168
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,644
What?

1169
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,203
Johnny...

1170
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,884
"Mom, you were right all along."

1171
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,251
I don't know how I got
caught up in this mess.

1172
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,490
I should've listened to you.

1173
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,429
I'm sorry.

1174
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,800
I'm sorry for everything.

1175
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,101
I just hope you can forgive me.

1176
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:06,171
I love you and I know
I don't deserve you as a mother.

1177
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,775
I know I've made mistakes,
but I swear to you

1178
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,210
I will change.

1179
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,918
"I have changed."

1180
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,480
"I will try my hardest to be the man"

1181
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,950
you want me to be.

1182
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,247
I love you.

1183
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,379
"Your son Johnny."

1184
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,802
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello?

1185
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,672
What?

1186
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,473
What do you mean, "What?"

1187
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,706
What the hell, Dani?
I've been calling you for weeks.

1188
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,510
Why haven't you answered
any of my phone calls?

1189
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,245
You left me in a fucking
motel room, Johnny.

1190
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,980
Mark had to come pick me up.

1191
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,248
What else was I supposed to do?

1192
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,449
I've been fucking locked up.

1193
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:25,687
Listen, Johnny, I don't wanna
be with you anymore.

1194
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,658
I got your room ready.

1195
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,859
Thanks, Mom.

1196
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,334
I never wanna
go back there again.

1197
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:15,137
I ever catch you dealing
or doing drugs again,

1198
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,973
I'll call the police myself.

1199
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,918
I'm just glad
to be out, you know?

1200
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,681
Good.

1201
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,284
I love you.

1202
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,289
Love you too, Mom.

1203
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,988
Hey, Johnny.
Here's some legit paper for you, baby.

1204
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,253
Hey, Bill. What's up, man?

1205
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,420
- Thanks.
- Doing all right.

1206
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,794
- Is it good?
- Yeah, totally, man.

1207
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,423
- Thank you.
- You got it, man.

1208
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,558
Hey, Bill, listen,

1209
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,694
I just wanted
to take the opportunity

1210
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,362
to actually thank you
for letting me come back.

1211
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:53,532
I mean, you really don't know
how much this means to me.

1212
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,542
It's all cool, man.
Just remember,

1213
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,078
we all make mistakes, man.
I've done it. I've screwed up.

1214
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,273
Get over it.
Move on, all right?

1215
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:01,940
- Cool.
- Cool.

1216
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,747
Gain some weight, man.
You're looking skinny. It's a gym.

1217
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,515
So I hope you liked it

1218
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,056
and I hope we get
to see you soon.

1219
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,614
Thank you so much.
That was great.

1220
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:14,453
- Hey, Steph.
- Oh! Hey.

1221
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,793
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you or anything.

1222
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,457
No, Bill told me you were back.

1223
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,899
Yeah, I've been back
a few days.

1224
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,029
Look, I was... I was just wondering
if you had a few minutes to talk.

1225
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,936
I mean, it's been awhile,
you know?

1226
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,474
Catching up and stuff.

1227
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,533
Um, yeah.

1228
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,636
I... I can take five now.

1229
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:32,839
Awesome. Cool.

1230
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,277
Look, I just wanna tell you

1231
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,819
I'm really sorry about Jesse.

1232
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,684
It's not your fault.

1233
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,213
I mean, he knew what
he was getting into.

1234
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:50,758
So when did you get back?

1235
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,561
A couple days ago.

1236
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:56,035
You're really lucky.
You know that?

1237
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,436
Yeah, I know.
A second chance, right?

1238
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,030
Yeah.

1239
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,235
I hope you don't
fuck this one up.

1240
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,279
Look, I'm trying
really hard not to.

1241
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,609
- Really.
- Good.

1242
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:10,082
Well, I guess I'll see you around.

1243
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,676
Listen, I was just
wondering if maybe

1244
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:15,416
you would be down to hang out
sometime outside of work,

1245
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,321
like the good old times,

1246
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,189
like you, me, Jes... Rudy.

1247
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:23,629
- And we can hit the track...
- I kind of started dating someone.

1248
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,689
No, I just meant as friends.

1249
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:29,731
- If that's cool.
- I'd like that.

1250
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,736
All right. Good.

1251
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,968
Okay. See you around.

1252
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:37,011
Okay.
