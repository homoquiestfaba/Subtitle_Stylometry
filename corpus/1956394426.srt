1
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,921
In 1945, America's greatest
generation came back from war.

2
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,646
The flags of freedom fly
over Europe.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,960
Nazi Germany had been defeated...

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,085
and three months later, Imperial
Japan surrendered, as well.

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,647
And there's jubilation around
this Earth.

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,156
Men returned home.

7
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:04,428
Among them, some of baseball's
most beloved names.

8
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:07,449
Musial... DiMaggio... Williams.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,004
Life in the United States
could return to normal.

10
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,752
I don't know what's the guy's
name on first base!

11
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,217
What's on second?
Who's on second?

12
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:14,666
Who's on first?
I don't know.

13
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:15,699
Third base.

14
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,088
And baseball was proof positive
that democracy was real.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,650
A baseball box score, after all,
is a democratic thing.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,531
It doesn't say how big you are,
or what religion you follow.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,365
It does not know how you voted,
or the color of your skin.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,001
It simply states what kind of
ballplayer you were...

19
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,631
on any particular day.

20
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:33,924
And he did it.
It's a home run.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,923
They knew he'd do it.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,323
African Americans had served
their country gallantly.

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,434
But they returned home from
fighting the war...

24
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,699
to free the world from tyranny...

25
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,705
only to find racism, segregation
and Jim Crow law...

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,639
still waiting at home.

27
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,047
Segregation was the law and
custom of the land...

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,443
and no group was more scrupulous
in its observance of custom...

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,170
than organized baseball.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,860
There was a long road ahead.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,887
If African Americans dreamed of
playing baseball...

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,690
it was not for the New York
Yankees...

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,658
but for teams like the Kansas
City Monarchs...

34
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,591
of the Negro Leagues, where the
barnstorming style of play...

35
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,736
stood in contrast to the Majors.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,330
In 1946, there were sixteen
Major League baseball teams...

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,882
with a total of 400 players
on their rosters.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,691
Every one of the 400 players
were white.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,529
But when opening day came in 1947,
that number dropped to 399...

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,603
and one man stood apart.

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,529
Gentlemen, I have a plan.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,611
Plan's good, Mr. Rickey.
You always have one.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,445
My wife says I'm too old.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,045
That my health's not up to it.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,121
My son says, uh, everybody in...

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,290
everybody in baseball is gonna
be against me.

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,522
But I'm gonna do it.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,602
Do what, Mr. Rickey?

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,808
I'm gonna bring a Negro
ballplayer...

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,451
to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,125
With all due respect, sir,
have you lost your mind?

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,406
Think... think about...

53
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,086
think about the abuse...

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,527
that you are gonna take from
the newspapers...

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,524
let alone how this is gonna
play out in Flatbush!

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,809
Please, Mr. Rickey.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,963
Sit down, Harold.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,491
No law against it, Clyde.

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,965
No.

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,801
No, but there's a code.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,414
You break a law and get away
with it...

62
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,576
some people think you're smart.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,401
You break an unwritten law...

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,001
you'll be an outcast.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,201
Mm-hm.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,364
So be it.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,446
New York's full of Negro
baseball fans.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,121
Dollars aren't black and white,
they're green.

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,726
Every dollar's green.

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,248
I don't know who he is...

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,883
or where he is...

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,643
but he's coming.

73
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,811
Hey, runner!

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,169
Where'd you learn to move like
that? At a dime-a-dance night?

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,850
Stand still!

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,411
There you are!

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,881
Ball!

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,484
Safe!

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,526
Catcher!

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,569
When you gonna start throwing
for real?

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,006
You talking to me?

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,162
You got a rag arm, catcher.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,530
Steal home. You'll find out
what kind of arm I got.

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,444
Okay.

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,766
I'm coming.

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,764
Where's your shortstop from?

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,081
California.

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,402
Sure got a mouth on him.

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,407
Safe!

90
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,769
Discussions concerning Japan's
offer of surrender.

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,406
Washington, London, Moscow,
and Chungking...

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,608
now framing their decision.

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,480
When this decision will be
communicated to Tokyo...

94
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,393
via the government's...

95
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:10,647
Fill her up?
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,451
You boys heading out...
Uh, Chicago.

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,409
Chicago, huh?
Heh.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,283
You boys get around.
Yeah, we sure do.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,563
Hey. Hey, you, where you going?
To the toilet.

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,410
Hell, come on, boy.
You know you can't go in there.

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,123
Them Cokes are a nickel.

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,645
Take that hose out of the tank.

103
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,484
Robinson.
What?

104
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,969
I said, take it out.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,685
We'll get our 99 gallons of gas
someplace else.

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,525
All right, then.
Go on.

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,450
Go on!
Use it.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,484
Roy Campanella.

109
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,168
Hell of a player. He's too sweet.
They'd eat him alive.

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,810
All right.

111
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,282
Oh, sorry.
Oh, wait. Sorry.

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,723
Satchel Paige, then.
He's too old.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,362
We need a player with a future,
not a past.

114
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,925
Here.

115
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,809
Jack Roosevelt Robinson.

116
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,286
Four-sport college man, out
of UCLA.

117
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,645
That means he's played with
white boys.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,724
Playing for the Kansas City
Monarchs.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,607
Twenty-six years old.
He's batting .350. Three-fifty.

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,363
Methodist.

121
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,851
Commissioned Army officer.

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,371
He was court-martialed.

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,090
He's a troublemaker.

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,567
Well, he argues with umpires.

125
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,524
A quick temper is his reputation.

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,600
Well, what was he court-martialed
for?

127
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,009
Wouldn't sit in the back of a
military bus. Fort Hood, Texas.

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,084
Driver asked him to, uh, move
back.

129
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,768
MPs had to take him off.

130
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,846
There, you see?

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,163
I see he resents segregation.

132
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,688
If he were white, we'd call
that spirit.

133
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,691
Robinson's a Methodist.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,763
I'm a Methodist.
God's a Methodist.

135
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,089
We can't go wrong.
Find him.

136
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,404
Bring him here.

137
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,600
How are you, fellas? I'm looking
for your, uh, shortstop.

138
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,121
You Jackie Robinson?

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,484
Who are you?

140
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,926
Mr. Rickey...

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,250
what's this about?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,606
This is about baseball, Jackie.

143
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,684
I see you starting in spring
with our affiliate, in Montreal.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,968
If you make it there...

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,688
we'll try you down here...

146
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,241
with the Dodgers.

147
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,966
With the white Brooklyn Dodgers.

148
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,523
Hmm.

149
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,490
I'll pay you $600 a month.

150
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,762
And a $3500 bonus when you
sign the contract.

151
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,967
That agreeable?

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,444
Yes, that's fine, but...
There's one condition.

153
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,574
I know you can hit behind
the runner.

154
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:16,327
That you can read a pitch.
One question is...

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,528
can you control your temper?

156
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,487
My temper?

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,967
Yes, your temper!
What are you, deaf?

158
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,726
A black man in white baseball, heh,
can you imagine the reaction?

159
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,008
The vitriol?

160
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,567
Dodgers check into a hotel,
a, uh, a decent, good hotel.

161
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,041
You're worn out from the road.

162
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,926
Some clerk won't give you the
pen to sign in, with.

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
"We got no room for you, boy.

164
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,833
Not even down in the coal bin,
where you belong."

165
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:53,811
Team stops at a restaurant.
Waiter won't take your order.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,891
"Didn't you see the sign on
the door? No niggers allowed."

167
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,840
What are you gonna do then?
Fight him? Ruin all my plans?

168
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,040
Answer me, you black son of
a bitch!

169
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,605
You want a player who doesn't
have the guts to fight back?

170
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,725
No.

171
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,605
No.

172
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,088
I want a player who's got the
guts not to fight back.

173
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,767
People aren't gonna like this.

174
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,040
They're gonna do anything to
get you to react.

175
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,125
Echo a curse with a curse and,
uh, they'll hear only yours.

176
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,571
Follow a blow with a blow and
they'll say...

177
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,113
"The Negro lost his temper."

178
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:46,169
That "The Negro does not belong."

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,641
Your enemy will be out in
force...

180
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,247
and you cannot meet him on his
own low ground.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,964
We win with hitting, running,
fielding. Only that.

182
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,330
We win if the world is convinced
of two things:

183
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,204
That you are a fine gentleman
and a great baseball player.

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,527
Like our Savior, you...

185
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,162
you gotta have the guts...

186
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,649
to turn the other cheek.

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,409
Can you do it?

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,561
You give me a uniform...

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,208
you give me a, uh, number
on my back...

190
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,362
and I'll give you the guts.

191
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Hello?

192
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,011
Rae...

193
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,005
Jack.

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm in Brooklyn.

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,841
Brooklyn?
For what?

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,729
Uh...

197
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,804
I don't want to say on the
phone.

198
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,682
In fact, I'm not supposed to
tell anyone.

199
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,328
What's going on?

200
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,504
Aren't you supposed to be
playing in Chicago?

201
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,683
We've been tested, you and me.

202
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,687
We've done everything the
right way. We have.

203
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,121
Me trying to make money, you
finishing school.

204
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,724
We don't owe the world a thing.

205
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,611
Only each other.

206
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,566
Jack, what are you talking about?
What is going on? What happened?

207
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,410
Will you marry me, Rae?

208
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,925
Absolutely.

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,931
Yes!
Yes.

210
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,607
When?

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,524
Um...

212
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,762
How about right now?

213
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,048
Did my mom look happy?

214
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,407
Yes.
You know your mother loves me.

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,282
Did my gram look happy?

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,210
Yes.

217
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,211
My brother look happy?

218
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,328
Heh, your brother?
Ha, ha.

219
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,492
Everyone looked happy.

220
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:41,805
I've never seen so many
happy-looking people.

221
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,688
Did Jack Robinson look happy?

222
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,689
What if I can't make you happy?

223
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,650
Too late.

224
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,809
You already do.

225
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,488
It's you and me, Rae.

226
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,889
Ooh, ha, ha.

227
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,042
Um...

228
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,767
Till the wheels fall off.
Hmm.

229
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,164
Oh, Jack, the world is waiting
for us.

230
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,767
The world can wait one more
night.

231
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,840
Are you coming, Mrs. Robinson?

232
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,691
I'd follow you anywhere,
Mr. Robinson.

233
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,805
Okay.

234
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,124
Okay.

235
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,041
Flight to Pensacola leaves in
an hour.

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,521
Flight to Pensacola leaves in
an hour.

237
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,955
"Flight to Pensacola leaves
in an hour.

238
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:55,821
Flight to Pensacola leaves
in an hour."

239
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,045
Are you okay?

240
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,682
I've just never seen one, before.

241
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,405
Oh.

242
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,690
Yeah, we're not in Pasadena
anymore.

243
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,885
Rae?

244
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,407
Rae?

245
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,730
Rae!

246
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,642
Oh, boy.

247
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,761
We have to lighten the plane.

248
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,046
There's some bad weather east
of here.

249
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,931
A heavy plane is dangerous.

250
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,568
So someone'll have to cancel.

251
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,770
Look, I'm with the Brooklyn
Dodger organization.

252
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,331
I have to get down to Daytona.

253
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,086
I'm supposed to report to spring
training in the morning.

254
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,707
We'll do our best to get you
there by tomorrow afternoon...

255
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,357
but it might be the day after.

256
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,287
Jack.
Right this way.

257
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,766
You gave away our seats?

258
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,887
You get us back on that plane.

259
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,201
You get us back on that plane
right now.

260
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,923
Do you wanna call the sheriff...

261
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,964
or should I?

262
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,771
Watch your step.

263
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,287
Oop, there he is.
There's my boy.

264
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,125
Folks, stand back, we'll get
the bags out.

265
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,647
Jackie Robinson.

266
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,845
Wendell Smith.

267
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,046
Pittsburgh Courier.

268
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,926
A reporter?

269
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,846
Mr. Rickey sent me to meet you.
I'm gonna be your Boswell.

270
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,041
My who?

271
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,486
Your chronicler.

272
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,848
Your advance man.

273
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,487
Hell, even your chauffeur.

274
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,971
Mrs. Robinson.

275
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,525
It's Rachel.

276
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,327
Man, you two looked wiped out.

277
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,521
You got a car?

278
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,444
Uh-huh.

279
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,750
Brooklyn plays downtown.

280
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:40,188
Montreal, just a few blocks
from here.

281
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,888
Joe and Duff Harris live here.

282
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,525
Now, he gets out the Negro
vote.

283
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,751
He does a lot of good for
colored people.

284
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,161
Now, Mr. Rickey set it up
himself.

285
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,720
"If the Robinsons can't stay
at the hotels...

286
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,963
they should stay someplace that
represents something."

287
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,010
You'll stay here all but a few
days at the end of the week...

288
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,215
when the Dodger organization
goes to Sanford.

289
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,081
It's about 45 minutes away.

290
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,646
You'll stay here though, Rachel.

291
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,844
This'll be your home when Jackie
has to travel.

292
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,609
Uh, where are the other wives
staying?

293
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,001
Welcome to Daytona Beach.

294
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,041
There are no other wives.
You must be Mr. Jackie Robinson.

295
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,329
You're the only one that Mr. Rickey
allowed to spring training.

296
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,446
Thank you.
Mm-hm. After you.

297
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,601
Come on, now, skip.

298
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,768
All right, here we go, boys!

299
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
I got it! I got it!
I got it!

300
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,971
That was a pretty big hop,
there.

301
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,360
You got the hop!

302
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,286
Spring training. It's where we
work out our differences.

303
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,645
All right!

304
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,963
You boys continue to pretend
you're ballplayers.

305
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,648
Morning, Leo.
Good morning, Mr. Rickey.

306
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,766
How are they doing?

307
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,641
They're rusty, but we'll have them
oiled up in no time, ready to go.

308
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,290
Oop.

309
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,049
First day of spring training.

310
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,851
Pittsburgh Courier readers need
to know how it feels.

311
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,011
It's okay.

312
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,082
That's not exactly a headline.

313
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,370
It's all I got.

314
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,488
Look, Jack, right now, it's just
me asking you.

315
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,923
But when you step out on that
field...

316
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:53,240
there's gonna be The New York
Times, and the Sporting News.

317
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,176
You should think about it.

318
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:55,654
If they ask something, I'll
answer it.

319
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,124
That's okay.
Well, here's one for you...

320
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,886
what if one of these white
pitchers throws at you?

321
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,408
Look, they're gonna try to get
under your skin.

322
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:08,413
You need to be ready.

323
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,329
Listen, listen.

324
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,091
You know...

325
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,083
you know how when you're at
the plate...

326
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,686
you want to see the ball come
in slow?

327
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,004
You want to see these questions
come in slow too.

328
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,726
Hey, Jackie. Jackie, you think you
can make it with these white boys?

329
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,966
Uh, I had no problems with white
men in the service, or at UCLA.

330
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,044
What you gonna do if one of these
pitchers throws at your head?

331
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,725
Yeah, Jack.

332
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,884
I'll duck.
Heh, that's a good one.

333
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,042
Hey, Jack, what's your natural
position?

334
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,203
I've been playing shortstop.

335
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,931
Are you after Pee Wee Reese's
job?

336
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,724
Uh...

337
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,723
Reese plays for Brooklyn.

338
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,969
I'm still trying to make
Montreal.

339
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,647
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Jack, is this about politics?

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,046
It's about getting paid.

341
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,242
"About getting paid."

342
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,833
Did you hear what he said?
"It's about getting paid."

343
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:07,526
He's gotta be kidding.

344
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,808
Yeah.
Good luck, Hop.

345
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,130
Clay, Jackie Robinson.

346
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,420
Jackie, I'd like you to meet
Clay Hopper.

347
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,338
Manager of the Montreal Royals.

348
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,481
Jack.
They call me Hop.

349
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,769
Now, we ain't doing much today.

350
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,776
Just tossing the ball around,
hitting a few.

351
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,002
You can try tossing with
those fellows, over there.

352
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,123
Jorgensen, come here!

353
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,764
You're not playing him at
shortstop, huh, Clay?

354
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,994
Oh, he's getting by on a quick
release.

355
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:50,081
His arm's too weak for short.
I think second base is his spot.

356
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,411
I agree.

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,725
Clay...

358
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,123
I need you to get the other
players to...

359
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,536
act like gentlemen around him.

360
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,049
Treat him like they would any
other teammate.

361
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,087
Be natural, work together in
harmony.

362
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,246
Got the double up!

363
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,131
That was practically superhuman.

364
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,169
Heh, "superhuman"?

365
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,402
I mean, don't get carried away,
Mr. Rickey.

366
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,562
That's still a nigger out there.

367
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,167
Come on in now. Grab a bat.
Who's up?

368
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,608
Nice job, boys!

369
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,922
Clay, I realize that attitude is
part of your cultural heritage.

370
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,688
That you practically nursed race
prejudice at your mother's breast...

371
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,888
so, I'll let that go.

372
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,330
But I will tell you this:

373
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,168
You will either manage Robinson
fairly and correctly...

374
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,649
or you, sir, can be unemployed.

375
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,170
Yes, sir.

376
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,366
Let's go!
Come on, guys, let's go!

377
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,921
Way to turn two, Jackie.

378
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,208
Well, well, lookie here.

379
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,409
Jackie, I'm Mr. Brock.

380
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,648
Welcome to Sanford, Florida.

381
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,643
Thank you for having us.

382
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,202
The day belongs to decent-minded
people.

383
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Wendell, always good to see you.
You as well.

384
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,086
Yeah, well, the wife's inside
cooking.

385
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,210
You know what she asked me?
She asked me this morning:

386
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,041
What do you serve when a hero's
coming to dinner?

387
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,409
Heh, um, Mr. Brock, I'm just
a ballplayer.

388
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,721
Oh, no, no.

389
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,131
You tell that to all the little
colored boys playing baseball...

390
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,960
in Florida, today.

391
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,288
To them, you a hero.

392
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,288
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you, sir.

393
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,086
Here you go.

394
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Scorecards, get your scorecards
here!

395
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,765
Scorecards here!
Get your scorecards here!

396
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,804
Ed!
You stay where I can see you.

397
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,611
Mom, I'm ten years old!

398
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,450
Come on.

399
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,449
Welcome to the inner-league game
between the Brooklyn Dodgers...

400
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,211
and their Minor League affiliate,
the Montreal Royals.

401
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,683
There you go, Pee Wee!

402
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,808
Now coming to bat for the Royals...

403
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,122
number nine, Jackie Robinson.

404
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,485
Get out of here!

405
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,961
Stand up tall, Jackie!

406
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,561
Get out, nigger!

407
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,326
Jack's got a thick skin.
He'll be okay.

408
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,610
Well, how about you?

409
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,005
I better get one in a hurry, heh.

410
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,605
Have pride, Jackie!

411
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,084
Look. Look, there he is, black
as the ace of spades!

412
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,642
Hey, nigger boy! What are you
doing playing baseball?

413
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
Hit a home run, Jackie!

414
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Please, God, let Jackie show
them what we can do.

415
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,488
Please.
All right, now, Jackie Robinson!

416
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,766
Let's go, Jackie!

417
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,090
Come on, Jackie!

418
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,367
Ball!

419
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,203
They're giving you a chance!
Do something about it!

420
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
Let's go, Higbe!
Shut him down right here!

421
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,290
Ball!

422
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,962
Durocher, tell him to throw
some strikes!

423
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,241
Let him hit!

424
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,890
Come on now, come on now!

425
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,367
He ain't scared of you, Higbe!

426
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,890
You show him, Jackie!

427
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,161
Ball!

428
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,969
Come on, rook. Ain't you gonna
swing at something?

429
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,901
Higbe, just settle down.

430
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:47,139
Let's get the ball over the
plate now, all right?

431
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,404
Ball four!

432
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,126
You stink, Higbe!

433
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,251
It's just a walk.

434
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,688
Ha, ha, who can blame them?

435
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,487
Good job, Jackie.

436
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,610
Now coming to bat for the Royals...

437
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,603
number 3, Spider Jorgensen.

438
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,321
Let's go, Hig!

439
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,289
All right, Higbe, shake it off,
there.

440
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,807
We got this, boy, we got this
boy. Let's do it.

441
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,284
Well, throw it over there!
What are you waiting for?

442
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,724
Safe!

443
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,970
Come on, pop up, Jack.

444
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,810
Ball one!

445
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,844
Yeah, Jackie!

446
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,809
Heads up, Jack.
Get the sign.

447
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,960
He's going!
Runner! Runner!

448
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,721
Come on, move!
Get back!

449
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,604
Get him, Schultzy!
Get him, Schultzy!

450
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,045
Here we go!

451
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,009
What are you gonna do now?
Come on!

452
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,321
Outside!
Outside!

453
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,211
On your horse, Bragan!
On your horse! Outside!

454
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,045
Now!
Go, Stanky! Go, Stank!

455
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,727
Ooh.

456
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,561
Hey, all right!

457
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,248
Hey! Don't you know nothing?

458
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,882
You're supposed to get back
when I step off.

459
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,290
What are you doing?

460
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,016
You can dance with him later!
Focus on the plate!

461
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:52,004
Come on, now! Work the plate!
Work the plate!

462
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,337
Come on, Higbe, don't worry
about the runner.

463
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:04,276
Get this guy at the plate.

464
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,206
Timeout!

465
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,486
That's a balk.

466
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,808
Runner, take home.

467
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,245
Son of a bitch.

468
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,288
He didn't come to play, he
came to kill.

469
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,442
What happened?
I don't understand.

470
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,730
The pitcher dropped the ball. It's
a ball. Therefore, Jackie scores.

471
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,484
But he didn't do anything.

472
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,850
Oh, Mama, yes, he did.
He discombobulated the man.

473
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,361
He... what?

474
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,809
Phew.

475
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,401
I hope Jackie's sleeping
all right.

476
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,690
Chasing baseballs in the sun
all day? Put me in my grave.

477
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,931
How they treating him out there?
Well, they treat him okay.

478
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,248
As far as I can see.

479
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,408
Well, you can find good people
every place.

480
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,127
Even here in Sanford.

481
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,685
Is he in there?

482
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,647
Who is it that you're looking
for?

483
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,450
The Nigra ballplayer.

484
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,329
Is he in there?

485
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,648
He's asleep right now.

486
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,170
Maybe you wanna come back in
the morning.

487
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,767
No, I ain't coming back.

488
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,401
Other fellas is coming.

489
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,807
And they ain't happy that he's
staying here in Sanford...

490
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,930
playing ball with white boys.

491
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,290
Now, let me tell you something, sir.
No, you listen to me, young man.

492
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,802
You best just skedaddle on out
of here.

493
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,602
Because if they get here and
he's still here...

494
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,644
there's gonna be trouble.

495
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,930
You understand?

496
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,805
Trouble.

497
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,926
Trouble, trouble, trouble.

498
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,291
Mr. Brock.

499
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,648
May I please use your telephone?

500
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,287
Wake him up and get him out
of there.

501
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,168
Put him in the car and, uh, start
driving to Daytona Beach. Now.

502
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,846
Uh, oh, and, uh, Wendell...

503
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,843
under no circumstances are
you to tell him...

504
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,004
what this is about, I, uh...

505
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,766
I don't want him getting it
in his head...

506
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,962
to stay there and fight.

507
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,171
Where's he at?

508
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,085
I don't know.
Think he's getting another one.

509
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,721
Hey, Jim. You escorting that
boy out of town?

510
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,001
Hey, look at this.

511
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,764
What's that?

512
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,731
What's he want?

513
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,684
Hey, hey, hey!

514
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,170
What the hell, Wendell?

515
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,766
A man came by while you was
asleep.

516
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,490
He said more men were coming.

517
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,165
It might have been those fellas.

518
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,011
Mr. Rickey said to get you to
Daytona Beach, ASAP.

519
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,530
Why didn't you say so?

520
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,475
Mr. Rickey was afraid that
you wouldn't wanna leave.

521
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:06,388
You'd want to stay there
and fight.

522
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,766
Man, what in the hell are you
laughing at?

523
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,123
I thought you woke me cause...
cause I was cut from the team.

524
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,401
You got a strange sense of
humor, man.

525
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,407
Two, two, two! Take him back.
Throw him out now!

526
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,847
Safe!

527
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,363
You're too fast for them, Jackie!

528
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,602
All right, way to go.
Way to go, boy!

529
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,444
Get that nigger off the field!

530
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,331
Come on, Spider, bring him in.
Let's go.

531
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,486
We got him.

532
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,209
Four! Four! Four!

533
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,249
No cut!
He's running through!

534
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,325
Safe!

535
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,006
Get off the field.

536
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,568
What?
Get off the field. Now.

537
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,604
Why?

538
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,527
Because it's against the law,
that's why.

539
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:33,562
No nigger's gonna play with
white boys.

540
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,961
Now you get off the field, or
go to jail.

541
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,691
You use that thing, you better
hit me between the eyes.

542
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,121
Hey, hold on, now.
What'd he do wrong?

543
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,409
We ain't having no Nigroes mix
with white boys in this town.

544
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,087
Y'all ain't up-states now.
They gotta keep separate.

545
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,648
The Brooklyn Dodgers ain't
changing our way of living.

546
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,771
Where y'all from, anyhow?

547
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,490
I'm from Greenwood, Mississippi.

548
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,883
Hell, boy, you ought to know
better.

549
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,323
Now, you tell your nigra
I said to git.

550
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,321
What did you do?

551
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,805
Oh, I said:

552
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,204
"Okay, skipper. I'm a-gitting,
I'm a-gitting, I'm a-gitting.

553
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,283
You don't want no trouble."
You did not!

554
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,841
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
Ha, ha.

555
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,322
Then I took a cold shower.

556
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,528
We lost two to one.

557
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,921
Aw.

558
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,050
Okay, skipper.
I'm a-gitting, I'm a-gitting.

559
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,004
Oh, no, you not getting away
from me.

560
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,205
Jack.

561
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,166
Get back, Rae.

562
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,251
I want you to know something.

563
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,926
Yeah, what's that?

564
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,490
I want you to know I'm pulling
for you to make good.

565
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,007
A lot of folks around here, feel
the same way.

566
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,483
If a man's got the goods, he
deserves a fair chance, that's all.

567
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,205
Ma'am.

568
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,400
You wanted to see me, Mr. Rickey?

569
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,084
Bermuda grass grows so well,
here.

570
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,562
I wish we could get it to grow
like this, up in Brooklyn.

571
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,725
Yeah.

572
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,363
I like the way it smells when
they mow it.

573
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,205
Yeah... me, too.

574
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,050
Jackie...

575
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,041
it is my pleasure...

576
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,410
to tell you that you have earned
a place with the Montreal Royals.

577
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,568
When they head north on Tuesday
for opening day with Jersey City...

578
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,922
you'll be on the train.

579
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,851
I won't let you down.

580
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,411
Yeah, I know you won't.

581
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,606
If you don't mind, I'd like to
go tell my wife.

582
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,366
Ah, you give her my regards.

583
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,607
Mr. Rickey?

584
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,289
Why are you doing this?

585
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,127
I'm in the baseball business.

586
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,289
With you and the other Negro players
I hope to bring up next year...

587
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,967
I can put together a team that
can win the World Series.

588
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,124
And the World Series means money.

589
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,007
You believe that, don't you?

590
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,081
I don't think it matters what
I believe.

591
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,930
Only what I do.

592
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,651
Agreed.

593
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,084
Therefore...

594
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,483
I want you to worry those pitchers
till they come apart.

595
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,642
Run as you see fit.

596
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,371
Sometimes you'll get caught,
but that doesn't matter.

597
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,648
Ty Cobb got caught plenty.

598
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,485
You just run those bases like
the devil himself.

599
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,849
Put the natural fear of God
in them.

600
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,525
Yes, sir.

601
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,244
Train for Atlanta and Points
North, now boarding.

602
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,404
Train for Atlanta and Points
North, now boarding.

603
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,011
There he is.

604
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,050
All aboard!

605
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,444
Young man.

606
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,602
I can still hear him.

607
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,247
I can still hear him!

608
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,245
Play ball!

609
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,603
And now the lineup of the
visiting Montreal Royals.

610
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,287
Batting first, playing center
field, Marv Rackley.

611
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,445
Batting second, playing second
base, Jackie Robinson.

612
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,087
Batting third, playing left
field, George Shuba.

613
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,765
Hey, you okay?

614
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,410
I think I might be sick.

615
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,686
Excuse me, Wendell.

616
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,323
Popcorn!
Get your popcorn!

617
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,930
You all right, honey?

618
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,649
I'm sick.

619
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,769
Don't know why.

620
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,367
Mm, thank you.

621
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,327
When did you have your monthly
last?

622
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,763
It may be that you're pregnant.

623
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,320
Now batting for Montreal,
number 9, Jackie Robinson.

624
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,005
Come on, Jack!

625
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,845
Come on, Jackie.

626
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,606
Come on, batter.
Put it here!

627
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,522
Whoo!

628
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,882
He may be superhuman after all.

629
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,689
Way to go.

630
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,283
Oh, Jack.

631
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,445
Yeah.

632
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,443
My daddy left.

633
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,284
He left us flat...

634
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,203
in Cairo, Georgia.

635
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,562
I was only six months older
than you are now.

636
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,969
I don't remember him.

637
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,762
Nothing good, nothing bad.

638
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,810
Nothing.

639
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,927
You will remember me.

640
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,851
I'm gonna be here with you
till the day I die.

641
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,161
Yeah.

642
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,448
Hello, Leo.

643
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,649
What are you doing?

644
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,290
I'm bowling.

645
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,169
No, I'm snowshoeing in the Alps.

646
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,005
I'm trying to sleep, Mr. Rickey.
It's still dark out.

647
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,006
Another spring training is
upon us, Leo. In Panama.

648
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,042
I need to know your attitude
towards Jackie Robinson.

649
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,168
I don't got an attitude toward
him.

650
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,653
Eight times in the Bible...

651
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:02,710
we're told to love our neighbor
as ourself.

652
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,886
It's one of God's most repeated
commands.

653
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,805
Well, I don't know much about
the Bible.

654
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,247
But I didn't go to school just
to eat my lunch, either.

655
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,528
I'll play an elephant if he
can help us win...

656
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,649
and to make room for him, I'll
send my own brother home...

657
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:16,727
if he's not as good.

658
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:18,170
Oh, what are you gonna do
with me?

659
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,718
We're playing for money here,
Mr. Rickey.

660
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,636
Winning is the only thing
that matters.

661
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:23,170
Is he a nice guy?

662
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,483
Well, if by nice you mean
soft, no.

663
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,722
No, not particularly.

664
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,725
Good, he can't afford to be.

665
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,850
Nice guys finish last.
And what about nice girls?

666
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,162
So, you have no objection
to him?

667
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,527
None whatsoever.
Can I go back to sleep now?

668
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,806
Yes.
All right.

669
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,564
Oh, and Leo?
What?

670
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,085
The Bible has a thing or two
to say about adultery, as well.

671
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,723
I'm sure it's got a lot to say
about a lot. Good night.

672
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,767
What am I gonna do with you?

673
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,604
I thought you knew.

674
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,686
You gonna take care of your mama?

675
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,691
No?
You better.

676
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,405
Mm-hm.

677
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,403
You gonna take care of my mama?

678
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,766
Come here, baby.

679
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,127
There you go.
Come here, baby, I got you.

680
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,889
Promise me you'll write?

681
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,081
When have I ever not written?

682
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,290
I want you to know I'm there for
you, even if it's words on paper.

683
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,724
Rae...

684
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,924
you're in my heart.

685
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,968
You're getting close now, and
the closer you get...

686
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:46,010
the worse they'll be.

687
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,087
Don't let them get to you.

688
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,450
I won't.

689
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,367
God built me to last.

690
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,401
Hmm.

691
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,081
I'll see you in Brooklyn in
eight weeks, oh.

692
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,167
It might be Montreal.

693
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,168
It's gonna be Brooklyn.

694
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,410
I know it is.

695
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,937
Why do you think Rickey's got
us playing spring games...

696
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,406
here in Panama, huh?

697
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,482
He wants us to get used to
Negro crowds.

698
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,648
He wants more of them than
there are of us.

699
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,633
And he's hoping it'll make us
more comfortable...

700
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,263
being around Robinson.

701
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:41,924
Ahem.
All right, ahem.

702
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,567
Listen up.
This is what I got.

703
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,202
"We, the undersigned Brooklyn
Dodgers, will not play ball...

704
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,289
on the same field as Jackie
Robinson."

705
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,601
That's right.

706
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,210
Kirby Higbe.

707
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,848
I'll sign that.
All right.

708
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,002
Brooklyn Dodger Declaration
of Independence.

709
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,366
That's right.

710
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,090
Give me that.

711
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,605
Y'all sure about this?
You wanna play ball with a nigger?

712
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,120
Skip's got you out in left?

713
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,964
Yeah, for today.
Hey, Robinson.

714
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,970
What do you want me to do
with this?

715
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,040
Well, you play first base.

716
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,768
Coach, I never played first base
in my life.

717
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,564
Well, it's like this:

718
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,369
Brooklyn's got a solid second
baseman.

719
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,437
We got Pee Wee Reese over
at short.

720
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,569
But first base is up for grabs.

721
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,924
Come on in.

722
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,851
Hey, Stank.
What's going on?

723
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,520
Well, we got a petition going
on, Stank.

724
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,610
Keep Robinson in Montreal.
Where he belongs.

725
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,082
Can't sign now, boys.

726
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,249
I'm indisposed.

727
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,768
How about I just catch up with
you later?

728
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,571
That ball's coming in a lot
faster, Jack.

729
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,728
The angle's a lot different
in second.

730
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,164
Take all the time in the world
on second. You're getting it.

731
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,569
That's like you have a suitcase
on your hand there, Jack.

732
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,287
The new glove, it's the big one
there, Jack. You'll get used to it.

733
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,844
Give me the pen.

734
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,765
You know Mr. Rickey wants you
to play conspicuous baseball.

735
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,763
To be so good that the Dodgers
demand to have you on their team.

736
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,247
That's it.

737
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,808
So, I thought about it for a
while...

738
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,004
and I looked up "conspicuous"
in the dictionary.

739
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,489
It means "to attract notice,
or attention."

740
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,010
Conspicuous.

741
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,875
Look, it's like this...

742
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,975
I got a wife, I got a baby, and
I got no money.

743
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,845
So, I don't wanna step in
anything, so...

744
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,731
you want to skip me on this
one, Dix. I'm not interested.

745
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,008
What if they put him at shortstop?
Exactly.

746
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,326
That's right, Pee Wee.

747
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,608
Well, I figure if he's man
enough to take my job...

748
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,000
he deserves it.

749
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,531
Oh, the hell he does.

750
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,535
He does not have the ice water
in his veins...

751
00:51:49,696 --> 00:51:51,337
to play big league baseball,
and you know that.

752
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:53,442
That's right.
So let him show what he's got.

753
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,171
Robinson can either play, or
he can't.

754
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,209
It'll all take care of itself.

755
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,771
It's gonna cut you off.

756
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,888
So, right foot on the bag, when
it comes.

757
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,203
There you go. That's nice, Jackie.
Nice, Jackie. Pop that foot off.

758
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,728
When that ball comes, that right
foot, just pop that.

759
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,042
Pop that... don't leave that
foot on there.

760
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,690
Yes, Mr. Rickey.

761
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,923
Have our friends in the press
gone to sleep, yet?

762
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,767
We are the only people awake on
this entire isthmus, Mr. Rickey.

763
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,163
About this, uh, petition, Leo.

764
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,926
I think a deliberate violation
of the law deserves...

765
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,370
a little show of force.

766
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,531
I leave it to you, Leo.

767
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,487
Good night.

768
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,049
Good night, Mr. Rickey.

769
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,293
So, what are we doing here in
the middle of the night?

770
00:52:54,393 --> 00:52:57,190
Leo said to get everybody
together.

771
00:52:57,325 --> 00:52:58,848
I was sleeping good.
Down in the kitchen?

772
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,606
Wake up now, ladies!
Wake up!

773
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,323
It has come to my attention
that some of you fellas...

774
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:12,490
don't wanna play with Robinson.

775
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,900
That you've even got a petition
you've drawn up...

776
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:21,072
and you're all going to sign.

777
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,802
Well boys, you know what you
can do with your petition.

778
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,450
You can wipe your asses with it.

779
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,807
Oh, come on, Leo.
Come on, what?

780
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,760
Ballplayers gotta live together,
shower together.

781
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,968
It ain't fair to force him on
us, like this.

782
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,804
Besides, I got a hardware store
back home...

783
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,949
Screw your hardware store, Dix...

784
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,604
and if you don't like it, screw
you.

785
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,763
Mr. Rickey will be happy to make
other arrangements for you.

786
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,646
Now, I don't care if he is
yellow, or black...

787
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,802
or has stripes, like a zebra.

788
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,748
If Robinson can help us win...

789
00:54:00,848 --> 00:54:03,196
and everything I have seen
says he can...

790
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,687
then he is gonna play on this
ball club!

791
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,971
Like it, lump it, make your minds
up to it, because he's coming!

792
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,370
And think about this, when your
heads hit the pillows, tonight.

793
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,890
He's only the first, boys.

794
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,770
Only the first.

795
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,880
There are more coming right
behind him every day...

796
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,362
and they have got talent, and
they wanna play.

797
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,044
Oh, yeah, they are gonna come
scratching and diving.

798
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,409
So, I would forget your petition
and worry about the field...

799
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,891
because unless you fellas pay
a little more attention...

800
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:48,482
to your work, they're gonna run
you right out of the ball park!

801
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,601
Bragan, most of your teammates
have already, uh...

802
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,048
recanted on this petition
nonsense.

803
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,488
Are you really here to tell me you
don't wanna play with Robinson?

804
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,130
Yes, sir.

805
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,721
My friends back in Birmingham
would never forgive me.

806
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,201
Well, what about your friends
in Brooklyn?

807
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,249
I don't know.

808
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,409
Hmm.

809
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,201
Then I will accommodate you.

810
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,173
As long as you give me your
word...

811
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,618
that you will do your very best
for this team...

812
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,728
until I can work out a trade.

813
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,083
Do you think I would quit on
anyone? I don't quit, sir.

814
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,891
Only on yourself, apparently.

815
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,689
Taxi!

816
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,683
Hey, Jack.

817
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,609
You again.

818
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,851
That's right.
Me again.

819
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,881
There something wrong with
that, Jack?

820
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,084
Where's the car?

821
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,289
Right this way.

822
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,124
They can't keep you in Montreal
for long.

823
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,048
After these exhibition games,
they're gonna have to bring you up.

824
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,485
You don't have two words to
rub together, do you?

825
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,167
You ever wonder why I sit down
behind third base...

826
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,482
with my typewriter on my knees?

827
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,642
Does that ever cross your mind?

828
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,049
It's because Negro reporters
aren't allowed in the press box.

829
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,005
So, guess what?

830
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,593
You, Mr. Robinson, are not the
only one...

831
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:09,013
with something at stake, here.

832
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,490
I apologize.

833
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,690
You've been there for me through
this...

834
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,969
more than anyone besides Rae
and Mr. Rickey.

835
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,209
But I guess that's what
bothers me.

836
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,962
How do you mean?

837
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,362
I don't like needing someone
to be there for me.

838
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,886
I don't like needing anyone
for anything.

839
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,849
I never have.

840
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,324
You a hard case, Jack Robinson.

841
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,130
Hey.

842
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,880
Is it okay if I keep driving you,
or should I let you get out...

843
00:57:56,011 --> 00:57:58,080
so you can walk?

844
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,081
Hmm?

845
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,161
"Branch Rickey cannot afford
to upset team chemistry...

846
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,129
so the only thing keeping Robinson
off the Dodgers now, plainly...

847
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,089
is the attitude of the players.

848
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,130
If it softens at the sight of
Jackie's skills...

849
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,251
he'll join the club sometime
between April 10th and April 15th.

850
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,570
Otherwise, Robinson will spend
the year back in Montreal."

851
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,248
Oh, for the love of Pete.

852
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,008
He batted .625 in the exhibition
games against them.

853
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,288
Us, them... against us!

854
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,290
Judas Priest!

855
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,131
Jane Ann, are you out there?

856
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,211
Branch Rickey.

857
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,210
Yes, uh, this is him.

858
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,681
The commissioner of what?

859
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,045
Uh, yes, put him through.

860
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,646
The Commissioner of Baseball.

861
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,802
Branch.
How are you?

862
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,247
Good, Happy.
What can I do for you?

863
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,484
How'd you feel about losing
Durocher for the year, Branch?

864
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,499
Uh, I'm sorry, Happy, heh, I
thought you said...

865
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,930
lose Durocher for a year.

866
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:23,364
I got a notice today...

867
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,481
from the Catholic Youth Organization
vowing a ban on baseball...

868
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,644
if Durocher wasn't punished for
his moral looseness.

869
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,286
You're joking.

870
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,061
I wish I were, Branch...

871
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:39,359
but it's this business of this
actress, out in California.

872
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,767
She's recently divorced, and
Durocher's the cause.

873
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,491
They say they may even be
illegally married.

874
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,524
Now, I know you're joking.

875
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,011
I'm not.

876
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,005
Thing of it is, Branch, uh...

877
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,041
this CYO, they buy a lot of seats,
they draw a lot of water...

878
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,043
and I can't afford to ruffle
their feathers.

879
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,523
I'm sorry, am I mixing my
metaphors there?

880
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,685
Happy, you know very well my
organization is entering a tempest.

881
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,241
I need Durocher at the helm.

882
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,801
He's the only man that can
handle this much trouble.

883
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,240
In fact, he loves it.

884
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,209
You're cutting off my right
hand!

885
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,449
I have no choice.

886
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,126
I'm gonna sit your manager,
Branch.

887
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,171
Leo Durocher is suspended from
baseball for a year.

888
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,527
Happy, you can't do this, you
son of a bitch!

889
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:41,000
As the search continues...

890
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,998
to replace Leo Durocher, I have
it on good authority...

891
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,138
that former Yankee manager
Joe McCarthy...

892
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:47,563
has turned down the request...

893
01:00:47,598 --> 01:00:50,410
of Branch Rickey to take the
reins of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

894
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,767
He is not the only man to say no.

895
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,804
And so, with the 1947 season
about to begin...

896
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,089
the Dodgers are still without
a manager.

897
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,410
Now we present once again Mary...

898
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,605
Hello?

899
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,764
Mr. Robinson? This is Jane Ann,
in Mr. Rickey's office.

900
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,763
He needs to see you right away.

901
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,571
He has a contract for you to
sign.

902
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,200
Contract for me to sign.

903
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,089
Okay.

904
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,971
Hello?

905
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,963
Shoot!

906
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,882
Clyde, you're good.
Jane Ann, get in there.

907
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,127
Come on.

908
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,284
Harold, telegram the press.
Say this:

909
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,370
"Today the Brooklyn Dodgers
organization...

910
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,208
has purchased the contract of
Jackie Robinson...

911
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:59,048
from the Montreal Royals.
He will report immediately."

912
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,285
I love you.

913
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,004
I love you.

914
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,889
Lookie here.

915
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,447
Hey, you're looking for your
locker, aren't you, son?

916
01:03:30,547 --> 01:03:32,609
Follow me.

917
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,961
I'm Hermanski.
Welcome to Brooklyn.

918
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,645
Greetings.

919
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,450
Hey, man.
Ralph Branca.

920
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,681
Greetings.

921
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,882
Greetings.
Okay.

922
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,287
I just found out today.
The best I can do.

923
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,125
I'll get you straightened out
tomorrow. Okay?

924
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,203
It's okay.

925
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,361
Robinson, can we get a photo?

926
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,085
Robinson, turn around!
Come on, come on, Mr. Robinson.

927
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,330
Good luck, sir!

928
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,802
Get out of here!
We don't need you!

929
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,769
Get out of here!

930
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,645
Yeah!
There he is!

931
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,240
Oh, say can you see...

932
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,291
by the dawn's early light

933
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,611
what so proudly we hailed...

934
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,685
at the twilight's last gleaming?

935
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,805
Who's broad stripes and bright
stars...

936
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,806
through the perilous fight.

937
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,365
O'er the ramparts we watched...

938
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,804
were so gallantly streaming?

939
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,124
And the rockets red glare...

940
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,609
The bombs bursting in air

941
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,924
gave proof through the night...

942
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,489
that our flag was still there...

943
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:33,640
Oh, say does that star-spangled
banner yet wave...

944
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:41,209
o'er the land of the free...

945
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:47,447
and the home of the brave.

946
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,451
Play ball!

947
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,925
Another opening day, Harold.

948
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,401
All future, no past.

949
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,881
It's a blank page, sir.

950
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,046
Hello again, everybody.

951
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,528
It's The Ol' Redhead, speaking
here...

952
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:06,097
from high up in the catbird seat
at Ebbets Field.

953
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,809
Welcome to opening day of the
1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season.

954
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,767
As many of you know, the Dodgers
finished 96-60, last season.

955
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,844
Respectable, but still two games
behind St. Louis...

956
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,571
who would, of course, go on to
take the World Series.

957
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,809
The Dodgers looking to move up
this year and win the pennant.

958
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,962
Now batting for the Dodgers...

959
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,487
One out.
Bottom of the 1st.

960
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,151
Headed to the plate now, for
his first big league at bat...

961
01:07:32,251 --> 01:07:34,892
is Dodger rookie Jackie Robinson.

962
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,329
Jackie is very definitely
brunet.

963
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,204
The Dodgers still without a
manager...

964
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,921
as Leo Durocher was suspended
earlier this week.

965
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,451
You got this, Jackie!

966
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,001
It's a shirtsleeve afternoon.

967
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,803
Johnny Sain looking in. When
he's got that fastball working...

968
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,169
what I mean to say is, he can toss
a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.

969
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,846
Oh, and it's a hard-hit ball
down the third baseline.

970
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,129
Elliott gobbles it up and makes
the long toss across the diamond.

971
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,520
You're out!

972
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,682
And Robinson is out.

973
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,845
Come on!
Ump, get some glasses!

974
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,082
You blew it!
Al, you blew that call!

975
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,321
You blew it!

976
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,206
It was a close play, at first.

977
01:08:19,306 --> 01:08:21,962
A tie usually goes to the runner,
but not this time.

978
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:25,765
So, that first big league hit
will remain to be seen.

979
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,488
So the Giants got Mize batting
cleanup.

980
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,444
Shame about Leo.

981
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,287
Inevitable, I suppose.

982
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,205
I asked him if she was worth it,
he said yes.

983
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,370
How's the retirement?

984
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,887
Oh, it's just fine.

985
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,371
You know, the roses are...

986
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,771
Hell of a thing when a man's
got good health...

987
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,331
and plenty of money...

988
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,363
and absolutely nothing to do.

989
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,888
Heh, well, I'm perfectly happy.

990
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,565
Is that so?

991
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,041
You know, when I took the Cleveland
uniform off two years ago...

992
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,484
I promised the missus I'd never
put on another uniform again.

993
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,564
So the roses are beautiful...

994
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,927
and, uh, I sleep better too.

995
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,084
Roses and sleep are two wonderful
things, Burt.

996
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,614
But sleep you can get when
you're in your casket...

997
01:09:22,714 --> 01:09:25,602
and flowers look great on
top of it.

998
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,327
But, uh, you don't look like
a dead man to me, Burt.

999
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,405
What's this about, Branch?

1000
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,246
I need you to manage the Dodgers
for me, Burt.

1001
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,601
No.
Now, wait.

1002
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,004
We're a ship without a captain,
and there's a typhoon coming.

1003
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,248
I'm sorry, no.

1004
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,090
Don't you miss the game, Burt?

1005
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,168
Working with the players?

1006
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,641
Helping to get the best out
of the team?

1007
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,090
Go on, look me in the eye and
tell me you don't.

1008
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,490
Baseball's the only life for
an old pepper pot like me.

1009
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,803
But I promised my wife, Branch.

1010
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,964
You promised her you'd never
put on a uniform again.

1011
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,361
You didn't promise her you
wouldn't manage.

1012
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,966
Wear a suit and a tie, like
Connie Mack.

1013
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,804
Come on, Burt.

1014
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,926
What do you say?

1015
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,443
Burt, I need you.

1016
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,008
What do you say?

1017
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,948
All right, men!
Men?

1018
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,570
Men?

1019
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,043
I know you've all, uh, heard
the news. I'm your new manager.

1020
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,521
I don't have much to say to you.

1021
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,131
Just, uh...

1022
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,001
don't be afraid...

1023
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,801
of old Burt Shotton as your
manager.

1024
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,640
You can win the pennant, in
spite of me.

1025
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,564
There's, uh...

1026
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,565
there's nothing I can do to
hurt you.

1027
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,091
So, uh...

1028
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,966
You Robinson?

1029
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,689
I thought so.

1030
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,891
So let's get out there and beat
those, uh... who are we playing?

1031
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,280
Giants, Burt.

1032
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,683
Giants.
Let's go beat the Giants!

1033
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,531
Now batting, number 42...

1034
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,571
first baseman, Jackie Robinson.

1035
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,842
You mark my words and circle
this date.

1036
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,527
Negroes are gonna run the white
man straight out of baseball.

1037
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,407
I'm not prejudiced.
It's physiological.

1038
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,055
They have a longer heel bone.

1039
01:11:54,368 --> 01:11:57,421
Gives them an unfair speed
advantage.

1040
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,770
Here's Robinson. Jack holds
that club down by the end...

1041
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,622
rear foot at the back end of
the box...

1042
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:04,768
slight open stance, bent at
the knees.

1043
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,561
Jack swings.

1044
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,242
That ball is screaming out to left.
Hartung watching it go and...

1045
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,368
so long!
Home run!

1046
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,770
Jackie Robinson has his first
Major League home run.

1047
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,244
Was that because his heel bone
was longer, Bob?

1048
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,843
"Heel bone, longer."

1049
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,764
Sorry I'm late.
Class ran long.

1050
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,530
That's okay.

1051
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,083
It's so cold and raw out, I don't
want him getting sick at the game.

1052
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,208
Fed him already.

1053
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,364
All of his bits are on the table
over there.

1054
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,489
He'll be nice and warm in here.

1055
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,483
Thank you, Alice.

1056
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,370
Bottom of the 1st.

1057
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,881
The skies are leaden now.
Pretty threatening.

1058
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,088
Eddie Stanky, safe at first.

1059
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,322
And Jackie Robinson stepping
to the plate.

1060
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,501
There's a slight breeze coming
in from right field...

1061
01:13:24,642 --> 01:13:26,169
blowing towards left.

1062
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,042
It shouldn't give much of an
advantage...

1063
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,743
to the right-handed hitters.

1064
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:31,369
Hey, nigger!

1065
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,000
Black nigger!

1066
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,101
Hey, why don't you go back to
the cotton fields...

1067
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:37,530
where you come from, huh?

1068
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:39,607
I saw you swing your way
out of a jungle.

1069
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,582
Chapman, the Phillies manager,
seems to be chirping something...

1070
01:13:42,682 --> 01:13:43,724
out to Robinson.

1071
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,241
Chapman, a hothead during his
playing days...

1072
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,762
has carried that reputation
right into his managing.

1073
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,480
He's got half a mind, Jackie.

1074
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,851
Take that monkey out now!

1075
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,044
You all right?
You don't look all right.

1076
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,202
Nigger, nigger, nigger!

1077
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,761
Come on, nigger, nigger, nigger!

1078
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,610
Whoa!

1079
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,284
Welcome to the big leagues, rook!

1080
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,048
Come on, now, get up.

1081
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,771
Can't take the heat, get out
of the kitchen, rook.

1082
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,967
Right, Bobby, heh?

1083
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,562
Those are nice dance moves,
Bojangles.

1084
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,062
Leave your hat on the ground...

1085
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:33,559
maybe somebody'll throw
some money in it, huh?

1086
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,891
Put on a little show, nigger.

1087
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,008
Do a little shuffle.

1088
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,041
Come on, midnight!
He's all right, he's all right.

1089
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,361
All right, nigger.

1090
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,166
Let's do this. You ought to be
careful in this sunshine.

1091
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,368
Tar baby skin gonna melt.

1092
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,369
Whoa!
You can't hit that?

1093
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,363
One more!
Strike him!

1094
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,205
Why don't you get that boy that
you sent down...

1095
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,408
to the International League, huh?

1096
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,523
That's where Africans play,
ain't it?

1097
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,011
Who was that?

1098
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,924
Who'd you put out of a job,
nigger?

1099
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,249
Come on, Jackie.

1100
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,442
Robinson, waiting for the pitch.

1101
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,602
Swings, and it's a fly ball out
to left.

1102
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,362
Ennis settles under it, for
the out.

1103
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,128
Sky's starting to clear now,
the sun pushing its way through.

1104
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,726
Nigger can't play.

1105
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,927
It's all right, he can take it.

1106
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,291
God built him to last.

1107
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,648
No score, bottom of the 4th.

1108
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,644
Spider Jorgensen taking a small
lead off first.

1109
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,644
Jorgensen, a rookie, spent last
season in Montreal.

1110
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,965
Here's the pitch.

1111
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,561
And Stanky lines a single out
to right field.

1112
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,131
Three!

1113
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,360
Hung low. Now there you go.
Next up for the Dodgers:

1114
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,127
Jackie Robinson.

1115
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,286
Hey!

1116
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,805
Hey, Pee Wee!

1117
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,361
Hey, what's this nigger doing
for you all...

1118
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,490
that you let him drink out of
the same water fountain as you?

1119
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,571
Huh?

1120
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,123
I hope you don't take showers
with him.

1121
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,611
Because you gonna be a mess!

1122
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,166
Hey, nigger!

1123
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,362
You like white women, huh?

1124
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,884
Hey, which one of these Dodger
wives...

1125
01:16:42,984 --> 01:16:45,281
are you climbing on, tonight?
Time!

1126
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,364
Wait, timeout, hold on.
He's gotta take a nap.

1127
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,521
Hey, which one is it?

1128
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,964
I think I know!

1129
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,641
Dixie?

1130
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,046
Sorry. Dixie, I hate to be the
one to tell you.

1131
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,807
I saw her walking earlier with a
little bit of a bow in her step.

1132
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,446
It'll be fine.

1133
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,440
It'll be fine.
He looks like a nice boy.

1134
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,369
That right, boy?

1135
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,210
Come on, nigger, nigger, nigger!

1136
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,929
Two men on for Robinson.

1137
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,363
Here's the pitch from Leonard.

1138
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,922
Swung on, and it's a towering
infield pop-up.

1139
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,446
Seminick settles under it.

1140
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,201
Hey, is that a home run?
Yeah.

1141
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,163
If you're playing in an
elevator shaft.

1142
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,926
Can of corn, and Robinson is out.

1143
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,842
You don't belong here, nigger!

1144
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,484
You hear me? Why don't you
look in the mirror?

1145
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,768
This a white man's game.

1146
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,726
All right? Get that through
your thick monkey skull!

1147
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,330
Look at me, baby.

1148
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,121
Look at me, baby.
Look at me.

1149
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,800
No!

1150
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,450
No...

1151
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,640
The next white son of a bitch
that opens his mouth...

1152
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,962
I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.

1153
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,847
You can't do that, Jack.

1154
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,485
I'm supposed to just let this
go on?

1155
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,571
These men have to live with
themselves.

1156
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,325
I have to live with myself, too.

1157
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,964
Right now I'm living a sermon
out there.

1158
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,528
You don't matter now, Jack.

1159
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,564
You're in this thing.

1160
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,008
You don't have the right to pull
out from the backing of people...

1161
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,721
that believe in you, that respect
you, that need you.

1162
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,166
Is that so?

1163
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,604
If you fight, they won't say
that Chapman forced you to.

1164
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,136
They'll say that you're in over
your head.

1165
01:19:35,236 --> 01:19:36,642
That you don't belong here.

1166
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,962
D' you know what it's like having
somebody do this to you?

1167
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,281
No.

1168
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,366
No.

1169
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,411
You do.

1170
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,166
You're the one...

1171
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,049
living the sermon.

1172
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,284
In the wilderness.

1173
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,169
Forty days.

1174
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,691
All of it.

1175
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,411
Only you.

1176
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,091
There's not a goddamn thing
I can do about it.

1177
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,770
Of course there is!

1178
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,605
You can get out there and hit!

1179
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,843
You can get on base and score.

1180
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,049
You can win this game for us.

1181
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,485
We need you.

1182
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,688
Everybody needs you!

1183
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,400
You're medicine, Jack!

1184
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,241
Let's go, fellas.

1185
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,090
They're taking the field.

1186
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,731
Now, get out there.

1187
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,041
Be smart, fellas.

1188
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,326
Let's go!

1189
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,048
Who's playing first?

1190
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,681
I'm gonna need a new bat.

1191
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,843
Eight zeros on the scoreboard for
the Phillies, seven for the Dodgers.

1192
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,480
No score, with the bottom of
the 8th coming up.

1193
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,085
All right, nigger.

1194
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,006
Hey, boy!

1195
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,129
Porch monkey!

1196
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,244
Hey, nigger, I know you can
hear me.

1197
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,602
You know what you're here for,
don't you, huh?

1198
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,004
You're here to get the nigger
dollars for Rickey at the gate.

1199
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,403
You don't belong here, nigger!

1200
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,325
Sit down.
You sit down, or I sit you down.

1201
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,920
What's the problem, Stank?

1202
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,129
You're the problem, you disgrace.
What the hell kind of man are you?

1203
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,379
You know he can't fight back.

1204
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,669
Why don't you try picking on
someone who can fight back?

1205
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,361
I'm not gonna fight you, get
thrown out of the game.

1206
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,524
Stanky now having a chin-wag
with his ex-teammate Chapman.

1207
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,569
Both men, masters of distraction.

1208
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,848
Stanky from second and Chapman
from the dugout.

1209
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,031
We'll have to wait and see what
the umpire does...

1210
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,531
since he's well within his rights
to kick Stanky...

1211
01:22:22,631 --> 01:22:23,377
right out of the game.

1212
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,684
Hey, 12! That's enough.
Back to the dugout.

1213
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,763
You shut your mouth, or I shut
it for you.

1214
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,610
This ain't happening.

1215
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,287
Hey, Stank? What's it like
being a nigger's nigger?

1216
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,001
I don't know, Chapman. What's it
like to be a redneck piece of shit?

1217
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,609
Robinson up.

1218
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,410
Here's the pitch.

1219
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,361
And Jack pokes a soft hit past
second.

1220
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,401
Sorry!

1221
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,004
Not much of a hit to speak of,
but Jackie is standing on first.

1222
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,005
Go, Jackie.

1223
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,401
Center fielder, number 7,
Pete Reiser.

1224
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,882
Mr. Pete Reiser steps up into
the batter's box.

1225
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,929
Robinson with another big lead
off first.

1226
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,560
He's just as restless as a cat
with a hot foot.

1227
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,081
Back.

1228
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,765
Whoa!
Safe!

1229
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,209
The Flatbush faithful voicing
their approval of Jack...

1230
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,050
as this type of scrappy play...

1231
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,443
is exactly what they've grown
to expect of their beloved Bums.

1232
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,090
Play now.

1233
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,005
Work it.

1234
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,523
Steal it, sweetheart.
Take it.

1235
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,043
Strike three, you're out.
He's going!

1236
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,601
Down!
Safe!

1237
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,089
The Dodgers, with an excellent
chance...

1238
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,811
as Robinson has willed himself
into scoring position.

1239
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,485
Thattaboy.

1240
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:23,247
Young Gene Hermanski steps to
the plate, playing right today.

1241
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,166
Come on!

1242
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,641
Hermanski cracks a single to
the left...

1243
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,331
and Robinson is able to trot home
for the first run...

1244
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,165
that may also be the decider.

1245
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,484
All right.

1246
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,601
Jackie!
All right!

1247
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,770
Hey, Robinson!

1248
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,847
Thanks.

1249
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,690
For what?

1250
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,526
You're on my team. What the hell
am I supposed to do?

1251
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,847
Nice hit.

1252
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,047
All this fuss over a rookie.

1253
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,403
What, he's got 10, 12 at bats.

1254
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,846
Y'all gonna spoil him.

1255
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,128
Chapman, do you think it cost
you the game?

1256
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,080
No. I think that a single out to
the left field cost us the game.

1257
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,642
You think you were a little hard
on Robinson?

1258
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,441
No. Look, we treat him the same
way we treat Hank Greenberg...

1259
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,126
except we call him a kike,
instead of a coon.

1260
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,760
Whenever we play exhibitions
with the Yankees...

1261
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,321
we call Joe DiMaggio "The Wop."

1262
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,448
All right?
They laugh about it.

1263
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,047
And it's forgotten when the
game's over.

1264
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,563
I don't care if they like me.

1265
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,287
I didn't come here to make
friends.

1266
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,209
I don't even care if they
respect me. I know who I am.

1267
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,171
Got enough respect for myself.

1268
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,409
But I do not want them to beat me.

1269
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,650
They're never gonna beat you.

1270
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,289
They came close today.

1271
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,241
I'm going in that Phillies
dugout tomorrow...

1272
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,482
and I'm gonna wring Ben Chapman's
neck!

1273
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,608
Did I say something funny?

1274
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,048
When I first told you about
Robinson, Harold...

1275
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,170
you were against it.

1276
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,482
Now, all of the sudden you're
worried about him.

1277
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,966
Wonder how that happened.

1278
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,589
Why, any decent-minded person
would...

1279
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:39,531
Sympathy, Harold. It's a Greek
word. It means "to suffer."

1280
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,127
"I sympathize with you" means
"I suffer with you."

1281
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,451
That Philadelphia manager
is, uh...

1282
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,291
He's doing me a service.

1283
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,205
A service?
Yes.

1284
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,843
He's creating sympathy on
Jackie's behalf.

1285
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,211
"Philadelphia" is Greek.

1286
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,287
Means "brotherly love."

1287
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,241
Bob Bragan to see you, Mr. Rickey.

1288
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,723
What in Satan's fire does he
want?

1289
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,121
All right, send him in.

1290
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,565
What do you want, Bragan?

1291
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,686
Uh, Mr. Rickey, I, uh...

1292
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,407
I would like, um...
What do you want?

1293
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,882
I'd like to not be traded, sir.

1294
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,130
If it's not too late.

1295
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,044
What about Robinson?

1296
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,283
The world's changing.

1297
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,006
I guess I can live with the
change.

1298
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,608
I mean, I can't believe it.
I speak my mind, and they trade me.

1299
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,409
This ain't the America I know.

1300
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,082
Uh-uh. Home of the free, land
of the brave? You hear me?

1301
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,363
Where they sending you, Hig?

1302
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,566
Pittsburgh.

1303
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,808
For cash and some Italian
outfielder named Gionfriddo.

1304
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,205
Pittsburgh.
I mean...

1305
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,961
Good luck, boys.
You gonna need it.

1306
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,289
Pittsburgh!

1307
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,450
Branch, it's Herb.

1308
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,722
Herb.
What can I do for you?

1309
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,962
Branch, how long have we known
each other?

1310
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,611
Oh, twenty years, maybe more.

1311
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,366
That's right. Been over some
solid road, together.

1312
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,013
So, urn, you can trust me when
I tell you...

1313
01:29:53,113 --> 01:29:55,109
Brooklyn's due here tomorrow...

1314
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,651
but you cannot bring that
nigger down here...

1315
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,609
with the rest of your team.

1316
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,809
Why's that, Herb?

1317
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,162
Nigger's name is Jackie Robinson,
by the way.

1318
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,687
Yeah, Branch, I understand
he's got a name...

1319
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,842
but we're just not ready for
that sort of thing...

1320
01:30:11,942 --> 01:30:13,678
here in Philadelphia.

1321
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,564
Now, I'm afraid that we're not
gonna be able to take the field...

1322
01:30:16,664 --> 01:30:19,239
against your team, if that
boy's in uniform.

1323
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,841
Well, what you do with your
team is your decision, Herb.

1324
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,004
But my team's gonna be in
Philadelphia tomorrow...

1325
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,003
with Robinson.

1326
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,562
And if we have to claim the game
as a forfeit, so be it.

1327
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,643
That's 9-0...

1328
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,200
in case you forgot.

1329
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,421
You know it, Branch, you've had a
hell of a hair across your ass...

1330
01:30:37,552 --> 01:30:38,969
over this, for a long time...

1331
01:30:39,104 --> 01:30:41,366
and I'd like to know what it is
you think you're trying to prove.

1332
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,126
You think God likes baseball,
Herb?

1333
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,525
What... what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1334
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,081
It means someday you're gonna
meet God...

1335
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,971
and when he inquires as why
you didn't take the field...

1336
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,884
against Robinson in Philadelphia...

1337
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,611
and you answer that it's because
he was a Negro...

1338
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,690
it may not be a sufficient reply!

1339
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,239
Okay, guys, we got 20 minutes
to check in and get to Shibe...

1340
01:31:24,339 --> 01:31:25,775
so chop-chop!

1341
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,241
Hey!

1342
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,250
Hey.
Out.

1343
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,811
And get that bus out of here.

1344
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,925
Oh, no, no, no, we have reservations.
We're the Dodgers.

1345
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,352
No, your team is not welcome,
here.

1346
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:38,910
Not while you have ball club
Negroes with you.

1347
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,368
You just mean that Robinson
can't stay, right?

1348
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,847
No, I mean your entire team
has been refused.

1349
01:31:44,944 --> 01:31:46,669
We've been staying here for
ten years.

1350
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:48,826
And you can stay away that
long, too.

1351
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,008
Hold on. Now, wait, we should
talk about this.

1352
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,208
Who put you up to this?
Is it the Phillies, behind this?

1353
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,402
They're not gonna let us stay
here, fellas.

1354
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,251
They don't want us here.

1355
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,804
Yeah, well maybe 42's got enough
friends in town we can bunk up.

1356
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,930
It's the rule we're gonna go with.
We've got reservations.

1357
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,690
Why is that?
That is the rule!

1358
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,604
What's that supposed to mean?

1359
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,650
It's not supposed to mean
a thing.

1360
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,929
When you can't get in hotels, you
got people's houses you stay at.

1361
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,605
Ain't that right?

1362
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,606
What?

1363
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,209
What do you want from me, Walker?

1364
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,366
An apology.

1365
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,245
You want an apology?
For what?

1366
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,765
For places like this?

1367
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,644
No. For turning this season
into a damn sideshow.

1368
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,768
Hey, fellas.
I'm a ballplayer, all right?

1369
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,287
I'm here to play ball!
So am I.

1370
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,886
I'm here to win.

1371
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,690
We want to win.
We on the same page?

1372
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,081
Well, how we supposed to win
sleeping on a bus?

1373
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,667
Well, maybe it'll do you some
good...

1374
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:50,381
the way you been swinging
the bat lately.

1375
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,483
Hey, you watch your mouth!
Hey, you watch your hand.

1376
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,700
Don't you ever talk to me like
that again!

1377
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,303
Watch your hand!

1378
01:32:57,438 --> 01:32:59,402
You hear me?
Watch yourself!

1379
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,244
You spit on me now?

1380
01:33:01,344 --> 01:33:03,139
If I spit on you, it'd be an
improvement.

1381
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,807
That's it. You go home, all right?
All right, that's enough!

1382
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,331
Hey, hey! Get used to it, fellas.
This how it's gonna be.

1383
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,124
We show up, the circus is in town!

1384
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,328
I'm not going anywhere!

1385
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,760
I'm right here!

1386
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,964
"There is a great lynch mob
among us.

1387
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,482
They go unhooded and work
without a rope."

1388
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,603
That's you, not me.

1389
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,124
"We must remember that all
this country's enemies...

1390
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,090
are not beyond the frontiers
of our homeland."

1391
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,480
A Jew probably wrote that.

1392
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,041
I don't care who wrote it.
It's in the damn papers!

1393
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,723
This is not good, Ben.

1394
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,811
Makes the entire Phillies
organization look racist.

1395
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,485
You gotta do something about it.

1396
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,889
Me?
Look, I'm defending baseball.

1397
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,408
It's time for you to step up
and defend the Phillies.

1398
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,158
This started on the field, it's
gonna end on the field...

1399
01:34:00,258 --> 01:34:02,179
and we're done talking about it.

1400
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,844
All right.

1401
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,810
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

1402
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,647
Excuse me.
Hi, Jackie.

1403
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,285
Uh, Wendell, um...

1404
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,687
A request came in.

1405
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,828
Uh, Ben Chapman, he's the, uh,
manager for the Phillies.

1406
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:27,484
You knew that.

1407
01:34:27,519 --> 01:34:29,362
Uh, he'd like his photo taken
with you.

1408
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,611
You been drinking, Harold?

1409
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,161
No, no.
I wish.

1410
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,409
No, Mr. Rickey, uh, he thinks
it's a good idea.

1411
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,563
He says it's gonna be in every
sports page across the country.

1412
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,361
An example that even the most
hardened man can change.

1413
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,684
Chapman hasn't changed.
He's just trying to save face.

1414
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,322
Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter
if he's changed.

1415
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,881
As long as it looks like he's
changed.

1416
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,406
Jackie, you've seen the questions
come in slow.

1417
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,804
Now, just see this photo come
in even slower.

1418
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,702
Chapman said he'd come
down here.

1419
01:35:12,871 --> 01:35:15,168
Or, uh, he could meet you
in the runway.

1420
01:35:15,303 --> 01:35:16,326
No.

1421
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,444
On the field.

1422
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,971
Where everyone can see.

1423
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:28,841
Did World War III break out?
Look at all of y'all.

1424
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,683
They even dug you up, Baum.
This must be important.

1425
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,888
Listen, I want to say something,
uh...

1426
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,723
Jackie's been accepted into
baseball...

1427
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,327
and the Philadelphia organization
wish him all the luck that we can.

1428
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,481
I just hope that our trial of
fire has helped him along.

1429
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,730
How about a picture? You shake
hands. Bury the hatchet.

1430
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,484
You wanna bury the hatchet?

1431
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,166
Sure.

1432
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,724
We'll use a bat.

1433
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,407
That way we don't have to
touch skin.

1434
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,884
All right.
Come on, fellas.

1435
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,327
All right, do it.
That's good. Right here.

1436
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,450
One more.
This way, Ben.

1437
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,961
It's Ostermueller on the mound.

1438
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,451
Ostermueller, deliberate.

1439
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,692
What I mean to say is...

1440
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:25,163
he's one of the slowest working
pitchers in the game.

1441
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,890
Here's the windup.
And...

1442
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,575
Oh, my! He hit Jackie Robinson
right in the head.

1443
01:36:37,743 --> 01:36:39,123
And Jackie is down!

1444
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:40,767
What are you doing out there,
Ostermueller?

1445
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,565
Hey!

1446
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,621
Ostermueller, you creep!

1447
01:36:44,778 --> 01:36:46,299
You gotta bat too!
Don't you forget it!

1448
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:47,844
Hey, I'm ready, you wop bastard!

1449
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,571
Oh, yeah? "Wop bastard"?
It's coming between your eyes.

1450
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,769
I'm gonna come like a kamikaze!
He doesn't belong here!

1451
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:54,967
Get off!
Knock it off!

1452
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,245
I'll send you back to
Schmeling and Goering...

1453
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,607
and the rest of your dead Kraut
buddies!

1454
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,165
You want some, Piner?

1455
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,731
He doesn't belong here!

1456
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,444
They're just ignorant.

1457
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,367
Hmm?

1458
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,727
If they knew you, they would
be ashamed.

1459
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,569
What can I do for you, Pee Wee?

1460
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,962
Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this.

1461
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,647
The series in Cincinnati next
week?

1462
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,804
Yes.
Important road trip.

1463
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,046
We're only three games out of first.
Yes, sir.

1464
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,205
Now, you know I'm from Kentucky.

1465
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:12,641
Then Cincinnati will nearly be
a home game for you.

1466
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,805
Well...

1467
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,369
I got this letter.

1468
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,515
Apparently, some people aren't
too happy...

1469
01:38:20,615 --> 01:38:22,531
about me playing with Robinson.

1470
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,005
Huh?

1471
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,241
"Nigger lover.

1472
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,124
Watch yourself.

1473
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,010
We'll get you, carpetbagger."

1474
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,241
Pretty typical stuff.

1475
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,010
Well, it's not typical to me,
sir.

1476
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,404
How many of those letters have
you gotten, Pee Wee?

1477
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,802
Just the one.
Ain't that enough?

1478
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,571
What are those?

1479
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,527
Well, I'll tell you what they
aren't.

1480
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:09,527
They aren't letters from the
"Jackie Robinson Fan Club."

1481
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,888
"Get out of baseball, or your
baby boy will die."

1482
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,924
"Quit baseball, or your nigger
wife..."

1483
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,486
"Get out of the game, or be
killed."

1484
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,645
Does Jackie know?

1485
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,041
Well, of course he does.

1486
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,924
And the FBI.

1487
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,250
They're taking a threat in
Cincinnati pretty seriously.

1488
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,621
So, excuse me if I don't get
too upset...

1489
01:39:45,721 --> 01:39:48,394
about you getting called a
carpetbagger.

1490
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,170
You should be proud.

1491
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,650
Well, I'd just like to play
ball, sir. That's all.

1492
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,924
Oh, I understand.

1493
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,765
I bet Jackie just wants to play
ball.

1494
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,003
I bet he wishes he wasn't leading
the League in hit by a pitch.

1495
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,084
I bet he wishes people didn't
want to kill him.

1496
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,885
The world's not so simple,
anymore.

1497
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,922
Guess it never was.

1498
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,084
We just, uh...

1499
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,766
baseball ignored it, now we
can't.

1500
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,520
Yes, sir.

1501
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,408
No hits, no runs for the Dodgers.
The Reds are coming to bat.

1502
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,131
How many times do you think
Pee Wee's gonna score?

1503
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,441
Well, I don't know, son.

1504
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,389
I remember when I was a kid...

1505
01:40:43,489 --> 01:40:46,786
I saw Honus Wagner play,
scored three times that day.

1506
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:49,963
We'll just have to wait and see.
Wow, that would be great.

1507
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,484
We don't want you here!

1508
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,325
Hey!
Hey, nigger boy!

1509
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,130
Get the hell out of Cincinnati!

1510
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,369
We don't want you here!

1511
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,450
Go back to Brooklyn!

1512
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,965
You the batboy, sambo?

1513
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,761
Hey, nigger!
I'm talking to you!

1514
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,362
Get the hell out of Cincinnati!
We don't want you here, boy!

1515
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,610
Nigger!

1516
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,603
We don't want you here!

1517
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,943
Cincinnati fans expressing their
displeasure...

1518
01:41:20,043 --> 01:41:21,939
as the Dodgers take the field.

1519
01:41:22,074 --> 01:41:24,650
Jackie Robinson at first.
"The Brat" Eddie Stanky at second.

1520
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,046
Spider Jorgensen at third.

1521
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:28,534
And the captain, Pee Wee Reese,
at short.

1522
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,595
Fans, ask any man and they'll
tell you...

1523
01:41:30,753 --> 01:41:33,690
the Gillette Superspeed razor
is a honey.

1524
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,127
Maybe the sweetest shaving
razor you'll ever use.

1525
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,965
Look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp.

1526
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,730
We don't want no niggers here!

1527
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,850
They can say all they want.
We're just here to play ball.

1528
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,570
Get him off the field!

1529
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:49,486
It's just a bunch of crackpots
still fighting the Civil War.

1530
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,584
Well hell, we'd have won that
son of a gun...

1531
01:41:51,724 --> 01:41:53,637
if the cornstalks would have
held out.

1532
01:41:53,772 --> 01:41:55,602
We just ran out of ammunition.

1533
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,883
Better luck next time, Pee Wee.

1534
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,329
Ain't gonna be a next time, Jackie.

1535
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,721
Hey, Reese!
Carpetbagger!

1536
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,811
All we got's right here.

1537
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:12,305
Right now.
You know what I mean?

1538
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,965
Thank you, Jackie.

1539
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,729
What are you thanking me for?

1540
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,361
I got family up there, from
Louisville.

1541
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,170
I need them to know.

1542
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,728
I need them to know who I am.

1543
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,080
Hey, number 1!

1544
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,848
You playing ball, or socializing?

1545
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:46,961
Playing ball, ump.

1546
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,160
Play ball!
Don't let them get to you!

1547
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,770
Playing ball.

1548
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:56,681
Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42.
That way they won't tell us apart.

1549
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,289
Come on, Jackie!

1550
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,490
Let me ask you something, Jackie.

1551
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,962
How come you never shower until
everybody else is done?

1552
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,686
What are you, shy?

1553
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,647
I don't want to make anyone feel
uncomfortable.

1554
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,840
We're a team.
On a hot streak.

1555
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,480
Come on, half those wins were
on account of you.

1556
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,244
You're the bravest guy I ever saw.

1557
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,770
You're leading us, you're afraid
to take a shower?

1558
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,768
Come on, take a shower with
me, Jackie.

1559
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,243
I didn't mean it like...

1560
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,906
That came out a little wrong.

1561
01:44:09,006 --> 01:44:10,859
I was not saying just take a
shower with me...

1562
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:13,491
I was saying, why don't we all
go and take a shower.

1563
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,681
Like, why...
Heh.

1564
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,446
As a team, why don't we shower
together.

1565
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,120
Branca?
Yeah.

1566
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:25,323
Stop.
Yeah.

1567
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,886
I'm stopping.

1568
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,217
We're in the last of a four-game
series with the Cardinals...

1569
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:01,688
and these two teams are in
a dogfight for first.

1570
01:45:01,788 --> 01:45:04,522
Top of the 11th now, all tied up
at 2.

1571
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,166
For those of you just tuning
in, how did we get here?

1572
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,885
Well, it's been double trouble...

1573
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,283
as Robinson knocked in Stanky
with a double in the 3rd.

1574
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,965
Shoot two!
Shoot two!

1575
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,640
And Dixie Walker did the same
with a double in the 8th.

1576
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,124
Second base!
Second base!

1577
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,560
But it wasn't enough...

1578
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,524
as the Cardinals tied it up with
two of their own in the 9th.

1579
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,126
This game is crucial to the
Red Birds.

1580
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,673
They are five games out
with the Dodgers not having...

1581
01:45:29,773 --> 01:45:32,967
relinquished first place
since June 30th.

1582
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,242
They call him "Country."

1583
01:45:34,364 --> 01:45:36,313
Slaughter's hitless in four
trips.

1584
01:45:36,443 --> 01:45:38,962
"Fireman" Casey in his second
inning of relief.

1585
01:45:38,997 --> 01:45:41,924
This game is just as tight as a
new pair of shoes on a rainy day.

1586
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,082
Casey goes into his windup.

1587
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,624
Slaughter hits a hard ground
ball right at Reese...

1588
01:45:47,724 --> 01:45:49,366
who fires it over to Jack
at first.

1589
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,406
Oh, my!

1590
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,764
Robinson is down.

1591
01:45:52,932 --> 01:45:56,654
Slaughter spiked him high up
on the leg, and he is down.

1592
01:45:56,789 --> 01:45:58,133
Goddamn it, Slaughter!

1593
01:45:58,233 --> 01:45:59,619
You knew what you were doing!
You spiked my guy!

1594
01:45:59,654 --> 01:46:01,045
Get up, Jackie.

1595
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,522
Get him up, boys, get him up.

1596
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,444
Stay off it.
Team doc will be out.

1597
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,789
Hugh, next guy up, you hit him
right in the head, alright?

1598
01:46:07,889 --> 01:46:09,199
You clean his clock.
No, no, no, no, no...

1599
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,601
No, no. Get me up.
No, lay down, man. You're staying.

1600
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,609
No.
Get me up!

1601
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,011
Easy, kid.

1602
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,645
Just get him out.

1603
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,125
Just get him out.

1604
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,281
Understand?

1605
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,125
Game's too important.

1606
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,850
Just get him out.

1607
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,846
Go play ball.

1608
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,367
You a tough man, Jackie.
Let's get him out.

1609
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,508
Jackie, what are saying?
He spiked you on purpose?

1610
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,445
You saw the play.

1611
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,261
My foot was on the inside of
the bag...

1612
01:46:44,361 --> 01:46:46,217
he was out by a mile, but he
kept coming.

1613
01:46:46,252 --> 01:46:48,646
So, it was on purpose?
Slaughter said it was an accident.

1614
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,325
What are you asking me for, then?

1615
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,801
Are you calling Slaughter a liar?
Is he a liar?

1616
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,850
Am I calling him a liar?
What are you gonna write?

1617
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,346
Get out of here!
Get out!

1618
01:46:57,446 --> 01:46:59,574
Come on, Rickey, let him finish
the story!

1619
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,760
Go on, let me talk to my first
baseman.

1620
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,046
Is he a liar, Jackie?
Go!

1621
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,010
All right, all right. Getting
stitched up, for Pete's sake.

1622
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,527
Just trying to do our job,
Rickey.

1623
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,011
Looks good, Babe.
Thank you, sir.

1624
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,941
Sticking up for himself...

1625
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:22,802
is something you'd expect of
any man.

1626
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:29,042
Some find it galling in a Negro.

1627
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,281
You know what I saw this morning?

1628
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:49,050
I was passing a sandlot, little
white boy was up at bat.

1629
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,043
You know what he was doing?

1630
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,489
Sitting on a fastball?

1631
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,244
He was pretending he was you.

1632
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,368
Rubbing dirt on his hands.

1633
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,963
Swinging with his arms outstretched,
like you do.

1634
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:10,768
Little white boy pretending
he is a black man.

1635
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,162
Why'd you do this, Mr. Rickey?

1636
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,890
We had a victory over fascism
in Germany.

1637
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,647
It's time we had a victory
over racism at home.

1638
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,211
No.

1639
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,171
Why?

1640
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,006
Why'd you do it?

1641
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,291
Come on.

1642
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,164
Tell me.

1643
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,610
I love this game.

1644
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,769
I love baseball.

1645
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,642
Given my whole life to it.

1646
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,877
Forty-odd years ago, I was a
player-coach...

1647
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,820
at Ohio Wesleyan University.

1648
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,205
We had a Negro catcher.
Best hitter on the team.

1649
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,929
Charlie Thomas.
Fine young man.

1650
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:27,327
I saw him laid low, broken,
because of the color of his skin.

1651
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:29,482
And I didn't do enough to help.

1652
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,041
Told myself I did, but I didn't.

1653
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:38,451
There was something unfair at
the heart of the game I loved...

1654
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,005
and I ignored it.

1655
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,409
But a time came...

1656
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,687
when I could no longer do that.

1657
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,764
You...

1658
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,886
you let me love baseball again.

1659
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,846
Thank you.

1660
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,085
Last long road trip of the year.

1661
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,726
And two long faces, huh?

1662
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,288
Try not to lunge at the plate.

1663
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,690
You serious?

1664
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,684
That's why they're throwing
the fastballs inside.

1665
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,241
Fight those inside fastballs
off...

1666
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,644
sooner or later they won't be
able to help, but, throw a curve.

1667
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,247
And what'll happen then, coach?

1668
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,083
Is that right?
Mm-hm.

1669
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,562
Well, you know, if we win enough
of these next games...

1670
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,844
we bring home the pennant.

1671
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,009
You bring yourself home.

1672
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,730
That'll be plenty.

1673
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,604
You're in my heart.

1674
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,130
Since the 4th of July...

1675
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:27,779
the Brooklyn Dodgers have gone
on a hot streak...

1676
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:30,040
holding off all challengers.

1677
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,283
During that time and during
this season...

1678
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,046
I have watched Jackie Robinson
submerge himself...

1679
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,850
to serve something greater.

1680
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:39,605
And I don't mean the Brooklyn
Dodgers...

1681
01:51:39,705 --> 01:51:42,010
though he's doing that, too.

1682
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,763
The man flat-out has guts.

1683
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,997
A stand-up force of nature...

1684
01:51:47,097 --> 01:51:49,417
he's complicated everything
but himself.

1685
01:51:49,552 --> 01:51:52,807
He's changing the world and
refusing to let it change him.

1686
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,249
But baseball isn't tennis.

1687
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,169
It takes a team.

1688
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,487
Joining together was a start.

1689
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,802
Staying together, a big step
forward.

1690
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,122
But working together is how
you win.

1691
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,560
Out!

1692
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,328
Jackie, you son of a gun,
I could kiss you!

1693
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,641
Nice catch.

1694
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,290
Yours, or mine?
Heh.

1695
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,485
Down the stretch on the last
long road trip of the year...

1696
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:21,008
Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn
Dodgers are doing exactly that.

1697
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,088
They're holding off the Cardinals
and streaking towards the pennant.

1698
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,320
Boss, we did it.

1699
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,721
We did it, we swept Cincinnati!

1700
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,291
Great, Harold.

1701
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,329
One more win could do it.

1702
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,528
Who's pitching tomorrow for
the Pirates?

1703
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,330
Ostermueller.

1704
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,003
Fritz Ostermueller on the mound.

1705
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,844
He's 12-8 on the season.

1706
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,241
A big game today in Pittsburgh.

1707
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:51,930
A win, and the Dodgers will
have clinched...

1708
01:52:52,030 --> 01:52:53,356
the National League pennant...

1709
01:52:53,456 --> 01:52:56,366
Yankees having already clinched
in the American League.

1710
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:57,681
There's bad blood here...

1711
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,526
as Ostermueller beaned Robinson
in the head earlier in the season...

1712
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,251
prompting quite a rhubarb at
the time.

1713
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,883
Teams have gone their separate
ways since...

1714
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,520
with Ostermueller left standing
in the Dodgers' way...

1715
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:13,291
as they chase the pennant that
eluded them last year.

1716
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,249
Come on, Jackie, let's go!

1717
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,760
Here comes the pitch.

1718
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,368
And Robinson takes outside.
Ball one.

1719
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:26,928
Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!
You don't belong here.

1720
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,645
And you never will.

1721
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,484
Robinson crowding the plate.

1722
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,927
Jack hasn't backed down to
a pitcher all season.

1723
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,161
There you go, Jackie!

1724
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:38,564
You got nothing for him, Ostermueller!
But he's got something for you!

1725
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,882
Ostermueller winds and throws.

1726
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,844
Low and away, ball two.

1727
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,122
Fritz seems to be pitching
around Jackie...

1728
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:50,250
or as they say in the trade,
trying to get him to chase.

1729
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,402
Robinson's having a fine
rookie standard...

1730
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,643
batting .301 with 31 doubles
and 10 home runs.

1731
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,327
He has stolen 27 bases this
season, and has yet...

1732
01:53:58,427 --> 01:54:00,200
to be thrown out attempting.

1733
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:03,201
Needless to say, Ostermueller
being careful with him.

1734
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,969
It's 3-0, now.

1735
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,444
Robinson patient, waiting for
something he can swing on.

1736
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,445
Give me something.

1737
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,405
Give me something I can hit.

1738
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,766
You want it?

1739
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,490
What are you afraid, of?

1740
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,129
What are you afraid, of?

1741
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:33,969
Ostermueller looking in for
the sign.

1742
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,771
Be careful what you ask for,
boy.

1743
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,449
And here comes the pitch.

1744
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,602
Oh, and that's a deep fly ball
to left.

1745
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,001
Kiner on his horse, I don't
think he'll get there.

1746
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,730
Back, back, back, and...

1747
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,360
Oh, ho, ho, doctor!

1748
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,648
Robinson got his pitch!

1749
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,040
It's a home run.

1750
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,771
And barring a miracle comeback...

1751
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,810
the Dodgers are going to the
World Series!

1752
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,001
Yes!

1753
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,005
He did it, he did it!

1754
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,330
Pittsburgh!

1755
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,367
Yes!

1756
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,364
Way to go, Jackie!

1757
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,083
Jack in his home run trot, now...

1758
01:55:35,183 --> 01:55:36,899
and the home crowd here at
Forbes...

1759
01:55:36,934 --> 01:55:39,486
recognizing something special
when they see it.

1760
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,847
All the same, I can practically
hear the roar...

1761
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,526
from the heart of Flatbush back
in Brooklyn.

1762
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,405
Jackie, yeah, yeah!

1763
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,531
Robinson rounds third...

1764
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:32,248
headed for home...

1765
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,442
sweet home.
