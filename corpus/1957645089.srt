00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,578
These'll be great.

00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:14,579
Thank you.

00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,501
Ta-da!

5
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,720
What's this for?

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,462
Because I love you.

MAN: Call 911!

14
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:41,867
No, stay back!

15
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:48,352
Nick?

16
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,314
Nick?

17
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,532
Nick?

18
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:55,446
Nick?

19
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,930
Oh, no!

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,453
No, Nick!

21
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,934
Somebody, quickly!

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,935
Nick!

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,504
No, Nick!

24
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:10,374
No.

[music playing]

26
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:33,789
Nick?

27
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,269
What's that?

28
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:40,796
Nothing.

[buzzes]

30
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,900
You sure about this, ma'am?

31
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:46,166
It's not too late to go rightback to the station, you know.

32
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,777
Listen, any time you wantto leave, night or day,

33
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,127
you call me.

34
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,389
Good luck.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,521
You're going to need it.

36
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,757
[buzzes]

37
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:13,671
SECURITY GUARD: Yes?

38
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,804
What do you want?

39
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,806
Hi.

40
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,677
I'm Elizabeth Guinness.

41
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,766
I believe I'm expected.

42
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,115

RICHARD KEATON:
You're too young.

44
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,163
Dr. Keaton?

45
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,123
You can stay until morning.

46
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,385
You'll find a room prepared.

47
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,560
Mrs. Pram will
attend to your needs.

48
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:22,653
Wait.

49
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,325
[music playing]

50
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,423
Dr. Keaton?

51
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,544
Dr. Keaton.

52
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,206
Dr. Keaton, please.

53
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,165
I'm not too young.

54
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:28,866
I'm very experienced, and Ihave excellent references.

55
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,521
My son has driven
off three other

56
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,436
professional and
highly-qualified nannies

57
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,221
in the last four months.

58
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,008
What makes you think that youcan succeed where they failed?

59
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:43,881
Well, I happen to specializein working with children

60
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:44,795
that are challenged.

61
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:51,106
I grew up with four brothers.

62
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,934
I don't know.

63
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:56,503
Please just give me the
month's trial period,

64
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,417
and then we'll see.

65
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,944
Please.

66
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,033
All right.

67
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,600
But you won't get very
far as long as you

68
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,211
see Andrew as a challenge.

69
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,693
He studies on his own,and he is best left to be

70
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,478
by himself as much as possible.

71
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:20,309
I am not to be disturbed
except in emergencies.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,223
Mrs. Pram.

73
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,621
Dr. Keaton, one other thing.

74
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,057
What are the custody
arrangements?

75
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,754
Does Andrew spend
time with his mother?

76
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:31,668
MRS PRAM: Yes, sir?

77
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,017
Please come up here.

78
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,546
Andrew's mother is
dead, Ms. Guinness.

79
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,460
[gunshot]

80
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,553
Please do not
speak of her again.

81
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,598
Mrs. Pram will take care of you.

82
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:49,947
Please wait for
her on the landing.

83
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,472
[music playing]

84
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,951
Yes.

85
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:54,952
Good night.

86
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,447
Ms. Guinness?

87
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,902
[humming]

88
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,387
[shrieks]

89
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,566
You must be the new nanny.

90
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:47,004
Haven't you been told to knockbefore you enter a lady's room?

91
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,353
You're not a lady.

92
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,355
You're an employee.

93
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,054
I most certainly
am a lady, and I

94
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:56,100
expect to be treated like one.

95
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,015
You stay here.

96
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,756
My name is Elizabeth Guinness.

97
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,019
My friends call me Liz.

98
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,674
You must be Andy.

99
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,720
Andrew Philip Albert Keaton.

100
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,896
The Albert is for Einstein.

101
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:11,768
You may call me Master
Andrew if you wish,

102
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:17,034
but Andy is out of the question.- There.

103
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,908
I'm decent, but I'd like
to get dressed properly.

104
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,823
Then I'll make you
your favorite breakfast

105
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,739
and we can get to
know each other, OK?

106
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,089
Can I watch?

107
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:30,352
I've only learned female
anatomy from books

108
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,136
and internet searches.

109
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,965
I've never seen an adult
female naked before.

110
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,271
Really?

111
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,794
Well you're not
going to see one how.

112
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,491
Skedaddle.

113
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,407
I think I'm going tocall you nanny number four.

114
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,061
Why?

115
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:48,022
Because you're going to goaway like the other three.

116
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,720
I thought that was a closet.

117
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,766
It's kind of
like a big closet.

118
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,636
It's where I'm stored.

119
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,471
Breakfast in five minutes, OK?

120
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,302
Mrs. Pram goes
to the supermarkets

121
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,608
on Wednesday mornings.

122
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,261
I don't think she'll
be very pleased

123
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,700
with you using her kitchenwithout her permission.

124
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,572
I think she'll get used to it.

125
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,401
Here.

126
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,316
Napkin?

127
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:24,101
Napkin, where?

128
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,060
Right-hand drawer over there.

129
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,496
Thank you.

130
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,852
You look different
with clothes on.

131
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,028
Don't you have any
jeans and sneakers?

132
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,117
Of course, but
I don't like them.

133
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,118
Why?

134
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,380
Here.

135
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,208
I thought you could
show me around.

136
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,862
Perhaps we could go riding.

137
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,908
Now those clothes
might get dirty.

138
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,170
I hate horses.

139
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,868
Besides, I'm much too busy.

140
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,609
Father left for
Geneva this morning,

141
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,438
and I want to finish readingthe almanac before he returns.

142
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,528
You're going to finish thealmanac before he returns?

143
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,964
Yes.

144
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,662
Father read the phone
book when he was three.

145
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,055
Well, he didn't sayanything to me about a trip.

146
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,317
He didn't tell me either.

147
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,407
I downloaded his
computer scheduler.

148
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,757
He didn't say goodbye to you?

149
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,149
No.

150
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,065
Father has no time for
that kind of stuff.

151
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,763
What kind of stuff?

152
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,678
Unscientific stuff.

153
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,288
You should be wearing
your uniform, you know.

154
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,203
Nannies wear uniforms.

155
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,421
Well, this nanny doesn't.

156
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:30,820
So I guess it's just
you and me, huh?

157
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,039
We're not alone.

158
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,344
She's here.

159
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,826
Who, Mrs. Pram?

160
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,133
Well, who else lives here?

161
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,613
Mother.

162
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:45,922
Andy, your father toldme your mother passed away.

163
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,015
She's still here.

164
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,456
There are 36 deaths
by snakebite recorded

165
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,720
every year in thecontinental United States.

166
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,896
Yeah, how do you know that?

167
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,246
Just download the insurancecompany's mortality tables.

168
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,639
I thought you said you
knew about computers.

169
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,338
Well I do, but I'm
not as morbid as you.

170
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:13,733
[music playing]

171
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,480
[squeals]

172
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,962
Stop, stop!

173
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:30,445
Don't you know what water willdo to a scientific calculator?

174
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,534
This is a very
delicate instrument.

175
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:42,152
Shake then you
grasp like that.

176
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,676
And then you slide
it and you grip it.

177
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,635
And then you get your
thumb here in that,

178
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,679
and then you do like this.

179
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,812
You [inaudible] a couple, shh.

180
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,380
And then you pull out,
you got to go boom.

181
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,729
And then you blow the
smoke from the gun.

182
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,730
Whoosh.

183
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,254
Stick it in your holster.

184
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,561
It's really cool.

185
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,780
What do you think?

186
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,784
I think it's silly,
and I also think

187
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,830
you'd do much better if youread one or two of these.

188
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,702
Read this one first,
and then this one.

189
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,704
And I'd advise you to geta pen and a piece of paper,

190
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,750
because they have a numberof equations in them.

191
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,685
She's dribbling
down the court,

192
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,991
And she's coming
at a high speed.

193
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,470
And it looks like
the [inaudible] team

194
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:40,820
is going to win thechampionship of the world.

195
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,038
And she passes it to
Andrew Keaton, who's

196
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,431
putting it up for three points.

197
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,562
Come on, Andy.
Shoot!

198
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,476
Shoot.

199
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:46,477
Go on!

200
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:10,850
[window creaks]

201
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:12,852
Who's that?

202
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,823
ANDREW KEATON: Did it scare you?

203
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,478
Did what scared me?

204
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:34,134
When the window crashed open.

205
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:36,963
Well it woke me, but it
was just a gust of wind.

206
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,400
How did you know about that?

207
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,314
It was her.

208
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:41,271
Who?

209
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,751
The ghost.

210
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,622
What ghost, Andy?

211
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,015
My mother.

212
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:49,671
You're nowhere near as
beautiful as she is.

213
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:53,457
Of course I'm not.

214
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:54,502
Do you talk with her?

215
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,765
No.

216
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,158
Is she scary to you?

217
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,334
Look, don't do the
shrink stuff on me, OK?

218
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:01,465
It doesn't work.

219
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,424
She's a ghost, OK?

220
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,339
She doesn't want you here.

221
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,254
[music playing]

222
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,169
Andy.

223
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,171
My mother was murdered.

224
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,041
Ask father.

225
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,356
Do you think Dr.Keaton will be back soon?

226
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,662
He doesn't tell me his
schedule, Ms. Guinness.

227
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,019
Have you been here
long, Mrs. Pram?

228
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,977
Ever since Dr.
Keaton was a boy

229
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,893
and went away to
school in England.

230
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,635
I took care mostly of Blain.

231
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,767
So you knew Mrs. Keaton.

232
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,466
Everybody knew Alycia Keaton.

233
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,469
How did she die?

234
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:52,125
She fell from the east tower.

235
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,562
Oh, my god.

236
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,216
Was there an inquest?

237
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:59,610
Dr. Keaton is a very wealthyman, a famous scientist.

238
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,266
People like to gossip about him.

239
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,921
So what was the verdict?

240
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,229
They called it a suicide.

241
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,578
How old was Andy?

242
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,319
What happened to him?

243
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,538
Andy was three.

244
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,586
He went away to live
with Alycia's parents.

245
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,284
They died in a boating
accident six months ago,

246
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,505
and he came back here againto live with his father.

247
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,723
Poor little boy.

248
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,859
Mrs. Pram, how havethings been between them?

249
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,866
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,868
Good night, Mrs. Pram.

[clock chiming]

253
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,471
RICHARD KEATON: I seeyou've found the library.

254
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,827
Yeah.

255
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,569
Hi.

256
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:59,399
It's a beautiful room.

257
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,184
I'm afraid I can't
take credit for it.

258
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,491
Generations of Keaton
women have conspired

259
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,319
to make this room what it is.

260
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,972
Would you like
something to drink?

261
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:08,886
No.

262
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:09,757
No, thank you.

263
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,632
So how was Geneva?

264
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,114
Geneva was a hotel room, auniversity conference center,

265
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:23,945
and an airport like anyother scientific meeting,

266
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:25,990
only this time withchocolates and cuckoo clocks.

267
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:35,043
Is it OK me being here?

268
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,393
Well I'm generally not inhere until after midnight.

269
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:40,179
I doubt if we'll be
in each other's way.

270
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,833
No.

271
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:48,535
So how was your
trial by Andrew?

272
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,406
Was it a test?

273
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,668
Well, my schedule
has nothing to do

274
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,367
with your responsibilities.

275
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:55,194
It was good.

276
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:04,290
Andrew seems to think thathis mother was murdered.

277
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,641
I thought I told younot to mention his mother.

278
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:08,816
You did.

279
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,819
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,517
I suppose his
grandparents told him.

281
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,258
They despised me.

282
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,128
Why?

283
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,004
Because they
believe that I did it.

284
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:31,621
Why did Andy go to live
with his grandparents?

285
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,927
Because they wanted
him, and I didn't.

286
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:36,060
It was as simple as that.

287
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:38,802
Until they capsized
their sailboat, and then

288
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:39,803
I had to have him.

289
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,505
How do you feel about him now?

290
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,207
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like some privacy.

291
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,123
I have a lot of reading to do.

292
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,778
Of course.

293
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,214
Good night.

294
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,128
Good night.

Ms. Guinness.

299
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:17,336
Don't worry.

00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:35,266
Andy, would you take
this up to your father?

303
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,051
- No.
- Well, please.

304
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,053
You're going that way.

305
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,228
I don't want to disturb him.

306
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,621
Well Andy, he has to eat.

307
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,406
Please.

308
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:45,842
Oh, all right.

309
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:46,800
Thank you.

310
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,670
Can you manage?

311
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:48,541
Yes.

312
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,635
Why did Alycia's parents tellAndy his mother was murdered?

313
00:22:55,765 --> 00:23:00,030
They never accepted that Mrs.Keaton could take her own life.

314
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,165
Didn't they understandwhat it could do to Andy?

00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,237
Welcome home.

00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:42,725
Thank you.

322
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,075
Look, I'm real busy right now.

323
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:46,337
We'll talk later, OK?

324
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,558
I'll come down for dinner.

325
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:50,429
Yes, father.

00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,785
Uh-oh.

327
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:03,224
They don't sound
like very happy feet.

328
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:08,142
Andy, what happened?
What happened?

329
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:11,101
It's all your fault.
You made me go up there.

330
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,276
I knew I shouldn't have.

331
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,802
I was right about you.

[slams door]

333
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,778
What on earth happened?

Andy is crying his
eyes out downstairs.

335
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,261
Now you've been
gone for two weeks.

336
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,785
Can't you give him a
moment of your time?

337
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,221
Does this constitute
an emergency?

338
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,659
Is there some kind of problem?

339
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,618
Well yes, I think
there is a problem.

340
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:53,622
Your son Andrew thinks
his mother is a ghost.

341

Now I can't bring him backfrom that without your help.

you are free to leave.

I don't understand you.

345
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:10,160
Ms. Guinness, do you know whatI do if I reach a conclusion

346
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,250
that doesn't make any sense?

347
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,035
I re-examine my premises.

Oh, he's beautiful.

00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:16,662
What's his name?

359
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,316
Her name is Amber.

360
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,449
She was my mother's favorite.

361
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,929
Have you ever ridden her?

No.

go out some time.

00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,728

00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:52,872
Blain, Jilly!

372
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:04,013
US genuine army surplus.

373
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,625
Picked them up in a
junk shop in Barbados.

374
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:07,843
They work.

375
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:08,888
I think they'll
need some fiddling,

376
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,933
but I thought you'd like them.

377
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,196
Your father and I had thesame pair when we were kids.

378
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:14,589
Of course, Richard
took them apart

379
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,373
and we never could get
them to work again.

380
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:17,418
They're great.

381
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,202
Thanks, uncle Blain.

382
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,116
They're terrific.

383
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,295
Hi.

384
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:26,862
Well hello.

385
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:29,691
Blain Keaton, official
family black sheep.

386
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:30,866
This is Jillian Zale, my friend.

387
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,041
Hi.

388
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:32,912
Care for a drink
while I'm pouring?

389
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,870
Oh, no thank you.

390
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,045
I'm Liz Guinness.

391
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:36,916
I'm Andy's--

392
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,134
She's my new nanny.

393
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,396
Well, my brother's
taste in nannies

394
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:42,573
has definitely improved.

395
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,705
What are they, Andy?

396
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:45,402
Walkie-talkies.

397
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,753
If I replace the inductioncoils in the modulator circuits,

398
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,146
they should be effective
anywhere in the house.

399
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,757
So where is the famous man?

400
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,846
He's up in his office working.

401
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,935
Should I send word
that you're here?

402
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,502
My dear girl, he knew wewere here before you did.

403
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,243
Hi.

404
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:01,984
What a nice surprise, Jillian.

405
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,030
I thought you were going tospend the summer at the Cape.

406
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,380
Oh, Richard.

407
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,034
How could I stay away from you?

408
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,737
Blain.

409
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,392
Richard.

410
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:21,047
Oh, it's great to be
back in the country.

411
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:23,527
I'm so sick of the city.

412
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,791
I have a hankering toride your horses, Richard.

413
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,748
Well please do, Jillian.

414
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:27,923
They could use it.

415
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,882
I've not had time
to ride lately.

416
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,057
Why don't we go
tomorrow morning?

417
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,319
I can't.

418
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:33,363
My publisher will
kill me if I don't

419
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,495
finish my manuscript on time.

420
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,801
Oh, you're a writer.

421
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,411
And I am his muse.

422
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,327
Isn't that right, Blain?

423
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,851
I must say I was surprised tosee how happy Andrew was today.

424
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,898
Big change from the
last time I saw him.

425
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,291
Well, we have Ms.Guinness to thank for that.

426
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:50,163
She's working wonders with him.

427
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,774
Well she certainly is a stepup in the nanny department.

428
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,124
Makes me wish I
were eight again.

429
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,691
Still, better late than never.

430
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,788
If you'll excuse me,it's been a very long day.

431
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,704
Andy gets up very early.

432
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:10,661
Good night.

433
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,240
Liz?

434
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,287
Liz.

435
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,202
Are you really going to bed,or were you just choking

436
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:31,595
on the tension in there?

437
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,033
They don't like eachother very much, do they?

438
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:37,253
That's theunderstatement of the year.

439
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,953
How about you and
I having a drink?

440
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,433
OK.

441
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,347
OK.

442
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,872
Come on.

443
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:50,266
How long are you
staying for this time?

444
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:53,704
Long enough to
finish my manuscript.

445
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,185
Fine.

446
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,405
Then just keep out of my way.

447
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:01,234
Richard, I want
to sell the estate.

448
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,019
I've told you just give metime, and I will buy you out.

449
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,412
I'm not prepared
to wait that long.

450
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,326
I want to sell it now.

451
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,328
Oh, don't be so absurd.

452
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,330
This house was built by ourgreat-great-grandfather,

453
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,984
if you hadn't forgotten.

454
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:14,508
No, I haven't forgotten,as much as I would like to.

455
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,205
Do you really think this
is an appropriate place

456
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,947
for Andy to grow up in?
- Oh no, Blain.

457
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:22,081
Don't question what
I do for Andrew.

458
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,778
Your rules, your house.

459
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,084
Everything's got to be your way.

460
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:27,738
You're damn right.

461
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,089
No wonder Alycia
was so unhappy.

462
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:33,048
How dare you.

463
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,658
You know, I'd have
thought you to be

464
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,835
ashamed to show your face.

465
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,924
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

466
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,534
Don't mind Blain.

467
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,492
No one else does.

468
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:45,365
He's not very subtle, is he?

469
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,584
He just can't imagine
a man and a woman

470
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,543
being alone in a place
like this and not

471
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:53,068
actually sleeping together.

472
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,855
So are you sleeping
with Richard?

473
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,639
No.

474
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,032
I'm sorry.

475
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:02,817
Blain must be rubbing off on me.

476
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,253
Cheers.

477
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,124
Cheers.

478
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,216
So you like to ride?

479
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,478
Oh, yes.

480
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:12,609
Especially these horses.

481
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,133
They're so good.
Do you ride?

482
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,047
Mhmm.

483
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,396
I grew up with horses.

484
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,788
Really?

485
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,051
Well we'll have to
ride together sometime.

486
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,835
I'd like that.

487
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,142
I don't understand why
Dr. Keaton keeps them.

488
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:26,362
I mean, he never goes near them.

489
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:29,844
Alycia loved them, andthey're part of the museum.

490
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,503
It must have been very
difficult for Dr. Keaton

491
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,634
after she died.

492
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,246
Depends on what you mean.

493
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:44,467
Luckily, she was my bestfriend, but she was no saint.

494
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:48,732
She liked two things in life,and used one to get the other--

495
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:53,302
money and men, and in
no particular order.

496
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,957
Really?

497
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,091
But she always
came back to Blain

498
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:03,138
before and after her marriage.

499
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,139
Why did he marry her?

500
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:10,580
Because he loved her.

501
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,192
She really was quite beautiful.

502
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:15,672
[rumbling]

503
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,197
That didn't take long.

504
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,198
[music playing]

505
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:23,158
[glass shattering]

506
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,638
[shouting]

507
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,124
Stop!

508
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:34,126
Stop it!

509
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,083
Stop it.

510
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,047
[crying]

511
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,535
I'm going to call it a night.

512
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:03,459
Andy?

513
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:42,063
[door creaking]

514
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,203
Andy, is that you?

515
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,143
[crying]

516
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,147
Andy.

517
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:33,114
Oh, Andy.

518
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,640
Mommy.

519
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,164
Oh, it's OK.

520
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,643
It's OK, darling.

521
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,611
It's OK.

522
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:58,574
[music playing]

523
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,070
Did my father kill my mother?

524
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,032
I don't think he could
do a thing like that.

525
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:29,475
So you're not leaving then?

526
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,259
No.

527
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,306
I told you I'm going to stay.

528
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:37,135
Besides, I quite like it here.

529
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,663
You're not scared of her?

530
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:47,884
Andy, there's no ghost.

531
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:52,367
Now sleep tight.

532
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,108
Don't that the bed bugs bite.

533
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,023
If they do, hit
them with your shoe.

534
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,335
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,293
For what?

536
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:08,340
For scaring you.

537
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,385
I made your window crash open.

538
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,217
You did that?

539
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,218
Yeah.

540
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,655
How did you do that?

541
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,396
I can't tell
you because you'll

542
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,920
tell all the other nannies,and then it won't work anymore

543
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,574
because they won't be scared.

544
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,141
Oh, you can't
tell me, can you?

545
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,579
Well, I think I'm just goingto tickle you until you

546
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,147
tell me exactly how you did it.

547
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,235
[laughter]
Do you give up?

548
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,410
Do you give up?
Do you give up?

549
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,020
- Yes, yes, yes.
- OK, tell me how.

550
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,326
Don't tickle me.

551
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,372
I've put magnets in
the window frames,

552
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:43,723
and I used a massive

554
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,596
Not an electromagnetic pulse.

555
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:48,641
No, no, no.

556
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,295
Oh, my God, you're so clever.

557
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,209
Go to sleep.

558
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,472
[laughter]

559
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:54,429
Night night.

560
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,387
See you in the morning.

561
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,998
Good night, Liz.

562
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,913
Good night, Andy.

00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,049
Who's that?

568
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,137
Sorry.

569
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,225
I fell asleep.

570
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,966
I'm going.

571
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:53,880
Is Andrew all right?

572
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,842
Well, he was very upset.

573
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:00,887
He's asleep now.

574
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:11,201
Look, I'm very sorryabout that scene in there.

575
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:16,163
My brother and I have
some unresolved issues.

576
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,687
It must all seem
pretty pathetic.

577
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,519
Dr. Keaton, may I?

578
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:34,094
I think you should know
tonight, Andy asked

579
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:37,924
me if you murdered his mother.

580
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,447
Did he?

581
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:43,669
Well, I said I
didn't think so, but--

582
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,671
I appreciate the
vote of confidence.

583
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:54,419
I keep trying to
find the liar in you,

584
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:56,159
but I just don't see it.

585
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,553
Really?

586
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,948
You're one of the
few that doesn't.

587
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,645
I was lucky
enough to be married

588
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,952
to a man who didn't lie.

589
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:09,259
So I think I know
what to look for.

590
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,828
I didn't know that
you were married.

591
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,701
You never asked.

592
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:18,399
Are you still married?

593
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,792
No.

594
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,141
He died.

595
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,055
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm becoming a little clumsy.

597
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,670
That's OK.

598
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,501
I don't understand you.

599
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,852
Now he's such a
wonderful little boy.

600
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,114
He's bright.

601
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,813
He's sensitive.

602
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,598
Why do you keep
pushing him away?

603
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,078
I provide him witheverything that he needs,

604
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,428
the best that money can buy.

605
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,605
Yeah, but he needs
love and affection.

606
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:54,783
That's what I hired you for.

607
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,180
Doesn't it bother you?

608
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,137
He's your son.

609
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:10,451
I provide for him,
but he is not my son.

611
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,071
Andy, are you ready?

612
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:23,203
[knocking on door]
Come on.

613
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,117
Let's go.

614
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,992
You can't go on a picnic
dressed like that.

615
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,820
I can dress any way I want.

616
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,213
You do.

617
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:36,695
I dress appropriately,
and so should you.

618
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,914
Put on your jeans and sneakers.

619
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:43,397
All right, on conditionthat you wear your uniform,

620
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,877
and don't forget the tie.

621
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,622
ELIZABETH GUINNESS: You'll
have to help me, OK?

622
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,537
One, two, three.

623
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,978
Get some stuff out of here.

[horses neighing]

625
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,644
Well, well.

626
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,515
And I thought you were going tobe working on your manuscript

627
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:15,777
this afternoon.

628
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:16,865
Well, Jillian
convinced me that it'd

629
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,258
be more fun to go riding.

630
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,955
Yeah, fun.

631
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:23,045
The story of your life, Blain.

632
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,004
You could lighten up a
little bit, big brother.

00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:32,098
Just, just further
than the real--

636
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:34,970
Andy, it's your father.

637
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,711
Hi.

638
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,931
Hello there.

639
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,323
ANDREW KEATON: Hi.

640
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:44,240
I see we're playing
truant this afternoon.

641
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:48,027
And you, Ms. Guinness,are looking very official.

642
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:52,771
Well, I lost a
negotiated settlement.

643
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:55,425
It's a one-time-only event.

644
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,689
This is good.
May I join you?

645
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:58,516
Oh, sure.

646
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:08,351
Andrew, I'm very sorry forwhat happened last night.

647
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,179
How come you and uncle
Blain always fight?

648
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:17,230
Andy, why don't
you tell your father

649
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,231
what you were just telling me?

650
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:24,106
Well go on, Andy.

651
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:29,459
Well, what I was
saying was at the moment

652
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,592
that the black hole
is formed, time

653
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,812
freezes on the event horizon.

654
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,465
And the last photons
of light that

655
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,207
escape after the
black hole is formed

656
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:39,992
are frozen in that moment.

657
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,734
It's not on the
event horizon, Andy.

658
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:45,824
It's an infinitesimal
distance above it.

659
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,782
You wouldn't detect
time-frozen photons

660
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:50,350
if they were at the horizon.

661
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,004
Well, why don't--

662
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,527
why don't you explain thedifference to us so we know.

663
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,137
Well you have to understandthere are no margins

664
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,356
for imprecision in science.

667
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:05,191
Don't call me that.

668
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,845
Only Liz can call me Andy.

669

Only Liz!

670
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:13,678
Why did you bother
to come out here?

671
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:18,465
I was curious.

672
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,119
I couldn't imagine Andy--

673
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:23,035
Andrew, enjoying all this.

674
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,689
You were curious.

675
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,388
Well he is a child, and heneeds to learn how to play,

676
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:32,740
how to enjoy
sentiment and emotion.

677
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:37,789
Ms. Guinness, it seems thatyou are a bit of a romantic.

678
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,529
What is that supposed to mean?

679
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,532
It means that logic and reasonplay no part in your makeup.

680
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:44,230
Well, that's ridiculous.

681
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,189
I'm the most logical
person that I know.

682
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,192
I'm sorry if I
ruined your picnic.

683
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:51,106
He has to learn.

Dr. Keaton, you
go to him, please.

686
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:14,173
Just make it up to him.

687
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:16,392
Invite him to your lab tomorrow.

688
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,004
It doesn't have to be for long.

689
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:22,921
I know he'd love
to see you working.

690
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:23,791
Please.

691
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:33,322
I don't know how you can
say he's not your son.

692
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:34,846
You're exactly like him.

693
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:45,639

don't you think?

It's OK.

Andy, are you all right?

00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:41,276
There was a tree
tapping at the window.

Yeah, power's off
in the whole house.

Oh.

00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:49,632
Well, why don't we go
down to the library?

there's a fire there.

Let's go.

Have you been
awake all this time?

739
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:49,910
You snore.

740
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:54,306
I do not.

741
00:47:57,483 --> 00:47:58,179
It's very relaxing.

Do you think you couldcarry him up to his room?

For what?

748
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,339
For coming to see
why he screamed,

749
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,822
for carrying him upstairs.He won't forget.

750

I have to be sure.

Of what?

760
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,723
Whether or not I killed my wife?

761
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:33,639
I wasn't even
thinking about that.

00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,075
What then?

00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:44,911
What you have to understand isI've known real love, Richard,

764
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,435
and I won't settle
for anything less.

765

You're very brave
taking Amber for a ride.

Alycia was scared stiff of her.

Can't say I'm surprised.

780

He has scared off
three other nannies.

00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,129
So you think he did it?

Of course he did.

Why would you think otherwise?

I don't know.

785
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:03,136
It just seems really odd.

really getting along.

No.

she ever let ride her.

So where's Andy?

797
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,430

make of this, but I--

I found it in my room.

Do you think Andy wrote it?

819
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:27,525
Well, I think
that we can be quite

820
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:28,526
certain that Alycia didn't.

821
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:31,224
That's for sure.

822
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,487
Did he do this sort of thingwith the previous nannies?

823
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:34,793
Yes, but he didn't like them.

824

He likes you.

825
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:39,319
Have you shown that
to Jillian yet?

826
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,233
Yeah.

827
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:41,713

Does she?

829
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,848
My guess is that she
probably wrote it.

00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:50,199
What?

00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,464
Jillian has been in lovewith Richard for years.

She sees the way that
Richard looks at you,

833
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:59,208
and I don't think she
likes it very much.

Jillian were an item.

truth, in the instance.

So you both were,
you and your brother.

He never loved her.

He only married
her to get at me.

How can you be sure?

01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:06,679
I'll email you.

920
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,428
[music playing]

921
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:20,780
Amber's saddle girth was cut.

922
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:22,303
How do you know that?

923
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,175
I know who did it.

924
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:25,524
Who?

925
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:27,526
- She'll hear you.
- Andy, who?

926
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:28,396
Mother.

927
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:31,748
Where's the saddle?

928
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:36,361
Father took it in the
car this morning, early.

929
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,425
So you're still here.

930
01:02:57,556 --> 01:02:59,384
Where's the saddle?

931
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:01,647
What saddle?

932
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,867
The one you took to town.

933
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:06,391
The saddle I was riding on.

934
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:08,741
The saddle that got cut.

935
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,048
- How did you know that?
- Andy told me.

936
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:16,053
I just took it
over to the sheriff.

937
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:16,967
Get in.

938
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,622
Look.

939
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:25,410
If you don't believe
me, here is the receipt.

940
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,544
Received one riding saddle,brown English for Dr. R Keaton

941
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,416
for evidentiary purposes.

942
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,679
You see, it's signed
Sam Getting, [inaudible]

943
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,595
River County Sheriff.

944
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:37,988
Why didn't you just tell me?

945
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:44,603
Because if I had, I knewyou would never leave.

946
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:51,871
Liz, I was scared for you.

947
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,701
I was afraid something likethis might happen again.

948
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,486
So please do get in.

949
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,848
Sending you away like thatwas one of the hardest things

950
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,980
I've ever done.

951
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:15,416
I'm very sorry.

952
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:17,854
You must never lie to
me like that again, OK?

953
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,290
I am a grown-up.

954
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,422
I don't need to beprotected from the truth,

955
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:22,771
and I'm not leaving.
- There.

956
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:23,642
You see?

957
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:24,991
I can't leave now.

958
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:27,776
Liz, somebody
tried to kill you,

959
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,953
somebody who knew youwere going to ride Amber.

960
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,869
Richard, everyone
knew I was riding Amber.

961
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:33,826
Well, that narrows it down.

962
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:42,879
How did Andy know
the girth had been cut?

963
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:44,358
I thought you told him.

964
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:45,272
Me?

965
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:47,187
No.

966
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:49,363
I think I'm going to
have a word with him.

967
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:52,105
Oh no, let's not frighten himany more than he already is.

968
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,631
I don't know.

969
01:04:56,762 --> 01:05:00,113
Maybe I could take him camping.

970
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:00,984
Camping?

971
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:02,768
Yeah.

972
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,249
I used to go with my brothersall the time when I was a kid.

973
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:08,252
Pretty easy to talk whenyou're lying in your sleeping

974
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:09,296
bag staring at the stars.

975
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:14,040
I think he needs to talk.

976
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:19,219
Mrs. Pram says
you're not leaving!

977
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:20,394
- That's right.
- Really?

978
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:22,092
Really.

979
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:23,267
Does that mean I don't haveto go away to any school?

980
01:05:23,397 --> 01:05:24,181
I think so.

981
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,878
Yes.

982
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,445
I'm so happy.

983
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:28,968
I got all this stuff out.

984
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:31,101
And I thought to celebrate,we could go camping.

985
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:32,015
What do you say?

986
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:33,277
- Camping?
- Yeah.

987
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:34,060
- Really?
- Mhmm.

988
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,453
Go and get ready.

989
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:36,497
Well you look like
you're feeling better.

990
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:37,934
- I am.
- Go and get ready.

991
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:39,370
Long pants and long sleeves.

992
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,241
Well you know myhooded ski suit and boots

993
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:42,851
would afford me very
good protection.

994
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:44,636
Andy, it's the
middle of August.

995
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:45,680
See you later.

996
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,247
We're going camping, Jilly!

997
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:49,684
Yes!

998
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:51,556
Oh, camping.

999
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,645
How quaint.

1000
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:56,561
What brought all this on?

1001
01:05:56,691 --> 01:06:01,305
I think you should know myfall, it wasn't an accident.

1002
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:03,916
Somebody cut the saddle girth.

1003
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,832
What?

1004
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,313
How could anyone do that?

1005
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:10,749
I don't know.

1006
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:12,316
Richard's looking into it.

1007
01:06:12,446 --> 01:06:13,621
But we're playing
safe and getting out

1008
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:14,535
of the house for the evening.

1009
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,277
I don't blame you.

1010
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:19,105
Why don't you come
to the city with me?

1011
01:06:19,236 --> 01:06:20,411
We'll have fun.

1012
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,239
You'll probably be
safer there, anyway.

1013
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:23,544
I can't.

1014
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:26,199
I promised Andy I'd
take him camping,

1015
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,810
anyway, we'll be
OK with Richard.

1016
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:29,724
Will you?

1017
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,081
Last chance.

1018
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,734
I'll be fine.

1019
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:40,605
Are you ready, Liz?

1020
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:41,519
Oh, hi, Jillian.

1021
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:42,433
Are you off?

1022
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,217
Safe trip.

1023
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:45,392
Where's Andy?

1024
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:46,219
He's looking for
a sleeping bag.

1025
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:49,614
Oh, good.

1026
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:52,573
Bye.

1027
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:53,574
Bye.

1028
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,017
A little bit more.

1029
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,541
My brothers and I used totake turns telling ghost

1030
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:07,284
stories around the camp fire.

1031
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,112
Do you want to go first, Andy?

1032
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:10,983
No.

1033
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,855
Oh, come on.

1034
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,727
You told me a kind
of ghost story

1035
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:18,643
today when you said the
ghost of your mother

1036
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:20,036
cut my saddle girth.

1037
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,863
You shouldn't
have said anything.

1038
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:23,082
I had to.

1039
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:28,087
Liz could have been killed.

1040
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:30,220
I know.

1041
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,221
Who cut it, Andy?

1042
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:32,439
We have to know.

1043
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,137
I already told you, my mother.

1044
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:35,051
Come on now.

1045
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:37,140
Don't be silly.

1046
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,099
Your mother has been
dead for five years.

1047
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,231
Who else then?

1048
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:43,581
RICHARD KEATON: You don't know?

1049
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:44,973
No.

1050
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,888
Then how did you
know it had been cut?

1051
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:50,457
I locked the saddle
in the tackle room.

1052
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,938
I diverted your email.

1053
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:53,852
You what?

1054
01:07:56,811 --> 01:08:00,076
I hacked into
your email account.

1055
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:03,557
I read the letter you sent tothe sheriff about the saddle.

1056
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:08,780
Andy, my email
has an encryption

1057
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,565
algorithm I wrote myself.

1058
01:08:11,696 --> 01:08:13,219
It wasn't that hard to hack.

1059
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:18,920
How long has this
being going on?

1060
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:23,447
I started right
after I came here.

1061
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:25,057
RICHARD KEATON: Why?

1062
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:26,537
I wanted to know
what you were thinking.

1063
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,365
You didn't talk to me very much.

1064
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:32,630
Sorry, father.

1065
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,546
Hey, come here.

1066
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:39,985
You're not half
as sorry as I am.

1067
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:03,617
Is he asleep?

1068
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:15,020
Well, at least one goodthing has come out of all this.

1069
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,630
I feel so very much
closer to Andy.

1070
01:09:21,113 --> 01:09:22,462
[chuckling]

1071
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:23,594
Diverting my email.

1072
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:29,295
A chip off the old block.

1073
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,561
I'm not sure what I
feel about that anymore.

1074
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:39,349
A year ago-- oh hell--

1075
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,438
three weeks ago, I couldn'thave imagined doing any of this.

1076
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:47,444
I have you to thank for that.

1077
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:51,839
Thank you.

1078
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:02,633
[gunshot]

1079
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:04,939
[music playing]

1080
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:06,941
Oh my god.

1081
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:07,855
What was that?
[gunshot]

1082
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:08,769
[screams]

1083
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,684
Get down!

1084
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:12,643
Get down.

1085
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:13,557
[gunshot]

1086
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:14,993
[screams]

1087
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:15,950
Father?

1088
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:18,518
Andy, come here.

1089
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:19,432
Come here.

1090
01:10:19,563 --> 01:10:20,390
It's OK.

1091
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,391
ELIZABETH GUINNESS: Nick?

1092
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,262
[gunshot]

1093
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:25,438
All right.

1094
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:27,048
Now look, you two stay here.

1095
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:28,615
Keep your heads down.
I'm going for the car.

1096
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:29,486
ELIZABETH GUINNESS: No, no.

1097
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:30,400
No, it's all right.

1098
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,879
Don't worry.

1099
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,446
Whoever it is seems
to be a lousy shot.

1100
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:41,324
That wasn't her, was it?

1101
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:44,805
That was somebody real.

1102
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:46,285
You're OK.

1103
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,243
Don't worry.

1104
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:55,599
Will you be able to sleep?

1105
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:57,644
Yes.

1106
01:10:57,775 --> 01:10:58,515
Are you sure?

1107
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:03,041
Mother's really dead.

1108
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:03,955
Yes.

1109
01:11:06,914 --> 01:11:09,265
So she can't come
back and scare anybody

1110
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:14,444
or even watch anybody, right?- No she can't.

1111
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:20,841
Good night, Liz.

1112
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:24,976
Good night, darling.

1113
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:26,760
Where'd you say
they came from?

1114
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:28,371
The north ridge.

1115
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,111
But I can show you theexact spot in the morning

1116
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:31,287
when it gets light.

1117
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,462
Well, it's most
likely a head lamp

1118
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,638
or some damn fool
who couldn't hit

1119
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:37,684
a barn door if it was moving.

1120
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:39,338
That's not hunting.

1121
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:41,166
That's plain murder,
taking a deer like that.

1122
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,690
No sheriff, I don't
think it was a hunter.

1123
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:45,605
I think it was my brother.

1124
01:11:45,736 --> 01:11:47,477
Why?

1125
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:48,391
Hello?

1126
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,044
There he is now.

1127
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:50,958
Blain.

1128
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:56,442
Is everybody all right?

1129
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:57,313
Why?

1130
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,576
Shouldn't we be?

1131
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:00,751
What's going on?

1132
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:01,926
What are you doing
here, sheriff.

1133
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:03,144
Where were you
at 10:30 tonight?

1134
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:04,450
I was on my way
home from the city.

1135
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,451
Oh, come on, Blain.

1136
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:07,235
Who are you trying to fool?

1137
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:09,847
Would someone mind explainingto me what this is all about?

1138
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,327
I know you were up
at the north ridge

1139
01:12:11,457 --> 01:12:13,024
and you fired three shots at us.

1140
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:13,894
No, I wasn't.

1141
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:15,679
Did anyone see you?

1142
01:12:15,809 --> 01:12:17,376
Well, I can't tell you whereI was at 10:30, but I can--

1143
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:20,031
Hey!

1144
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:21,641
But if you let me
get into my wallet,

1145
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:24,078
I can prove where
I was at 10:15.

1146
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:26,254
I got a speeding ticketgoing through Briggenville.

1147
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:28,518
It's 60 miles from here.

1148
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:30,041
Take it very easy.

1149
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:50,627
10:15 PM, doing 65 in a
40 in beautiful downtown

1150
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:52,237
Briggenville.

1151
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,717
Well, you have to
watch for Leonard.

1152
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:58,417
He's a terror on peoplespeeding through his town.

1153
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:02,813
Well, you won't be needing
my services any further.

1154
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,162
I think I'll just
go home and see

1155
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:06,425
what's left of the ball game.

1156
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:09,733
[music playing]

1157
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:14,433
It was a head lamper.

1158
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:15,303
Conscience bothering you?

1159
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:23,834
How the hell do you think Icould do something like that?

1160
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:26,227
Well if it wasn't
you, who was it?

1161
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:36,063
Who's there?

1162
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:37,587
It's OK, Andy.

1163
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:38,414
It's just me.

1164
01:13:41,852 --> 01:13:43,070
I wanted to see that
you were all right.

1165
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,558
Did they find out it who was?

1166
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:56,693
No, but we will.

1167
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:57,607
Come on.

1168
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:58,564
Let's tuck you back in.

1169
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:05,876
OK?

1170
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:07,312
Are you going to
marry Liz, father?

1171
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:13,927
How do you feel about
calling me "dad?"

1172
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,495
Are you going to marry Liz?

1173
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:17,409
Do you want me to?

1174
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,759
Yes.

1175
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,847
Well then, you're
going to have

1176
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:21,892
to put in a good word for me.

1177
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:29,769
Sleep well.

1178
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,252
Good night, dad.

1179
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,171
Good night, son.

1180
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:48,179
[music playing]

1181
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:57,378
[clock chiming]

1182
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:28,758
I couldn't sleep.

1183
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:31,238
Neither could
I. What happened?

1184
01:16:34,546 --> 01:16:35,765
Blain has an alibi.

1185
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,160
So it wasn't Blain.

1186
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:40,987
I didn't say that.

1187
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,296
Why do you hate
each other so much?

1188
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:53,173
Well more than anyone, Blainthinks that I killed Alycia.

1189
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:55,654
He thinks you marriedAlycia to get back at him.

1190
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:58,962
No.

1191
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:00,485
No, I loved her very much.

1192
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,095
I always loved her.

1193
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:05,272
Why do you think
she killed herself?

1194
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:08,014
I don't know.

1195
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:09,581
She wasn't that kind of woman.

1196
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:12,149
She intended to live forever.

1197
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:16,719
Maybe she did just
fall out of the window.

1198
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:17,894
What happened
the night she died?

1199
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,203
She'd been to a
party in the city.

1200
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,770
She came home drunk.

1201
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:27,643
I hated being around her
when she was like that.

1202
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,122
She started in on
me about how she'd

1203
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:30,733
married the wrong
brother, how it was

1204
01:17:30,863 --> 01:17:33,649
Blain that she really loved.

1205
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,825
She must've been
very confused.

1206
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,828
Yeah, I think she
was, and I obviously

1207
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:41,439
didn't know how to help her.

1208
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:44,660
She could be very
cruel, particularly when

1209
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,487
she was drunk.

1210
01:17:46,618 --> 01:17:48,620
And that night, she told methat Andrew was not my son,

1211
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:49,490
that he was Blain's.

1212
01:17:52,885 --> 01:17:55,235
Maybe she was just
trying to hurt you.

1213
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:57,890
Yeah, maybe.

1214
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:01,633
Or maybe she was
telling the truth.

1215
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:05,985
Anyway, I stormed out, andthose were the last words

1216
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:06,812
that passed between us.

1217
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:12,731
I couldn't deal with it.

1218
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:14,994
I shut myself down emotionally.

1219
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:18,606
Then you showed up.

1220
01:18:23,176 --> 01:18:25,701
Suddenly, I had feelings again.

1221
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:26,963
You opened my eyes.

1222
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,402
I love you, Liz.

1223
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:33,230
Oh, I know I could never beanything like your husband,

1224
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,624
but don't you feel anythingfor me, anything at all?

1225
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:43,066
This is very
hard for me to say.

1226
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:43,893
Then don't.

1227
01:18:55,556 --> 01:19:02,172
I don't think I ever lovedNick the way that I love you,

1228
01:19:02,302 --> 01:19:03,739
and I found that hard to face.

1229
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:12,008
Andy wasn't the only one
carrying around a ghost.

1230
01:19:12,138 --> 01:20:44,448
And if he can let go, so can I.

1231
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:46,580
Thank you, Mrs. Pram.

1232
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:47,843
Morning, everyone.

1233
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,022
Hi.

1234
01:20:53,152 --> 01:20:55,676
Oh, could I have some
eggs please, Mrs. Pram?

1235
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:57,417
ANDREW KEATON: Hey.

1236
01:20:57,548 --> 01:20:59,942
I'm hungry.

1237
01:21:00,072 --> 01:21:04,947
Liz, if my father
were to marry you,

1238
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:06,122
you'd be my mother, right?

1239
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:13,303
Well, that would
depend on you.

1240
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:16,784
But you'd be willing to be?

1241
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,874
Well you do
realize that mothers

1242
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,050
don't take orders like nannies.

1243
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,573
I know.

1244
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:27,056
They give them, but it'sbecause they love you.

1245
01:21:27,186 --> 01:21:30,189
Mine didn't.

1246
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,845
My mother never loved me.

1247
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,500
I'm sure she did.

1248
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,503
Hey, you know what?

1249
01:21:39,633 --> 01:21:42,375
I love you very much.

1250
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:48,468
Where are you going?

1251
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:49,339
I give up, Richard.

1252
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,296
You win.

1253
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:51,384
It's all yours.

1254
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:53,560
Last night was the last straw.

1255
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:54,822
Look, I need the money.

1256
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:56,955
So if you can raise
it, buy me out.

1257
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:58,391
No, no, you're not leaving.

1258
01:21:58,522 --> 01:21:59,523
You're not going anywhereuntil you tell me

1259
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:00,785
what you know about last night.

1260
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,960
You know it wasn't me.

1261
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:03,483
No Blain, I know
no such thing.

1262
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:06,095
Richard, you're my brother.

1263
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:07,792
I may not like you, but
I wouldn't shoot you.

1264
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,011
Why not?

1265
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:09,925
You'd have the house.

1266
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:10,882
You'd have your son.

1267
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:12,144
Seems reason enough to me.

1268
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,190
Richard, you've
got to believe me.

1269
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,845
I never slept with Alyciaafter she married you.

1270
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:19,021
Andrew is your son.

1271
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:24,635
Oh my god.

1272
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:29,945
She really had us
both, didn't she?

1273
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:23,955
Good evening, Mrs. Pram.

1274
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:25,435
Where are you off to?

1275
01:23:25,565 --> 01:23:26,610
Dr. Keaton left me a note.

1276
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,872
He needs some things from town.

1277
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:51,330

01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:02,298
Liz, are you in there?

1282
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:06,041
Can you come and play with me?

1283
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:07,738
Liz, are you sleeping?

1284
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:08,826
Liz!

1285
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:09,740

ANDREW KEATON [ON RADIO]:Dad, are you there?

1288
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:05,752
Are you there?

1289
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:06,623
Yes, Andy.
What is it?

1290
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:07,537
It's Liz.

1291
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,147
She's in big trouble.

1292
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:10,017
What's wrong?

1293
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,106
It's Jillian.

1294
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:13,195
She took her to the east tower.

1295
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:14,109
Jillian.

1296
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:20,245
Andy, are you sure?

1297
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:21,159
Hurry, dad.

1298
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,073
She's got a gun!

1299
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:23,248
A gun?

1300
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:30,386
Andy, I'm locked in.

1301
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:32,083
Get up here fast and let me out.- I can't!

1302
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:32,953
I'm locked in, too.

1303
01:25:38,785 --> 01:25:41,005
Dad, are you there.

1304
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,441
Yeah Andy, I'm here.

1305
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:46,750
Now listen, listen
to me very carefully.

The rope fire ladder isunderneath your computer table.

1307
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,406
Get it out.

1308
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:51,885
Dad, I'm scared.

1309
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,322
RICHARD KEATON [ONRADIO]: That's all right.

1310
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:56,325
Brave boys get
scared, too, but they

1311
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:57,891
still do what they have to.

1312
01:25:58,022 --> 01:26:00,503
Do you understand?

1313
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:01,808
Yes.

1314
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,506
RICHARD KEATON [ON
RADIO]: Good boy.

1315
01:26:03,636 --> 01:26:05,290
Then do it.
Do it, Andy.

1316
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:07,292
Do it for Liz.

1317
01:26:07,423 --> 01:26:08,728
OK, dad.

1318
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:27,094
Oh my god.

1319
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:30,576
Jillian.

1320
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:50,422
Andy, are you all right?

1321
01:26:50,553 --> 01:26:51,336
Talk to me.

1322
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:57,081
Why are you doing this to me?

1323
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,387
I lost him once.

1324
01:26:58,517 --> 01:27:00,084
I'm not going to let
that happen again.

1325
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,478
Please Jillian, let's
just talk about this.

1326
01:27:02,608 --> 01:27:04,654
Oh, there's nothing
to talk about.

1327
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:06,351
Why don't you just move
towards the window?

1328
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,197
Don't be crazy.

1329
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:27,894
You'll never get away with it.

1330
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:33,683
I did before, and
no one found out.

1331
01:27:33,813 --> 01:27:36,512
I followed her back
here from the party.

1332
01:27:36,642 --> 01:27:41,560
She was drunk, and
she was mocking me.

1333
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:45,347
She had Richard, and
she knew I loved him.

1334
01:27:45,477 --> 01:27:47,827
It didn't take much to push her.

1335
01:27:54,443 --> 01:27:55,922
Good boy.

1336
01:27:56,053 --> 01:27:59,230
Please Jillian, why
are you doing this?

1337
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,492
Why?

1338
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,581
Why?

1339
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:06,193
Because you spoiled it all.

1340
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:10,154
All these years
I waited for him.

1341
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,852
And in three weeks,
you have destroyed

1342
01:28:12,983 --> 01:28:15,115
everything I worked for.

1343
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:19,250
But Richard will
know that you did it.

1344
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:20,904
Well, maybe I
don't care anymore.

1345
01:28:24,908 --> 01:28:25,778
Jillian, stop this.

1346
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:30,305
Come on now.

1347
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:31,218
Put down the gun.

1348
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:32,132
Put it down.

1349
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:38,443
You never loved me, did you?

1350
01:28:38,574 --> 01:28:42,273
No Jillian, I didn't.

1351
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:43,883
And I'm truly sorry
if I ever gave

1352
01:28:44,014 --> 01:28:44,884
you the impression that I did.

1353
01:28:48,497 --> 01:28:56,548
All these years I never
wanted anyone but you.

1354
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:57,506
Oh, god.

1355
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:01,901
[inaudible]

1356
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:02,772
RICHARD KEATON: No!

1357
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:18,091
[crying]

1358
01:29:27,187 --> 01:29:28,711
I've got an idea, Richard.

1359
01:29:28,841 --> 01:29:30,365
All we have to do is selloff 10 acres at the far end

1360
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:33,759
of the property, pay off allour debts, fix up the old pile,

1361
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:34,934
and we live happily ever after.

1362
01:29:35,065 --> 01:29:35,892
Do it.

1363
01:29:36,022 --> 01:29:37,372
Well, that's it?

1364
01:29:37,502 --> 01:29:38,547
You're not going
to argue about it?

1365
01:29:38,677 --> 01:29:41,071
I have no time
to argue, Blain.

1366
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:42,464
I am off on my honeymoon.

1367
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:44,422
Dad, I want to come
on your honeymoon.

1368
01:29:44,553 --> 01:29:45,380
Oh, no, no.

1369
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,468
Children are not allowed.

1370
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:47,991
Well, that's not fair.

1371
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,558
I put in a good word foryou just like you asked.

1372
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:50,950
Didn't I, Liz?

1373
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:52,256
It's true.

1374
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,345
Ha, this is a conspiracy.

1375
01:29:54,476 --> 01:29:55,607
It's outrageous.

1376
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:57,304
Well, you are
going to need someone

1377
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:58,784
to go fishing with while Ifinished reading "Jane Eyre."

1378
01:29:58,915 --> 01:29:59,872
Mhmm.

1379
01:30:00,003 --> 01:30:00,917
Of course you can.
Come on.

1380
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:01,787
Hop in.

1381
01:30:01,918 --> 01:30:02,788
Yay.

1382
01:30:02,919 --> 01:30:03,659
Are the bags in the car?

1383
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:04,573
Yeah.

1384
01:30:04,703 --> 01:30:05,574
Good.

1385
01:30:05,704 --> 01:30:08,881
Blain, thanks for the car.

1386
01:30:09,012 --> 01:30:10,622
What are brothers for?

1387
01:30:10,753 --> 01:30:11,580
Bye, Blain.

1388
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,798
Bye bye, guys.

1389
01:30:12,929 --> 01:30:13,973
- Goodbye, uncle Blain.
- Bye, Andy.

1390
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:14,844
Bye Mrs. Pram.

1391
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:15,932
Bye bye.

See you soon.
