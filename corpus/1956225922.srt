1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,606
(slow somber tone)

2
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:18,752
- Jeremy

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,255
Jeremy, wake up.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,953
Come on

5
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,623
let's go to bed.

6
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:01,061
(heavy breathing)

7
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,299
* Let's go outside

8
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,770
* And talk to the birds

9
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,243
* I heard there
 was something bout

10
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,146
* Not being heard

11
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,083
* And we talked

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,155
* All through the night.

13
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,923
* We talked all

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,095
* Through the night.

15
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,534
* Let's go outside

16
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,173
* And play in the grass

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,778
* We can plant chestnuts then

18
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,382
* And hope that they root

19
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,719
* And we played

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,590
* All through the night

21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,259
* We played

22
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,628
* All

23
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,631
* Through the night

24
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,069
* Let's go outside

25
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,641
* And cry in the dark

26
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:26,280
* We can hide nothing there

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,918
* Except being (inaudible lyric)

28
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:34,222
* And we cried

29
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,125
* All through the night

30
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,061
* We cried

31
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:45,233
* All through the night

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,407
- Didn't you take
 Math 33 last quarter?

33
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,309
- Yeah.

34
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,143
Yeah.

35
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,214
- You never showed up
 after the first week.

36
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,549
- I had to drop it.

37
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,317
I got really swamped
 with my other classes.

38
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,921
- Oh, that's happened to
me way too many times.

39
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,756
Scott.

40
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,158
- I'm Jeremy.

41
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,160
- Can I sit?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,994
- Sure.

43
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,305
- I don't mean to be weird but

44
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,739
the first couple of days
that you were in class

45
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,543
I kind of thought that
 maybe you were staring at me

46
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,714
or was it the guy next to
 me that caught your eye?

47
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,750
- It was you.

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,851
- I knew it.

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,355
- You just reminded
 me of somebody.

50
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,189
- Who?

51
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,293
- My roommate.

52
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,594
- Dorm roommate?

53
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,861
- No, I live off campus.

54
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,096
- Oh, me too.

55
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,798
Yeah, I got a great
 place near campus.

56
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,832
I love waking up late

57
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,801
walking no class no rush.

58
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:54,635
- Yeah.

59
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,836
- Yeah.

60
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,770
- Pretty lucky.

61
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,605
- Yeah.

62
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,277
I just started
 learning how to cook.

63
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,546
(Scott laughs)

64
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:10,518
I was wondering if you wanted
 to come over for dinner?

65
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:11,719
- Maybe another time.

66
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,220
- Come on I make this
 great pasta dish.

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,923
Come on guaranteed
 you'll love it.

68
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,159
- Thanks but I should probably

69
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,228
Just I should probably
 - [Scott] No, no take

70
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,930
one bite of my gourmet cooking.

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,864
- Gourmet.

72
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,165
- Yeah.

73
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,600
- I thought you said
 you just started.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,169
- I learn fast and
 if you don't like it

75
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,341
then I'll take you to any
 restaurant you pick, okay?

76
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:36,877
- Okay.

77
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,314
- All right (laughing).

78
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,283
Made it from scratch.

79
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,723
- Thanks.

80
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,431
Mm,

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,569
this is delicious.

82
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,236
- Always is.

83
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,472
- Wow,

84
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,640
it seems like you want
 a career as a chef.

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,475
- No,

86
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,443
only as a hobby.

87
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,612
See what I'm really
 into is engineering

88
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,814
like mechanical engineering like

89
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,750
love machines making
 them work perfectly.

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,952
What are you into?

91
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:19,787
- Um,

92
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,425
just having a nice quiet life

93
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,993
I guess.

94
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,895
- No, I meant like
 what do you study?

95
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,230
- Oh, linguistics.

96
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,533
- I don't know
 anything about that.

97
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,802
- Um, just basically
 the study of language

98
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,905
how it's formed,
 how it's structured.

99
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,407
Yeah.

100
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,375
- All right, what kind of
 jobs are there for that?

101
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,776
- Not that many.

102
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,247
But I mean you know if I get
 into a really good grad school

103
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,550
then I'll probably find a job.

104
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,285
But I have to get my GPA way up.

105
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,155
I'll find a job.

106
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,393
- You know I got something
 that would go perfect

107
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,193
with this pasta.

108
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,662
You're gonna love it.

109
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,496
- Okay.

110
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,740
- No wine for me.

111
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,409
- You don't like wine?

112
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,644
- No, I do.

113
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,947
No, I really like it I just um

114
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,148
Not tonight.

115
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,750
- Why?

116
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,752
- Uh, I got my reasons.

117
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,063
Look I should've told you this.

118
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,265
My roommate

119
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,401
he's uh

120
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,371
He's not just my roommate.

121
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,839
- Oh.

122
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,074
- I mean he's been telling
 me we should break up.

123
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,542
He wants to end it
 then he doesn't.

124
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,478
And he says he's just trying
 to get over his issues.

125
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,980
- Yeah, everybody has issues.

126
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,986
- Yeah, well, his issues
 just happen to be other guys.

127
00:06:58,986 --> 00:06:59,820
- Oh.

128
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,590
- But you know he says
 a lot of couples have

129
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,257
open relationships.

130
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,259
But then he comes back to me

131
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,961
and he apologizes for days

132
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,697
and says he won't do it again

133
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,132
and tells me he loves me and

134
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,604
- How long you been with the

135
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:17,671
- Elliot.
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

136
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,839
Um, two years.

137
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,210
Yeah, two really good years.

138
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,583
Yeah, he's the only guy
I've ever been with.

139
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,752
- You wanna change that?

140
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,123
- Maybe I don't know.

141
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,192
(slow somber music)

142
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,046
[Jeremy] Oh, man, oh.

143
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,418
- [Scott] You want
 me to keep going?

144
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,187
- No, no, I'm sorry.

145
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,557
- [Scott] Really?

146
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,390
- Yeah.

147
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,325
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,128
- [Scott] No problem.

149
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:22,703
It's always better
 whenever you're sure.

150
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,971
To being sure.

151
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,476
- I better go.

152
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,312
- Right.

153
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,716
You wanna take home some pasta.

154
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,719
I'll put it in a
 container for you.

155
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,627
(birds chirping)

156
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:00,841
- Elliot.

157
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,015
Elliot.

158
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,160
(phone ringing)

159
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,763
- [Voiceover] Hey,
 leave a message

160
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,332
and I'll get back to
 you as soon as I can.

161
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,334
(beep)

162
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,469
- Beautiful California here.

163
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,172
- Hey.

164
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,641
(laughing) Don't be shy.

165
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,475
Hey, Rachael.

166
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,710
Hey, Gavin.

167
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,878
- Hey, mom.

168
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,545
- Hope you're
 having a great time.

169
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,047
God knows we are.

170
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,353
- [Jeremy] We're gonna go
 on the Ferris Wheel later.

171
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,691
(slow tempo drum beat)

172
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,182
- Hi.

173
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,451
- Hi

174
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:55,923
- Jeremy.

175
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,795
- I don't wanna hear it.

176
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,196
- Let me explain.

177
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,167
I'm just not ready to be in

178
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,103
an exclusive kind
 of relationship.

179
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,439
It isn't fair to you or me.

180
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:19,112
We're way too young to
 know what we really want.

181
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,581
- You sure about that?

182
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,415
- Yes.

183
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,288
- Then you should move out.

184
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,360
- Jeremy, I love you.

185
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,464
- I don't wanna hear it.

186
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,299
- Come on look at me.

187
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,770
Don't you believe me?

188
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,603
- No.

189
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,176
- All right I guess

190
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,179
I guess I'll move out.

191
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,382
Love you.

192
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,175
(water running)

193
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,424
- Is everything okay?

194
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,559
- I hope you're hungry.

195
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,495
- I was just about
 to start cooking.

196
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,466
That's not the leftovers
that I gave you.

197
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,635
- I made it from scratch.

198
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,575
Maybe we could try it
 with some of the wine

199
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,410
you said was so good.

200
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,948
- I've got a couple bottles.

201
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,118
- That should just about do it.

202
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,787
- Oh (laughter)

203
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,023
enter, sir.

204
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,815
(heavy breathing)

205
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,191
Want me to take off my shirt?

206
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,659
- Yeah.

207
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,501
- [Scott] I got the
 drawer full of Bull.

208
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,337
(birds chirping)

209
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,377
- Hey, Rachael. Hey, Gavin.
 - [Jeremy] Hey, mom.

210
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,214
- Hope you're
 having a great time.

211
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,621
- They used to look
 so happy together.

212
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:18,291
- Jeremy acted happy
 so you wouldn't worry.

213
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,129
He wouldn't talk about it but

214
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,798
I knew there was
 something wrong with them.

215
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,303
- He looks happy with this one.

216
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,939
- Hey, mom,

217
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:32,772
dad

218
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,343
check it out.

219
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,913
- I know I'm sure
 as hell am happy.

220
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,049
He's gonna be an engineer.

221
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,150
- Job security.

222
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,651
- Yes, thank God.

223
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,223
- [Scott] Hey.

224
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,359
- So this is the guy.

225
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,027
- I'm the guy, hey.

226
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,663
- He's pretty cool.

227
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:00,033
(electronic dance music)

228
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,769
(inaudible dialog)

229
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,272
(girl laughs)

230
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,909
- All right, pour me some.

231
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,638
- [Female} He
 looks like an angel

232
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,073
just like me.

233
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,509
- There's angels everywhere.

234
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,579
- [Male Partygoer] Hey, see you.

235
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,221
You are so cute.

236
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,289
- And you are so buzzed.

237
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,691
Oh, I'm just getting started

238
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,493
but I do have an idea.

239
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,301
- Hey, I'll be back.

240
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,302
- Don't go.

241
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,340
- [Scott] Hey, what
the hell are you doing?

242
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,575
- [Male Partygoer] Hey,
 Scott, I was just telling your

243
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,777
very cute boyfriend
that it would be so nice

244
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,180
to see you on the
 left side of the bed

245
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,581
him on the right

246
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,852
and me right in the middle.

247
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,656
- Is that what you want?

248
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,523
- He's just buzzed.

249
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,725
He's only joking.

250
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,829
- [Male Partygoer]
 No, I'm very serious.

251
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,831
- Thanks but no thanks.

252
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,637
- Male Partygoer] Okay,
I'm not going anywhere.

253
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:49,109
(slow ringing tone]

254
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,379
(pulsating drum beat)

255
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,252
- [Voiceover] Something's
 wrong with them.

256
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,689
Something's wrong with him.

257
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,591
(electronic dance music)

258
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,759
- Let's go home.

259
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,927
- You tired?

260
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,897
- Not at all, not tired at all.

261
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,765
- Neither am I.

262
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,600
Come on.

263
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,414
(slow mellow tone)

264
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,827
(inaudible mumbled voice)

265
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,972
(faint voices whispering)

266
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,384
(slow mellow tone)

267
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,710
- You should wear
 something different.

268
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,779
- I told 'em plenty of
 times that these are

269
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,247
cheap, they're easy to clean,

270
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,483
and they look good enough.

271
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,553
- You think I should wear a tie?

272
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,388
- No.

273
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,360
There's nothing to worry about.

274
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,263
(doorbell chimes)

275
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,404
- [Scott] Hey.

276
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,571
- [Bill] Hey.

277
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,280
- Hope traffic wasn't too bad.

278
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,781
- [Bill] It was bad.

279
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,219
- Yeah, well, you made it
 here on time dinner's ready.

280
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,720
- Happy birthday.

281
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,156
- Hello, sir.

282
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,592
- Sir, I think you're uh

283
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,094
making your friend nervous.

284
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,696
- I'm not nervous.

285
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,598
- Right.

286
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,167
Something smells good.

287
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,570
- I showed Jeremy how
 to make your favorite.

288
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,339
- [Bill] My son's a good cook.

289
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,806
I hope you are too.

290
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,107
- [Scott] Dad, you
 mind if I open this?

291
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,610
- [Bill] Yeah, yeah go ahead.

292
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,455
- [Scott] Thank you.

293
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,056
- Okay, let's eat.

294
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,166
So, Jeremy, do your
folks live around here.

295
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,136
- We're from New Hampshire.

296
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,205
- That's far away.

297
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,374
- His folks will
 be here in a month.

298
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,309
They want to meet me.

299
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,144
- So they know
 all about you two.

300
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,384
- Yeah, they have
 no problem with us.

301
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,786
You have a problem with us?

302
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,725
- When do you finish school?

303
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,793
- Next year.

304
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,696
- Scott will be done this year.

305
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,564
He's got engineering jobs
 waiting all over the place

306
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,765
Texas, Oregon.

307
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,667
- I don't think
 I'll be doing that.

308
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,803
- You're taking
 one of those jobs.

309
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,339
- I'm gonna finish my
 Master's here first.

310
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,773
I don't know it depends.

311
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,741
- It depends on what?

312
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,643
- A lot of things.

313
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,378
- Scott, those kind of offers

314
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,013
they don't come
 around every day.

315
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,014
- I know.

316
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,282
- I don't think you do.

317
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,850
- I can do whatever I want

318
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,118
that's what you
 don't understand.

319
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,620
It's my decision.

320
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,856
- Yes, it is.

321
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,261
Time to hit the road.

322
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,830
- You can't drive back tonight.

323
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,832
- [Bill] I got a job
 to finish tomorrow.

324
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,199
I can't be losing customers.

325
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,200
Good night.

326
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,609
- [Scott] What the
hell is wrong with you.

327
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,817
(electronic dance music)

328
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,739
- Scott.

329
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,524
You gotta get more sleep.

330
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:05,725
- This is the best
 work I've ever done.

331
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,627
Check it out.

332
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,729
- It's a lot of numbers.

333
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,535
- I told you math was my thing.

334
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,044
It's not right.

335
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,280
It's absolutely not right.

336
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:34,320
I got a lot of studying to
 do just let me finish this.

337
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,060
You'll figure this out.

338
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,961
You will figure this out.

339
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,463
You'll figure this out.

340
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,764
You'll figure this out.

341
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,165
You'll figure this out.

342
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,867
You'll figure it out.

343
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,769
You'll figure this out.

344
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,242
(faint ominous laughter)

345
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,057
- Hey, Scott.

346
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,160
What's the matter.

347
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,097
- Man, we need to
 get some more wine

348
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,599
a whole lot more.

349
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,902
Some fine wine.

350
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,440
- You studied all week for this.

351
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,443
- The professor's out to get me.

352
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,279
I know he's talking
 behind my back

353
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,448
that asshole.

354
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,821
Can't concentrate.

355
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,159
- That's 'cause you're
 not sleeping enough.

356
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:47,994
- Yeah.

357
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,831
- Here come here.

358
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,433
Come here.

359
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,913
(faint voices whispering)

360
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,249
(sinister laughter)

361
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,785
My parents will
 be here tomorrow.

362
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,854
Let's go get some sleep.

363
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:27,867
- [Rachael] So your father
 found this great restaurant.

364
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,201
- [Gavin] If your friend
doesn't show up soon

365
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,337
we're gonna lose or reservation.

366
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,005
- [Jeremy] He should
 be here any minute.

367
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:33,940
- [Rachael] Well,
 if he's too busy

368
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,975
we can meet him tomorrow.

369
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,611
- [Jeremy] No, he's just
 been studying a lot lately.

370
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,312
He's got a few tests

371
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,582
but he really wanted
 to meet you guys

372
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,184
before he gets even busier.

373
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,319
(knocking)

374
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,488
- Oh, that should be him.

375
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,860
(slow dramatic music)

376
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,494
(door opens)

377
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,329
- [Jeremy] Hey,

378
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,197
is everything all right.

379
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,532
- [Scott] Yeah.

380
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,071
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

381
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:05,972
- You too.

382
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,375
- Nice to meet you.

383
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,343
Can I get you
 something to drink?

384
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,679
- Sure, thanks.

385
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,915
- Anything in particular?

386
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:19,518
(faint whispering voices)

387
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,723
Something the matter?

388
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,959
(faint whispering voices)

389
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,461
- Mineral water is pretty good.

390
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,529
- All right.

391
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,802
- [Jeremy] Are you okay?

392
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,871
- [Voiceover] Don't be nervous.

393
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,974
(slow ringing tone)

394
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,845
- Why didn't you let
 me open the bottle?

395
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,446
- Excuse me.

396
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,982
- There's something
 in the water.

397
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,250
He's trying to poison me.

398
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,219
I won't let him.
- [Jeremy] No.

399
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,454
(faint whispering voices)

400
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,457
(slow ringing tone)

401
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,066
(sinister laughter)

402
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,802
- [Scott] Go away,
 get away from me.

403
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,039
(indistinct dialect)

404
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,207
(slow ringing tone)

405
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,709
(inaudible dialect)

406
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,111
(pulsating drum beat)

407
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,079
I can't concentrate.
 - [Jeremy] Look at me.

408
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,080
Look at me.

409
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,252
- I'm here.

410
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,422
(crying) I'm here.

411
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,257
I'm here.

412
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,369
(machine beeping)

413
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,173
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 13301

414
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,645
(indistinct mumbled voice)

415
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:56,348
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 13301

416
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:05,925
- We've given him
 medication that calmed him

417
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,326
so he's sleeping.

418
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,628
- Scott told me that
 his head was hurting.

419
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,765
Do you think that he has
 some kind of brain tumor?

420
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,201
- We'll be checking
 on all possibilities.

421
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:18,137
- The young man kept
 saying he heard voices

422
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,673
that wouldn't stop
 screaming at him.

423
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,474
- So this is a

424
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,576
It's a symptom of schizophrenia.

425
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,479
- Like a nervous
 breakdown from stress?

426
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,250
- After some tests
 we'll know more.

427
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,153
- [Gavin] Has any of Scott's
 family been contacted?

428
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,122
- [Doctor] We're trying
to contact his father.

429
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,724
- [Gavin] Anyone else?

430
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:41,894
- The only contact information
 we do have is for his father.

431
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,565
I need to continue my rounds.

432
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:50,536
- Do you know how to get
 a hold of Scott's mother?

433
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,238
- No, he never wanted
 to talk about her

434
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,307
or any of his
 family just his dad.

435
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,944
- Well, there's
 gotta be someone.

436
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,812
Maybe you could call one
of his friends and ask?

437
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,314
- Gavin, leave that for later.

438
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,352
The doctors will
 take care of him.

439
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,121
(slow dramatic tone)

440
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,424
- I ran into an old
 friend from college.

441
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,796
His daughter had to be
 taken to the hospital.

442
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,365
It was schizophrenia.

443
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,633
- Is the girl better?

444
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,037
- No, my friend spent
 every penny he had

445
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,707
all kinds of hospitals.

446
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,509
His daughter ended
 up running off.

447
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,344
She hasn't been found.

448
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:37,183
If Scott has the same thing,

449
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,052
he'll need full-time care.

450
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,788
Jeremy shouldn't do that.

451
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,791
He has his whole
 life ahead of him.

452
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,427
(rapid typing)

453
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,663
(slow dramatic music)

454
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,871
- Yeah,

455
00:28:58,871 --> 00:28:59,705
that's it.

456
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,850
- What is going on with me?

457
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,118
I got so much studying to do.

458
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,921
I got to get out of here.

459
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:18,124
- Scott, I need the
 truth about something.

460
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,392
Did you ever take drugs
when I wasn't around?

461
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,227
- No.

462
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,030
- How about before you met me

463
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,433
any of those years that
you lost from school?

464
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,603
- No, maybe it's a brain
 tumor that's causing this.

465
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:36,008
They can fix that can't they?

466
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:36,843
- Yeah.

467
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,478
- I'm so

468
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,515
I'm so tired all the time.

469
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,289
(machine beeping)

470
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,766
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 16601.

471
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,541
- The hospital called

472
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,709
and told me that
 my son might have

473
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,012
some kind of mental problems.

474
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,114
- It might be drugs
 that caused all this.

475
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,382
- Drugs.

476
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,917
- Scott swore that
 he never took any

477
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,919
but if the blood
 tests show that he did

478
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,687
then he could get better.

479
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,923
- [Bill] Who would've
 given him drugs?

480
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,324
- I don't know.

481
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,393
- You know he had
 some wild friends.

482
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,727
You hang out with them too?

483
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,429
- Sir, I promise I

484
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,998
- Don't sir me.

485
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,132
Do not sir me.

486
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm gonna stay here.

487
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,821
(heavy breathing)

488
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,174
- You are correct.

489
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,977
Taking some drugs can cause
 symptoms of schizophrenia

490
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,179
but taking drugs
 doesn't cause it.

491
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,448
The test were repeated
 several times.

492
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,216
No drugs were in his blood,

493
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,585
no signs of brain tumors.

494
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,688
But Scott is responding
well to the medicine.

495
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,658
It was very helpful that you
 brought him in right away.

496
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,694
- I read online that if
 someone like Scott is not

497
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:39,465
violent or suicidal that
 he can decide what to do.

498
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,732
- Correct.

499
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,169
- Doctor, tell my son
 how difficult it is to

500
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,803
take care of someone
 with this condition.

501
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,305
- I can handle it.

502
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,608
I'll learn how

503
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,343
do whatever it takes.

504
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,981
(door opens)

505
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,750
- I've been telling my
 dad that I feel fine

506
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,787
and pretty soon
 I'll get out of here

507
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,756
studying back to it, graduate,

508
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,625
get a job all that.

509
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,794
- [Bill] Yeah, no
 doubt, no doubt

510
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,562
no doubt in my mind.

511
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,700
- But I'm staying with Jeremy

512
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,768
if that's what he wants.

513
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,973
- It is.

514
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,376
- Well, listen, maybe
 you should rest.

515
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,845
- No, listen I'm sick
 of laying around.

516
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:30,482
Look I'll make a
kick ass dinner.

517
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,884
- My parents really
 want to meet you.

518
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,120
- Yeah.

519
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,888
(machine beeps)

520
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,805
- Would you like some
 more Mrs. Driscoll?

521
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,508
- It was very good but I'm full.

522
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,811
- We still have some white
 wine if anybody wants some.

523
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,015
- [Gavin] Thank you
 but we have to go.

524
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,683
- Okay.

525
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,988
- I can make some coffee.

526
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,490
- Not for us son.

527
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,059
It'll keep us awake.

528
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,494
We have a very early flight.

529
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,934
- I'm glad we met.

530
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:23,935
- Same here.

531
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:28,074
- [Rachael] I'll call
you the minute we land.

532
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,675
- No need to worry.

533
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,813
- [Gavin] Honey,
 we can't be late.

534
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,515
- I'll walk your parents out.

535
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,617
Get the coffee ready for my dad.

536
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,152
- It'll be ready.

537
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,487
- [Scott] Well, just give me a
 minute with your folks, okay.

538
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,189
- [Jeremy] Okay, okay.

539
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,458
(slow dramatic music)

540
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,732
- Cab will be here in a minute.

541
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,070
I hope you believe

542
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,038
you understand that

543
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,907
I care for him so much.

544
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,045
Yeah.

545
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,282
We'll be all right.

546
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,822
- [Gavin] Honey, the
taxi's here we gotta go

547
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,058
- [Rachael] You take
 care of yourself.

548
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,064
- Sir, thank you.

549
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,036
(door closes)

550
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,275
- [Jeremy] Is
 everything all right?

551
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,509
- [Scott] Yep.

552
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:42,814
- [Bill] It's time for
 me to hit the road.

553
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,816
I'll be back next week.

554
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,619
- Call me whenever you get home.

555
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,121
- [Bill] Will do.

556
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,625
(door opens)

557
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,093
(door closes)

558
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,862
- Is everything okay?

559
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,365
(bell rings)

560
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,468
- Hey stranger

561
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,772
hanging out in
 your favorite spot.

562
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,440
- Yeah, I guess so.

563
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,116
- I called

564
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,487
couple times

565
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,654
left messages.

566
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,724
- I've been busy.

567
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:26,558
- Me too.

568
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,063
Heard you moved
 in with somebody.

569
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:32,898
- I did.

570
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,235
- How's that going?

571
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,068
- Good,

572
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,137
really good.

573
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,540
- Glad to hear it.

574
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:47,646
When I walked up you
 looked at me a certain way.

575
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,218
- I don't know what
 you're talking about.

576
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,520
- Think you do.

577
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:01,393
- I got to finish
 reading, Elliot.

578
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:02,228
- Okay.

579
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,433
I'll see you around.

580
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,408
- Hey.

581
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,446
It says they just need
 to be taken exactly

582
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:22,881
as the instructions say.

583
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,317
- I'm good doing that.

584
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,151
- Good.

585
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,288
It's important.

586
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,174
You been reading all night.

587
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,077
- Got of lot of
 catching up to do.

588
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,716
- We have a lot of
 catching up to do.

589
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,155
- Doctor said I can't do
that for a week or two.

590
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:04,990
- Why?

591
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,960
- Mine's not working.

592
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,362
- With the medicine.

593
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,930
- Yeah.

594
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,831
- Oh, okay.

595
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:16,568
Okay.

596
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,311
- But yours shouldn't
 have a problem.

597
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,022
- Scott,

598
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:39,858
oh man.

599
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,998
(slow dramatic music)

600
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:25,504
(slow dramatic music)

601
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,535
- We're celebrating.

602
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,470
- What's the occasion.

603
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,173
- I checked my grades
got an A in everything.

604
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,610
Yeah.

605
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,744
- That's good.

606
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,679
- Now for the surprise.

607
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,718
All is working like it should.

608
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,853
- No problems at all?

609
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,555
- I did a test run.

610
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,890
- With who?

611
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,225
- A good friend

612
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,365
whom I cheat on you
with from time to time.

613
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,199
- Okay.

614
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,336
Well,

615
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,271
here

616
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,375
- The wine's all yours.

617
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,545
I don't, I don't need it.

618
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,318
- To good friends.

619
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,153
- Cheers.

620
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,042
(slow somber tone)

621
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,783
[Scott] You never gave up on me.

622
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,652
(car alarm)

623
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:03,562
(phone chimes)

624
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,057
(phone dials)

625
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,562
- [Scott] This is Scott leave
 a message after the beep.

626
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,429
- Hey, Scott, it's me.

627
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,365
Just wondering where you are.

628
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,700
Just give me a call
 when you get this.

629
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,035
I'll talk to you soon, bye.

630
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,805
- You'll figure this out.

631
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,139
You'll figure it out.

632
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,074
You'll figure this out.

633
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,009
You'll figure this out.

634
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,515
This is not possible.

635
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:01,519
- [Voiceover] You failed it.

636
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,854
He's worthless.

637
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,457
(slow ringing tone)

638
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,960
- Quit hiding behind
 the bushes asshole.

639
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,895
(slow ringing tone)

640
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:13,398
(faint voices whispering)

641
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,204
Whoa, all right I'm
 coming over there.

642
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,641
(sinister laughter)

643
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:26,044
(slow suspenseful tone)

644
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:33,184
Wait until I grab
 you by the balls.

645
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,521
(dismal dramatic beat)

646
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,077
[Scott] Not gonna happen.

647
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,078
Stop moving,

648
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,447
stop moving,

649
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:03,281
stop.

650
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,919
(dismal dramatic beat)

651
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,143
He'll kill him.

652
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,745
Stop following him.

653
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,114
Following him.

654
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,884
Stop following me.

655
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:39,885
Stop following me.

656
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,452
Stop following me.

657
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,756
Stop following me.

658
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:47,092
Stop following me.

659
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:50,328
(tense dramatic beat)

660
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,581
- [Jeremy] What happened?

661
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,251
- Somebody's been following me.

662
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,554
- There's nobody out there.

663
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:18,724
- He's out there, listen.

664
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,993
- Yeah, okay, I
 think I can hear him.

665
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:22,828
- Listen.

666
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,466
- Sounds like he's walking away.

667
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,300
- Liar.

668
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,672
(dark malevolent laughter)

669
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,274
- [Voiceover]
 He'll kill you run.

670
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:38,143
- I won't let you poison me.

671
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:40,545
(faint whispering voice)

672
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,214
- I'll kill you you understand.

673
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:48,386
(faint whispering voice)

674
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:49,855
- [Operator] 911.

675
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:50,856
- Yes, hello

676
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:52,724
I have an

677
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:54,492
I have an emergency.

678
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:04,202
(slow ringing tone)

679
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,372
(rhythmic drum beat)

680
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:16,581
- Where's dad?

681
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,583
- Back home he has to
 take care of some troubles

682
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,351
at our store.

683
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,186
- Is he

684
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:22,754
- No, he's fine.

685
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:24,255
In a couple days the
 problems will be fixed

686
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,824
and he'll be here.

687
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,194
- Is that what's
really going on?

688
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,028
- Yes.

689
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,299
I'll clean this up.

690
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,741
Looks like you haven't
 been sleeping much.

691
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,410
- As much as I can.

692
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,648
- Does Scott wanna
 keep living with you.

693
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,786
- He doesn't want me near him.

694
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:58,456
He was telling everyone
that I've been putting

695
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,125
poison in his pills.

696
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,360
- Might be a good
 idea if you took

697
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,496
some time off school, came home.

698
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,232
- Yeah, I been
 thinking about that.

699
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,066
- Good.

700
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:11,202
- I've also been thinking
 about all the times that

701
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,138
dad would get depressed.

702
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:16,274
He'd just lay on
 the couch all day

703
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,542
with that weird look on his face

704
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,545
I just never want
 to be around him.

705
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:23,815
I'm just nervous all the time.

706
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,516
- Any five year old
would be nervous around

707
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,085
someone like that.

708
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,022
- When you first met dad if
 he would've gotten sick Scott

709
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:34,960
do you think you
 would have left him?

710
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,130
- There was a time he had
 been depressed for a year.

711
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:43,134
We were in debt, bad debt.

712
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,403
He couldn't work.

713
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,973
I couldn't take it anymore.

714
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,374
You were too little to remember.

715
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,910
I left you with
 your grandmother.

716
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,846
Truth is I wanted to
runaway from everything

717
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,516
even thought your
 grandmother could raise you.

718
00:46:58,516 --> 00:46:59,817
I was so close to
 getting in my car

719
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,652
and never coming back.

720
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,656
Back then I was so busy
taking care of everybody

721
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,094
I didn't know what I
 wanted, still don't.

722
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,062
Maybe now I

723
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,032
I need time to myself.

724
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,635
- So you're leaving dad?

725
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,071
- Not sure.

726
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,543
- I don't know if
 I can leave Scott.

727
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,848
- Depends on how
deeply in love you are.

728
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,682
- Yeah.

729
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:39,390
I'm tired.

730
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,962
I don't know who I am anymore.

731
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:46,231
I just, I need someone to

732
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:47,698
I need you or somebody

733
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,467
- I love you.

734
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,936
You need no listen to me this is

735
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,803
you need to think about where
 you are in life right now.

736
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,005
- Look around you.

737
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,041
Look at where what
 I'm living in.

738
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,543
I feel like I'm going crazy

739
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,045
and where are you?

740
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,812
- I'm here, I'm here.

741
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,315
- No, I have to take
 care of you now, you see.

742
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:05,550
Because you come in here

743
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,484
and you tell me
 all your problems.

744
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:07,818
- Jeremy, I'm here for you.

745
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,720
I am here for you now.

746
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,157
- Yeah, okay.

747
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:12,991
(slow somber tone)

748
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:13,925
- Maybe just son you

749
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,494
- I don't want to talk about it.

750
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,776
(crying)

751
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,567
(phone rings)

752
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,471
- Hello.

753
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,639
- [Rachael] Elliot.

754
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,007
- Hey, Rachael, how's it going.

755
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:39,077
- [Rachael] I've been better.

756
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,411
- What's wrong.

757
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,681
- [Rachael] He's in
 some serious trouble.

758
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:44,915
- Oh.

759
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,484
- [Rachael] I'm
 over at his place.

760
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,685
- Is he okay?

761
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,619
- [Rachael] No, I need you

762
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,656
I need you to come over, okay?

763
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,525
- Yeah, yeah I
 can be there soon.

764
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:55,760
I'll head out now.

765
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,862
- [Rachael] Okay, I
 really appreciate it.

766
00:49:57,862 --> 00:49:59,030
- No problem at all.

767
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,864
- [Rachael] Thanks.

768
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,799
- All right, bye, bye.

769
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:11,409
- Make sure that anything
 sharp is locked away.

770
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,343
- Uh, huh.

771
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,515
(door closes)

772
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,756
- I have to leave tonight.

773
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,892
Your father needs me back home.

774
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,329
The money troubles are
 worse than we thought.

775
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,364
- Anything that I can do?

776
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,666
- We'll handle it.

777
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:40,004
I told your dad that if you
 decided to live with Scott

778
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,006
then there's no way I'd
go back home till I knew

779
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,242
you'd be as safe as possible.

780
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:47,044
If you could let Elliot
stay here for a while

781
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,979
I'll be able to leave.

782
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:55,220
I'll get sick, sick worrying
 if you don't let Elliot stay.

783
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,054
Talk to your father he'll

784
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,525
He'll tell you it's
 the right thing to do.

785
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:05,263
(slow melancholy tone)

786
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,769
- If you want me to go I will.

787
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,874
- Scott was fine before he
 stopped taking his medicine.

788
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,977
I'll make sure that
 doesn't happen again.

789
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,011
- After I talked to your mom

790
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,214
I read on the internet that

791
00:51:56,214 --> 00:52:00,351
schizophrenia mainly happens
 to guys between 15 to 24.

792
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,788
- Yeah, I read that too.

793
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:08,359
Did you see that it
 could get you at any age?

794
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,461
There's not even a cure.

795
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,097
- Yeah.

796
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:18,035
- They don't even know
 what causes it not really.

797
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,804
(crying)

798
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,738
Goddammit.

799
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,820
- Okay.

800
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,322
- [Jeremy] Dammit.

801
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,661
(machine beeps)

802
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:47,398
- [Jeremy] He said that his
medicine started working again?

803
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:52,337
- [Bill] Right now it's better
 if he comes back with me.

804
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:56,173
- [Jeremy] I can go with
 you if you want to help out.

805
00:52:56,173 --> 00:53:00,311
- [Bill] If you go with us
 what happens to your grades?

806
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,383
- [Jeremy] I can take
 the classes again.

807
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:08,386
- [Bill] And if it takes
 years for Scott to get better

808
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,288
you gonna stay with us?

809
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,157
- [Jeremy] Yes.

810
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,995
- I'm gonna make
 this easy for you.

811
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:18,829
Stay away

812
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,800
for a little while

813
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,869
just until he calms down.

814
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,406
Can you do me that favor?

815
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,975
- Yeah.

816
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,530
(slow somber tone)

817
00:53:56,801 --> 00:54:00,204
Scott's dad took him
 back to their town.

818
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,140
- For how long?

819
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,975
- He, uh, didn't say.

820
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,383
- I guess it's time
 for me to get my stuff

821
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,652
out of your place.

822
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,221
(bells ring)

823
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,055
- If

824
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,993
when Scott gets better

825
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,033
I'm not sure what I wanna do.

826
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:37,107
I was wondering if you could
 stay until I figure that out.

827
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:39,009
- Yeah.

828
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:42,647
- Good.

829
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,388
- How is it?

830
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,290
- It's delicious.

831
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,792
It's my favorite.

832
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:59,664
- I have another one
 of your favorites.

833
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,301
(laughing)

834
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:10,575
- Thank you.

835
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,932
(slow tranquil music)

836
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:34,124
(slow tranquil music)

837
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,766
(applause)

838
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,569
- [Voiceover] Graduating
class of 2015.

839
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,604
(applause)

840
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:56,874
(slow tranquil music)

841
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:03,380
- [Gavin] Congratulations

842
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,314
great job.

843
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,553
- [Rachael] Open it.

844
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:14,725
- [Elliot] Wow.

845
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,962
- [Jeremy] It's too much.

846
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,565
- We've had a very
 profitable year.

847
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:23,834
We'll be sending a little
 extra cash each month.

848
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,204
There'll be no starving graduate
students in this family.

849
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:30,808
- [Rachael] I want a photo
 of Elliot and Jeremy.

850
00:58:30,808 --> 00:58:32,910
- [Gavin] Let me take it.

851
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,082
Okay you guys ready.

852
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:38,916
Nice.

853
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:44,689
(slow somber tone)

854
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:16,921
- [Scott] I'm too far
behind I need to study.

855
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,488
I need to study.

856
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,957
I need to study.

857
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,391
I need to study.

858
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,793
I need to study.

859
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,210
- Scott, I made you some toast.

860
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,445
- [Scott] Ice,

861
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,148
ice,

862
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,583
ice

863
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,918
to wash it down.

864
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:50,487
- [Bill] What?

865
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,556
- [Scott] Ice to wash it down.

866
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,125
- [Bill] Wash what down?

867
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,629
- [Scott] There's a
 spider in my throat.

868
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:00,330
It's in my stomach.

869
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,600
(dark dramatic music)

870
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:11,041
(water running)

871
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,987
(door opens)

872
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,057
(door closes)

873
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:45,676
(water running)

874
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:49,246
(climactic dramatic tone)

875
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,315
(inaudible dialogue)

876
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,745
(doorbell rings)

877
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:55,980
- Who's that?

878
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:09,994
- Come in.

879
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:13,363
- Hi,

880
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,101
I'm Bill.

881
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:17,935
- Elliot.

882
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:22,706
- I need to talk to you.

883
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,785
All week Scott kept
 saying over and over

884
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:37,387
he was going to finish school.

885
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,057
Then he didn't say
 anything for days.

886
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,458
I looked everywhere.

887
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,694
Local police they're
 looking for him to, nothing.

888
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,264
I thought maybe, maybe
 he'd come back here

889
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,167
or someplace you guys hung out.

890
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:51,601
- Did he take his medicine?

891
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,603
- No, he left all of it.

892
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:57,507
He's out there all by himself.

893
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,410
- I don't know if
 I can help you out.

894
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,211
- Jeremy.

895
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,084
- We'll find him.

896
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,252
- We have to.

897
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:13,323
(electronic dance beat)

898
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:36,480
(indistinct faint conversations)

899
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:47,491
(indistinct faint conversations)

900
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:14,351
- We can keep going
 I'm not that tired.

901
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,521
- I'm almost out of gas.

902
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,157
- Well there's a
 station near here.

903
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:23,260
- I think I spent about
everything I have.

904
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,063
I got to figure out
 a long term plan.

905
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,532
I got some land up
 north that I can sell.

906
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:32,702
Maybe I can hire somebody that
 finds people professionally.

907
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:35,605
- Here.

908
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,912
- No,

909
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:42,746
no.

910
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,923
I'll pay you back every penny

911
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,926
soon as I sell my
 stuff all right?

912
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,100
(engine cranks)

913
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:11,708
You even think of somewhere
 he might be you call me.

914
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,443
- [Jeremy] Yeah, okay.

915
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,013
(doors close)

916
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,372
Maybe we can get the landlord to

917
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:45,609
let us stay just
 a few more months.

918
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,577
- [Elliot] We have a lot
 to do before grad school.

919
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,545
- [Jeremy] I know.

920
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,846
- A lot

921
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:50,680
to do.

922
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,515
- I know.

923
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,057
- Do you still love him?

924
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:03,927
- Yes.

925
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,582
- [Gavin] I would like to
 take you to dinner later on

926
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:02,086
when I get home from
 work if that's okay?

927
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:05,522
- Maybe.

928
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,992
- Works for me.

929
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:11,995
- Works for me too.

930
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:17,234
- Business has been
 good this month.

931
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:21,071
We can afford to send
him a little extra, huh?

932
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:31,615
(slow somber tone)

933
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,216
- [Jeremy] Hey, Scott.

934
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:10,320
We've got your apartment all
 fixed up and ready for you.

935
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,721
Why don't we go home.

936
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,291
- [Voiceover] Don't
 listen to him.

937
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,725
- Let's go home.

938
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,927
(slow ringing tone)

939
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,196
(dark whispering voice)

940
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:21,665
- [Voiceover] They
 will kill you.

941
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,933
- [Voiceover] Stab them.

942
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,435
- No.

943
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,403
No.

944
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,738
No.
- [Jeremy] Scott, wait.

945
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:29,806
Scott, Scott.

946
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:32,776
(faint mumbling voices)

947
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:35,512
- [Jeremy] Scott, stop.

948
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,513
Scott, stop.

949
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:38,515
Stop.

950
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,918
(mumbled sinister voice)

951
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,728
(slow ringing tone)

952
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,171
We got to get him
 away from here.

953
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,005
- How.

954
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:07,677
- We have to find a way to
 force him into a hospital.

955
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,288
(sirens)

956
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:28,498
(indistinct conversations)

957
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,977
(car alarm)

958
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:07,203
- Scott,

959
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,673
look.

960
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:10,840
- Here, Scott,

961
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:13,910
this belongs to you.

962
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:25,555
(inaudible voice whispering)

963
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,814
(crying)

964
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:00,790
(mumbled voices whispering)

965
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:05,228
- [Voiceover] You're
 worthless jump.

966
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,531
- [Voiceover] Hey, Scott.

967
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,998
- [Voiceover] Hey, Scott.

968
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,900
- [Voiceover]
 Scott, what's wrong.

969
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,304
(voices whispering all at once)

970
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,506
- [Voiceover] Come here.

971
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:19,443
- [Voiceover]
 Something the matter?

972
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,779
- [ Voiceover] What's wrong.

973
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,883
(voices whispering all at once)

974
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:31,555
- [Voiceover] Jump.

975
01:11:34,691 --> 01:11:36,360
- [Voiceover] Jump.

976
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,567
- [Scott] No,

977
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:44,401
no.

978
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:32,215
(crickets chirping)

979
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,457
- You're doing much better

980
01:13:13,457 --> 01:13:17,026
very soon you'll
be up and about.

981
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,361
You're improving

982
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,129
I can tell.

983
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,333
Got to go.

984
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,906
Got to go work to do.

985
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:34,944
- Scott, let her go.

986
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:37,847
Let go.

987
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,924
I have something that's yours.

988
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,162
- I can't leave him
 with anything sharp.

989
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,866
- I just wanna see
 if he remembers it.

990
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,768
It belongs to him.

991
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,205
Can he just have
it for a minute?

992
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,306
- All right.

993
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,610
(inaudible dialogue)

994
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:46,182
(slow ringing tone)

995
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:49,118
(inaudible dialog)

996
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:04,534
(upbeat contemporary music)
