1
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:16,370
It was at the time of the warlord I
sought peace in the temple of my youth.

2
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:20,184
But sometimes you start a journey
for a reason ...

3
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:23,291
and decide you do to another.

4
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:30,095
I could not escape the
bloodshed that destroyed our country.

5
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,774
I do not understand what I do wrong.

6
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:19,876
You are scared.

7
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:29,194
The hardest stone
is the easiest to break.

8
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,943
Think only of your destination
of nothing else.

9
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:44,311
Forget the stones. That do not matter.

10
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:50,669
Only your own will,
your intention is important.

11
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:10,988
Down.

12
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,076
All. Fast.

13
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,797
I can help.

14
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:04,713
Vuren.

15
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:08,050
White Crane, I can not see.

16
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:16,000
Remember who you are: White Crane.

17
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,882
Tarnish my memory is not ...

18
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,100
with revenge.

19
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,659
They will pay the price.

20
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,584
I had to take revenge.

21
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,781
I had my life to thank
to large Myling mistress.

22
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,092
But only they knew the burden
my revenge.

23
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,257
The dark emotions in me.

24
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,336
Well done. My best troops.

25
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:15,027
The farmers of this valley are no longer
protected by your Wudang-warriors.

26
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:18,074
How hot you Westerner?

27
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:22,846
I am White Crane.

28
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:32,059
I am Al-Deu Berezov,
soldier of Kahn.

29
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:36,955
That name will keep you until you die.

30
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,636
Let him walk.

31
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:10,540
He can peddle
what happened in Wudang.

32
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:54,540
I do not think he survives.
-Silence.

33
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:02,236
The arrow has just missed your heart.

34
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,680
Where am I?

35
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:10,828
Master Crane, this is the farm of
Madame Lian. They helped us.

36
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:17,061
They will find us.
-No, they think you are dead.

37
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,016
And for me they are not afraid.

38
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,342
Now yet.

39
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,273
But ever do.

40
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:21,423
I am ready. We search Kahn
and holds him from the road.

41
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:23,666
Lang Han ...

42
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,791
I have to do this.

43
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,634
You must hide your characters.

44
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,160
That was my man.

45
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:39,833
Where is he now?
-He is dead.

46
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,589
Why can not I take revenge?

47
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,242
Why?

48
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:36,688
Because I've seen the darkness
that entails.

49
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:41,137
And as I soon
I might die.

50
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,269
And you ...

51
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,990
Your life has just begun.

52
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,995
Opium?

53
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:16,357
It can not be otherwise.
It's this or death.

54
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:20,133
The whole valley is Daixiangou him.

55
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:23,207
From whom?
-Kahn.

56
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,737
Do you know him?

57
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:34,850
I have heard of him.

58
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:40,277
I did not meet him,
but that is still pending.

59
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,402
Do you really means to take revenge?

60
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:51,734
Yes, it must be done.

61
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,998
That said my husband, too.

62
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:59,907
Everyone in the opposition said:
It must happen.

63
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,383
If you ever are looking for peace, White Crane,
'll find them here.

64
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:17,266
Each week they opium
to Shanghai and Kahn.

65
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,007
Hey, stay away from her.

66
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:34,627
Stay away from her.

67
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,495
Let me through.

68
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:32,399
This is the last time I go.

69
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,936
Kahn, that village burning.

70
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,573
Nice, very nice.

71
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:31,072
You're late.
-Sorry, kid.

72
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,358
Please.

73
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,772
This is not the money.

74
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,572
Give me the money now.
-Listen, gook.

75
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:47,169
Let us fix
who is the boss.

76
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,707
Mr. Kahn will hear it.

77
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,700
Hi, Lilly.

78
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,738
Go with me.
-Fuck you.

79
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:49,088
Ni-Hao, Mr. Wong.

80
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,644
Do you have something for me?

81
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:59,158
Listen. You owe me money.
Try never me.

82
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,369
Touche.

83
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:21,381
You may not enter.
Guests must wear a costume.

84
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,843
Nice costume.

85
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:46,811
Ladies and gangsters, I ask your
attention to a beautiful songbird.

86
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:51,245
A white lily with the blue sea
here is flown.

87
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,243
Miss Jane Marshall.

88
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,816
The lady was singing.

89
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:14,273
Stop. That's it.

90
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:21,227
British police Shanghai.

91
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:50,862
Hello, Miss ...
-Marshall.

92
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:53,472
Have you succeeded?

93
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:56,008
To my brother to find.
- Your brother?

94
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,883
Peter. It's been days since he ...

95
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,414
No, excuse me.

96
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,348
But do not worry.
He turns it back on. Sooner or later.

97
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:14,879
Anyway.

98
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:22,439
A Martini. Without all the clutter.

99
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,467
Thank you intervened.

100
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:33,914
Shanghai is more like Brooklyn
than I thought.

101
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:39,362
I sort of world tour.

102
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,600
Anyway, I owe you one.

103
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:47,170
You owe me nothing due.

104
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,250
And a gentleman too.

105
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,373
My name is Crane.

106
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,726
Does anyone have money?

107
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,955
What you drink?

108
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,986
Tea.
-He drinks like a monk.

109
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,022
Who are you anyway?

110
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,553
Chong 'Bingo' Quo. Crane.

111
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:19,963
Say 'Bingo'.

112
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:25,577
You have my window, tables
and chairs destroyed.

113
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:31,104
Is this all yours?
-Nothing is completely 'yours' in Shanghai.

114
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:36,091
What are you doing? Singing, dancing,
playing the piano?

115
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,735
Someone will have to pay damages.

116
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:47,978
Wil you really make money?

117
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:19,278
Pawn to d4.

118
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:24,054
We have a winner.

119
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,387
Are we the next victims?

120
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,121
Who is this clown?

121
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:37,367
Who is the next victim?

122
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,130
We have a winner.

123
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:14,983
You were almost at your ancestors had.

124
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:21,637
I told you.
He is indestructible.

125
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:37,193
We have someone who
the Westerner to include.

126
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:43,476
This will not be easy.

127
00:26:56,052 --> 00:27:01,028
White Crane, you will not
easy to seal.

128
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:03,035
Not yet.

129
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,917
Turn it on, Crane.

130
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,544
Grab him.

131
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,478
Kill him.

132
00:27:56,913 --> 00:28:03,895
White Crane. The name you
remember you until you die.

133
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:40,341
I take our half now.

134
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,214
Toad, what are you doing here?
You would not come.

135
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:53,699
Your new husband is very effective.
-I understand you.

136
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:57,267
Who is he?
-I know nothing of him.

137
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,892
He has suddenly emerged.

138
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:05,054
Hear him. I do not want it
a problem for the opposition.

139
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:10,959
Does he know that he
someone Kahn has slain?

140
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:14,666
Kahn will avenge me.
-Maybe not.

141
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:21,693
If Kahn leaves, keep him on
before they get in the car.

142
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:26,851
Tonight? Here? Now?
Remember-anything.

143
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:32,638
We must not fail this time.
The opposition wants Kahn dead.

144
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:48,900
Kahn, almost forgotten. I have some money
for you are in our last fight.

145
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,697
Is this really necessary?

146
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,520
Take the money.

147
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,313
We are home.

148
00:30:57,442 --> 00:31:00,014
Whiskey, hello.

149
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:04,013
You had the front
way to go.

150
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:09,473
You can sleep here. Only tonight.

151
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:13,434
I have a home.
I am not an orphanage.

152
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:17,722
Remember also to:
these walls have ears.

153
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:23,682
If they do not mind.
I go in the bath. See you later, guys.

154
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,636
It is complicated.

155
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:41,131
You know who you've saved tonight?

156
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,546
Apart from you?

157
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:47,267
Is that important?

158
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,672
Yes, it's important.

159
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:59,539
A good Scotch.

160
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,664
It was Kahn.

161
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,666
Have you heard of Kahn?
-I know who he is.

162
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,295
If you know who he is,
did you let him die tonight.

163
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:17,866
If he dies, is that
at the time that I say.

164
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:22,202
And I do it in person.

165
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:30,577
Who do you work, Crane?

166
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,450
I work for nobody.

167
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,493
Everyone works for somebody.

168
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:50,400
Kahn prediction seems correct.
-His prediction?

169
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:56,447
Everyone knows that Kahn thinks he
will be slain by a Wudang.

170
00:32:56,572 --> 00:33:01,148
You've seen his bodyguards.
Russians, Persians, Indians.

171
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,271
And Westerners like you.
I insult you, Crane?

172
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:13,229
I'm not offended by someone who
pressing on poor people in a dievenhol.

173
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,192
You know me. This club of mine
I built out of nothing.

174
00:33:19,318 --> 00:33:24,897
I must take account of Kahn,
Hoggins and resistance. Clear?

175
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:27,016
The opposition?
-Toad.

176
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,514
He is as ruthless as the rest.

177
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:34,314
And for whom you work?

178
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,717
I work for nobody.

179
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:41,054
Everyone works for somebody.

180
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:50,633
Why did you not slain Kahn?
-I have made someone a promise.

181
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:55,051
It takes me trouble
made him to do.

182
00:33:56,895 --> 00:34:02,510
Kahn is a great plan,
something really big and I need to know.

183
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:07,678
Kill him not as long as we do not know.

184
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:11,424
Well, Bingo.

185
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:15,299
I will do what you ask.

186
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:19,129
For.

187
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,700
Hello, Peter.

188
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:55,335
Are you you?

189
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,158
How are your claims?

190
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:05,872
Well. I can almost begin.
-I hope it's true.

191
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:14,278
And you ensure that the gas is fatal?
-I promise you

192
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:21,107
Are you you?

193
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,812
You mean this?

194
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:36,976
It is empty.

195
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:39,979
Of course.

196
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,317
You know the deal.

197
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:47,146
Only at the end of the day
so you can sleep.

198
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:51,271
Sleeping without demons, very peaceful.

199
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:54,230
Without memories.

200
00:35:54,985 --> 00:36:00,266
You promised. You would bring
but you did not.

201
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:05,470
And where is my sister? Where is she?

202
00:36:05,604 --> 00:36:07,760
You said it.

203
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:11,837
I want to see her. I want my sister to see.

204
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:20,257
I want my sister to see. You said that I
could see her. You promised.

205
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:23,473
You promised.

206
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:35,550
Are you busy?

207
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,127
That's him.

208
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:48,298
He was 22. He had just graduated
as a chemist when he was in service.

209
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:52,303
The army used him
for the production of gas.

210
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,942
Gas for people to kill.

211
00:36:56,072 --> 00:37:01,117
He was never the old one.
He always had nightmares.

212
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,548
Why he came to Shanghai?

213
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:13,397
It would do him good to the world
to see. We opted for the Pacific.

214
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:18,115
He has always worked.
He had not much money.

215
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,167
Given his postcards and letters
it seemed to him better.

216
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:27,177
What happened?
-I do not know.

217
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,812
I do not think I really want to know,
I believe him.

218
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:37,993
I want him to make good
and I want him to worry.

219
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,045
Thank you.

220
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:49,983
Can I take a while
Just stop you are?

221
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:56,294
Of course.

222
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:02,105
Mr. Kahn, what fun
that you're in tonight.

223
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:06,621
This could be interesting.
-It seems predictable.

224
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:12,176
I had hoped for as a business
issue to discuss.

225
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,813
Never in public talking about issues.
-Of course. Of course.

226
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:29,087
Kahn apparently wants you to speak.

227
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:31,968
Maybe you get a rose.

228
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,621
Neat, though. You have apparently
a new tailor.

229
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,262
I must still pay because you did
what my body could not wait.

230
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:57,266
So what do you want from me?
-I want nothing.

231
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:05,128
You see, I have enough men
to protect me.

232
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:08,844
But without their weapons
they can not.

233
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:13,725
There are more men of honor
in the world than arms.

234
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:19,622
I have more of. They cost,
how it is said that, grab a penny.

235
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:25,591
It says that you get
what you pay.

236
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,388
I pay very well.
Maybe I can use.

237
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,226
May I invite you
in my humble home?

238
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:35,442
Of course.

239
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:26,771
He is in love with her.

240
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:29,982
Do you?

241
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:13,631
Hi, beauty. Are you going tonight
with me to Shanghai?

242
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:22,397
Provoke me.
-Let me through.

243
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,116
I no longer swallow.
-Many people oppose it.

244
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:30,713
They burn their opium fields,
but it costs them their lives.

245
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:35,140
It seems pointless
with so little Wudang-warriors.

246
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:37,849
Your daughter is very beautiful.

247
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:42,399
Perhaps her tonight
will test again.

248
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:49,917
Crane has abandoned us.
I do not. I am a Wudang.

249
00:43:02,953 --> 00:43:07,542
Boertje, makes you not.

250
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:00,709
Back to Kahn.

251
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:18,748
Back to Shanghai with a gift
of the Daixiangou Valley.

252
00:44:36,295 --> 00:44:40,131
You can apparently
agreement with Kahn.

253
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:46,354
These villagers were sitting across him.
Make sure you have good buddies with him still.

254
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:49,524
Since you will not regret it.

255
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:52,367
I will not.

256
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:09,860
I'm glad you're here.

257
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:13,744
I feel honored.

258
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,922
Assign Mr. Crane his room.

259
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:21,055
Rust just before eating.
Everything is provided.

260
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:45,221
The artillery is there.
-Excellent.

261
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:50,572
<i> French 75's. The best of the best.
The SOIXANTE-quinze. </ I>

262
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:56,144
If they have the Great War
won. Together with the British.

263
00:45:56,276 --> 00:45:58,838
And the Yanks.
-It is clear to me.

264
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:05,117
That they will learn mores. We have yet
finder on the salary talk.

265
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:09,808
It is a special evening.
Affairs, we discuss after dinner.

266
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:12,222
Yes, of course.

267
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:35,600
We live in interesting times,
Mr. Kahn.

268
00:46:35,736 --> 00:46:39,385
England men as you need.
And me.

269
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:43,500
We reach only unit
if we the people brief.

270
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:46,648
No excesses, no tolerance.

271
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:52,556
You taste the food?
-Delicious. Reminds me of home.

272
00:46:52,683 --> 00:46:56,040
Take something else.
-I can really nothing more.

273
00:46:56,171 --> 00:47:00,482
You insult me?
We must not waste food.

274
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:04,264
If you insist.

275
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:13,648
How like the American boy?

276
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:17,269
He claims the gas?

277
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:27,191
I have at times not so much eaten.

278
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,106
You flatters me.

279
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,959
Let's discuss our business.

280
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:39,408
Very good idea.

281
00:47:59,227 --> 00:48:02,130
I've done everything you wanted.

282
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:17,950
I eat and time you wasted.

283
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:41,880
You are a mystery to me, Crane.

284
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:48,516
I come from a gladiator family.
So I can appreciate skill.

285
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:54,583
But a Westerner with an unprecedented
Kung fu technique, in Shanghai?

286
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,573
Why?
-There is no mystery to like.

287
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,021
My parents were ...

288
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,176
missionaries.

289
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:07,625
Very sweet people.

290
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:11,284
They were murdered.

291
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,686
I grew up ...

292
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,134
on the mission ...

293
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:20,790
but I was never really accepted.

294
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:30,464
Since I was not accepted,
ensured that I was afraid of me.

295
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:36,744
Where you been like?
-I have been everywhere.

296
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:41,814
I have many years around jury.

297
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:45,177
Almost twenty years.

298
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:50,905
It seemed to me that nothing that I found,
of any value.

299
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:56,096
I turned back.
There was an old woman ...

300
00:49:56,232 --> 00:50:01,041
very nice to me
had been as a child.

301
00:50:01,174 --> 00:50:04,692
I wanted to go back to her ...

302
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:08,349
for that warmth again experienced.

303
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:12,253
And now I am in Shanghai.

304
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,079
My fate was in my youth determined.

305
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:20,647
I fear not,
I got it in his own hand.

306
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,716
I have the people with whom I share,
choose with care.

307
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:32,359
Buy a new costume. Buy ten.

308
00:50:32,495 --> 00:50:39,593
Everything that you dream. Women,
diamonds, cars, peace, happiness.

309
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:48,400
What do you do?
-A proof of your loyalty.

310
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:51,846
You see that I do not trust Hoggins.

311
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:57,866
And Bingo has other plans, I fear.

312
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:03,596
Kill him. And please
your place beside me.

313
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,293
You are shocked.

314
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:12,780
It is a good test.
A great test.

315
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,589
The residents of the Valley Daixiangou
have your men slain.

316
00:51:21,796 --> 00:51:24,701
Buy new costumes.

317
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:29,187
You only need one to kill
to warn a hundred.

318
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:34,418
Soon I may kill thousands
millions of warning.

319
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:39,483
How is that possible?
-I have a very powerful weapon.

320
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:44,883
There will be no resistance anymore.
Everyone will be afraid of me.

321
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:48,913
What does your blood now, Crane?

322
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:56,925
Well. Sergonov will witness
of Bingo's death.

323
00:51:57,058 --> 00:52:00,665
Until then it remains your best friend.

324
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,365
Until that time, you are my guest.

325
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,099
So he eats it? Make him awake.

326
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:07,638
Very bad. If the American dies,
Kahn puts you paid.

327
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:32,172
You look handsome from.

328
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:37,300
How did you get that hat?
-I have found in an alley.

329
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:45,941
Sometimes we start something for a reason ...

330
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:50,858
but we must finish
to a greater cause.

331
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:56,772
I can not follow.

332
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:06,992
What do you do to your brother back
see? What are you prepared to do?

333
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:12,819
Everything.

334
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:22,456
Peter is trapped in the palace
of Kahn. I still talk to you.

335
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:29,447
Again, from the beginning.

336
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,631
Is it ready?

337
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,951
It is finished.

338
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,054
You could prove it.

339
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:46,765
Fine. This will work fine.
-More than good.

340
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:52,988
This is a single phase reaction. If this glass
breaks, we killed.

341
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:58,562
Make sure you are far away.
And not with the wind gets inside.

342
00:56:58,684 --> 00:57:01,397
We can fill tubes.

343
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:04,439
Right now?
Round it off before sunrise.

344
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:08,301
What is the ...
You would take.

345
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,523
When you're done.
We must first testing.

346
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:18,912
I thought that all rats were dead.
-There are always available.

347
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:36,400
I'll liberate you.

348
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:21,921
We still have no problems?
-No one will miss.

349
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:27,705
That new man of you Crane.

350
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,738
Interesting.

351
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:33,999
You know him.

352
00:58:52,716 --> 00:59:00,029
If you could be free, what would you do?
What would you have to have?

353
00:59:01,615 --> 00:59:04,018
Everything.

354
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,228
Even your life?

355
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:14,179
I do not own my life. I am slave
of Kahn and I have betrayed my friends.

356
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:20,250
Who are your friends?
-What does that matter?

357
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:26,532
I do not have long to live. I will
miss nobody, and nobody misses me.

358
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:29,987
This is your own stupidity.

359
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,431
Why look at your watch?

360
00:59:35,565 --> 00:59:39,502
It is new. I
never had one.

361
00:59:40,929 --> 00:59:43,003
Come on.

362
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:00,847
Sit down.

363
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,577
I come for Mr. Kahn.

364
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:48,903
You singing tonight for our master.
-Yeah, I mean.

365
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,563
Say it if I need help.

366
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:58,060
Crane, prays for a Westerner
to the Buddha?

367
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:01,962
I pray for us.

368
01:01:02,097 --> 01:01:07,540
I apparently misjudged you.
-Yes, you sure.

369
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:13,654
I am a fool.

370
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:19,856
I promise you that it will be painless.

371
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:25,718
<i> What should that be.
-I have misjudged you. </ I>

372
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,926
I do not want to die like a coward.

373
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,954
I trusted you.

374
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,006
I'm speechless.

375
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:30,709
It pales by your beauty.

376
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,858
I would be able to buy thousand women.

377
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:40,128
But with all the money in the world
are you not for sale.

378
01:03:40,258 --> 01:03:43,441
Excuse me. I can not ...

379
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:47,914
I do not know what I ...

380
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:50,811
I must find my brother.

381
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,941
Your brother?

382
01:03:57,846 --> 01:04:00,943
Then I will show you your brother for detection.

383
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:06,336
I am prepared to half the world
to kill for you.

384
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:13,498
It will be late for a taxi.

385
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:17,596
Too late.

386
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:29,153
Check it.

387
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,626
He is dead.

388
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:46,326
It was the only way.

389
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:51,306
Kahn will be satisfied.

390
01:04:52,987 --> 01:04:56,371
It is difficult to kill a friend.

391
01:04:56,506 --> 01:05:00,218
Even if it is needed.

392
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,164
You indeed have ice water in your veins.

393
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:02,048
I do not have much time.

394
01:07:02,176 --> 01:07:05,478
Pete.
-What wonderful to see you.

395
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:10,591
What happened to you?
-Nothing, though.

396
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:15,626
You sit here and there is nothing
you done? What are you doing here?

397
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:19,335
Pete, look at me. What are you doing here?

398
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:23,426
I do the gas. I make the gas.

399
01:07:23,556 --> 01:07:27,262
They think that it is difficult,
but it is easy.

400
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:32,418
It is zethaleen, sulfur and dichloro ...

401
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:36,588
Why? What does he plan
with the gas? Where?

402
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:41,249
Who knows.
It is a huge country.

403
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:43,441
Why?

404
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:50,260
For people to kill.
And it's easy.

405
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:57,193
A few thousand Chinese. Chinese,
French, Germans. What does it matter?

406
01:07:57,317 --> 01:08:03,508
Where, Pete?
-I am already working to fill the tubes.

407
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:06,884
When he wants. Now, for my part.

408
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:11,546
Why are you doing this?
-It is my job.

409
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,141
It's always been my work.

410
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:27,193
I gotta go. We must ...

411
01:08:36,161 --> 01:08:40,636
Careful. Let them not
from your hands.

412
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,088
Sjors them tightly.

413
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:47,857
This is my greatest achievement.
Everyone in China will know Kahn.

414
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,753
If that is what you want.

415
01:08:50,882 --> 01:08:55,432
Yes, I do. Tell me:
how is it to have power?

416
01:08:55,558 --> 01:08:58,891
Sometimes I forget it. Even me.

417
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:01,434
I would not know.

418
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:46,592
What's on your mind, Crane?
-I think of the future.

419
01:10:28,843 --> 01:10:31,135
What do you do?

420
01:10:31,265 --> 01:10:33,340
Hunting.

421
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,486
What?

422
01:11:03,108 --> 01:11:06,115
You go to the opposition.

423
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:09,702
I go with you.

424
01:11:10,755 --> 01:11:13,712
I do not want you end up like me.

425
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:19,945
I go with you.

426
01:11:41,934 --> 01:11:45,101
You are not me.

427
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:55,839
I am terrified.

428
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:38,292
This is the Daixiangou Valley.

429
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:46,488
They commit the most resistance.
We will restore order here.

430
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:51,788
I get these small villages
and management than the entire country.

431
01:12:51,926 --> 01:12:55,469
I care for peace and prosperity.

432
01:12:55,606 --> 01:12:57,816
I am free from worry.

433
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:00,619
Free from worry.

434
01:13:00,746 --> 01:13:05,962
Since the emperor was disposed,
there is anarchy in the country.

435
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:10,850
There is no unity.
All these different groups.

436
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:15,786
I do not think you know
how strong these people are.

437
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:18,291
We will see.

438
01:13:18,845 --> 01:13:23,643
Eendracht she violently
imposed. Then succeed.

439
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:27,359
With a strong man, as an emperor.

440
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:33,790
There is a lot that the emperor would return,
but first there must be order.

441
01:13:33,928 --> 01:13:40,139
From this village we make an example
for the rest. We teach them a lesson.

442
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:37,392
Very good.

443
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:40,740
A good time to start.

444
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:47,847
But there are so many people.
Well-seen Crane.

445
01:14:48,895 --> 01:14:51,817
Load the cannons.

446
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:20,235
Guards, protective shells that.
Spread.

447
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:18,324
So you dodged the bullet.

448
01:17:18,448 --> 01:17:21,678
By my sword you can not, Crane.

449
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,129
Thank you.
-Who are you?

450
01:17:41,263 --> 01:17:44,381
Bingo. Risen from the dead.

451
01:18:41,496 --> 01:18:44,162
Who are you, Crane?

452
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:50,831
Wudang.

453
01:18:50,966 --> 01:18:54,087
Impossible. I have them all slain.

454
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:59,220
If you kill me, you achieve nothing.
Then there is half as me.

455
01:18:59,352 --> 01:19:02,311
Then I kill them.

456
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:19,094
What ever was, you no more.
Now you're just a murderer.

457
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:23,010
I am a Wudang.

458
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:45,139
Don not.

459
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,226
Relax.

460
01:22:26,296 --> 01:22:28,375
Go home.

461
01:23:07,951 --> 01:23:10,702
Will I ever find peace ...

462
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:15,327
Now I have slain?

463
01:23:42,346 --> 01:23:46,924
The more things change,
the more they remain the same.

464
01:23:47,062 --> 01:23:49,556
Welcome to Shanghai.

465
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:58,947
It is something of Westerners.

466
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:03,546
All the best to you, Crane.

467
01:24:36,242 --> 01:24:38,071
Thank you.

468
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:41,746
For al .. For everything.

469
01:24:48,312 --> 01:24:49,825
Make sure you feel more comfortable.

470
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:26,073
You have not answered.

471
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:31,014
Will it ever leave?

472
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:36,669
Knowing that you've slain.

473
01:26:05,414 --> 01:26:10,483
The fate of the warrior
follows an erratic path.

474
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:14,677
But how we walk this path,
is always our own choice.

475
01:26:15,907 --> 01:26:19,560
We are the old wounds of
the fight left.

476
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,560
Praying that they will one day cure.
