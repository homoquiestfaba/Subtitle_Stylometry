00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:54,300
NOTRE-DAME ON FIRE

3
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>The door is open.</i>

4
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,258
- You're the new guy?
- Yes.

5
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,175
- Right on time.
- Thank you.

6
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Good for you.

7
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:46,258
Follow me!

8
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:53,842
Were you trained?

9
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,967
Yes.

10
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,425
Tuesday and Thursday.

11
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,508
Two hours. Almost two hours.

12
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:02,175
How about that?

13
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,883
Know how it works?

14
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,633
Yeah, they showed me.

15
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:06,758
I know it.

16
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:08,050
Follow me.

17
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,425
This is where you'll take your break.

18
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,842
That's a repeater panel.

19
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,258
Never take your eyes off it.

20
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,633
That's the fridge.

21
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,675
Those are the lockers.

22
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,800
Bathrooms in the back.

23
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,800
- Did you try on your uniform?
- No.

24
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,675
A little big!

25
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,050
Better than the other way around.

26
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,592
DANGER
LEAD

27
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:19,008
I've been on this job for a year.
And you?

28
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:28,633
Careful, buddy! Move your bus!

29
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,758
It's a one-way street.
You're going the wrong way!

30
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,633
Are we seeing Mona Lisa?

31
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:34,800
No, Uncle,

32
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,925
here it's the Crown of Thorns.

33
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,175
Come behold the wonder.

34
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Welcome to Notre-Dame Cathedral.

35
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,342
A jewel of French Gothic architecture.

36
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,925
The most visited in the world,

37
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,133
an edifice that houses the most precious

38
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,383
and venerated of relics.

39
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,758
We're reinforcing the bearing points

40
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:01,967
of the spire.

41
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,758
To take the scaffold weight
off the roof.

42
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,592
Ok, understood.

43
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,842
Here you see the Virgin and Child.

44
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,467
The incarnation of Notre-Dame.

45
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:29,967
It was placed here
by Viollet-le-Duc in 1855,

46
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,800
in front of a former altar,

47
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,425
which during the Middle Ages

48
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,550
was a high place of worship of Our Lady.

49
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,258
This is the exact spot

50
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:44,758
where David painted the famous

51
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:47,258
"Coronation of Napoleon."

52
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,758
Later appeared a young author,

53
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,133
Victor Hugo,

54
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:56,383
who at just 29 published a novel

55
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,633
entitled <i>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</i>.

56
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,508
The main character, Quasimodo,

57
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,675
who is half-blind and lame...

58
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Keep going!
Only 200 steps to go!

59
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,632
The structure supporting the roof,

60
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,592
one of the oldest in the world,

61
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,007
is made of oak trees
planted 1,200 years ago,

62
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:19,258
during the reign of Charlemagne.

63
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:22,383
There is a total of 1,300 tree trunks.

64
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,758
And finally, here we are

65
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,175
in the Chapel of the Seven Sorrows.

66
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,550
And now, you are standing before

67
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:37,217
the holiest of Christian relics.

68
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,550
The Crown cost an astronomical sum,

69
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,508
putting France in debt for 35 years.

70
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,383
Debt, a French passion!

71
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,092
135,000 pounds.

72
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,550
A fortune that put France on its knees
for 50 years.

73
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,842
In French history,
it is the most precious

74
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,092
and most expensive...

75
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:08,675
The wavy red glass of the reliquary

76
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:13,967
evokes the crimson cloak
the Son of God was made to wear

77
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:18,633
in mockery,
to show him as a sham king.

78
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:21,508
Behind the glass here,

79
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,008
you see a beige linen tunic

80
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:27,217
worn by Saint Louis
on his return from the Crusades.

81
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:32,008
He asked his confessor
for this small flagellation chain

82
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,133
to whip himself.
You can see traces of blood.

83
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:44,133
- Hello?
- <i>It's Mr. Merlin, your boss.</i>

84
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:48,550
<i>Sorry this falls on you.
There's a hitch with the afternoon guy.</i>

85
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,842
<i>His papers aren't in order.
Can you stay till 11 p.m.?</i>

86
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,050
Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.

87
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,925
I just need...

88
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,883
to call my wife.

89
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:00,383
<i>Of course.</i>

90
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:01,967
<i>Good luck!</i>

91
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:10,508
<i>The kids are tired of waiting.
What am I supposed to do?</i>

92
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,592
<i>I'm sick of you.</i>

93
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,508
I know. I don't have a choice.

94
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,092
<i>Same old song!
You don't give a shit about us.</i>

95
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:23,508
<i>What do I tell them?
That it's never your fault?</i>

96
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:24,633
<i>Is that it?</i>

97
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:09,258
{\an8}EASTER MONDAY MASS
6:15 PM

98
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:47,508
But the chief priests then decided

99
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,675
to kill Lazarus also,

100
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:52,342
because he was the reason many Jews

101
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,092
were deserting them
and believing in Jesus<i>.</i>

102
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,633
Let us praise

103
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,967
the word of God.

104
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:17,008
6:17 PM

105
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,967
Alarm!

106
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,675
Alarm: fire, attic, nave...

107
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,217
<i>Alarm!</i>

108
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,467
<i>Alarm: fire, attic...</i>

109
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,050
<i>sacristy!</i>

110
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:50,842
Copy sacristy attic, I'm on it.

111
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,342
Excuse me.

112
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,925

<i>fire attic nave

Control post?

115
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,342
Yes?

116
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,175
<i>I'm in the sacristy attic.</i>

117
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,717
<i>Nothing unusual. False alarm.</i>

118
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,925
It's still blinking.

119
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,633
The evacuation announcement
is gonna go off. Don't worry.

120
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,467
The system's been acting up for years.

121
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:53,342
I keep reporting it,

122
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,925
but nobody gives a hoot. I give up!

123
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,842
On my way.

124
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,050
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

125
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,258
<i>For safety reasons,</i>

126
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,050
<i>the building is closing to the public.</i>

127
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:29,758
<i>Please stay calm and leave</i>

128
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,092
<i>by the nearest exit.</i>

129
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,508
Mommy,
can I have a coin to light a candle?

130
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,716
Some other time.
You heard the message.

131
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:47,508
Come along. I promise.

132
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,800
They're asking us to leave.

133
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:59,175
Damn alarms are a pain in the ass.

134
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,216
And now during mass!

135
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:45,050
<i>You've reached...</i>

136
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,883
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

137
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,425
Excuse me, Mr. Merlin,

138
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,717
but an alarm has gone off.

139
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,383
6:35 PM

140
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,925
Give me the code.

141
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:42,800
<i>The guard said the sacristy was fine,
but...</i>

142
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:44,175
The code!

143
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,717
ZA-110-

00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,217
<i>L2-</i>

145

15-L1.

146
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,300
Is that the alarm I hear?

147
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:57,258
<i>Yes.</i>

148
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,342
Turn it off. Orange button.

149
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,258
Ladies and gentlemen!

150
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,925
The alert has been lifted.
False alarm.

151
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,300
Feel free to return to the cathedral.

152
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:12,675
Mass will be resuming.

153
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,675
The alert has been lifted!
It's safe to go in.

154
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:17,967
Enjoy your visit!

155
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,675
I'm giving you your coin now,

156
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,175
but light the candle only after mass. Ok?

00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,258
<i>act fast!
It's not the sacristy attic,</i>

160
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:41,758
it's the nave!
The forest.

161
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,342
Yes, sir, the nave attic.

162
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:46,550
What's going on?

163
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,967
There's a rehearsal later.
14 musicians.

164
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:49,883
I'm checking up there.

165
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,092
- The forest? Really?
- Yeah.

166
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,592
300 steps up with your asthma,
that's tough.

167
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,008
I'm coming with you.

168
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,758
I'm sick of these false alarms.

169
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,133
The system needs checking.

00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,842
Hello, fire brigade?

184
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:26,925
I'm at number 121, Rue de la Vacquerie.

185
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,967
My kitten is sliding off the roof.

186
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,633
He got out.

187
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,675
Kitty!

LIEUTENANT GENERAL GALLET

190
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,258
Jean-Claude,
any news on Notre-Dame?

191
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,217
Got a strange call.

192
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:53,217
A friend from police HQ
on vacation in Italy.

193
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,842
Florence. Look at this.

194
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,217
Dispatch says they know nothing.

195
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,717
It's gotta be fake.

196
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,925
Well, it sure looks real.

197
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:07,717
- Shouldn't we check?
- Let's go to the Comm Center.

198
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:11,758
PARIS MAYOR'S OFFICE

199
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:13,383
Look over there.

200
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
There's smoke.

201
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:16,717
I don't know what it is...

202
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:20,383
It can't be Notre-Dame.
Notre-Dame can't burn.

203
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,633
Wait, I'll call Karine.

204
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,550
Yes, Karine...

205
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,175
We see some smoke.

206
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,050
I don't know. It's strange.
Over by Notre-Dame.

207
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:35,758
Just in case,
could you call General Gallet

208
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:38,467
to see if anything's going on?

209
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,092
I smell smoke, don't you?

210
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:47,300
What's that noise?

211
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:48,925
Move away from the door.

212
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,175
Security!

213
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:19,592
Call the fire brigade!
There's a fire in the attic!

214
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,258
Yes, it's serious! Hurry!

215
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:27,300
We have to get everyone out!

216
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,925
You think it might be arson?

217
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,967
When I was on the force,
that was our first hunch.

218
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,758
And up there's the best place
to burn the house down.

219
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,717
ISIS has threatened twice
to attack Notre-Dame.

Excuse me!

233
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:31,758
Smoke coming from the roof?

234
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,675
How much smoke do you see?

235
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,175
Do you see flames?

236
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,675
What color is the smoke?

237
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,675
Stay calm.

238
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,550
Anything on Notre-Dame?

239
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,883
Yes, General.

240
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,383
Lots of calls.
We sent out a first alarm response.

241
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,967

- Jean-Claude...
- Notre-Dame is on fire.

247
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,217

What a disaster.
Eight centuries, can you imagine?

280
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:00,217
We should call your mother.

00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:10,633
<i>Ascent halted on north transept stairs
by locked door.</i>

365
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,675
Capt. Marcus Poiret-Clerc.

366
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I'll command operations.

367
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:15,842
Captain,

368
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,633
survey the fire,
then radio initial size-up.

369
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:21,383
Request artwork protection material.

370
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,967
Building evacuated. No casualties...

371
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:25,967
Yet.

372
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:32,550
High calorific potential.

373
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:36,383
The blaze is likely to spread
to the entire edifice.

374
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,550
Pursuing recon.

375
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,008
Excuse me.

376
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:48,050
Thanks.

377
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:50,425
The custodian's son lost the pass key.

378
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,550
That's why we're in a jam.

379
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,925
Thanks.

380
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,633
- It works.
- Opening!

381
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:16,925
- Thanks. Don't stay here.
- Wait.

382
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,133
Got it!

383
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:20,717
- Good luck.
- Let him by.

384
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:22,258
Another 80 steps.

385
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,467
Let's get going.

386
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:04,717
ELYSÉE PALACE

387
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,800
I'll go to the scene
as soon as conditions...

388
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,592
Lay the hoses on the left.

389
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,258
Go no farther.

390
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:00,717
Marianne, position the hose line here.

391
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,758
We'll use the standpipe.

392
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,383
Sandro, recon under the roof.

393
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:08,717
Find the seat of the fire.

394
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:09,883
Got it.

395
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,675
Use the thermal imaging camera.
You know the drill.

396
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,550
Let's go.

397
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:21,842
Stand here.

398
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:27,758
Mask up!

399
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:30,258
Anchor yourself to the door.

400
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,175
Anchored.

401
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,342
Alright?

402
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,967
I'm good!

403
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,092
Wait.

404
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,675
Control your breathing.

405
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:50,925
Ok, go up.

406
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:58,175
- Watch the steps.
- Got it!

407
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:02,425
One.

408
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:05,050
Two.

409
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:07,883
Three.

410
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,467
Four.

411
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,467
Three more steps.

412
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,675
Got it.

413
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:21,675
I'm suffocating.
I'm having trouble breathing.

414
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,508
Adjust your mask.
Breathe deep.

415
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,925
Careful. We're on a catwalk.

416
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,967
One.

417
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:37,342
Two.

418
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,300
Three.

419
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:43,342
Four.

420
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,342
Five.

421
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:51,675
Six.

422
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,467
Hang on.

423
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,300
- Your helmet's blistering.
- What?

424
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:01,467
Your helmet's blistering!

425
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,258
So is yours.

426
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:07,258
<i>920° F</i>

427
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,633
It's too hot. Back out!

428
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,675
- You lead.
- Got it!

429
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:14,675
Eighteen.

430
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,758
Seventeen. Sixteen.

431
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,300
Fourteen!

432
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,800
My ears are roasting.

433
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:24,008
How many steps?

434
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,217
Thirteen.

435
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:26,550
Two.

436
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,550
One.

437
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:30,467
We're out!

438
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,592
I'm in position. Charge the line!

439
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:40,592
Charging!

440
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,092
Sandro.

441
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:46,675
Size-up?

442
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,717
After the first door,
we went up a dozen steps.

443
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:52,550
After 15 ft,
we had to stop due to the heat.

444
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,258
We backed out.
Couldn't find the seat.

445
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:58,175
Take a breather and stand ready.
We'll need another line.

446
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,258
What's going on?

447
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,883
Why's there no water?

448
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:06,508
I'm not getting water!

449
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,800
Open it up!

450
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,175
It's as far as it'll go.

451
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,258
No pressure, Sarge!

452
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:23,675
Increase pressure.
As high as it'll go.

453
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:28,800
There must be a kink.

454
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,758
Still not enough pressure!

455
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,842
Increase pressure, Florian.
We're getting nothing!

456
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:48,383
It's at its max.

457
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,425
Progress is impossible!

458
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,675
Only one First Response truck.

459
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:26,300
General Gontier here.

460
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:28,633
<i>Rescue the artwork while we can.</i>

461
00:43:28,758 --> 00:43:30,800
The Special Artwork Unit is notified.

462
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:32,550
ETA 30 min.

463
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:36,258
<i>You're on your own. Paris is gridlocked.</i>

464
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,925
General Gallet here.

465
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,675
Remember the Fire Brigade's
code of honor:

466
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:43,217
<i>"When you call, I rush.</i>

467
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,592
<i>"But be sure to use the fastest</i>

468
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:47,175
<i>"and surest channels.</i>

469
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,175
<i>"Your wait will seem long, very long."</i>

470
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:53,300
My predecessor added,
"but despite your distress,

471
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,717
"forgive my apparent slowness."

472
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,258
Any pressure?

473
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:16,758
Look for kinks!

474
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,300
Check for kinks on the other side.

475
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:20,592
Check for kinks!

476
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,592
Backing out. It's useless.

477
00:44:25,717 --> 00:44:26,675
Got a kink here.

478
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,967
I'm too hot!

479
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,467
Yes, it's me.

480
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,217
Notre-Dame is burning.

481
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:26,633
It is!

482
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:34,467
Yes, but they can't do anything.
They're in danger.

483
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:37,383
Look on TV. It's burning.

484
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:42,633
It smells like the anti-termite treatment
they sprayed, remember?

485
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,133
I'm fine.

486
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,842
But it's hot. Really hot!

487
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:57,717
I'm taking command!

488
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:58,758
Colonel.

489
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,800
Look out! Move back!

490
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:03,967
Lead!

491
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:05,717
Move back! Lead!

492
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:17,175
All we have is a First Response,
two active lines

493
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,842
and a leaky standpipe.

494
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,425
All this is useless.

495
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,342
It shows we're here,
that firefighters are doing their best.

496
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:27,217
To end up charred under the ruins?

497
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:42,925
<i>Engine 225, rear entrance.</i>

498
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:47,175
Electricity's off. Be right back!

499
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:01,800
Corporal, take the second nozzle!

500
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:05,342
Get under the pinnacle,
attack the timbers from below.

501
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:06,592
Got it, Sarge!

502
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:08,217
Sandro, take her nozzle.

503
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:09,633
Got it.

504
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:26,425
Stay here.
The stone staircase'll collapse last.

505
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,342
Team 2!

506
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:37,550
I need help!

507
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:39,633
Captain, we have no pressure.

508
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:45,258
There's a kink. Straighten it.

509
00:47:45,758 --> 00:47:46,758
Sandro!

510
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,550
Go straighten the kink!

511
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:51,217
You ok?

512
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,842
Look at me, Sandro.

513
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,842
Know how many firemen
would want to be here?

514
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:58,633
So let's go.
Put down your visor and go!

515
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,133
Go!

516
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:03,842
Go!

517
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,050
Come back!

518
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:18,383
- You ok?
- Yeah!

519
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,008
Take the nozzle.

520
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:22,175
Give it to me.

521
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:25,217
Focus on the scaffolding.

522
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:27,800
Cool it down. If it collapses,

523
00:48:27,925 --> 00:48:30,092
the cathedral goes down
and so do we!

524
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:32,467
There, there!

525
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,675
Please!

526
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,467
We're securing the bridge.

527
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:52,467
Move along!

528
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:54,258
Back up!

529
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,425
Hook up the Y!

and at the scaffolding.

There are teams
up in the south and north transepts.

534
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:07,758
This shows the roof vault.

535
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:10,633
Debris is falling into the cathedral
through an oculus.

536
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,133
The general's coming!

537
00:51:12,258 --> 00:51:13,133

I must warn you: the building's fragile.

550
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:08,883
The stone's porous. It's 12th century.

551
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:10,758
It's like blotting paper.

552
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:12,342
Then you choose.

553
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:13,383
What?

554
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:14,633
Between water and fire.

555
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:16,883
Alright.

556
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:19,175
Now I'll go do my job.

557
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,883
We have three priorities.

558
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:24,883
First, the scaffolding.

559
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,508
500 tons of it. If it bows...

560
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:30,258
Jean-Marie's on call tonight.
He's in command.

561
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:33,300
I'll command operations, Captain.

562
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:36,217
General Gontier's taking over.
Spread the word.

563
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:37,300
Second priority.

564
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:38,842
Lieutenant, your mission:

565
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:41,633
Don't let the fire
spread to the belfries.

566
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,133
I want an attack point
between the towers.

567
00:52:44,258 --> 00:52:46,675
Up on the terrace,
to support the aerial truck.

568
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,925
Yes, sir.

569
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:49,342
Last,

570
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,300
and I should've started with this.

571
00:52:51,675 --> 00:52:53,175
Rescue the artwork.

572
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,592
The cathedral can be rebuilt,
not the relics,

573
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,925
or priceless treasures it contains.

574
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,092
General, Captain Francis
is in command of the Seine sector

575
00:53:03,217 --> 00:53:05,842
and artwork retrieval.
Trained at the Louvre.

576
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,883
General.
- I'm counting on you.

577
00:53:08,008 --> 00:53:11,342
I'm Monsignor Charley,
rector of the cathedral.

578
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:12,467
Come, My Lord.

579
00:53:12,592 --> 00:53:14,300
Captain, I beg you,

580
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,883
of all things, save the Crown of Thorns.

581
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:17,967
Alright.

582
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:21,008
I can't reach Laurent Prades. Seen him?

583
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:22,967
- Who?
- Laurent Prades.

584
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,508
No, not at all.

585
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,592
Until you find him, this is Céline.
Heritage curator.

586
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:32,592
She'll explain everything meanwhile.

587
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:36,467
So all these pieces can be accessed
via the sacristy?

588
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:39,842
Yes, but the list is incomplete.
Inventory's not done.

589
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,050
But the Crown

590
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,633
is in the axial chapel.

591
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,050
The Seven Sorrows.

592
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:47,133
Along the ambulatory,

593
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,675
second side chapel in the apse.

594
00:53:51,092 --> 00:53:52,758
How do I recognize it?

595
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:54,258
- What, the Crown?
- Yes.

596
00:53:55,633 --> 00:54:00,383
It's like what you saw in the Louvre
in paintings of the crucifixion.

597
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:02,925
Ok. Come with me.

598
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,633
And put up your hood.

599
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:08,425
We really need Laurent Prades.

600
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,050
Sorry, but who's he?

601
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,258
Céline, wait! I've got him!

602
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:16,133
Saint-Michel's closed.
I got off at Orsay.

603
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,467
I know, My Lord!

604
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:19,633
Yes.

605
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,383
Of course I have it.

606
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,592
I always carry it on me.

607
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,800
As fast as I can, My Lord.

608
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:34,258
I don't believe this!

609
00:54:58,258 --> 00:55:00,675
<i>The wind has shifted from E to NE.</i>

610
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,675
<i>The Massena aerial truck
on Square Jean XXIII</i>

611
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,633
<i>will set up
at corner of the south belfry.</i>

612
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:09,425
<i>Do you read me? Go ahead.</i>

613
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,883
<i>Roger that. Over.</i>

614
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:24,925
Over here! Please evacuate.

615
00:55:37,717 --> 00:55:38,925
It's this way.

616
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,592
Stay here.

617
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:46,175
It's toward the back. You can't miss it.

618
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,758
In a reliquary.

619
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:50,050
A display case.

620
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:50,967
Guys, with me.

621
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:01,925
Hug the walls.
It's raining debris.

622
00:56:55,717 --> 00:56:57,050
Go on, force it open.

623
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:48,008
Sergeant,
tell CP we recovered the Crown.

624
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:51,883
CP truck for Captain Francis.

625
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,717
Reporting we have retrieved

626
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:55,425
<i>the Crown of Thorns.</i>

627
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:14,550
Thank You, Lord.

628
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:17,717
Thank You

629
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:21,508
for giving back this relic
that brings us closer to You.

630
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:43,217
Father!

631
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:46,300
Padre, Chaplain,

632
00:58:46,425 --> 00:58:47,883
look, we found it.

633
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:50,383
It's not the real one.

634
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:54,425
It's a decoy, a facsimile.

635
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,925
A vegetal likeness.

636
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,925
Not the real Crown of Thorns.

637
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:01,342
What do you mean?

638
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:03,967
I'm a Knight of the Holy Sepulcher.

639
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,550
I've held the crown in my hands.

640
00:59:08,175 --> 00:59:11,383
It's in a safe in the chapel.
We need a key and a code.

641
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:13,592
Who has the key?

642
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,383
Laurent Prades.

643
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:23,800
Move back, please.

644
01:00:23,925 --> 01:00:26,717
I live right over there.
Let me by.

645
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:31,675
Stand back.
Make way for the firefighters.

646
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:38,258
It's like they don't hear us.
We'll never get through.

647
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,717
Follow the colonel's EMS truck.

648
01:00:40,842 --> 01:00:45,758
<i>Location in sight for
Versailles aerial truck stuck in traffic.</i>

649
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:47,800
Almost there.
200 yards to go.

650
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:35,092
Pull out!
Sarge, your crew!

651
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,008
You heard him!
Firefighters, pull out!

652
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,300
Evacuate! Team 1, bring up the rear.

653
01:02:07,092 --> 01:02:08,217
<i>Good evening</i>, <i>all.</i>

654
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:09,758
<i>This Monday night's news:</i>

655
01:02:09,883 --> 01:02:12,800
{\an8}<i>a major conflagration
in Notre-Dame Cathedral.</i>

656
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:16,425
{\an8}<i>Fire broke out in the attic
just before 7 p.m.</i>

657
01:02:44,425 --> 01:02:46,675
<i>We just learned some 20 minutes ago</i>

658
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,883
<i>that Emmanuel Macron
has postponed his address</i>

659
01:02:50,008 --> 01:02:53,133
<i>to go to the Notre-Dame Cathedral.</i>

660
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,008
Help me open the door!

661
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,342
Move over!

662
01:03:08,758 --> 01:03:10,217
I have four guys inside!

663
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,175
Watch your head.

664
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:22,758
Hurry! The fumes are toxic!

665
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,675
The captain doesn't have his mask.

666
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:32,300
Oh, man, I don't believe it!

667
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:36,342
Sandro, try!

668
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:39,717
Hang on.

669
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:43,842
It's locked on the other side.

670
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:46,508
Poissy duty officer

671
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:49,050
for Poissy sergeant. Go ahead.

672
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:53,383
You alright, Captain?

673
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,092
Door blocked, north transept.
Can't evacuate.

674
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:59,175
I repeat: can't evacuate!

675
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,508
The rescue hood!

676
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:02,383
We need help.

677
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:06,258
<i>We're trying to enter the building.
Hang in there.</i>

678
01:04:07,758 --> 01:04:08,925
Roger.

679
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,383
We'll cope.

680
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Get the rescue hood on him.

681
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,092
Hang in there.

682
01:04:25,217 --> 01:04:27,050
Only 100 bars left.

683
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:34,717
It's me again, Rue de la Vacquerie.

684
01:04:34,842 --> 01:04:36,800
My little kitten got out.

685
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:39,258
He's sliding off the roof.

686
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,550
Yes.

687
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:44,675
He's slipping!
He can't hold on much longer.

688
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,133
My little kitten!

689
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,925
Come with the big ladder!

690
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:58,508
You're here, General?

691
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,717
My respects.
They're shaken, but unharmed.

692
01:05:02,383 --> 01:05:04,925
- Anyone else inside?
- I don't think so!

693
01:05:12,592 --> 01:05:14,133
I don't want anyone under that!

694
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:21,217
Gen. Gallet here:
ceiling vault pierced by spire,

695
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:23,633
burning smoke
evacuating by flue effect,

696
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:26,675
risk of explosion diminished,
risk of collapse increased.

697
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,217
Thank you, Corporal.

698
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,508
DRONE UNIT

699
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:06,508
Please, let me through...

700
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,133
Fire scene safety area,
no one goes through.

701
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:10,800
The key to the Holy Crown!

702
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,842
Sure.

703
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:15,967
- I'm the cathedral general manager!
- Everyone's a bishop today.

704
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,092
Move back!

705
01:06:18,633 --> 01:06:19,758
Thank you.

706
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:22,133
Behind the tape, ma'am.

707
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:40,800
Stop him!

708
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:42,258
Police! Halt!

709
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:44,967
- Let go of me!
- Your ID!

710
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:01,717
You there?

711
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:03,383
Behind the door!

712
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:13,633
- Coming out!
- Go on.

713
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,967
- Get Captain Marcus.
- We're going.

714
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:18,342
Come on!

715
01:07:26,592 --> 01:07:27,842
Stand ready.

716
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:31,508
The President's coming.
Activate mirror CP.

717
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:33,258
Act like it's the real one!

718
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,675
Here's the board.

719
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,425
- Remote screen sharing.
- Done.

720
01:07:37,383 --> 01:07:39,925
Mirror CP operational. Exact replica.

721
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,842
Don't worry, they'll buy it.

722
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,425
I'll intercept them
before they get underfoot.

723
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,592
Good luck.

724
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,342
Send me good news.

725
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,217
I won't be disturbing you often.

726
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:02,092
THE SPIRE COLLAPSED
MACRON ON SITE

727
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:04,842
Mr. President!

728
01:08:34,382 --> 01:08:36,007
Take a breather.

729
01:08:36,132 --> 01:08:38,007
Open your turnouts. Swap tanks.

730
01:08:40,257 --> 01:08:42,632
Stand ready to go in again.

731
01:08:57,632 --> 01:08:59,507
- Better, Captain?
- Yeah.

732
01:09:16,092 --> 01:09:17,175
Two issues:

733
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,050
The wind is turning.

734
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:21,092
It's shifted north toward the belfry.

735
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:24,467
Second, the temperature.
Over 2,200° F.

736
01:09:27,425 --> 01:09:28,342
Ok.

737
01:09:29,133 --> 01:09:32,383
Switching to exterior attack.
With all possible units.

738
01:09:32,508 --> 01:09:34,883
All aerial trucks and fireboats.

739
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,883
Put me on the main channel.

740
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:42,508
Make sure Colossus shows up.

741
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:06,467
We're here to cool down the gable!

742
01:10:06,592 --> 01:10:09,008
The fire mustn't reach the belfry.

743
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:10,092
Roger that?

744
01:10:10,217 --> 01:10:11,217
- Lieutenant?
- Yes?

745
01:10:11,342 --> 01:10:12,758
The standpipe is giving out...

746
01:10:12,883 --> 01:10:16,008
Sergeant,
I give the orders! I know what to do.

747
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:19,342
Sorry, sir. I'm not ivy league.
My parents aren't rich.

748
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,633
Right, great. Asshole.

749
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:24,425
I swear...

750
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,217
Fucking officers.

751
01:10:26,342 --> 01:10:28,467
<i>General Gontier to all firefighters.</i>

752
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,217
<i>General evacuation.</i>

753
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:32,467
<i>I want no one inside</i>

754
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,883
<i>or on the building.</i>

755
01:10:34,008 --> 01:10:34,842
Wait!

756
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:37,842
<i>We're switching to exterior attack.</i>

757
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:39,675
Guys!

758
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,842
Anchor the hoses and get out!

759
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:51,175
Risk of collapse. Evacuate!

760
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,342
What'd he say?

761
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:54,467
Place is coming down.
Gotta go!

762
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:00,008
Colossus ETA?

763
01:11:00,508 --> 01:11:01,425
8 minutes.

764
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,883
We need it now. Now!

765
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:09,383
We can still win this
with all available assets.

766
01:11:09,508 --> 01:11:11,008
Status on the fireboats?

767
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,592
Where's the damned safe?

768
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:29,842
What's it look like?

769
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:33,842
Gimme some light.

770
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,717
I can't see.

771
01:12:11,008 --> 01:12:12,592
Guys, I found it.

772
01:12:13,258 --> 01:12:15,217
Is there a reference on your label?

773
01:12:15,342 --> 01:12:16,217
We found the safe.

774
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:17,800
Now we need the key.

775
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:19,050
Where is it?

776
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:20,092
Anyone have it?

777
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:21,508
Me!

778
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,050
I'm the stage manager.

779
01:12:23,175 --> 01:12:25,383
I have a key to the sacristy.

780
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,550
I have that key, too.

781
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,925
This box has the key to the main closet.

782
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:39,883
Then what?

783
01:12:40,008 --> 01:12:41,300
It contains 700 keys.

784
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:43,925
- And?
- We have to find the right key.

785
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:45,383
My boss knows.

786
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:47,967
Who's your boss?
Don't say Laurent...

787
01:12:48,092 --> 01:12:49,008
Prades.

788
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:50,342
- Move!
- Here he is!

789
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:51,883
Out of the way!

790
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:10,758
This one.

791
01:13:28,758 --> 01:13:31,383
Only one person with Mr. Prades!

792
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:32,967
The ministry guy!

793
01:13:33,425 --> 01:13:35,592
Mr. Prades, beware of debris.

794
01:13:35,717 --> 01:13:38,300
Be careful.
Don't lose eye contact with me.

795
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:45,758
Your helmet. You too.

796
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:48,217
Wet your scarves
and cover your mouths.

797
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:49,967
It's for the fumes.

798
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:17,467
Here!

799
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:20,092
We have to break this
to access the safe.

800
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:34,967
That's not it...

801
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,883
I know the code.

802
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:04,300
But I'm panicking.
I'm drawing a blank.

803
01:15:05,217 --> 01:15:06,800
Helmet on.

804
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,092
Who else has it?

805
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:19,258
The head sacristan.

806
01:15:25,883 --> 01:15:28,425
The network is saturated.
Send a text.

807
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:34,883
Hurry...

808
01:15:36,092 --> 01:15:39,550
CODE TO THE CROWN!!!!
QUICK!!!!!

809
01:15:44,092 --> 01:15:45,300
Come on!

810
01:15:51,008 --> 01:15:52,883
Laurent, let me try.

811
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:56,258
I'm usually lucky.

812
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:58,717
You never know.

813
01:16:12,842 --> 01:16:15,425
TACTICAL SUPPORT UNIT

814
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,425
That's Colossus?

815
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,967
Yup. Colossus-Rex.

816
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:40,133
Like tyrannosaurus.

817
01:16:50,758 --> 01:16:53,925
CODE TO THE CROWN!!!!
QUICK!!!!!

818
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,675
Guys, don't take your eyes off them.

819
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,800
At the first alert, get them out.

820
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:23,592
Corporal, got a good angle grinder?

821
01:17:23,717 --> 01:17:25,842
- What for?
- The Crown of Thorns.

822
01:17:56,175 --> 01:18:00,925
<i>To CP:
operation underway inside cathedral...</i>

823
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:07,967
Excuse me.

824
01:18:08,092 --> 01:18:11,342
I'm really sorry,
but it's my job to tell you.

825
01:18:11,717 --> 01:18:14,133
The flying buttresses are weakening.

826
01:18:14,258 --> 01:18:16,092
The walls are spreading.

827
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:20,175
If the building shifts,
the scaffolding will collapse.

828
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,258
Two teams
are hosing down the scaffolding nonstop.

829
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:28,050
And the north transept gable
is receding from the vault.

830
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:30,217
I spoke to Villeneuve about it.

831
01:18:30,342 --> 01:18:33,758
We need to stop watering it down.
The weight of the water...

832
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:37,092
If someone has a better idea,
let me know.

833
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:14,092
That's it! Of course!

834
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:15,883
Move over!

835
01:19:21,217 --> 01:19:22,133
0...

836
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:27,883
1, 2,

837
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:30,508
3, 4, 5,

838
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:33,383
6, 7, 8.

839
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:37,508
1, 2,

840
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:38,592
3.

841
01:19:44,258 --> 01:19:45,383
Well done.

842
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:47,842
We did it.

843
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,342
Take this.

844
01:19:54,425 --> 01:19:55,842
Take this, too.

845
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:10,550
There's also a piece of the true cross,

846
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:11,883
a vial of Christ's blood,

847
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,717
and a crucifixion nail.

848
01:20:14,883 --> 01:20:16,467
I have it in my pocket.

849
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:18,758
Come on...

850
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:21,467
Hang in there, little buddy.

851
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:28,842
Charge the hose.

852
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:30,383
Go on.

853
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:32,300
Ok.

854
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:42,342
Is that the best it can do?

855
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:43,717
More pressure, dammit!

856
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:45,800
Colossus pilot for CP truck.

857
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,717
Increase pressure.

858
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:04,342
It's at its max.

859
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:13,383
Bring Colossus back.
And get me Gen. Gallet.

860
01:21:35,383 --> 01:21:36,592
Well done, Laurent.

861
01:21:36,717 --> 01:21:38,883
Should I announce
that the Crown is saved?

862
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:42,092
We did 30 min. ago.
Let's not confuse them.

863
01:22:53,758 --> 01:22:56,592
Colossus can't reach
the seat of the fire.

864
01:22:57,217 --> 01:23:00,675
It's spread to the belfries.
The north tower especially.

865
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,550
Once the support beams weaken,
the bells will bring down the facade.

866
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:09,717
The building is too compromised
for us to send in men.

867
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:12,383
So far, there have been no casualties.

868
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:14,758
And it's the first rule
of our fire brigade:

869
01:23:14,883 --> 01:23:15,800
I can ask my men

870
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:18,342
to risk their lives to save other lives,

871
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:20,925
not to save stones.

872
01:23:22,592 --> 01:23:23,592
No matter what stones.

873
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:29,633
Mr. President,
the cathedral may well collapse.

874
01:23:30,383 --> 01:23:32,175
There is one last option.

875
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,758
A volunteer squad. A suicide mission.

876
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:37,383
But I need your approval.

877
01:23:37,508 --> 01:23:39,550
It's under your responsibility.

878
01:24:05,633 --> 01:24:08,633
We can always rebuild a cathedral,

879
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:12,550
not the life of a firefighter
or their family.

880
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:18,467
None of us want to relive the tragedy

881
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:20,675
we went through a few months ago.

882
01:24:21,467 --> 01:24:22,675
We do not want

883
01:24:23,175 --> 01:24:24,092
to relive

884
01:24:24,217 --> 01:24:26,925
the sad spectacle
of coffins in our firehouses.

885
01:24:30,175 --> 01:24:31,217
Excuse me.

886
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:38,133
What's gotten into you, Sergeant?

887
01:24:38,467 --> 01:24:40,550
Why are you among senior officers?

888
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,383
Colonel, sir,
I just went up the north belfry.

889
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:45,842
There's a leak in the standpipe,

890
01:24:46,175 --> 01:24:49,342
the stairs are flooded,
but the belfry's holding up.

891
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:53,550
The fire hasn't reached
the beams that support the bells.

892
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:55,842
We'll have to use the south stairs.

893
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:57,383
With a few men,

894
01:24:57,883 --> 01:25:00,758
we still have a 15-min. window to act.

895
01:25:00,883 --> 01:25:02,842
We have to go up on the terrace.

896
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:03,925
Are you sure of yourself?

897
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,550
Yes, sir.

898
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:07,758
Certain.

899
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:11,758
Jean-Claude,

900
01:25:12,342 --> 01:25:14,425
you sure he realizes the risk?

901
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,092
Of course.
The President was quite clear.

902
01:25:18,258 --> 01:25:20,342
In short, silence is consent.

903
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:27,133
Alright.

904
01:25:31,342 --> 01:25:34,217
We have a green light
to recruit volunteers

905
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:36,342
for a last-ditch mission.

906
01:25:36,883 --> 01:25:38,258
A suicide mission.

907
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:41,383
With a risk level
that is fully understood

908
01:25:41,883 --> 01:25:43,258
and accepted.

909
01:25:44,717 --> 01:25:45,717
You?

910
01:25:49,175 --> 01:25:51,300
Most of my men have children.

911
01:25:52,217 --> 01:25:54,925
We're happy to do our duty, but this...

912
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:56,967
I understand.

913
01:25:57,092 --> 01:25:57,967
General.

914
01:25:58,258 --> 01:25:59,300
Lieutenant.

915
01:25:59,425 --> 01:26:01,675
I listened to Sergeant Reynald's plan.

916
01:26:01,883 --> 01:26:02,883
Who?

917
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,925
General,

918
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:07,842
an NCO from my battalion has a proposal.

919
01:26:12,758 --> 01:26:13,592
My respects, General.

920
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:17,300
I know the cathedral well
and I love it.

921
01:26:17,425 --> 01:26:18,925
That's why I'm being so bold.

922
01:26:21,633 --> 01:26:23,633
I just went back up the north belfry.

923
01:26:24,425 --> 01:26:26,258
It's standing strong.

924
01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:31,300
I propose that with a few men,
we go back up on the terrace

925
01:26:31,717 --> 01:26:34,050
with six 2 1/2-inch hoses.

926
01:26:34,717 --> 01:26:36,633
The standpipes gave out.

927
01:26:37,758 --> 01:26:40,217
We can unfurl from up top,
along the facade,

928
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:42,925
and hook them up
directly to the pumpers.

929
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:45,008
I think we can do it.

930
01:26:45,383 --> 01:26:47,508
Sir, my men and I volunteer.

931
01:26:48,258 --> 01:26:49,342
Me too!

932
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:50,592
Me too.

933
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:55,800
General,
permission to accompany these men.

934
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,842
Bring them back alive.

935
01:27:21,258 --> 01:27:22,175
Watch out ahead!

936
01:27:22,508 --> 01:27:24,217
The staircase collapsed!

937
01:27:53,383 --> 01:27:56,383
Louis IX paid for this crown
with the Kingdom's treasury.

938
01:27:56,508 --> 01:27:58,967
It now belongs to the French Republic.

939
01:27:59,633 --> 01:28:01,883
I am its representative.

940
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:05,383
So...

941
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:11,467
Thank you.

942
01:29:00,925 --> 01:29:02,133
Who's there?

943
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,842
What're you doing?

944
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:11,633
Padre Boulanger?

945
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:13,425
Forgive me, Father.

946
01:29:13,758 --> 01:29:14,883
You can't stay here.

947
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,092
It's dangerous.

948
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:17,800
Warrant Officer Ibrahim,

949
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:21,383
I rescued the holy hosts,
the living body of Christ.

950
01:29:24,008 --> 01:29:27,508
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

951
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:01,592
It's blocked, Lieutenant!

952
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,675
Crew chief,
set up a point of attack.

953
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:37,300
What's this?

954
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:40,758
Guides' staff room.

955
01:30:58,383 --> 01:30:59,842
Ok, let's go!

956
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:23,633
We need more units.

957
01:31:25,008 --> 01:31:26,675
CP for Lt. Alexandre:

958
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,425
Request two additional teams. Go ahead.

959
01:31:36,883 --> 01:31:39,258
I repeat: CP for Lt. Alexandre.

960
01:31:39,383 --> 01:31:42,092
Request two additional teams. Go ahead!

961
01:31:43,675 --> 01:31:45,508
Network's saturated. No transmission.

962
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,675
I'll scout it out. I weigh the least.

963
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,883
Reynald, set up a line at the entrance.
Got it?

964
01:31:51,008 --> 01:31:52,258
Got it, Lieutenant.

965
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,633
Let's go!

966
01:32:05,925 --> 01:32:07,592
It's too narrow to pass.

967
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:10,300
Climb over me. Go on!

968
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:21,592
Going over you, Sarge.

969
01:32:21,717 --> 01:32:22,842
There.

970
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:37,758
Roll 'em out.

971
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:47,925
I'm coming, Lieutenant!

972
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,467
You're soaked.
You'll steam cook!

973
01:33:50,967 --> 01:33:52,800
Extinguish the floor first.

974
01:34:09,258 --> 01:34:11,092
Sir, ready for the line?

975
01:34:11,217 --> 01:34:12,508
Throw it up!

976
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:30,758
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

977
01:34:30,883 --> 01:34:35,300
<i>The Lord is with thee.</i>

978
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:41,258
<i>Blessed art thou among women,</i>

979
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:46,717
<i>and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.</i>

980
01:34:46,842 --> 01:34:52,008
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</i>

981
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:57,300
<i>pray for us sinners,</i>

982
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:03,217
<i>now, and at the hour of our death.</i>

983
01:35:03,342 --> 01:35:08,008
<i>Amen, amen, hallelujah.</i>

984
01:35:09,883 --> 01:35:14,800
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

985
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:19,592
<i>The Lord is with thee.</i>

986
01:35:19,883 --> 01:35:24,425
<i>Blessed art thou among women,</i>

987
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:29,217
<i>and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.</i>

988
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:08,508
Yes, to the right!

989
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:16,342
The hose stream's a sprinkle!
Too low to reach the seat.

990
01:36:17,217 --> 01:36:19,050
The water just vaporizes.

991
01:36:19,175 --> 01:36:20,300
Colonel,

992
01:36:20,425 --> 01:36:22,717
we requested more lines and units.

993
01:36:22,842 --> 01:36:23,925
No one's answering.

994
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:26,842
We won't get any.
It's five men max.

995
01:36:26,967 --> 01:36:28,633
What if the bell falls?

996
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:32,342
I request permission to go up.

997
01:36:32,467 --> 01:36:34,175
You're soaked. Stay here.

998
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,592
I'm dry, Colonel.

999
01:36:36,008 --> 01:36:37,550
I went over the water.

1000
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:39,758
I clung to the wire fencing.

1001
01:36:41,592 --> 01:36:43,300
I can try to climb up.

1002
01:37:15,342 --> 01:37:16,508
Lieutenant!

1003
01:37:54,425 --> 01:37:56,175
Give me more hose!

1004
01:37:57,883 --> 01:37:59,092
Enough!

1005
01:41:11,883 --> 01:41:13,008
General,

1006
01:41:13,925 --> 01:41:15,508
Colonel Michelon here.

1007
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:17,925
In the north belfry,

1008
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:20,092
the fire is out.

1009
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:22,675
I repeat.

1010
01:41:23,592 --> 01:41:24,967
The fire is out.

1011
01:43:20,425 --> 01:43:23,258
My second fire
might be a bit disappointing.

1012
01:43:23,383 --> 01:43:24,217
Here,

1013
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,008
piece of gum.

1014
01:43:26,383 --> 01:43:28,092
Told you I owed you one.

1015
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,175
{\an8}<i>The President is back in the cathedral.</i>

1016
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,925
{\an8}<i>The fire is definitely contained.</i>

1017
01:43:49,508 --> 01:43:52,050
<i>By some miracle,
no firefighters were killed</i>

1018
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:54,508
<i>or even seriously injured.</i>

1019
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,675
<i>The 1,300 works of art in the Treasury</i>

1020
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,592
<i>were all recovered
and are safely stored at City Hall.</i>

1021
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:03,883
<i>850 years after its construction,</i>

1022
01:44:04,008 --> 01:44:06,633
<i>Notre-Dame of Paris is still standing.</i>

1023
