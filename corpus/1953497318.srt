00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:33,322
Keep an eye up

3
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,849
Excuse me, sir?

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,349
Hey, is this the ... ?

5
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,484
I asked a woman a few miles back
where I could find the ...

6
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,978
and she told me that it is the shit old
with the ugly fat fog

7
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,079
lying up front with a bullet in his head?

8
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,947
You see?
I knew I had the right place.

9
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,338
Carlos?

10
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,305
Carlos Ruiz?

11
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,737
Have you guys seen Carlos Ruiz?

12
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,589
Do you mind if I change that?

13
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,335
I never bin a big fan of soccer.

14
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,536
Get up.

15
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:03,000
Sorry,
I missed that.

16
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,062
I missed it.

17
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:05,303
Let's go.

18
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:40,911
Carlos Ruiz...

19
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,015
I haven't heard that name in a while.

20
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:46,911
Well... that's because Carlos Ruiz is dead.

21
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,784
Tell me:
How did he died?

22
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,962
Officialy math lab explosion,

23
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,063
burned his face pritty bad,
lost an eye,

24
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:57,186
wasn't to long before his man forced him
in to  early retirement.

25
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,580
No go watch ceremony,
I  would imagine.

26
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:01,681
I would imagine not.

27
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,132
And unofficialy?

28
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,578
Unofficialy?

29
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,497
I am of the believe
you can't kill true evil,

30
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:09,212
although it hasn't stop me from trying.

31
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,349
Normally...

32
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,482
we live well-enough alone, you know,

33
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,285
if you Beaners wanna kill himselves
south of the border of a little white rocks

34
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:15,092
we don't give a shit.

35
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:15,940
Today you give a shit.

36
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,774
Today I give a big huge shit.

37
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:21,599
<i><s>[And what's the carrelive for this
sady changing posy?]</i>

38
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:22,595
A girl.

39
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,702
That's always a reason, right?

40
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:25,753
It's a popular motive.

41
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,858
Do you have a specific one in mind?

42
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,860
Zoe LaPerrier, daughter of
IOS senator Choy LaPerrier

43
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,602
17 years young, blond, pretty

44
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:35,023
and by populair account lacking
sound judgment.

45
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:36,547
And you believe this girl is here?

46
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:37,560
I do.

47
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,499
I am Carlos Ruiz.

48
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:40,898
That would explane the mask,

49
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,655
a kind of a sollidarity gesture.

50
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,497
Become embarrassed, mother fucker?

51
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,789
Do you think about all the people
your wife fucks

52
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,574
because your face looks like
a dried-up peace of dogs shit?

53
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:06,299
Welcome back, Carlos.

54
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:09,963
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,992
I think you intend the traffic
the Lapeïr girl

56
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,523
and I am here to shut you down.

57
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,079
Shortly you must be aware of
your situation.

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,822
And what situation?

59
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,210
You hear that?

60
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:29,690
No sir,
and my hearing is above average.

61
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,791
No backup unit breaking down the door.

62
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:34,819
No millitary vehicles rushing
to the rescue.

63
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,319
No contingency plan.

64
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,473
I'm not quite sure I put it like that.

65
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:46,264
Gentleman, there are more diplomatic
solutions available.

66
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,545
I can not think of notting more diplomatic

67
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,232
than cutting off the head of my enemy

68
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,183
and melling it to his overman.

69
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,612
Where should I adress this package?

70
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:56,224
FBI?

71
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,193
CIA? Blackops?

72
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,283
Well, I work for a more
specialized devision.

73
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,182
There really isn't an adress...

74
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:03,691
A love one perhaps?

75
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,816
Yes, but...
she will appreciate the gesture.

76
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,147
Was that enough evidence for you?

77
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,439
Ruiz has the girl.

78
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,516
I dont think convincing us
was ever the problem,

79
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,132
but that last shelling-use
coulda been put a better use

80
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,648
Yea? Like what?

81
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,749
It was a reckless waste, Charlie.

82
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,706
Not really worried.

83
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,229
Let's try this again.

84
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,474
How many of your friends are back there?

85
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,202
Hey, Red
I counted eight.

86
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,102
Who are you?

87
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,234
I am the contingency plan.

88
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,942
Who are you?
Where is my phone?

89
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:50,730
Let's go.

90
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,086
Wait, what's in your back?

91
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,219
Carlos.
Let's go!

92
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,873
Put me down!
Are you serious right now?

93
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,315
You're kidding me.

94
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,975
Package delivered.
