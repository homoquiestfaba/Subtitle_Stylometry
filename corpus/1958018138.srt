1
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,077
I think that bastard
reset all my teeth.

2
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,246
It's only right since he didn't
have any of his own.

3
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:16,286
How old was he? 90?

4
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,458
It's not age, it's skill.

5
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,574
"Badly Benny Barrell" was the champ
and my best friend defeated him.

6
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:22,749
That's right.

7
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,740
Yeah, a champ in 1926.

8
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,671
And it took Eric twelve rounds
to drop him?

9
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,919
- What's the problem? I won, didn't I?
- Don't listen to her.

10
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,967
I'm going to write a swell article
about the fight.

11
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:38,098
"Eric 'Kid' Carson
slugs it out with world-champion fighter,..."

12
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:42,184
"...slash drunk,
slash sex fiend."

13
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:46,354
Gee, thanks, Mary Anne, but when you put it
that way, it doesn't work for me.

14
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:50,487
Tell me, champ, what was worse?
His punch or his breath?

15
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:53,815
"Benny's eyes were red-hot coals burning
with the rage of a thousand defeats
."

16
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:55,824
I love it!

17
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,103
Yeah, he probably scares them to death
at the soup kitchen.

18
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:02,080
Let's face it, even your brother wouldn't
have bet on that one.

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,165
And he only believes only in sure things.

20
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:07,406
"Believed." Judith, you talk
like Roy's still around.

21
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,341
He ain't. He took a powder, sweetheart.

22
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,699
Hey, Roy never
ran away from anything in his life.

23
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:16,756
Wrong. That's all he did.
He owes all over town.

24
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,849
I don't care if he lammed from Mexico
to South America,

25
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,009
I just want him to be alive.

26
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:28,179
Well the crime beat guys at The Tattler said
this is the last place anybody's seen him.

27
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,309
Let's go. I've got a million questions
for these thugs.

28
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,512
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You stay
here, I'll check it out.

29
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:36,436
What, the punk's now the gumshoe?
That doesn't quite work for you, kid.

30
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:38,691
This place looks a little rough...

31
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,692
and, uh, delicate flowers like you two shouldn't
be exposed to this environment.

32
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,915
Maybe you 've forgotten, but
I work for the Hollywood Tattler...

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,993
...the country's 9th best-selling
movie rag?

34
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,079
I take my job very seriously and
I'll go anywhere to hunt a story.

35
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:56,454
Even Shirley Temple's underwear drawer
which isn't as pretty as it sounds.

36
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:00,582
Yeah, but, uh... we're not huntin'
a story, we're huntin' Roy.

37
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:04,628
You two are my best pals, just
give me ten minutes, okay?

38
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:09,719
I know you can take care of yourself, but
if things get dicey, throw in the towel, okay?

39
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,012
I don't think you
can take another win tonight.

40
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,176
I'll be all right.

41
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,650
What a loser!

42
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:29,577
See, that's your problem, dear.
You don't know the difference...

43
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:33,744
...between a loser and
a guy who won't quit.

44
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,453
- "Kid" Carson!
- How you doin? - Congratulations!

45
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:51,552
That guy you found tonight--
what made him keel over?

46
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,796
A stroke
or a heart attack?

47
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:57,966
A win's a win, smart guy. Give me a
bourbon and some answers.

48
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:02,090
- When's the last time you
saw Roy Carson? - Your brother?

49
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,227
He was in here every night for the last two weeks
.

50
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:09,347
Flashin' lots of green to
impress a broad.

51
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,406
What broad?

52
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:13,687
Her!

53
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:22,942
Jesus Christ on a crutch!

54
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,956
Yeah, your brother said the same thing.

55
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:39,427
Hey! How long has
Johnny Q been chasing that?

56
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:43,597
- You just finished your drink!
- Oh, now I get the setup.

57
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,878
- See how much they gimme to clam up if I ask questions.
- You wanna taste some pine? Get lost.

58
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:52,218
Now, you know he hated my brother's guts.
They get into it?

59
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:57,265
Go ten rounds with a grandmother.
That's more your speed anyway.

60
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:59,437
Yeah, I'll see ya.

61
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,488
You know they found the body of some little starlet
stuffed in those trash cans over there

62
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,581
Couple months ago.

63
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:58,784
Her only screen credit was a corpse
in a Charlie Chan flick.

64
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,035
Kind of ironic.

65
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:04,077
Wow, you're just a fountain of
information, aren't you sweets?

66
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,078
Tinsel town's my beat.

67
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:09,168
Anytime you think you're about to catch a break
I'll put a word in for you.

68
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:12,376
Thanks, but my glamor-puss days are over.

69
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:17,502
But don't think I still can't work it.
Just put me in a room with a sugar daddy and get out of the way.

70
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:20,720
Friend to friend? You don't meet
a lot of nice guys that way.

71
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:24,841
You can have nice... I like exciting.

72
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,947
What if Mr. Exciting's dead?

73
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:44,783
That's all you get tonight.

74
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,866
Now what the fuck does that mean? You've been saying the same
thing for the past two weeks.

75
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:51,839
It means you
have to be patient.

76
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,996
For what? A pump with a stipper?

77
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,244
You're on fire, but I don't
put the brakes on for nobody.

78
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,379
No more bullshit!

79
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:10,927
Jesus Christ!

80
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:28,533
Hey, follow that dame and don't let her go!

81
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,178
Thanks for saving my ass.

82
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,340
I take it you found out something about
Roy? Has he been naughty?

83
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:53,545
Oh yeah! He was spending a lot of time with this
chippy we're tailing.

84
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,639
I just saw her rip some greaseball to shreds
without breaking a sweat.

85
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,812
Think she gave Roy the same treatment?

86
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:05,058
Sweetheart, you may have just won me
the Pulitzer Prize.

87
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:30,000
Whoa, right here!
Okay!

88
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,822
Okay, so whatta we do with Miss
Bump and Grind?

89
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,872
What? I get around.

90
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:20,973
I'm always surprise how much
you get around.

91
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,248
The trick is not to show it.

92
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:28,551
You guys coming?

93
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,400
All right, Sherlock, now what?

94
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:53,245
Aw, you know Judith? We could have
pulled her over and

95
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:56,456
you could have asked all the questions
you wanted about Roy.

96
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,578
And she probably would have ripped your
head off... literally.

97
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,704
Honey, that's the third time you said that. Now, what
exactly happened? And don't leave out the gruesome details.

98
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:11,055
- Where the hell have you been?
- You don't speak to me like that!

99
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:12,336
Sorry...

100
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:16,382
... it's just that the doctor and the others...
they get on edge when you don't come right home.

101
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,505
I had a little hunting to do, remember?

102
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:21,552
Were you successful?

103
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,656
You were supposed to bring home a woman!

104
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:29,856
It couldn't be helped.
He got in the way.

105
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,104
I don't know what the doctor's
going to say about this.

106
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:34,189
I was followed.

107
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:36,153
They're just down the hill.

108
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:39,197
Who? What?
Who are "they?" The police?

109
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:42,413
No. Somebody from the club.

110
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:47,573
But don't worry. As soon as they enter the
grounds, it's just more lambs for the slaughter.

111
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,096
Roy's my brother. I think I
should go after the girl.

112
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:04,185
Yeah, he's my lover
And I agree.

113
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,343
What if she pops up while you're out
here alone, sweets?

114
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,559
Hey, you mighta seen a killer, I saw a two-bit
tramp breaking the speed limit.

115
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,693
Either way, it's for the cops.

116
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,729
Look, before we talk to anybody, we should
know what we're talking about. That's my editor's Rule #1

117
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,984
So why don't we go in, find out what's what,

118
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,150
And if things get crazy,
we can run back to the car.

119
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,364
You can
run in the heels, can't you dear?

120
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,577
Here we go.

121
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:55,275
So, uh... what is this place?

122
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:59,480
It's a hideaway. Left over from the pre-war
pre-tax days.

123
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,768
Make movies all day, party all night,
and be dead by your 25th birthday.

124
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:06,944
Huh... Doesn't sound too bad to me.

125
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,491
She could be hiding out anywhere.

126
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,576
And who knows what's underneath us?

127
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,582
These old places had escape tunnels in case of a vice raid.

128
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:30,761
Okay, I'll be a bitch and ask... Shouldn't we
at least wait until daylight?

129
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:33,998
Uh-uh. Roy could
be long gone.

130
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,135
Well, as far as I'm concerned, she
can have him.

131
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:42,222
According to you, she's willing to kill for him.
Helluva lot more than I'd ever do.

132
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,478
Judith's making sense for once.

133
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,512
My nose smells a story, but I'd
like to live long enough to write it.

134
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,686
What if my brother's dead?

135
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,733
All the more reason to call in the flatfeet.

136
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:59,898
Let the blue suits run around here and you can sit on your tired
cans and watch and I can phone it in to the city desk.- Good idea.

137
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:09,247
Wait a minute!
I know what this place is!

138
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:15,411
There was a sanitarium for the hoi polloi that
burned down in 1928.

139
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,758
It was run by this doc from Hong Kong.

140
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:20,842
He treated the crazies...

141
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:24,047
...with a combination of ancient Chinese
herbs and white powder moth.

142
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:30,094
One of the less happy patients went crazy with a blow torch.
Cooked everyone inside.

143
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,478
Interesting.

144
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:36,391
I know there
is another building on this estate.

145
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:38,483
part of the...

146
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,904
- Jesus Christ! What the hell was that?
- Shit! Come on Mar!

147
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,119
- Come on! - What? Have you taken one too many hits?
I'm not going up there!

148
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,282
- Uh-uh. We're no leaving her.
- No!

149
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:25,476
Great. It's either the Castle Frankenstein or whatever's
skulking in the bushes.

150
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:29,725
Hey... we're not leaving her. Okay?

151
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:35,981
All right, she better write a damn good article for
us to be saving her candy ass.

152
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,116
Come on.

153
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,527
Jesus, what is this place?

154
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:16,694
I dunno...

155
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:49,928
Dammit!

156
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,179
This is where I'm s'posed to tell you
not to worry. And don't bother screaming...

157
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:58,269
...but really, you should be scared shitless

158
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:03,282
- And go ahead and scream your lungs out!
- Eric, do something!

159
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,734
I'll see you later, my love.

160
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,705
Comfortable, my friend?

161
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:11,989
Jesus, you can speak?

162
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:16,065
Oh, I have vocal cords
and I know how to use 'em.

163
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,084
Not as well as your female friends.

164
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,331
Where is she?

165
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,216
Does it really matter?

166
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,465
I don't know what the hell you have planned,
but can't you just let 'em go?

167
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,432
You won't say anything.

168
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:35,553
Considering your friend
Mary Anne works for the newspaper...

169
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:38,964
...I doubt your promise
means very much.

170
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:44,022
Besides, I don't make the choices.
The doctor does.

171
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,390
C'mon Peewee, let's go!

172
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:55,732
What doctor?

173
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,700
What the hell is this?

174
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,706
Good question, champ.

175
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,252
Gallagher, I need more light!

176
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,456
I can't work if I can't see!

177
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,553
Mister? You have to help me. Please...

178
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,804
Help you? Help you with what, young lady?

179
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:23,882
Bringing the police down on my old head?

180
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,002
Sending myself to prison for the rest of my life ?

181
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,974
I don't think so,
but I like the irony.

182
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:32,106
- Please!
- I'm working--can't you see that?

183
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,229
Some of your friends are here.

184
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:37,478
What? Oh, God...

185
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:40,405
You'll al be together soon.
Won't they, Doctor?

186
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,691
No, they'll be used.

187
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:47,623
Well, perhaps you'll be united in a better place. That's
a thought to cling to right now.

188
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:58,007
Oh, this is no good. These organs
are riddled with yellow fever.

189
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:01,294
There's nothing worth harvesting. This man would have
been dead in two weeks anyway.

190
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,545
Even if he hadn't have been with Alliana.

191
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,469
I'm gonna have to check her
for an infection.

192
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:10,677
- But this was for Peewee!
- Yes, I know!

193
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:12,838
But what must I do?

194
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,899
What? You said you do.

195
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,060
I can't. This body is useless.

196
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:24,152
If I use any part of it in you, you'll die.
Is that what you want?

197
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,437
No!

198
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:30,453
Calm yourself! He's got to be
satisfied, Doctor!

199
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,660
Let him have the girl!

200
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:43,995
- Sorry, my dear.
- No!
- Just close your eyes.

201
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,247
I don't have any anesthetic.

202
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,014
Have her put on ice..

203
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,029
...in case there are any organs
he hasn't damaged.

204
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:13,274
It's not your fault, Doctor!

205
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,326
You didn't know the body was diseased.

206
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:20,535
I created all of you. Everything
you do is my fault.

207
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:45,515
You showed great courage following me.

208
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:47,682
I think it's fucking stupidity

209
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:52,722
- Why so cruel to yourself?
- You're one casual dame.

210
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:56,942
- I've never met anyone crazy before.
- Do you think I'm crazy?

211
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:01,116
I just watched you kill a guy with a punch
Superman couldn't match.

212
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:03,398
Now you're going to kill me.

213
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,329
What makes you think
I want to kill you?

214
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:20,124
Take off your shirt.

215
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,216
i want you clean

216
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:30,550
Trousers, too

217
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,514
Don't be modest.

218
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,274
What's gonna happen to me?

219
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,392
Well that depends on
how I feel later.

220
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:55,530
What about Mary Anne?

221
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:58,700
She's here.

222
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,750
Last I saw her
she was in good health.

223
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:05,953
Afraid, but fine.

224
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,125
I want to see her.

225
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,215
That sounded
like a demand.

226
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:16,371
You don't make demands here!

227
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:20,352
I just want to reassure her that
everything's gonna be okay.

228
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:23,680
That's sweet. It has nothing to do with reality.

229
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,769
Will I meet the doctor?

230
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:35,904
When I'm satisifed that you're worthy.

231
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:40,399
Nice...

232
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,238
Get me out of here, you freak!
Get me out!

233
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:38,459
Have you ever gotten anybody to do anything

234
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,703
by speaking to them like that?

235
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:42,833
I just want to get out of here!

236
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,959
Well, perhaps when you behave yourself
like a lady...

237
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,262
I'll listen to what you have to say.

238
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,458
You masking bastard!

239
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:18,281
You're not making happy with this one, are you?

240
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,324
I just don't want him to do anything premature
until he's been completely evaluated.

241
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:24,703
By who?

242
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:33,882
Get this rotting flesh out of here
and burn it.

243
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:38,963
- And take me to meet our young guest.
Forgetting yourself, aren't you?

244
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:43,144
I think it best if I speak to this young man,
don't you agree?

245
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,393
As a matter of fact, I do.

246
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,326
Remember: you're in my home.

247
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,533
I expect you to act accordingly!

248
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:23,004
Doctor!

249
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:29,252
I heard you
had another failure tonight.

250
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:34,394
- Too bad.
- Too bad for you too, my dear.

251
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:38,469
Anything that holds back our progress
affects us all.

252
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:43,770
Although... you... are perfect.

253
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:52,949
But, your choices this evening.
were not ideal.

254
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:57,240
He forced the issue. I'm sorry.

255
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,329
But I made up for it.

256
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,624
I understand you were acquainted with the deceased.

257
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,710
I believe he was some kind of gangster?

258
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:08,961
Oh, we was a prick,

259
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,797
but he shouldn't have gone that way.

260
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,125
Oh, that's much better than what God had
planned for him, I can assure you.

261
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,348
Come closer

262
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:29,643
Alliana tells me, "not-negative" things about you,.

263
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,860
We have mated once.
I was not displeased.

264
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:40,077
Let's see if it takes. That's the test.

265
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:43,241
Well, how do you feel, boy?

266
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,210
Like I've stumbled into a madhouse.

267
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:49,448
Those people--what happened to them?

268
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:54,465
Why? They were born.
And this is not a madhouse.

269
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:58,880
They call it "The House of Pain."

270
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:03,014
Jesus... so I got something to look forward to.

271
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,177
Great.

272
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:08,138
You told me you weren't gonna kill me.

273
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:11,187
I said it was not decided yet.

274
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:15,558
Well decide now. I ain't gonna be the victim of
your twisted shit until I'm dead.

275
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,850
Oh, you misjudged me, son.

276
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:58,058
She'll be fine. Let's go.

277
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,555
I am a prisoner
Just like you are.

278
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,527
And I do only as I'm told

279
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,689
And I'm told you need to be examined.

280
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:10,735
So...

281
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:15,778
When you're finished with him,
you are I have important business.

282
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:18,041
Pak, go and have another drink.

283
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:22,128
I can tolerate you better, the
more drunk you are.

284
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:28,380
Do everything the doctor demands.

285
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:30,624
It is your only hope.

286
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:38,798
She trusts me to be alone with you?

287
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,129
Why? What are you going to do? Kill me?

288
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,180
What then?

289
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,107
We're already locked in a cage...

290
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:49,386
...and my corpse would make them
very, very, angry.

291
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:55,407
If you want to make a child do something
you don't kill the father.

292
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:56,734
Sit.

293
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,023
What about these people?

294
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:04,949
You're the father?

295
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:09,163
That's an odd question considering
your recent mating with Alliana.

296
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:14,294
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have let that slip.

297
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:17,343
If they make a move, I'm close enough
to break your neck.

298
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:21,552
That would be a serious error.
I'm the most important thing in their lives.

299
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,792
But not for any reason that you might think.

300
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,046
They don't love me.

301
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,141
In fact, they hate my very soul
for having created them.

302
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,188
But now, they're dependent.

303
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,317
Well, you seem to be in
pretty sound health.

304
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,574
What kind of athlete were you?

305
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,694
When I was alive, I was a boxer.

306
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,656
When you were alive, huh?
Well, you're not dead yet!

307
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,867
And I doubt that day will be coming to you anytime soon.

308
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,120
Alliana has been looking
for someone like you for some time.

309
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:02,284
Congratulations, you will sire
beautiful children.

310
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:05,575
And the last phase will be complete.

311
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,547
Last phase of what?

312
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:11,558
Creation. My work.

313
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:14,758
The evolution
of the species is a fact.

314
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:19,933
But we don't know is how the gene pool
decides what form it's going to take.

315
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:24,220
One decides it's a parrot; one decides it's a human being.

316
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:27,321
The process is so complex as to be staggering.

317
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:32,527
But 20 years ago
I decided I was going to find...

318
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:36,769
...how each species
found its biological identity.

319
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:41,834
If man is truly
descended from the animals...

320
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:46,001
...why shouldn't an animal be transformed
into a man.

321
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:08,986
It isn't right.

322
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:14,223
She gets to roam the streets like trash,
bring the police down on us

323
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:19,364
And yet he still favors her over you.

324
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:24,497
Don't worry - she'll over-step her bounds.

325
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:29,790
Then you and I can continue our work.

326
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,996
Right where we left off.

327
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:38,047
I swear
I will make it happen.

328
00:31:42,594 --> 00:31:44,631
Get your weapon, Pak.

329
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:51,838
Don't be afraid.

330
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:10,359
Peewee here is the result of the combined efforts of
a mountain lion and a hyena.

331
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:12,694
I was searching for
the ultimate bodyguard.

332
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:17,668
He had great strength but minimal
brain capacity.

333
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:19,954
And, of course, disfigurement.

334
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:24,083
You made a woman mate with one?
You sick bastard!

335
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:27,172
Your temper
may be a problem.

336
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:30,335
I may have to recommend to Alliana
that you're not suited for siring.

337
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,503
Perhaps she'll be amused to see you go a few rounds here with Peewee.

338
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,729
Well, I'm sorry, but are these people or not?

339
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,135
They're manimals.

340
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,102
I started by artificially fertilizing mammal's eggs.

341
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:52,232
At first, it didn't matter what kind.

342
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:55,519
Once they grew to maturity,
I removed them from the mother

343
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:59,523
And the final birthing took place
in a seminal fluid chamber.

344
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:01,691
Very sophisticated.

345
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:06,628
Originally, I just used to
inject hormones into the newborn creatures.

346
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,080
Turned into disasters.

347
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,966
They died when they were very young,
I'm glad to say.

348
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,211
Jesus Christ. All this
was going on in this house?

349
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,372
The South Seas, actually.

350
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:21,463
I had a laboratory. I had
assistants. Pak was one of them.

351
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,519
Ah... brilliant intellect
for a weakling.

352
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,608
Together we created the manimals.

353
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:30,850
They were servants, laborers; the
best hunters in the world.

354
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:36,015
They could have been born and bred and trained for
any craft--and any purpose on earth.

355
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:41,072
But the more human they became,
the more defiant they became.

356
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:47,354
At first they buckled under my discipline
but then finally they revolted,

357
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:51,623
took me prisoner and brought
me here, to Pak's old estate.

358
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,905
Where my work continues, doesn't
it Gallagher?

359
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:59,956
We need to be among people, and the Doc here is gonna make sure that happens

360
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:04,171
And when it does, ones like you will be disposed of.

361
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,259
That's my only trump card.

362
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:11,387
Have the chance to continue changing them
until they become totally human beings...

363
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,709
...instead of groteque anomalies.

364
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:15,795
Like Alliana.

365
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:22,767
Alliana? Alliana is my work of art.

366
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:25,030
But she's not yet human.

367
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,075
Perhaps her offspring will be the final link.

368
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,436
Consider how lucky you are.

369
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,322
Instead of dissection, you'll be getting a honeymoon.

370
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,530
So... so... so you cut up everyone
you capture?

371
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,793
The experimentation continues.
I must have raw materials.

372
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,829
What about Mary Anne and Judith?

373
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:51,084
I think you'd best consider your own well-being.

374
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:53,214
They're dead, aren't they?

375
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,298
Well, your Nazi surplus served you
quite well, eh Gallagher?

376
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:02,393
Don't get cute with me, Doc!
Remember who's really in charge!

377
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,152
Got anything to say, beautiful?

378
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:20,151
- Just my compliments to the chef.
- Aw, thank you. That would be me.

379
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,751
C'mon, wake up, you punch-drunk idiot!

380
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,875
- What is that?
- I dunno.

381
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:38,925
What happened? Tell me what's going on,
don't leave anything out!

382
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,251
I don't know.

383
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,214
- Don't do this to me, you bastard!
- Judith, I don't know, really.

384
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:48,342
I mean they took me around to this place and I
didn't see what happened.

385
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:51,554
- But what I did see...
- Was it that bitch stipper?

386
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:54,692
I don't know, but
I'd be nice to her.

387
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,725
Her and the little guy pretty much run things.

388
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,978
Were you... nice to her?

389
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,152
With a knife to my throat.

390
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,201
Great. I've been kidnapped, thrown in a cage,
and held prisoner by a bunch of deformed freaks...

391
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,452
... and you get laid out of all of this?

392
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:16,707
It's perfect...

393
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:18,827
You want the big news?

394
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:22,998
They might have the same plans for you.

395
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,086
What the hell does that mean?

396
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:28,097
The guy who's behind
all this insanity...

397
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:31,095
...he wants mating partners for these freaks.

398
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,221
What?

399
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:34,503
- No!
- Yeah.

400
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,472
No, you've gotta find us a way to
get out of here.

401
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,556
Come on. You're a smart guy.

402
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:43,727
Think!

403
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,893
I thought I was punch drunk.

404
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,900
Everyone knows I'm a bitch,
why do you listen to things I say.

405
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:51,109
Jesus...

406
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,270
He might be a good guy to call.

407
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:57,206
'cause we're gonna need a miracle.

408
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:17,257
What is this?

409
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,175
A peace offering?

410
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:22,261
When I assisted you,

411
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:26,270
you always liked a taste when you were making
notes after a procedure.

412
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:29,646
If it was worth noting.

413
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:33,927
This wasn't.

414
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:38,981
There was nothing of any value to harvest.
No glands that could help anyone.

415
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:43,038
So you'll move on?

416
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:44,364
Of course.

417
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:50,208
The possibility of Alliana
giving birth to a fully-evolved human child...

418
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,576
...would be a tremendous breakthrough.

419
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:54,782
You shouldn't worry about her.

420
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:56,833
Pak...

421
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,879
There's very little else that can be done.
You know that.

422
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:05,000
What I know is that I
made the ultimate sacrifice to you.

423
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,210
And I expect to be repaid...

424
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,219
... in full!

425
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:11,418
What more do you want me to do?

426
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:19,600
I want you to use every bit of
strength of your mind.

427
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,852
Do as you said you would do!

428
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,861
I gave you a human life...

429
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,061
...and you turned it into a biological junk heap.

430
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:34,038
Now all you have to do is
turn it back.

431
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:37,214
Make her human again.

432
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:39,451
You have new parts,
I saw them.

433
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:41,703
So harvest them and use them.

434
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,668
But for my family, not yours!

435
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:51,717
The night they took me away,
I should have killed you!

436
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:54,172
But you didn't!

437
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:58,262
You better get back to work now, Doctor.

438
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,424
I just talked to Moreau.

439
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,435
He's going to have a new procedure
really soon.

440
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:11,726
I know it's hard,
but please, believe in me!

441
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:14,902
Just be a little more patient

442
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:38,965
You hate me.

443
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:44,095
But I'm going to set it right.
I swear.

444
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:14,329
Excuse me.

445
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,415
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

446
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:22,705
Now, you musn't be greedy. Your
friend here hasn't eaten at all.

447
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:27,716
And he needs to keep up his strength.
Don't you friend?

448
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:34,135
You're right, of course, but you're
the one in charge, right?

449
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,221
I do carry some weight.

450
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:42,279
If I upset you before, it's just...

451
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,489
...I'm so scared.

452
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:47,536
I know I said some horrible things...
I'm just really...

453
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:49,736
...really frightened. You know
how frightened I am?

454
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,905
As a matter of fact, I do.

455
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,119
You should get some rest.

456
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,623
That was good.

457
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,750
If it works...

458
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:57,666
What are you doing here?

459
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:01,712
-It's feeding time. - I thought
Moreau sent you to get me.

460
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,884
We're gonna need him soon enough.

461
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:07,039
- He's going to operate on Gorgana.
- She may have to wait!

462
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:11,060
He's... he's taken her body.

463
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,315
Let's deal with that thing.

464
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:19,364
Just don't hurt him--that's not your choice.

465
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,650
You worry about Gorgana.

466
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:53,723
She's mine.

467
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,975
I did nothing wrong.

468
00:42:57,187 --> 00:43:00,976
We know that. We wanna make sure
that you're all right.

469
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:03,110
That you're happy.

470
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:08,445
Jesus, he's crushing all the organs!
That thing'll be useless!

471
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,208
Oh, yes!

472
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,939
I brought you something for later.

473
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:47,058
Get out!

474
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:52,180
I hate you spying on me!

475
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:55,323
But I'm not; I was worried about you.

476
00:43:56,406 --> 00:44:00,446
Give it up, little man,
I don't want you!

477
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:05,662
I choose my mate and it's not you!

478
00:44:32,062 --> 00:44:35,021
You can't sleep
because you're scared.

479
00:44:36,149 --> 00:44:39,142
- What's the matter?
- You want out of the cage?

480
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:48,400
- So you can kill me?
- No, I would never do that!

481
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:51,536
Come on! You've suffered enough!

482
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,830
You've never seen anything like me before, have you ?

483
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:03,046
I know what you're gonna say.
In a nightmare!

484
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:07,329
But I know what I am.
Do you know what you are?

485
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:13,437
You're a natural beauty.

486
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:15,519
Come on

487
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:35,403
My surgical skills might have been
a bit sharper

488
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:37,488
...if you
hadn't have cracked my skull open.

489
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,582
If I wanted your head split
it would be split.

490
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,824
It was just a reminder that I'm not
your kow-tow anymore.

491
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,842
Well, when do you expect me
to perform this procedure?

492
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,083
They're starting the prep on the girl
right now.

493
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:02,397
Go ahead, it's okay.

494
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,809
- Oh my God! What is that?
- Don't run. Look at her!

495
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:13,987
We are all products
of Dr. Moreau's lab.

496
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:18,062
He wants to use you for his latest
experiments.

497
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:21,160
- You want to end up like one of us?
- No.

498
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:24,405
I mean I'm sorry.

499
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,579
Don't worry. No one in their right mind
would want to live the way we do.

500
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:31,669
Always in the dark. Everyone is afraid.
You have no idea.

501
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:35,794
God made you perfect and
you take that for granted.

502
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:40,045
Well, what if the doctor took away your face?
Then what would your life be like?

503
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,333
Very lonely.

504
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,211
I don't want to see him destroy
anybody else.

505
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:49,385
But it's been so long since I've been
so close to beauty...

506
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,600
...just let me see you and I'll get you out of here.

507
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,564
No.

508
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,731
I mean is that all?

509
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,817
It's not asking too much, is it?

510
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,062
In an hour you could
be back in the world of the living.

511
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,272
Then you'll let me go?

512
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,444
Yes.

513
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,749
Oh, yeah...

514
00:47:34,473 --> 00:47:37,466
God, you're more beautiful than I imagined.

515
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,630
Ah, you must be wonderful.

516
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:45,764
Whatever's good about you, the Doc's is gonna
transplant into her.

517
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:48,896
The bitch part, he'll toss into the gutter.

518
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:51,898
You can still get your way out of this...

519
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:55,151
...but it's gonna cost you a lot more
than a little strip show.

520
00:47:55,324 --> 00:47:58,237
You wanna buy your way out of the operating room?

521
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:01,334
You know the price!

522
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,876
I heard you call out.

523
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:18,038
I was afraid the doctor had
changed his mind without telling me.

524
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:21,208
- I'm still here.
- Good.

525
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,347
And you just stay here.

526
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:27,426
And stay alive...

527
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:30,440
As long as it pleases me.

528
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:42,064
You'll have to assist me with this.

529
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,232
I've done it before.

530
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:48,202
You ready to watch
me cut into your daughter?

531
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:53,374
I'm ready for you to
turn my daughter back into a human being.

532
00:48:57,712 --> 00:48:59,749
She'll do all right, don't you think?

533
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:03,002
Get up! Move!

534
00:49:14,602 --> 00:49:18,596
You should be thrilled. She approves of your body
and so do I.

535
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,644
Don't worry, it'll get
put to good use.

536
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:25,731
- Fuck you!
- It's too late. You already have!

537
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,669
You'll rot in hell for this,
you pig bastard!

538
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,839
Why do they always scream threats
when they're about to die?

539
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,055
As if getting me angry is gonna make
it any nicer for them!

540
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,189
Women!

541
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:02,384
Come on, Peewee, let's go!

542
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:20,028
Come on, lover boy.

543
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:55,560
Did you really think that you were gonna
mate with Alliana?

544
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,646
All that's gonna be
left of you is a bag of guts.

545
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:12,109
Don't worry, I'll clean you up. I'll
come back and you won't feel a thing.

546
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:24,461
Who is the treatment for? As if I
didn't already know.

547
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,767
Dr. Pak insists.

548
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,930
I agree. Gorgana does need a lot
more work than I do.

549
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:37,184
When the procedure's complete,
you won't be the masterpiece anymore, will you?

550
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,474
But I'll
always be the hunter/killer.

551
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:49,646
You don't know how many
people have been here before you.

552
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:54,939
All the beautiful people
who scream out in pain...

553
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,959
... as I take their beauty away.

554
00:51:59,122 --> 00:52:02,274
Just so you know how we feel...
How we deal with the fact...

555
00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:05,333
...that women like Alliana...

556
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,618
...would never really want a guy like me.

557
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:15,703
Somehow, gutting you like a fish
just isn't gonna make up for that.

558
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,943
I was there when she was created
from a leopard...

559
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,149
...to what she is today

560
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,109
And you can't have her.

561
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:30,980
You're mine... only mine.

562
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,083
I'm ready for the patient.

563
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,044
Get the girl.

564
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:36,550
- Do you know what they were gonna do to me?
- They still might--hurry up and run!

565
00:55:19,423 --> 00:55:23,303
Come, my dear. This is what
you've been praying for.

566
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,846
Oh, great. This is perfect.

567
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:35,803
You can run around these corridors for the next three days
and still not find your way out.

568
00:55:36,104 --> 00:55:38,938
I can help you, but
you've got to let me go with you.

569
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:40,310
Uh-uh. No chance.

570
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:45,345
All right. Then I'll just sit here and watch
the manimals devour you two for breakfast.

571
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:49,488
How? How do we get out of here?

572
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:55,899
Gorgana, protect yourself!

573
00:56:02,002 --> 00:56:04,073
Don't worry you sick twist,
we just wanna get the hell out of here!

574
00:56:04,296 --> 00:56:05,252
Come on!

575
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:25,061
Grab anything you can get
that'll serve as a weapon.

576
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:28,177
- I thought you knew the easy way out.
- There is so easy way, my dear.

577
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,158
You're not going anywhere.

578
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:33,474
You're the only one
that can operate.

579
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:35,521
And that's what you're going to do.

580
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:39,567
Pak, I wouldn't run out on you.

581
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:42,743
Take another step and I'll kill you.

582
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:44,825
Then who will operate on Gorgana?

583
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:49,026
I'm giving you a choice. Get back
to that table and you'll live.

584
00:57:01,554 --> 00:57:03,591
This is no time to be shot. Come!

585
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:05,635
This way!

586
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,810
Jesus, you want me to go down there again?
- Quiet!

587
00:57:11,938 --> 00:57:13,975
The only way out for us is
past the old laboratory.

588
00:57:16,109 --> 00:57:19,147
If this is a trick and you try to put us back in that cage,
I'll tear you apart.

589
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,956
My friend!

590
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:38,997
She killed him!

591
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:44,335
I know.

592
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,483
- What the hell is this?
- Caution, Pak!

593
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:17,486
That human junk heap there thinks I
killed Gallagher.

594
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,809
- You did, didn't you?
- No.

595
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:21,827
Moreau did.

596
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,874
He made me this way.

597
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:27,882
I understand.

598
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:32,055
Then make him understand.

599
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,335
Doctor... I don't want you hurt.

600
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,508
I'm not hurting. See?

601
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:40,551
It's all right.

602
00:58:51,985 --> 00:58:55,979
If God is smiling, Moreau's dead already.
That doesn't give me much satisfaction.

603
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,115
- At least it's a start.
- Even that's not enough.

604
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:02,521
You're the huntress - hunt them.

605
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:04,523
I hunt, you'll kill?

606
00:59:05,622 --> 00:59:07,614
No. His dream will do the killing.

607
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,744
You want the girl? Break her
neck. Then you can play all you want.

608
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:18,043
- I'll play.
They're in the north tunnels. Go! Go!

609
00:59:25,472 --> 00:59:27,509
This leads directly to the outside.

610
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:40,017
You do know the way out of here,
don't you?

611
00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:43,145
Don't worry, my dear. I've been
planning this escape for some time.

612
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,150
Where's the main road, huh?

613
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:47,315
They'll be expecting us on the main driveway.

614
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,328
Take this path down to the old foundation
and wait for me there.

615
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,578
- I'll circle back so that they don't follow
- Great, then what?

616
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:02,798
Then I'll join you there after I've given them the
slip. I'll guide you to the outside.

617
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:05,960
Go! Go!

618
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,177
- Shit!
- Oh, my God...

619
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,569
My friend dead!

620
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:27,851
My family dead.
And it's all your fault.

621
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:49,832
Look out!

622
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:01,178
I told you
you were gonna die tonight.

623
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:03,389
Why didn't you believe me?

624
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,601
I believe you, old friend

625
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:11,692
You have never lied to me before.

626
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:12,810
You did.

627
01:01:13,776 --> 01:01:16,769
You told me you would make my daughter
a whole human being again.

628
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:18,979
She's lying in that slaughterhouse dead.

629
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:22,031
I did the very best I could,
you know that.

630
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:24,275
You were part of these
experiments, too.

631
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:29,294
You know what that is.

632
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:34,379
The bloodworm extract. One of our
first attempts, remember?

633
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:36,831
It was a failure.

634
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:40,676
No. We made a mutated freak.

635
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,885
A fleshbag that couldn't stop screaming
because of the pain.

636
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:48,209
You have a choice.

637
01:01:49,265 --> 01:01:53,259
Jam that needle in your arm. You'll
pass out almost immediately, I'm sure...

638
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:58,525
...or you wait for her. She'll
tear you to pieces.

639
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:04,694
I'm giving you a choice which is more
than you gave any of your experiments.

640
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:06,065
Or my daughter.

641
01:02:07,031 --> 01:02:09,102
Make your choice, Moreau!

642
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,989
You're very lucky. Alliana would have
torn you limb from limb.

643
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:00,105
I spared you that.

644
01:03:01,204 --> 01:03:03,161
You're really lucky, indeed.

645
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:08,333
You know I
worked with Moreau.

646
01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:12,503
But he never considered me the
surgeon he was.

647
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:17,595
It wasn't enough just to be cutting
and sewing glands,

648
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,841
The blood and secretions needed to be changed...

649
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:25,090
...in order for the transformations to take place.

650
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:37,729
I gave him my daughter as a baby...

651
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:41,850
...to experiment with.

652
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:50,036
Even you can only take
so much punishment.

653
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:55,162
If you weren't a fighter, you wouldn't have survived.

654
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:58,615
This is the second time you saved me.

655
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:00,708
Why?

656
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,873
I can't help it.
You're my mate.

657
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:11,968
If you want to live,
you stay here with me.

658
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,093
- What about Judith?
- What about her?

659
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,391
If she can be saved,
then I'll stay.

660
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,696
She's not going to die for nothing.

661
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,115
You'll barely feel this.

662
01:04:49,757 --> 01:04:53,751
- Why? Because you followed me here?
- Yeah.

663
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,842
But I wanted to find out what
happened to my brother.

664
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:00,127
I thought you looked familiar.

665
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:03,221
That got through you.

666
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:08,264
Just let it take its course, it'll help your organs
with the transformation.

667
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:10,398
Just let it work!

668
01:05:19,825 --> 01:05:20,861
Hey, Pak!

669
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:35,250
I know you can understand me.
Now you stay away from her!

670
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:37,702
I don't want to hurt you.

671
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:42,831
Let's go!

672
01:05:44,847 --> 01:05:45,883
Come on, go!

673
01:05:46,974 --> 01:05:50,046
Sorry, baby.
This wasn't gonna work out.

674
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,429
Die, you bitch, die!

675
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,892
Better take it easy...

676
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:30,185
- That bankroll ain't too fat.
- Think my fightin' days are over?

677
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:33,311
Do me again.

678
01:07:33,443 --> 01:07:35,321
Whatever you say, champ.

679
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:42,532
That stuff'll rot your insides.

680
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,908
Goddamit, ain't she somethin'!

681
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,150
Christ on a crutch...
