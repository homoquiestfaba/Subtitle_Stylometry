1
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,379
All trains
departing lower levels.

2
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,550
The collective runs
by everybody doing their part.

3
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:02,020
Report suspicious activity
to health and safety.

4
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,056
Health and safety
is here to help.

5
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:07,292
Just look for
the black and white vests.

6
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,763
After you.

7
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,931
Thank you.

8
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,743
This train serves the
north-east work sectors.

9
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,018
This is a message from
the collective.

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,356
-Are you overly tired?
Or experiencing
increased sensitivity?

11
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,092
-Maybe you have
difficulty concentrating.

12
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,595
-You may have s.O.S.
Switched on syndrome.

13
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,469
...a further 43 degrees
along this orbit

14
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:54,072
that the holst probe will begin
the 110 minute descent

15
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,874
into tk-14's atmosphere...

16
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:30,442
...bombs dropped for the span
of 28 days and obliterated 99.6%

17
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,579
of usable arid land
on the earth's surface.

18
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,048
And event that changed the
course of human kind forever,

19
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,217
and now known as the great war.

20
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,421
...of the two tracts of land
that survived the great war.

21
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,824
The peninsula
still stands 44 degrees
west of the collective.

22
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:51,163
And is a wild primitive area,
containing empty,
dilapidated buildings...

23
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,302
...and little is known
of the primitive nature
of the peninsula's inhabitants.

24
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,006
The defects living there
are ruled by emotion
and base desires.

25
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,808
An ancient vestige of our past.

26
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,846
This image shows equis 12
leaving earth's orbit on last
week's interstellar mission.

27
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,381
Who wrote the text
for this feature?

28
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,251
Me, I did.

29
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,287
Does this accurate, Nia?

30
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,021
Yes.

31
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,691
Except, the rocket's fission
thrusters are cylindrical...

32
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,393
...these appear triangular.

33
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,195
Thank you. I'll change that.

34
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,919
Iris is back
from conception duty.

35
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,091
She got back yesterday.

36
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,594
She had a defect.

37
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,396
How do you know?

38
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,131
She told me.

39
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,233
Did she have the bug?

40
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,468
No.
She says she's clean.

41
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,906
Where is everyone watching
the landing tomorrow night?

42
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,042
I'm watching it in bishop park.

43
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,277
I'm going to leave work early
to get a good seat.

44
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,913
If I arrive early enough
i can get a seat
close to the screen.

45
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,037
David!

46
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,707
David!

47
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,810
David!

48
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,845
David!

49
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,451
You're in safe hands now folks.
Please continue on your way.

50
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,651
Total number puzzles solved:
2224.

51
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,833
The following is an update
on last night's disturbance

52
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,568
in living block 5-j.

53
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,339
Health and safety officials
subdued two individuals
engaged in coupling activities.

54
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:26,311
And both have been transported
to the defective, emotional,
neuropathy facility, the den,

55
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,781
for containment and emotional
suppression treatment.

56
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,851
The incident is an outbreak
of defective behavior.

57
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,855
Remember, couplers are a danger
to themselves and to all of us.

58
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:41,059
Physical contact, touching,
or displays of emotion are signs

59
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,562
of an individual
infected with s.O.S.

60
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:48,066
If you see the signs,
report the couplers to
health and safety immediately.

61
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,803
Let's do our part to contain
this dangerous epidemic.

62
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:01,379
...with no infrastructure
the collective erected
a patrolled border

63
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,449
to contain
any resurgence of chaos...

64
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,922
Did anybody see that?

65
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,057
See what?

66
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,274
That's unfortunate.

67
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,609
He's already dead.

68
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,910
Anyone recognize him?

69
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,678
-Not sure.
-Don't think so.

70
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,615
That's our first jumper
in a while.

71
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,850
His head was no match
for that concrete.

72
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,420
-I just remembered
there was a suicide
in my building last night,

73
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,955
a woman slit her throat.

74
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,891
I hope they find someone
to cover his work.

75
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,251
Even before the demise,

76
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,922
humankind knew
the importance
of space exploration.

77
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,926
As the collective,
we prioritize it and perfect it.

78
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:27,265
Now, 798 million miles away,
as we brace the surface
of tk-14,

79
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,503
we move one step further
in our understanding
of ultimate reality.

80
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,805
Okay everybody, this is it.

81
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,642
3...2...1...Mark.

82
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,373
Last, but not least.
Speculative non-fiction,

83
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,042
the title is
inside the peninsula.

84
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,844
Silas, will you talk us
through the lead illustration?

85
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,247
Silas?

86
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,084
Sorry, Leonard.

87
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,653
I went with the scene
on the peninsula

88
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,588
where the defects huddle
together for warmth.

89
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,058
In my research I found
that they form social bonds
with each other

90
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,293
to help alleviate
something called anxiety.

91
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,061
Very good.

92
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,163
Thank you.

93
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,642
While scientists are making
great strides in understanding

94
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:03,381
this debilitating condition.
A reliable cure for s.O.S.
Has yet to be found.

95
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,519
And most s.O.S. Sufferers
will experience complete
emotional disability.

96
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,821
In as little as four
to six months.

97
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,323
Prior to eventual containment
at the den,

98
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:16,060
kappa rho inhibitors
offer a reliable means
of dampening symptoms,

99
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,630
and slowing the stages
of the disease.

100
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,398
Thus allowing sufferers
to maintain...

101
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,566
What stage?

102
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,002
Excuse me?

103
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,470
What stage are you?

104
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,474
Oh, I'm just here
for a check up.
Strictly precautionary.

105
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,645
I'm Jonas.

106
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,548
Silas.

107
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,418
What stage are you?

108
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,720
Two.

109
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,557
You look healthy.

110
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,661
Well, I have my good days
and bad days.

111
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,699
Silas?

112
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,733
Good luck.

113
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,869
Thank you.

114
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,539
-The ground was
rushing toward me.

115
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,274
I couldn't breath.

116
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,212
I felt like my stomach was...

117
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,083
...in my mouth.
It was extremely unpleasant.

118
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,651
You had a nightmare, Silas.

119
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,356
I never want to experience
anything like it again.

120
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,859
How long have you
had these symptoms?

121
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,896
Maybe three days?
No longer than that.

122
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,197
I'm going to
take some blood now.

123
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,001
Can you give me your hand
please, Silas?

124
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,813
Your test is positive, Silas.

125
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,648
You're only stage one.

126
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,721
A woman in my office
recently gave birth
to a defect, I...

127
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,791
I couldn't have
caught it from her.
Not if she's clean, right?

128
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:57,795
Even if this woman
did have s.O.S.
It isn't contagious.

129
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,498
-I'd like to start you
on a full course
of inhibitors immediately.

130
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,401
There's no reason
why you shouldn't be able
to live a normal life.

131
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,202
At least for a while.

132
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,105
Then the den.

133
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,873
-You mustn't think about that
for now.

134
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,642
-The den is a long way off
for you.

135
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,243
A cure is
right around the corner.

136
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,475
Where were you, Silas?

137
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,979
I went to the cafeteria
to drink some tea.

138
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,049
Is that where you
got the bruise?

139
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,984
No...

140
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,321
Last night in tai chi class,
the man next to me
accidentally struck me.

141
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,191
Silas, you weren't
in tai chi class last night.

142
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,492
Yes he was.

143
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,661
I saw him.

144
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,751
What's that?

145
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,222
It's a Bumblebee.

146
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,491
Careful.

147
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,592
Don't they sting?

148
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,971
According to
the laws of aerodynamics
they shouldn't even fly.

149
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,709
But they don't know it.

150
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,511
So they fly anyway.

151
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,595
Be a part of the solution
by taking your inhibitors.

152
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,497
Your health is the health
of the collective.

153
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,265
Picking up.

154
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,573
If you're watching this film...

155
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,509
...your doctor has diagnosed you
with s.O.S.

156
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,311
Switched on syndrome.

157
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:04,816
As members of the collective,
we hear a lot
about switched on syndrome.

158
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,420
Here is important information
about how this debilitating
disease will affect you.

159
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,623
And how you can
manage it responsibly
before eventual containment

160
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,928
at the defective emotional
neuropathy facility, the den.

161
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,132
Switched on syndrome
is a malfunction
of the gene silencing

162
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:25,036
that controls human emotions
and eliminates human flaws.

163
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,540
But in switched on syndrome,
problem genes lose their
silencing and re-awaken.

164
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:34,879
Leading to unpredictable
sensory experiences
and behavioral defects.

165
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,414
Until a cure is available.

166
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,218
Inhibitors are the only
effective means of slowing
the disease's staging,

167
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,253
while dampening
the onset of emotion.

168
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,356
And while the causes
are unknown,

169
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,825
we do understand
the disease's progression.

170
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:49,360
During stage one,

171
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:55,666
intermittent feeling,
you will experience
difficulty concentrating,

172
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,935
depression, pain,

173
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,904
overwhelmed feelings,

174
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,905
impulsivity

175
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,940
and sensitivity to light.

176
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,044
As the disease progresses
into further stages,

177
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,348
consistent low level emotion
and emotional volatility,

178
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,682
these symptoms will worsen.

179
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,553
In stage four,
acute behavioral chaos,

180
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,823
you will no longer function
as a productive member
of the collective.

181
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,359
And your doctor
will prescribe containment
at the den.

182
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,061
Where you will be provided
with electro restraint,

183
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,563
emotional suppression,

184
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,465
and a pain-free death scenario.

185
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,535
If you have questions
about your condition,

186
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:34,438
notify your doctor
or health and safety official
for immediate attention.

187
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,542
And remember, a cure
is right around the corner.

188
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,212
Hello Silas.

189
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,047
Hello Nia.

190
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,371
Nia,

191
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,677
I read your article
on the Harlow nine probe.

192
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,846
I was wondering if you' could
look over my impressions.

193
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,348
But you're
speculative non-fiction.

194
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,684
I switched with Leonard.

195
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,621
Why?

196
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,491
I felt like a change.

197
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,797
There's a staff meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

198
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,765
Why don't I review
your work then?

199
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,370
I'd really appreciate your input
at this early stage.
If it's not too much trouble.

200
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,838
This isn't what I described.

201
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,641
Isn't it?
-Harlow nine is a lander
not an orbiter.

202
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,945
Where's its robotic arm?

203
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,246
Are those for a feature?

204
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,715
-Yes.

205
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,484
I thought you were
speculative non-fiction.

206
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,818
I switched with Leonard.

207
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,188
One more thing.

208
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,190
The eleos landing
was made on a flat surface.

209
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,259
The way you've drawn it,
it looks almost mountainous.

210
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,694
Is there anything else
i can help you with, Silas?

211
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:20,765
Thank you for your feedback.

212
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,137
You're welcome.

213
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,163
It's this vastness,

214
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,166
inaccessibility, symmetry,

215
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,837
and the permanence
of the night sky

216
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,406
that made it a natural topic
for philosophers pursuing

217
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,974
the understanding
of ultimate reality.

218
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,443
It's this vastness,

219
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,147
inaccessibility, symmetry...

220
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,917
...and permanence
of the night sky

221
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,253
that made it a natural topic
for philosophers...

222
00:24:56,595 --> 00:25:00,698
At atmos our past is not a relic
we should leave behind.

223
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,166
But a living creation,

224
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,767
something to be handled.

225
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,437
The work we do at atmos is that
which links our present.

226
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,841
I'm so sorry.

227
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,547
You dropped these.

228
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,651
Thank you.

229
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,029
It's about time you all knew.
Last week I...

230
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,199
Tested positive for s.O.S.

231
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,237
I'm stage one.
I'm taking inhibitors.

232
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,141
-There is no evidence
that the bug is contagious.

233
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,643
However, if it makes you
feel more comfortable,

234
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,144
I'll wear a face mask
from now on.

235
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,280
Silas, I'm very sorry.

236
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:50,648
How long do you have?

237
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,585
It's difficult to say.

238
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,621
Is this why you stopped
doing speculative non-fiction?

239
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,856
I don't know, Rachel.

240
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,826
Possibly.

241
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,995
-I think a face mask
is a little extreme.

242
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,730
Although I don't think
he should sit with us anymore.

243
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,399
And you should have
your own mug.

244
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,203
Do you all agree?

245
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,976
We cured cancer.
We cured the common cold.

246
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:22,713
We can cure s.O.S.
You're going to live, pal.

247
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,750
Thank you all.

248
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,931
This has to stop.

249
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,236
If it continues I'll be forced
to report you.

250
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,171
Do you understand?

251
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,613
You have the bug. Don't you?

252
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,416
I'm clean.

253
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,490
The day that man
jumped of the building...

254
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,993
...you saw his body
out the window, you...

255
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,498
...you looked...

256
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,300
Affected.

257
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,870
-There have been
other times, too.

258
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,406
I've been watching you.

259
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,441
The way you look at the world,
the way you experience things.

260
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:58,609
I'm clean.

261
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,846
It's different.

262
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,817
What you are going through
must be very difficult.

263
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,655
If you were clean,
this conversation wouldn't even
be taking place.

264
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:12,523
You'd have reported me already.

265
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,858
Am I right?

266
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,630
Goodnight, Silas.

267
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,474
Good morning, Silas.

268
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,709
Good morning, Nia.

269
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,903
And finally, the Harlow landing.

270
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,008
Nia, do you have
any more notes for me?

271
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,077
No. Your changes work well.
Thank you.

272
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,279
Onto the next article then. Zoe?

273
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,217
These are my impressions
of the hot flow anomaly

274
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,119
on the planet bl4.
The visible bioshock--

275
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,889
goodnight, Nia.

276
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,290
Goodnight, Rachel.

277
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,496
Your bruise went away.

278
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,532
You noticed that?

279
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,338
I've had the bug
a year and three months.

280
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,542
I didn't want
to go to the doctor.
I just sort of knew.

281
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,544
You know there is
really nothing any...

282
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,146
...anyone could do to help.

283
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,951
And I'm scared
of the meds and then...

284
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,326
Doesn't seem fair at first.

285
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,962
Right?

286
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,102
You know I could live-
i could live with it.

287
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,405
But every day was different
and that was the hardest part.

288
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:04,041
Every single time
i thought I knew something
or learned anything I...

289
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,314
...didn't.

290
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,020
And I felt this guilt every time
i wanted to go back to normal.

291
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,022
Like I shouldn't want that.

292
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,761
Every day I am practicing
unbearable discipline
and self-control.

293
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,200
You realize what would happen
if anyone saw us,
in here, right now?

294
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,973
We'd go straight to the den.
It's a death sentence.

295
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,945
One of my neighbors missed
two doctor's appointments.

296
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,414
I haven't seen him in six weeks.

297
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,287
We can't do this again.

298
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,259
It can't happen, you know that.

299
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:06,970
-We just...

300
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,274
We just have to hold out
for the cure.

301
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,619
Will you stay in here with me
a little longer?

302
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,628
-Are you ok?
-Yeah.

303
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,230
I need to go.

304
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,283
Nia, are you staying late
again tonight?

305
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:27,384
I'm not sure.

306
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,519
I wish I had
your kind of work ethic.

307
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,490
I received a message from Zoe.

308
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:37,227
On her way to work
this morning she received
a conception duty summons.

309
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,729
Could one of the illustrators
present for her
in the staff meeting?

310
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,731
I'll do it.
I'll be glad to.

311
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,245
-Good night, Nia.
-Good night, Kate.

312
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,119
They may simply be labeled
as dualist.

313
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,125
Two subject concepts
and materialist
one subject concepts.

314
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,245
The way you've been
looking at me...

315
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,815
I can't help it.

316
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,051
I can feel it.

317
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,657
What does it feel like?

318
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,563
It feels wrong.

319
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,803
No, no. No.

320
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,073
It's not wrong.
It's completely right.
This feels...

321
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,877
...completely right.

322
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,976
I'm scared.

323
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,178
Im so scared.

324
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,147
Me too.

325
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,345
Hello, Leonard.

326
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:17,881
Silas.

327
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,018
I didn't expect
to see you here this late.

328
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,058
Have you thought
about killing yourself?

329
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,262
No,
that's not until stage three.

330
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,904
Why is Nia's interface on?

331
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,742
Have you been
snooping again, Silas?

332
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,212
Excuse me?

333
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:53,383
A month ago,
health and safety saw you
on Nia's interface after-hours.

334
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:54,951
I was told
to keep an eye on you.

335
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,087
Is there something
you want to tell me?

336
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,226
As the manager here at atmos,

337
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:07,363
one of my duties
is to maintain the safety
and welfare of the team.

338
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:11,901
Therefore, if I believe
that someone on the team
is in danger,

339
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,571
or involved in an activity
that is unsafe,

340
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,474
I'd report him, or her,

341
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:18,541
to health and safety.

342
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,979
Unless, of course,
the activity were to stop.

343
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,116
Does that make sense to you?

344
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,354
Yes.

345
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,356
Good.

346
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,593
Shall we get out of here, Silas?

347
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,538
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight, Nia.

348
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,650
He knows.

349
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,956
What are we going to do?

350
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,064
We have to stay away
from each other.

351
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,435
I can't...

352
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,504
...stay away from you.
I can't...

353
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:29,238
...not be around you.

354
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,376
Not in that office.
Not when I see you everyday.
It's impossible.

355
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,186
I thought about it.
The best thing is for me
to leave atmos.

356
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,787
Get a job somewhere else.

357
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,068
It's like you said...

358
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:00,436
...we have to hold on
for the cure.

359
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,805
That's all we should
be thinking about.

360
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,120
Nia...

361
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,945
Have you received
a conception duty summons?

362
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:17,847
Let's work together
to populate the collective.

363
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,284
Insemination is quick
and solitary,

364
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:25,421
and during gestation
you'll be supporting
and growing the collective.

365
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,657
If you received a summons
please...

366
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,598
Are you sure
this is what you want?

367
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,700
I'm sure.

368
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,571
-Positions at atmos
are highly coveted.

369
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,443
Because of my diagnosis,
i think a work environment

370
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,245
where I interact less with
others would be better.

371
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:51,714
For everyones benefit.

372
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,885
That's a very
responsible attitude.

373
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:07,497
Oh Nia...

374
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:09,232
...meet Dominic,
our new illustrator.

375
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,634
Dominic, this is Nia,
she works in text.

376
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,736
You'll be
interpreting her words.

377
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,538
It's very nice to meet you, Nia.

378
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,973
Welcome to atmos.

379
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,475
Follow me.

380
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,438
I also design rockets.

381
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,008
I could have been an engineer,
but I lacked Patience.

382
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,612
I think working at atmos
is a vitally important job.

383
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,716
-Science is a process
and often leads to dead-ends.

384
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,152
But here,

385
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,354
we're delivering the answers,

386
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,990
we're educating people.

387
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,893
Knowledge is sacred,
and atmos is the new scripture.

388
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,063
If you think about it,
we're kind of like preachers.

389
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,699
Where did you study?

390
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:49,699
I'm self-taught.

391
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,069
I've always drawn pictures
ever since I was a child.

392
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,505
One of my guardians, barnabas,
nicknamed me little Da Vinci.

393
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,876
Did you hear?

394
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:00,877
Zoe was inseminated.

395
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,678
It means she's clean.

396
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,247
She didn't catch the bug
from Silas.

397
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,249
That means we're probably clean,
too.

398
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:09,218
- I'm definitely clean.
I donated blood last week.

399
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:56,532
Silas?

400
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,270
Jonas?

401
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,379
You ok?

402
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,348
Ok.

403
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,217
Do you want to take a walk?

404
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:22,825
I miss her.

405
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:29,966
I don't know, it felt so good
to be around her that...

406
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,303
...we were nearly tripping up
and I couldn't see...

407
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,640
...couldn't see anything bad
happening to her.

408
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,443
You two were in love
with each other.

409
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,611
That's very clear

410
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,847
you were right to end it though.

411
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,783
I think dealing
with this disease on your own
is hard enough,

412
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,151
coupling would just
make it unbearable.

413
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
You know...

414
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,662
...about a year ago.

415
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,399
I also made a connection
with a woman.

416
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,472
Though, it didn't end well.

417
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,146
So sorry.

418
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,553
Your friend...What stage is she?

419
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,759
She's self-diagnosed.
She's fighting the bug
without drugs.

420
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:30,559
She's a "hider."

421
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,800
Not many people
can do that successfully.

422
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:38,701
I think hiders are...

423
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,004
I think they are
wired differently.

424
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,340
You know we have one
in our group.
Bess. She's a...

425
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,676
...she's a doctor at the den,
of all places.

426
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,046
Listen...

427
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,181
I'm part of a group.
A support group.

428
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,683
With Bess and others
from my work.

429
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,519
To talk openly
about how we feel.

430
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,688
If you're interested
I'll vouch for you.

431
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:01,857
It might help.

432
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,262
I'd be willing to try.

433
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,032
Great.

434
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,739
Nia, it's me again.

435
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,707
Until you give me some
text to work with I am idle,

436
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,143
and that doesn't seem
like a very good use of my time.

437
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,514
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

438
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,883
All the other illustrators
received their pieces
hours ago...

439
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,218
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

440
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,392
But I appreciate your Patience.

441
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,195
Of course.

442
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,820
Silas, you made it.

443
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,589
Oh, this is great.
I'm glad you're here.

444
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,792
Everybody, this is Silas.
The one I was telling you about.

445
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:46,862
Silas, this is Bess.
Peter and Thomas.

446
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,697
Gilead. Max. And Alice.

447
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:49,899
Come take a seat.

448
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:55,804
...and then after lunch
he kept staring at me,

449
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,940
like he could tell
i wasn't taking my meds.

450
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,709
And I wanted
to say something to him.

451
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,346
But then I thought,
what if I'm just imagining it?

452
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,783
So I turned and walked away.

453
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,320
And all I could think
is that he knows.

454
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:14,089
He's going to report me
and I'm going to get caught.

455
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,724
And I can't stop thinking that.

456
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,127
-All the time...
-It's natural.

457
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,129
It's happened
to every one of us.

458
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:23,732
Yes, but all I could think
is that I am going to the den.
I'm going to the den.

459
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:24,800
It's over.

460
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:26,135
And they're...

461
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,974
What happens in the den?

462
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,586
Half the people who are brought
in commit suicide.

463
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:47,523
The staff encourages it
and stand by while it happens.

464
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,525
And that's the preferable option
anyway.

465
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,361
Compared to electro restraints
and all the other methods
of treatment.

466
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,663
But there is value in living.

467
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:01,136
Being a hider
reminds you of that.

468
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:02,504
I still don't know
how you do it.

469
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,008
Working for health and safety
is hard enough.

470
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:13,215
Yes, it's difficult
to see things and not be moved.

471
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,918
But that's what being a hider
is all about.

472
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,954
So you do small things to help.

473
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,423
Just looking someone
in the eyes,

474
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,861
can make them feel
they are not alone.
Give them hope.

475
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,400
But under no circumstances
do you interfere.

476
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:37,506
You have to tell yourself,
do not risk your job,
do not risk your life.

477
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,146
But why stay in a position
where you feel so much risk?

478
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,416
You could ask to be reassigned.

479
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,818
I'd rather be with people
who feel.

480
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,088
Who feel intensely.

481
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:58,861
It reminds me
of who I am and why
i choose to keep on living.

482
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:01,930
Everybody says
it's not contagious.

483
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,534
But after all these years
as awful as it is,

484
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,804
everyday I feel a stronger...

485
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,341
...affinity with other people.

486
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,745
See I don't believe
all the research.

487
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,415
Feelings engender feelings.

488
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,919
S.O.S. Is not even a disease,
that's what they say but...

489
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:28,023
...switched off
is something they do to us
between conception and birth.

490
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,059
S.O.S. Is who
we really are and...

491
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:33,562
...the inhibitors are just
another attempt to squash that.

492
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,998
-I don't know.
-It's so hard.

493
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,367
It's lonely.

494
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,538
At least with the inhibitors
i can get by but now,

495
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,941
I would rather feel nothing.

496
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,811
Nothing is better than this.

497
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,746
It's okay. It's okay.

498
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,170
I could never have imagined
what love felt like.
It's strange...

499
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,174
Like a little tornado
going around and...

500
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,509
Yeah.

501
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,915
That's why I was
so scared of it at first.

502
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,390
It's about giving,
i want you to take everything,

503
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:26,128
I don't even know
what it is I just want you
to take it from me.

504
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,396
I just want to...

505
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,298
I want to run.

506
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,469
I want to run... both of us...

507
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,073
...as fast as we can,
outside, just take off.

508
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,545
It's so weird, I'm like...

509
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:46,715
I keep on thinking about...

510
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,420
Ever since we were kids
it's been drilled into us that..

511
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,656
Our purpose is to explore
the universe, you know.

512
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:56,558
Outer space
is where we'll find...

513
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,596
...the answers
to why we're here and...

514
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,699
...and where we come from.

515
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:05,901
It's like everyone's...

516
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:12,441
...searching for these answers
800 million miles away
and the truth is...

517
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,209
...the answers
are right in front of us.

518
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,613
I know why I'm here.

519
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,916
Me too.

520
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:24,820
What are we going to do now?

521
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:30,926
We just spend as much time
here together as we can.

522
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,762
Go to work, act normal,
but then...

523
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,932
...at night...

524
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,469
...we're together.

525
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,372
Okay.

526
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,863
What did you look like
when you were little?

527
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,968
Have you always
had these freckles?

528
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,471
I don't know.

529
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,141
I think so.

530
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,277
Did you grow early?

531
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,679
Did I grow early?

532
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,181
Yeah, I was tall until I wasn't.

533
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,620
I was a little round kid...

534
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,696
What was your favorite subject?

535
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,365
I liked history.

536
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:44,466
How about you?

537
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,436
I always really loved to write.

538
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:48,670
What did you write
when you were a kid?

539
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:51,039
I always liked to write poetry.

540
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,578
I liked the school trips
as well.

541
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,948
When we got to go...

542
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,316
To the great war museum,

543
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,887
to see how the bombs dropped
and wiped out
the cities and stuff.

544
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,992
I see a future
outside of this room.

545
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:15,130
Some place out there
in the vastness
of everything we know.

546
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:17,165
In all those millions of miles.

547
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,101
Dominic fyi.

548
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,769
The article is finished.

549
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,573
You gave it to me already.
I'm working on it right now.

550
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,174
No, the one after this.

551
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,343
On the extraction of superfluids
from neutron stars.

552
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:31,012
No pressure.

553
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,751
I wish I could explain this
to everyone else.

554
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,954
I'm sick of being...

555
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,789
...scared of getting caught.

556
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:45,761
I want people to know
and not think we're sick.

557
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,562
The significant breakthrough

558
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:23,832
came with the isolation
of the bulbar cell line,

559
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,868
allowing effective
genetic re-silencing,

560
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,871
without triggering
the systematic organ malfunction

561
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:32,574
that had marked
earlier attempts.

562
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:36,044
To be clear, this is not
another kappa rho inhibitor.

563
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:40,515
It's a cure that restores
the health and systematic order
to the individual.

564
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,417
With the ashby eni cure...

565
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:46,454
...it is only a matter of time
before all current
s.O.S. Cases are treated,

566
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,256
and future cases prevented.

567
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,092
The eni cure is injected
directly into the neck,

568
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,728
leaving a small coin-like scar,

569
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,630
a quick and simple procedure.

570
01:03:55,632 --> 01:04:00,268
Once administered,
the drug requires
a six hour absorption period,

571
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,004
before the disease
is completely neutralized.

572
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,640
After which point,
regardless of stage,

573
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:08,510
the patient is restored
to normal health.

574
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,112
Mass production of the drug
is already underway.

575
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:15,150
And shipments are being
made available to public clinics
immediately.

576
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:19,120
Individuals diagnosed
with s.O.S. Need not
suffer another day.

577
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:23,358
Contact your doctor immediately
to receive the ashby eni cure...

578
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,027
...and rejoin
the ranks of equals...

579
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,254
We're gonna
remember this feeling.

580
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,661
We're gonna live
every day remembering
and we're not gonna feel it.

581
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,471
We're not even
gonna exist anymore.

582
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,587
It's not over.

583
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,524
We're not doing that.

584
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,899
-So you don't want the cure.
-No.

585
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,302
Do you?

586
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:42,304
No.

587
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,558
This is Nia.

588
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,229
We want to go to the peninsula.

589
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,836
At my old post,
i took part in an air patrol.

590
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,074
We wouldn't fly directly
over the peninsula, but...

591
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:22,711
...i could see it
from a distance.
It's totally overgrown.

592
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:27,282
If anyone actually lives there
it's in a completely
primitive state.

593
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:31,152
-How do we get there?
-You're seriously
considering this?

594
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,554
We've already decided.

595
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,656
You know you'll be
on your own out there.

596
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,891
There will be no one
to look after you.

597
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,161
Whatever we go through
it will be together.

598
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:44,032
I know how you're feeling,
but you're not thinking
of all the risks.

599
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:46,968
If we stay here
we'll be found out.
We'll get the cure.

600
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:58,013
You know, it's many years ago,
i was not much older than you
when I got the bug,

601
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:03,151
no one even knew
what s.O.S. Was back then.

602
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:03,151
People were getting it,

603
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,721
and most of them
would commit suicide.

604
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,992
There was a young man
in my living block,

605
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,063
I could tell he was a hider,
just like me,

606
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,266
but no one dared
mention it back then.

607
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:25,473
One night, he knocked
on my door and told me
that he and two others...

608
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:28,176
...were going to the peninsula
and he wanted me to go with him.

609
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:29,778
Of course, there was no way
i was going.

610
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,382
I knew they were
headed for their deaths.

611
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,683
Bess.

612
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,724
A few months after he left
were the loneliest I ever felt.

613
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,362
We'd only spoken that one time.

614
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,500
More than all the suicides
I've seen.

615
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,071
It was his death
that was the most...

616
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,039
...unnecessarily wasteful.

617
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,874
Such a waste.

618
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,911
That was a new feeling for me.

619
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,614
But you don't know that he died.

620
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,552
What if he didn't?

621
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:28,803
I can talk to my old colleague.
He was the pilot who took us
on the air patrol.

622
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:28,803
If they get caught,

623
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:32,740
the whole plan could be traced
back to you or to the group.

624
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,644
You said interfering
was too risky.

625
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,383
If you make this decision
you know there is
no turning back.

626
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:47,755
If you do manage to get out.
You can never return.

627
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:51,659
Of course.

628
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,676
When you get to the border
ask for Oliver, he will fly you.

629
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:12,847
What if he gets caught?

630
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:14,649
He won't.

631
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:18,520
Good luck.

632
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,359
Thank you.

633
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,404
Welling is the closest station
to the border.

634
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:39,140
Trains don't go there
until the weekend.
I checked the schedule.

635
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:39,974
We could leave on Saturday.

636
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,279
Three days.

637
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,519
-You're shaking.
-So are you.

638
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:56,925
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

639
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,260
Are you?

640
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,238
I got a conception summons.

641
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:46,941
We're leaving in two days.

642
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:50,011
By the time they come
looking for you we'll be gone.

643
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:50,011
Ignore it.

644
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:53,248
My tag is blocked, I won't
be able to get on the train.

645
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,515
I won't make it through
any of the check points.

646
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,784
It's just a summons, right?

647
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,856
It's not like they're going
to inseminate you...

648
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,925
They'll check my blood.
They'll see I have
the disease instantly.

649
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:08,162
Yeah but they can't force you
to get the cure.

650
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,398
I've been diagnosed,
no one's forcing me
to get it are they?

651
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,966
Besides, the clinics
are overwhelmed right now.

652
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,869
All that's going to happen is,

653
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,838
they'll tell you you've
tested positive for s.O.S.,

654
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,940
and that you should
see your doctor immediately.
That's it.

655
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,508
Then get out of there.

656
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:23,578
Nothing's changed.

657
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,115
We're leaving Saturday,
10 o'clock train.

658
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:28,182
You've already missed
the whole morning of work.

659
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:29,417
You should get over there
right away.

660
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:30,718
I'll come after my shift.

661
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,920
Meet me behind the clinic.

662
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,188
Okay.

663
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,168
I received a summons.

664
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,556
-Hello Nia.
-Hello doctor.

665
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,991
Lie back for me, please.

666
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,264
-I'm going to take a sample
of your blood, okay?

667
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:17,365
Okay.

668
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,249
I have the bug, don't I?

669
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,219
Nia, you're pregnant.

670
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,419
-What is it?
-She's pregnant.

671
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:27,154
She got called
for conception duty
and they found out they're...

672
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:29,590
-Silas, calm down.
-...Taking her to the den.

673
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:30,625
You need to calm down.

674
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:32,159
I'm calm, I'm calm, it's fine.

675
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:34,462
-When did they take her?
-I don't know about
an hour ago or something.

676
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:36,797
-All right well listen,
i will contact Bess...
-No, no. No.

677
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,299
Not Bess.
She won't help us.
Ask someone else.

678
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:40,868
There is no one else.
Bess is our only hope.

679
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,504
Listen you can't be seen
around here like this.

680
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,306
-I'm fine, but let me
come with you.
-You need to go home...

681
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:45,306
-Let me help her...
-You need to calm down.

682
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:48,309
-Go home and I will contact you,
wait there.
-I can talk to them,

683
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:51,512
-let me go with you.
-Don't attempt to see Nia.

684
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,015
Silas, go home. Trust me.

685
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:57,151
-What are they gonna do to her?
-Just calm down.

686
01:15:57,153 --> 01:16:00,054
You need to stay calm,
or they'll give you the cure.

687
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,624
Give me a couple hours.
Go home and wait there.

688
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,427
Shh! Shh!

689
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,989
-Jonas?
-Get dressed as fast as you can.

690
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:17,324
And listen to me carefully,

691
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:22,296
last week, a woman
was brought in called Eva.
She was stage three.

692
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:25,366
Last night she knotted
a garbage bag over her head,

693
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:26,967
suffocated, she's dead.

694
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,103
Now you...

695
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:31,138
Are going to switch places
with her.

696
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,308
Eva didn't kill herself
last night, you did.

697
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,777
You are Eva, she was you.

698
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:38,145
You're gonna walk out of here.

699
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,716
Hold out your arm.
Your left arm please.

700
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,518
Okay.

701
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,456
All right.
Shh.

702
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,791
You are Eva.

703
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,195
Got it?

704
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,696
Ready?

705
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:12,379
I told Silas to wait
at his apartment.
You'll find him there.

706
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,778
The following message
is an update

707

708
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:29,817

who alerted authorities
to three individuals operating
against protocol at the den.

711
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:41,295
Two of the three were
health and safety officials,

712
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,697
and the third
was a physician at the den.

713
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:47,468
All are currently safe and
receiving the ashby eni cure.

714
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:51,238
So that they may
return to work as a productive
equals in the collective.

715
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,675

will now be required

716
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:55,809

And mandatory s.O.S. Testing

718
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:01,749
for all
health and safety officials

719

as well as
medical professionals.

720
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:05,986
Welcome...

721
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,493
Her name is Nia.

722
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:15,195
Her ID tag is 34729647.

723
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,597
She writes text for atmos.

724
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,867
You said her name was Nia?

725
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:21,201
Yes.

726
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,905
Was she brought here
yesterday evening?

727
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,841
-Lives at 6l 415?
-That's right.

728
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:30,511
She died last night.

729
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:33,914
According to the doctor's notes,

730
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,582
the cause of death
was asphyxiation.

731
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,354
Could you check that again?

732
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:46,794
Yes, that's her.

733
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:58,339
Sir?

734
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:01,475
Are you okay?

735
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:06,180
Do you need some help?

736
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:34,454
Where have you been?

737
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:37,925
Hey.

738
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:46,600
You okay?

739
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,011
Why?

740
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,249
I thought you were gone.

741
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,594
How long do you have?

742
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,630
Maybe five hours.

743
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,109
Silas.

744
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,416
Hey.

745
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,220
Fight it.

746
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:46,226
It doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter. Fight it.

747
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,327
Okay?

748
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:48,962
I'm still pregnant.

749
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,072
We're going to get on
the train tomorrow. Okay?

750
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,346
I love you.

751
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,652
I love you, I love you,
i love you...

752
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,603
You have to fight it.
Just fight it okay?

753
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,272
I can already tell it's in me.

754
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:37,944
Just remember...

755
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:39,646
Okay?

756
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:41,948
How?

757
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:47,854
Remember this feeling.

758
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,859
Just remember
what this feels like.

759
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:55,862
Yeah... yeah, just promise me,

760
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:03,303
no matter what happens
you keep loving me
no matter what I say

761
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:04,571
what I feel or don't feel

762
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,608
I'm still,
I'm still in here trying.
Okay?

763
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:12,112
I'm still in here.
Just don't give up on me.

764
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:14,081
Please, don't give up on me.

765
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:16,383
I promise.
I promise that I won't...

766
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,070
Silas?

767
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,109
Good morning.

768
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,719
Do you still love me?

769
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:34,861
I remember I loved you.

770
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,431
But...

771
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,268
I don't feel it anymore.

772
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:49,743
Do you still want to go?

773
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:53,680
We made a plan.

774
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,290
Right.

775
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:47,400
This is a non-local transport

776
01:31:47,402 --> 01:31:50,737
serving outlying regions
with three stops.

777
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:54,508
The final destination port
will be welling
at the outer peninsula...
