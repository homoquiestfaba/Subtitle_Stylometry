1
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,629
Good morning, America.

2
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,815
It's now twelve noon
in Salamanca, Spain.

3
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,755
In a short time, world leaders from over a
150 countries will meet here at Plaza Major,

4
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:33,455
to sign up to President Ashton's
bold new counter-terrorist strategy.

5
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,279
Since 9/11 more than 4500 people have
been killed in a rising tide of global terror.

6
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,394
Those lives will not soon be forgotten.

7
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:44,895
Today, world comes together to
take a stand against this violence.

8
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:49,196
We may be on a brink of historic agreement
between Western and Arab leaders.

9
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:51,997
Security services are on
high alert here in Salamanca,

10
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:54,250
and we now go live to our
news team on the ground,

11
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,618
and our reporter Angie Jones.
-5, 4, 3, 2...

12
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,902
I am standing inside Plaza Major
in Salamanca, Spain,

13
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,112
where crowds are lined up for a kick-off

14
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,613
of what is, without a question,
a landmark summit.

15
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,756
For months now, President Ashton has been
working with leaders from five continents,

16
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,101
to forge a new ground-breaking alliance
in the ongoing war on terror.

17
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,404
And now here, today,
Western and Arab leaders

18
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:20,934
will meet for the first time
to formalize this new coalition,

19
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:24,935
designed to, once and for all, put a
stranglehold on international terror.

20
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,892
Bring him up.

21
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,955
Tell us, Angie, what's the mood there?
-For the most part, hopeful.

22
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,265
Certainly, everyone here
is very sympathetic

23
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,466
to those who lost loved ones
in a recent bombing.

24
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:37,667
I did, however, speak to delegates...
-What is she doing?

25
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,253
...took a hard line, suggesting
that the US Foreign Policy...

26
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,752
Kevin, shut her down.

27
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,245
That's great.
Thanks, Angie.

28
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,390
Angie, what the hell was that?

29
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,221
Not everyone loves this, Rex.

30
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,356
Why don't you leave the punditry to
someone who's paid to have an opinion.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,660
Hey, I'm cool with censorship.
I know the American people love that.

32
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,171
Come on Angie, lighten up.

33
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:01,972
Got it!

34
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:06,478
-For you.
-Yes. I told her. You wanna tell her too?

35
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,179
Fine.

36
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,079
Who is the clown on two?

37
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,245
Camera two are you gonna move or what?

38
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,259
We're here for the summit,
not the sideshow.

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
Man, it's like training a freakin' dog!

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,570
OK everybody, the President
is about to arrive.

41
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,606
When he does, we're on him.
Let's have our ducks in a row.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,583
Three wider, four stay where you are.

43
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,484
C'mon, Kevin, get it moving,
I'm dying here.

44
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,423
Camera five, give me the motorcade.

45
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:59,003
Camera seven, concentrate,
I wanna go close on the President.

46
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:09,840
That's good, tighten up, five... good.

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,932
-Isn't that?...
-Thomas Barnes.

48
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,550
Why didn't we know he was here?

49
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,540
Shit. Grace, we should've had this.
-I know....

50
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,589
Kevin, call the archives.

51
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,853
OK, the President is approaching the Plaza.
All cameras ready.

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,118
Angie, we're back in
twenty, and remember...

53
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,264
we're here for the
summit, not the sideshow.

54
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:30,628
-There are other stories here, Rex.

55
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,825
-Which I don't give a shit about.

56
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:35,740
Unless the protesters set themselves
on fire, they're not our story.

57
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:46,665
Kevin, you got it?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,853
This was only last year.
I can't believe he's back already.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,158
-You know, if we're the
only ones who have this...

60
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,597
-No, he won't talk.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,312
I mean a year ago we had Hill,
we had that guy who saved Reagan...

62
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:05,924
-McCarthy.

63
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,195
All of them. It was a total hero piece,
Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.

64
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,615
-Well, that was then.
-Look, it's a shame...

65
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:15,196
it would've made a great side story,
but we've no time to work it in.

66
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,297
That was then, this is now.
OK, guys? We've got our story.

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,177
Okay.

68
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:22,678
Camera five, give me a single.

69
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,069
Three, four, get ready at the podium.
three go wide, four you're in close,

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,670
I wanna start with leaders
and end with the Mayor.

71
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,271
<i>Thank you so much for being here.</i>

72
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,889
Now three go back.

73
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,295
Camera six get ready,
we're coming to you.

74
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,829
<i>Today, we make history.</i>

75
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,130
That's good. Two, give me crowd.

76
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,336
Camera five, give me something
else to work with. That's good.

77
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,929
Angie, when this is over I want a fifteen
second fill, something to wrap it up.

78
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,230
Keep it simple.

79
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:52,144
-Want me to dumb it down?
-Get off it, Angie, come on.

80
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,777
<i>Therefore, I offer you my city,
my country...</i>

81
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,978
Ready with the graphics?

82
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,692
This summit can very well
be the defining moment...

83
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,788
-Pull out four, three...

84
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,101
Oh My God!

85
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,902
The President appears
to have been shot.

86
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,803
I heard two shots,
and the President fell.

87
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,414
What is he doing?
OK, five, stay with that guy.

88
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,350
Everyone else, give me Ashton.

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,476
Three, stick with the President.
Just stay with him.

90
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:25,777
That's good, just stay with him,
stay with him. Hold it there.

91
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,178
This is insane.

92
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:28,879
Yeah, yeah, coming in.

93
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,574
Number three, you gotta do better.
-They're not letting me through.

94
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:34,103
Don't give me this bullshit,
figure it out!

95
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,804
What the hell was that?
-It appears to be an explosion...

96
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,520
Camera four, turn around,
find out what that was.

97
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,421
Kevin, get the cameras going, we're gonna
have to uplink everything we've got.

98
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:46,984
Computer, uplink...

99
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,330
OK, Angie, you're on, lets go.

100
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,526
We are live, Angie, this is it. Go.

101
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:58,696
-I'm in the picture, right?
-Shit. Get Mark to stretch.

102
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:04,677
I know this is tough, OK? I know that.
We need you to tell us what's going on.

103
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,600
Focus, okay?

104
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:09,801
-Angie, please tell us what you're seeing.
-Deep breath, go.

105
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:12,145
The President of the
United States has been shot.

106
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:14,525
There have been several gunshots.

107
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,626
It appears there's also bomb
that went off inside the Plaza.

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,157
The people running scared...

109
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,446
Mark?

110
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,313
Mark, you gotta fill.

111
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:41,402
It seems that a huge bomb...
-Oh my God! Angie!

112
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,001
Angie!

113
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,934
Angie! Come on, kid, get up.

114
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:08,794
Kevin, pull the feed.
Turn it off.

115
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,272
Good morning, America.

116
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,649
It's now twelve, noon,
in Salamanca, Spain.

117
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,790
It's time.

118
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,447
<i>All teams to the control...</i>

119
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:06,748
It was before he lost it.
-C'mon...

120
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,704
Six months ago.
He's not that guy anymore.

121
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,361
Give him a break.

122
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,902
What are the chances he
freaks out on me when we walk?

123
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,211
I'd put it at 50-50.

124
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,475

We doing this?

125
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,988
Mr. President.

126
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:44,329
<i>All teams, this is control.
Eagle is on the move.</i>

127
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,927
Tell us, Angie, what's the mood there?
-For the most part, hopeful.

128
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,357
Certainly, everyone here
is very sympathetic

129
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,449
to those who lost loved ones
in a recent bombing.

130
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,093
Thanks.

131
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,594
For what?

132
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,202
For getting me back out here.

133
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,174
Don't thank me yet.

134
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:42,164
Mr. President, here we go.

135
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,354
What a beautiful baby.

136
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,355
Thank you so much.

137
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,856
A wonderful day.

138
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:47,057
Hey! Drop it.

139
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,826
<i>All clear, number five.</i>

140
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:29,232
Thank you so much for being here.

141
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,860
This is a wondrous day.

142
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,283
Today, we make history.

143
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:42,388
Señor Presidente,

144
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,602
fellow members of the European Union,
our friends from Africa,

145
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:51,989
President Ashton,
and citizens of the world.

146
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,090
This is a great day that
I invite you all to our town...

147
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:04,128
And it is the sad part
that we must...

148
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:13,443
Back annex building should've been cleared.
-Copy, it'll be cleared.

149
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,752
I've got a flutter on a second floor,

150
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:20,953
seventh window from the left.

151
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:23,480
Copy. We'll check again.

152
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,468
It's just a fan someone left on.
We got it.

153
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:59,673
Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart, and my hope.

154
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,730
Barnes!

155
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:21,107
Barnes!

156
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,058
-Please.

157
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,308
-Get him out of here,
get him out of here!

158
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,457
Move, move, lets go!

159
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,422
One, two, three!
-You got him?

160
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,700
Find that shooter.

161
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:48,533
Control, I want you to clear a half a block out.
Clear all the buildings along the back annex.

162
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,695
No one goes out or in without our go.

163
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,296
OK, you got him?

164
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:56,648
Control. Come in, control.
We need a 20 on POTUS.

165
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,849
Control. Come in, control.
Damn it!

166
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,850
Listen to me!

167
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,398
Listen to me!

168
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,820
We have to get out of here!

169
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,521
There's a bomb!
-Barnes!

170
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,869
Why did you run to the President?
Why did you run to the President?

171
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,970
Barnes!

172
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:19,370
I have to protect the Mayor. It's my job.
-You got up there pretty fast.

173
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:21,565
-Barnes, he's a cop.
-I don't care, he knows something!

174
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,066
Get him out of here!

175
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,517
Don't release him!
-It's a set up!

176
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,288
Control! Control, come in.

177
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:36,725
There's no response from control.
-I just spoke with them.

178
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:42,705
-We need to find that shooter.
-This never should've happened.

179
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,381
Except that it did.
And it happened on our watch.

180
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,592
I can't live with that.

181
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,493
We'd better find him.

182
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,339
Sir, we need your camera.
-Sure.

183
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,840
Where's the zoom?
-Right here.

184
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:02,067
Right there, that's where the flutter was.

185
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,398
The shot was up, to the left.

186
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,640
You saw the shooter?
-No.

187
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:10,324
But I saw something
like flash of light.

188
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,825
A saw a man in that window, sir.
-I'll check it out.

189
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,045
I'm coming with you.
-No, no!

190
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:17,240
If you're wrong,
let me take the heat.

191
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,741
Sir, did you film this entire thing?

192
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,541
-Yes.
-Show me.

193
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:26,942
I think I have a shooter on tape.

194
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,343
Go forward.

195
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:34,626
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

196
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,227
There's a bomb in the podium!

197
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:20,128
<i>-This never should've happened.
-Find that shooter.</i>

198
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,979
<i>A flash of light.</i>

199
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
<i>Find that shooter.</i>

200
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,049
Jesus, Barnes!

201
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,670
Medic! We need a medic here!

202
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,777
Take it easy now, buddy.

203
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,778
Barnes...

204
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,835
Hey, hey, stop him!

205
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,217
Stop him! Stop! Stop!

206
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:21,318
Hey, freeze!

207
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:45,579
Secret Service.
I need to see your tapes.

208
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,515
-Yes, Kevin...

209
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,617
I need to see any footage you have
of the back part of the Plaza.

210
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,118
OK. Give me footage of the
back part of Plaza on two.

211
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,518
-Got it!

212
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,119
Give me everything.

213
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,607
Please play it back. Yeah.

214
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,310
Barnes, you were right.

215
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:14,900
-About what?
-About the shooter.

216
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:17,241
I'm in pursuit lead at the
back annex, heading west.

217
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,458
Repeat, heading west.
-Did you call it in?

218
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,085
No, no, I need you to.
-I got it. Go!

219
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,449
Control. Come in, control.

220
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:32,962
Control, come in!

221
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,175
This is Agent Barnes.
Control is down.

222
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,095
My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.
We need immediate assistance.

223
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,854
Just outside the back annex.

224
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,718
Headed west on a surface street.
Do you copy?

225
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,598
Back up is on it's...

226
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,699
What? Barnes, what is it?

227
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:06,226
Rewind that.

228
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,155
Stop.

229
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,764
Oh My God!

230
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,196
What? What did he see?

231
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,614
I'll be at the underpass.

232
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:37,379
And now, President of the
United States.

233
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:01,014
Thank you so much for being here.

234
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,677
This is a wondrous day.

235
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,071
Today we make history.

236
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,072
<i>I'll be at the underpass.</i>

237
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,573
...my heart and my hope.

238
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:57,990
Get him out of here!

239
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,735
Let me go! I work for the Mayor!

240
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,569
Let me go!

241
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,670
Hey, who are you?

242
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,261
Veronica!

243
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,862
Veronica!

244
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:38,563
We have to go!

245
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:41,163
We are all in danger!
We have to go!

246
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:43,364
She threw something!

247
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:47,465
Please, please, listen to me.
He's telling the truth.

248
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:50,687
I am police! My badge is here.

249
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:53,388
Listen to me. We have to go!

250
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:58,070
Calm down. Are you armed?
-Yes. I work for the Mayor.

251
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:02,973
Listen to me. We're in danger.
We have to get out of here.

252
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:07,779
Barnes! 
-Why did you run towards the President?

253
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,176
I go to protect the Mayor.
It's my job.

254
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:13,577
You got up there pretty fast.
-Barnes, he's a cop!

255
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,167
I don't care, he knows something.
Get him out of here!

256
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,868
I've been set up!
You've got the wrong person!

257
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:42,468
Medic! We need a medic here!

258
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:54,889
Hey, stop him! Stop!

259
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,494
Hey, stop him!

260
00:26:58,482 --> 00:26:59,937
Hey, freeze!

261
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,640
Get out the way!
Get out the way!

262
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,741
Freeze!

263
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,542
Get out the way!

264
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,743
Stop him! Someone stop him!

265
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,544
<i>I'll be at the underpass.</i>

266
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,645
Get down! Get down!
Call the police!

267
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:40,746
Move!

268
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:04,533
Out the way!

269
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:19,934
Shit.

270
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,035
Out the way!

271
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,393
Surprised to see me alive?

272
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,135
It's amazing!

273
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,501
What are you seeing?

274
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:40,235
-Oh, you speak English.
-That's right.

275
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,857
I was just watching...
people over there.

276
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:47,132
Hi, my name is Sam, nice to meet you.
-Howard Lewis, nice to meet you too.

277
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,130
American?
-Yeah.

278
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,791
Wow! What brings you here?

279
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,017
Just... looking for little excitement.

280
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,607
First time, eh?
-In Europe? Yeah.

281
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,804
I just felt like it was a right time.
What about you?

282
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,879
I go where the moment takes me.

283
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,125
That must be nice.
No family, right?

284
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:06,576
No, none that I know of.

285
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:10,102
You're saying you have
kids running around.

286
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:14,003
-Are your's with you?
-No, they're with their mother.

287
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:16,104
We got in a sort of a
bad patch right now.

288
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:18,605
I decided to get away for a while...

289
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,460
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine, it's fine.

290
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:27,314
I think it's my cue.

291
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:30,932
-Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too. Best of luck.

292
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,633
Yeah, you too.

293
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,815
-Tell me your name.

294
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,634
-Anna.
-That's a pretty name.

295
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:47,570
You look about the same
age as my son Nathan.

296
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,512
Can I buy her another cone?

297
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,383
-Oh, no, it's okay. Thank you.
-No, really, it's no problema.

298
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:53,884
No, thank you very much.

299
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,538
Anna, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

300
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,539
...President Ashton.

301
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,483
Welcome.

302
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,841
Thank you so much for being here.

303
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,452
This is a wondrous day.

304
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:39,767
Today we make history.

305
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:47,368
It is with great pleasure that I
invite you all to our humble city.

306
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:51,369
The hopes of the world are with us.

307
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,470
We must act together.

308
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:03,843
What is happening?
What's he doing?

309
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,409
Get him out of here!

310
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:48,672
-Let me go!
-What the hell were you doing up there?

311
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,154
-Answer my god damn question!
-Veronica!

312
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:52,855
Veronica!

313
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:56,714
We have to go!
Please, listen to me!

314
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:58,415
-Calm down.
-We have to go!

315
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,016
-Wait...
-Step away, sir.

316
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,117
-She threw something!
-A gun. It's loaded.

317
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,353
-Hey, back up!
-Listen to me, he's telling the truth!

318
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:07,354
Veronica! Veronica!

319
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:34,240
Hi, leave a message.
-Bev, it's me.

320
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,603
You're gonna see on the news
when you wake up in the morning,

321
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:42,304
that the President has been shot.

322
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,605
He was here, in Spain.

323
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:47,171
And I think I just saw
the guy who did it.

324
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:51,972
Look, I'm all right, I just
want you to let the kids know

325
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,645
that I'm fine, and that I love
them very much and...

326
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,846
and I think I got it all on tape.
I don't know what to do...

327
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:05,062
Sir, we need your camera.
-Sure.

328
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:08,313
-Where's the zoom?
-Press this button right here.

329
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:11,440
That's... that's where the flutter was.

330
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,013
The shot was up, to the left.

331
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,734
-You saw the shooter?
-I saw something, like a flash of light.

332
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:20,706
It was... right there, there was
something in that window right there!

333
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:23,428
-I saw a man in that window, sir.
-I'll go check it out.

334
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,543
I'm coming with you.
-No, no!

335
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:27,733
If you're wrong,
let me take the heat.

336
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:30,376
Sir, did you film this entire thing?

337
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:32,206
-Yes.
-Show me.

338
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:40,638
I think I have a shooter on tape.

339
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,539
Go forward.

340
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,288
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

341
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,591
There's a bomb in the podium!

342
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,358
Medic!
We need a medic here!

343
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,197
Anna!

344
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:52,898
Anna!

345
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:56,989
Where is your mother?
Where is she?

346
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,911
I gotta get you somewhere safe,
then we'll find your mother.

347
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,144
I need your help. I need you
to watch her, okay? All right?

348
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,479
Her mother is gone,
I don't know where she is.

349
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,576
-She'll be safe with me, don't worry.
-I'll be right back, all right?

350
00:37:50,677 --> 00:37:52,877
I'll be right back. Wait for me.
-Take me with you!

351
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,982
I got to help the police.
Just stay with this lady

352
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,883
and I'll be back when I find your mom.
I'll be right back, okay? I swear.

353
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:00,184
I'll be right back.

354
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,685
Get out the way!

355
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:32,886
Mom?

356
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:57,386
Police!
Get out the way!

357
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:10,287
Police!
Move!

358
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:12,888
Police!
Police!

359
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,298
He's a cop.

360
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,412
Freeze!

361
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,813
They shot him.
They shot him.

362
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:29,214
Mom!

363
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,314
Anna!

364
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:47,915
Mom!
Mom!

365
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:21,845
When exactly do you think
the changes will be ready?

366
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,846
It's not like I have to
make the speech now.

367
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:28,483
I suppose I can just wing it, how much
trouble can I really get myself into?

368
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,299
Thing is, we both
know my limitations.

369
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:39,355
-Are we stopping?
-Yes sir.

370
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,620
Luke, I'll call you back.

371
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,278
NSA has just confirmed the threat.

372
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,879
<i>Control handover complete.
-Roger that.</i>

373
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:04,538
Where's Phil?

374
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,440
-At the hotel.
He's now at the Joint Chiefs.

375
00:42:07,086 --> 00:42:10,643
You're sending a double.
-Yeah.

376
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,403
Delivering POTUS to the hotel.

377
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,710
Control, reversing the car,
POTUS is returning.

378
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:19,832
We're going to issue a statement
to the press that we'll be deferring...

379
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:22,139
Deferring, that's great.

380
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:26,395
Today of all days...

381
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,355
Christ.

382
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:31,204
Sir, we've used doubles since Reagan.

383
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,489
I'm not sure photo ops is appreciating this a bit.

384
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:42,150
<i>Control, we have POTUS and
we're moving to the castle.</i>

385
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,704
<i>Eagle has arrived at the Plaza.</i>

386
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:59,779
<i>Control, we have POTUS and
are entering the castle.</i>

387
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,712
Sir?
-Talk to me, Phil.

388
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:15,870
NSA called about five
minutes ago, it's real.

389
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,825
And the summit?
-We're not thinking of pulling out entirely.

390
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,841
Why would we?

391
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,080
Do we know who's behind this?
-It looks like a local group

392
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,410
with some sort of a vague connection
to the Mujahideen Brigade.

393
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:28,402
-Why issue the threat now?
-Couple of weeks ago,

394
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,580
US Special Forces uncovered a plot to
smuggle a dirty bomb out of Morocco.

395
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,401
We took their bomb, and their men,
and this may be their retaliation.

396
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:38,563
They try to kill me
as a retaliation?

397
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,310
POTUS is moving.

398
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,211
<i>Safe for Eagle to exit vehicle.
-Copy that.</i>

399
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:09,091
This is them?
-That's Suarez.

400
00:44:09,192 --> 00:44:11,692
As far as we can tell,
he leads the group.

401
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:13,606
What do we know about him?

402
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,961
He's from Morocco,
educated in Paris.

403
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:19,444
He went off the map for a while,
but he surfaced in Beirut.

404
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,352
Couple of days ago, we intercepted an
e-mail between members of his group.

405
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,337
Embedded in it were links to maps,
blueprints of the area.

406
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,807
It wasn't until this morning
that we received the threat.

407
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,321
You talked to Joint Chiefs,
what do they recommend?

408
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,991
That we go after their leadership.
-Here in Spain?

409
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,112
Morocco.

410
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:41,783
We have a satellite locked
on one of their camps there.

411
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:46,021
You want me to call in a strike
on a friendly Arab nation?

412
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:48,180
They're harboring terrorists.

413
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,765
Is this intel certain?
-Absolutely.

414
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:59,845
Control, we're clear on seven.

415
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,566
Why aren't we focusing on the ones who
are here and are actually doing this?

416
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,172
-We are.

417
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:05,073
-This summit is too important.
-I know that sir,

418
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,561
but we're looking for five people
out of six million.

419
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:09,662
We are trying.
-Try harder.

420
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:33,604
Welcome.

421
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:36,315
This is a wondrous day.

422
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,609
Today we make history.

423
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:44,739
He doesn't even look like me.

424
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,040
Señor Presidente, fellow members
of the European Union,

425
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:50,941
President Ashton,
and citizens of the world,

426
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:55,842
it is with great pleasure that I
invite you all to our humble city.

427
00:45:57,696 --> 00:45:59,937
Is that Thomas?
-Yes, sir.

428
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,342
I thought he was still inactive.
-He was.

429
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:08,924
Well if he's back,
why isn't he with me?

430
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,808
We're checking if he's ready.

431
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:17,666
-You sent him out there.
-We need someone to sell the double.

432
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:20,541
Sell?
He took a bullet for me, Phil.

433
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,773
And look at him.

434
00:46:25,946 --> 00:46:27,740
He doesn't stop
punishing himself since.

435
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,245
Look, I liked him every bit as much
as you did, but we needed to know

436
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:32,746
we can count on him again,
before we put him on your detail.

437
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:35,647
So you threw him out there
to see if he's good?

438
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:38,697
Is that what you do
to your friends now?

439
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:44,798
<i>Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.</i>

440
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:50,639
This summit can very well be the
defining moment for this Presidency.

441
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,267
Jesus.

442
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:58,337
The President appears to have been shot.
-My God!

443
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:01,038
I heard two shots,
and the President fell.

444
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:04,465
Get the Joint Chiefs
on the line, now.

445
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:20,372
Mr. President.
-Sir.

446
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,287
Mr. President, the Chiefs have
a satellite lock on their village.

447
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:27,388
They are ready and waiting.

448
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:33,131
Ted?
-Well, there is an issue of when we can go.

449
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,639
We go now.

450
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:37,745
You can't give the order.
You've been shot.

451
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:41,413
If we go now, we risk telling the world
that you weren't really there.

452
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:43,257
But I wasn't there.

453
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:45,103
We get the Vice-President to do it.

454
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,686
No, we're not going there
on the 25th amendment.

455
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:53,182
Tell Rick to work up a story
that I was shot, but I'm OK.

456
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,552
That's not gonna fly.

457
00:47:54,553 --> 00:47:55,805
-If we have to go to some
hospital and put on a show,

458
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,633
that's what we're gonna do.
We're not sitting this one out.

459
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:59,976
-Sir, we have to talk about this...
-I'm done talking!

460
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,977
Christ!

461
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:08,112
Sir, we gotta go now!
We have to attack. Sir?

462
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:14,020
Find out what the hell
is going on down there.

463
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:22,063
Mr. President...

464
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:28,203
Tell them to stand down.
-Sir, we have to respond.

465
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:31,460
Bombing a camp in Morocco would
blow this summit out of the water

466
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:33,961
and that is exactly what the
bombers want us to do.

467
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:37,918
-Mr. President, we have to act strong.
-No, we have to be strong.

468
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:40,848
They sent us a warning because
they want us to react.

469
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:44,349
They know our playbook, they are
banking on us doing what we always do.

470
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:48,450
We will hit back. We have the world's
sympathy right now, that's...

471
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,251
Honor that. Let's finish
what we came here to do.

472
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:56,455
OK, copy that. Sir, everything is being
prepared to transport the President.

473
00:48:56,654 --> 00:48:59,080
Alright, that's it, we need to get the
President to Air Force One, right now.

474
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,077
I'm done hiding, Phil.
This is the President, is my wife there?

475
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,964
We have to be better than this.
-Sir.

476
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,336
-Yeah, get Air Force One ready,
and send a chopper...

477
00:49:07,337 --> 00:49:09,132
-Hey, it's me.

478
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,982
No, we're fine, we're safe.

479
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:49,383
Good morning, America.

480
00:49:49,484 --> 00:49:51,484
It's now twelve noon,
in Salamanca, Spain.

481
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:15,604
I am standing inside Plaza Major
in Salamanca, Spain.

482
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:22,027
This is for good luck.

483
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,883
I want to know if he's okay.

484
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:37,226
This was taken fifteen minutes ago,

485
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:40,527
I think you'll find that we're
taking good care of your brother.

486
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,535
What have you done to him?

487
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,276
He's still in one piece,
you should be happy about that.

488
00:50:49,098 --> 00:50:53,227
If you do what you're supposed to do
your brother will be fine, but if you fail,

489
00:50:53,328 --> 00:50:56,328
then this will be the last thing
you'll have to remember him by.

490
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,049
You look after yourself.

491
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:06,213
I'll be at the underpass.

492
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,591
Louis. Stick with the protesters.
They never see this side of the story.

493
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:45,092
To the last detail.

494
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,766
The beauty of American arrogance
is that they cannot imagine a world

495
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:54,867
where they're not a step ahead.

496
00:51:58,068 --> 00:51:59,168
Reception.

497
00:52:21,169 --> 00:52:23,769
<i>Control, we have POTUS and
are entering the castle.</i>

498
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,470
<i>Copy that.
Eagle has arrived at the Plaza.</i>

499
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:29,918
Javier.
-Yeah.

500
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:31,407
-Are you in the position?

501
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,776
-I'm on my way.
-Good.

502
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:35,393
For the moment Americans think
they've dodged the bullet,

503
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,358
do not be late.
-Don't worry about me.

504
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,859
I won't. Your brother spoke very highly
of your Special Forces training.

505
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,060
Do not disappoint him.

506
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:52,609
You just make sure my brother
will be at the underpass.

507
00:52:57,635 --> 00:52:59,792
How's our boy doing?

508
00:53:01,896 --> 00:53:03,900
Are we go?

509
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,647
There he is.

510
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:24,536
What are you seeing?

511
00:55:00,937 --> 00:55:02,541
I think it's my cue.

512
00:55:02,642 --> 00:55:05,442
-Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
-Best of luck.

513
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:24,948
Let's make ourselves a shooter.

514
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:46,099
That should keep him occupied.

515
00:56:11,594 --> 00:56:14,307
Javier, are you ready?

516
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:54,296
Eagle is down!
Let's go, move it!

517
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:10,075
-Control room clear.
-Do you have the frequency?

518
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,576
4-1-9-1-0.

519
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:19,473
<i>Control. Come in, control.
We need a 20 on POTUS.</i>

520
00:57:19,574 --> 00:57:21,574
Control. Come in, control.

521
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,465
Control!

522
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:54,558
Take care of him.

523
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,693
Lets go.

524
00:58:53,478 --> 00:58:57,289
This is control, there are agents down.
I repeat, agents down.

525
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,912
We have a situation at the front
requiring immediate backup.

526
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,656
<i>Heading to the lobby to assist.</i>

527
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:12,584
Move, move, move!

528
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:26,033
Things clear on seven.

529
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:56,034
Get Air Force One ready and send a
chopper so we can get outta here.

530
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:58,135
No, we're fine, we're safe.

531
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:12,400
Get up! Get up!

532
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:19,901
<i>Multiple casualties, I repeat,
multiple casualties.</i>

533
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,899
Hey!

534
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:33,277
We need your help... now.

535
01:00:36,078 --> 01:00:37,278
C'mon.

536
01:00:39,379 --> 01:00:41,179
He's got no pulse.

537
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:48,285
Secret Service. I need to see your tapes.
-Yeah...

538
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:51,211
I need to see any footage you have
of the back part of the Plaza.

539
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:53,559
OK. Give me footage of the
back part of Plaza on two.

540
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,360
Again...

541
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:58,161
two... again!

542
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:05,707
Washington, this is Agent Barnes.
-Go ahead.

543
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:08,308
Control is down, my partner
is in pursuit of a suspect.

544
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:11,109
We need immediate assistance.
Just outside the back annex.

545
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,610
<i>Copy that. Give me a heading.</i>

546
01:01:12,741 --> 01:01:14,982
Headed west on a surface street.
Do you copy?

547
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,083
<i>Heading west, copy that.</i>

548
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,540
Back up is on it's...

549
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:24,232
What? Barnes, what is it?

550
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:25,833
Barnes?

551
01:01:28,872 --> 01:01:30,742
Oh My God!

552
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:37,201
No. If you're wrong,
let me take the heat.

553
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:03,193
Barnes, you were right.

554
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:04,945
-About what?
-About the shooter.

555
01:02:05,075 --> 01:02:07,920
I'm in pursuit lead at the
back annex, heading west.

556
01:02:12,155 --> 01:02:13,994
<i>Barnes, what is it?</i>

557
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:15,523
<i>Barnes!</i>

558
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,674
Secret Service, get out of the car!

559
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,511
Washington.

560
01:02:56,512 --> 01:02:57,523
-This is Barnes.
-Go ahead.

561
01:02:57,695 --> 01:02:59,516
Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
but Agent Taylor has gone rogue.

562
01:02:59,517 --> 01:03:01,338
-What?

563
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,179
You gotta call in other agents back.

564
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,280
I know I made the call, but there's
something else going on here.

565
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:10,260
Control is compromised.

566
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,482
Listen to me, damn it!

567
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:14,883
God damn it!

568
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,835
Let him go.

569
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:42,972
What are you talking about?
-My brother.

570
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,113
I've done my part,
now you let him go.

571
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,459
-Put the gun down.
-Make the call,

572
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:53,285
or I pull the trigger
and your plan is finished.

573
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,793
Again.

574
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:02,694
Go ahead. Do it.

575
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:08,111
Do it and your brother is dead.

576
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:10,254
Can you live with that?

577
01:04:10,386 --> 01:04:12,847
Knowing that your brother
died because of you.

578
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,937
Javier, listen to me.

579
01:04:16,404 --> 01:04:19,365
He is going to be delivered
at the underpass.

580
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:21,562
Don't mess it up now.

581
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,284
You'll get your brother back.

582
01:04:32,595 --> 01:04:33,967
Nothing...

583
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:37,068
nothing...

584
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,687
had better happen to him.

585
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:43,994
Nothing will.

586
01:04:54,095 --> 01:04:55,095
Shit.

587
01:04:56,568 --> 01:04:57,899
This is Agent Barnes again.

588
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,750
I've lost Agent Taylor, I need
a GPS location on his cellular.

589
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:01,500
-Copy that.

590
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:43,817
We did it.

591
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,150
Not yet.

592
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:50,451
Mommy!

593
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:57,659
Yeah!
-Barnes, POTUS has been abducted.

594
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,621
Present location unknown.
No signal for Taylor's phone.

595
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:03,722
It's imperative we locate
and apprehend Taylor.

596
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:05,831
Son of a bitch.

597
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:30,331
-He fell down.
-Leave him.

598
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:35,185
It's me.

599
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:38,053
-They bought it.
-What about Barnes?

600
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,793
He took the bait.
He's pissing in the wind.

601
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:44,589
He has created a manhunt for
a shooter that doesn't exist.

602
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,976
Have you got Javier?
We may need him later.

603
01:06:47,097 --> 01:06:48,567
I'm on my way.

604
01:07:00,473 --> 01:07:02,929
I thought he was
supposed to be dead.

605
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:07,761
We need to tie up
all of the loose ends.

606
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:10,879
Who's the loose end?

607
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,798
You are.

608
01:08:00,816 --> 01:08:02,053
Lets go, lets go!

609
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:21,187
This is Agent Barnes,
I've located Taylor.

610
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:25,288
He's driving Salamanca police
vehicle, registration S-073654.

611
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:28,189
Headed south, repeat, south.

612
01:08:42,295 --> 01:08:44,353
Just get me to my brother.

613
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:00,082
Christ, it's Barnes.

614
01:09:14,612 --> 01:09:16,216
We got company.

615
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,810
It's Barnes.

616
01:09:19,046 --> 01:09:21,451
-Can you lose him?
-I'm working on it.

617
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:37,390
C'mon, c'mon!

618
01:10:45,512 --> 01:10:46,512
Shit!

619
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:53,051
-Have you lost him?
-I'm still working on it.

620
01:10:53,227 --> 01:10:56,633
Well, until you do, stay clear
of the rendezvous. All right?

621
01:10:57,964 --> 01:11:00,822
-No, we go to the underpass.
-You heard what he said.

622
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:02,793
I'm picking up my brother.

623
01:11:02,898 --> 01:11:05,040
Are you out of your mind?
I worked too hard for this.

624
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:08,696
Either you're coming with me,
or I'll drive myself. You choose.

625
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,340
Shit.

626
01:11:16,641 --> 01:11:17,641
Oh, shit!

627
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:26,459
Shit! Get him off my ass.

628
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:06,347
Happy?

629
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:09,148
Just drive.

630
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:23,949
-Where's my brother?
-Surprised to see me alive?

631
01:12:24,058 --> 01:12:26,528
-Where is Veronica?
-Veronica said that...

632
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:29,029
I don't care what she said!
You both tried to kill me.

633
01:12:33,786 --> 01:12:35,858
Where's my brother?

634
01:12:37,897 --> 01:12:39,753
Where's my brother?

635
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:42,296
Looks like we've both been set up.

636
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,197
Mom!

637
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,015
Come on, lets go!

638
01:12:54,122 --> 01:12:57,059
Where is he?
Where is he?

639
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,340
Back off.

640
01:13:12,896 --> 01:13:14,953
Lets go, lets go, c'mon!

641
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,388
I will ask you again.
Where's my brother?

642
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:21,276
Go to hell.

643
01:13:28,702 --> 01:13:29,772
Freeze!

644
01:13:40,364 --> 01:13:42,122
Give me my brother!

645
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,390
He's dead.

646
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,427
God damn you! You used me!

647
01:14:32,345 --> 01:14:35,000
I trusted you,
you son of a bitch!

648
01:14:36,841 --> 01:14:38,799
Who's got POTUS?

649
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:40,855
You're too late, Tom.

650
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:42,706
Why the fuck did you do this?

651
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,410
You can't stop us.
No one can stop it.

652
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:50,311
This war will never end.

653
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:58,580
What have you done?

654
01:15:00,698 --> 01:15:03,554
Who's got the President? Kent!

655
01:15:16,336 --> 01:15:18,413
Stop him!
Get him under control!

656
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,714
Stop him!

657
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,191
Mom?

658
01:15:27,192 --> 01:15:28,192
Mom?

659
01:15:28,793 --> 01:15:29,793
Anna!

660
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,694
Mom!

661
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:33,795
Anna!

662
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,296
No! Don't kill him!

663
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:39,018
Look out!

664
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:42,819
Mom!

665
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:22,031
Jesus Christ.

666
01:16:28,532 --> 01:16:29,732
Anna!

667
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:03,337
Mr. President?

668
01:17:04,663 --> 01:17:07,105
Barnes, is that you?

669
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:27,388
Mr. President.

670
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,284
I've got you.

671
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:35,250
Can you sit up?

672
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:49,629
Are you injured?
-Yeah.

673
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:52,704
But it's not important.

674
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:05,027
This is Agent Thomas Barnes.

675
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,660
POTUS is in hand.

676
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:10,428
I repeat, POTUS is in hand.

677
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:14,373
We need a pick-up seven
blocks east of the Plaza.

678
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,244
Hello?

679
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:40,781
-Oh, thank God.
Howard, are you okay? Are you hurt?

680
01:18:40,947 --> 01:18:42,016
-No, I'm...

681
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,085
-Are you sure? Are you okay?

682
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,009
I'm fine.

683
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,410
-We got your message.
Are you sure you're alright?

684
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:50,830
Yeah! No, I'm... I'm fine.

685
01:18:51,707 --> 01:18:54,744
-I'm fine.
-Kids were really concerned about you...

686
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:01,974
Thank you, Thomas.

687
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:07,048
You're welcome, sir.

688
