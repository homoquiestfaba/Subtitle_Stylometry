1
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,884
- Beautiful weather we're having.

2
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,835
- I could stay like this forever.

3
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,640
- I could stay with you forever.

4
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,781
Whoa!

5
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,816
Come on, come on!

6
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,684
Whoa, whoa!

7
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,155
I got you!

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,246
Are you okay?

9
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,681
Are you okay?

10
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,184
Are you all right?

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,768
I'm everything you'll never be.

12
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,321
- Good morning.

13
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,100
- I would like to know
where the Donner file is,

14
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,136
I need it in 10
minutes for a meeting.

15
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,140
(Margaret yelling

16
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,225
Do you have the
file or don't you?

17
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,428
Well, you gave
it to me just yesterday,

18
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,430
it's not ready yet.

19
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,801
- What have you been
doing all this time?

20
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,672
- I've gotta get the budget
done for next quarter

21
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,206
and if I don't get
that in by two p.m.

22
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,276
we won't cover
materials or supplies.

23
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,145
- Look, mister,
you get this right,

24
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,914
my priorities are
your priorities.

25
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,716
You are to drop
whatever you're doing

26
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,651
and take on my projects first.

27
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,486
- But if the budget
doesn't get in...

28
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,020
- Ah!

29
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,524
I'm about to go into that
meeting without that file.

30
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,494
This is not going to look
good for me, and you!

31
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,631
We're going to have a
conversation about this later, mister.

32
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,669
This is going to
affect your future.

33
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,113
- Nothin', okay?

34
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,951
All of sudden she's like,
"'Kay, stop, stop, stop!"

35
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,720
- What up, dog?

36
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,488
Biatch on the warpath again?

37
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,559
- I guess.

38
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,729
- You know you let
people walk all over you.

39
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,632
You know you shouldn't do that.

40
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,707
You are such a push over.

41
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,143
- You think?

42
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,988
- Hey, I'm gonna call you back.

43
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,158
Yo, she looks like a
major league ice queen.

44
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,359
- What, man?

45
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,829
- Oh, no, no I bet I
can melt those defenses.

46
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,531
- You ain't the
player with moves.

47
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,400
- Oh.
- Ah.

48
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,900
- All right, Georgie.

49
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,368
Oh, suddenly you know all
about the moves now, right?

50
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,903
Man, you'd hit that any day!

51
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,939
- First of all, y'all
don't know shit.

52
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,474
- Look fellas, fellas,
fellas all right.

53
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,410
You know what?

54
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,810
Watch the master, after all

55
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,579
I am the chief negotiator
for this company.

56
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,350
- All right, let's see it.
- Play ball.

57
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,319
Five bucks.
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,026
- Looks like we
made a connection.

59
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,895
- I would've let you
stare a little longer

60
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,297
if you kept your mouth shut.

61
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,603
- Come on let's, uh,
reboot this conversation.

62
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,640
I'm Derrick Rogers,
I work in legal.

63
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,208
- I'd rather finish my lunch.

64
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,010
- Come on.

65
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,112
Look, I'm not asking for
your hand in marriage.

66
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,449
- Do you wanna get to know me?

67
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,455
- You just struck out, bro!

68
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,228
- What the hell are you
two laughin' at, huh?

69
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,930
You oughta take a good
look in the mirror.

70
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,065
I make more money than the
two of you put together...

71
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,975
How about that?

72
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,380
You're nothing but a little
worm, you little piece of shit!

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,135
- Everything seems to
be going well, Cyril.

74
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,905
So what happened in
the lunchroom today?

75
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,440
- I didn't do anything!

76
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,144
That, that jerk from legal,
he's the one who started it.

77
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,080
- We'll forward this incident
to Derrick's manager,

78
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,884
but right now we need to
deal with your behavior.

79
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,154
- Your file is dotted with
many troubling things.

80
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
- I know I've messed up

81
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,697
but I had to learn
everything for myself,

82
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,499
I wasn't shown what to do!

83
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,701
- You give me no choice but to

84
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,304
place you on a performance plan.

85
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,609
I'll be watching you closely.

86
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,247
So you better bring your work
up to an acceptable level.

87
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,256
- I don't wanna sign it.

88
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,928
- I think it would be
a good idea if you did.

89
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,912
Thank you.

90
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,162
This will affect your future.

91
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,163
You're
nothin' but a little worm,

92
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,365
you little piece of shit!

93
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,667
Your file is dotted
with many troubling things.

94
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,844
You should kill them all.

95
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:20,019
They're only worm food, wasting
space for all of us here.

96
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,323
- Who's that?

97
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,027
It's me.

98
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,097
- Me?

99
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,067
Me who?

100
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,770
I'm what you really are.

101
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,244
- I've finally cracked.

102
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,482
I'm talking to voices in my...

103
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,854
I'm a lot closer than you think.

104
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,517
- Hi, honey, how ya doin'?

105
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,421
- Want a flower?

106
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,572
- Ugh!

107
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,841
- Where you going
in such a hurry?

108
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,743
- I'm just trying to get out
of the rain and get home.

109
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,578
- Oh yeah?

110
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,546
I see.

111
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,280
Well, this here is my alley,

112
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,449
and everyone around
here knows it,

113
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,584
so if you're gonna
come through my alley,

114
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,386
you're gonna pay some respect!

115
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,620
- I'll just go back
the way I came.

116
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,788
- Too late!

117
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,691
Now you're gonna
have to pay the toll.

118
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,526
Come here!

119
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,896
Open up.

120
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,465
There you go, swallow that.

121
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,600
Right, baby, you're
gonna pay, right?

122
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,370
Now get the hell
out of my alley!

123
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,906
Beat it!

124
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,441
- Oh, hey, Cyril.

125
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,776
Oh, hey, Callie.

126
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,444
- I thought you were Todd.

127
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,312
- Nope.

128
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,881
No, it's just me.

129
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,017
- I, um, do you think you
could help me with something?

130
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,020
- Yeah, sure, what's up?

131
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,455
- Are, are you okay?

132
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,325
- Ugh, I had a long
day, I'm pretty tired.

133
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,328
- Maybe you should
lie down or something.

134
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,297
- Good idea.

135
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,531
- Okay.

136
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,232
- I feel pretty sick.

137
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,851
- Let me know if
you need anything!

138
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,836
- Hello?

139
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:32,671
Yo, baby.

140
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:34,907
Oh yeah?

141
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,410
I can come over and take
care of that right now.

142
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,679
Oh yeah, you know I can
take care of that, baby.

143
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,982
Come over and get a
little nasty, huh?

144
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:44,817
Ooh baby!

145
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,487
You are just one
nasty little girl!

146
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,556
That's what I like about you.

147
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,158
So wear that little
red number, okay?

148
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,094
That's right.

149
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,029
That's what I like about you.

150
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,098
What do you want?

151
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,735
Isn't it a
little early for Halloween?

152
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,977
Don't you know who I am?

153
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,078
I can have you killed!

154
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,191
- There can't be
two death dealers.

155
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,028
There can be only one!

156
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,862
- Your thighs needs some
serious fucking help, babe.

157
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,130
- Baby...

158
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,365
- You're one inch from
lookin' like a hippo!

159
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,901
I got an image to keep up here.

160
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,505
- Hey, Cyril, you
feeling any better?

161
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,973
Yeah.

162
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,375
- If you're gonna party
with me, you gotta keep up.

163
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,244
So stop being so mousey.

164
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,712
- Hey!

165
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,781
You need to treat
her like a lady.

166
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,315
- You talkin' to me, shrimp?

167
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,683
- I'm not talking
to anybody else.

168
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,052
- You gotta be kiddin' me!
- Todd, come on!

169
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,086
He's a nice guy,
- Mind your own business!

170
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,021
- he's my neighbor!
- Hey!

171
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,755
Todd!

172
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,061
- Later, losers.

173
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,764
- I am so sorry.

174
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,637
He's not usually like that,

175
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,506
he's just mad 'cause I'm
slacking on my gym workout.

176
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,544
- Yeah, that's great, I'd
hate to see him on a bad day.

177
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,922
- There's something
different about you.

178
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,826
- Really?

179
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,169
I gotta go to work.

180
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,605
- Okay.

181
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,542
I'll see you later?

182
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,616
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

183
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,817
- No!

184
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,085
No, no, no, don't
touch, don't touch it.

185
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,721
Put it down, just,
just put it down.

186
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,157
Just go, just go.

187
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,759
- I'm sorry.

188
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,766
- Crazy shit.

189
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,967
- It's like straight
out of a comic book.

190
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,202
- Yeah, but this was real,

191
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,404
someone was actually
crazy enough to do it.

192
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,273
- That's the world
we live in today.

193
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,440
- No doubt.

194
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,775
- At least it happened
to some scumbag.

195
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,577
- You don't think it
was some vigilante?

196
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,579
- It was probably some psycho.

197
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,813
- What's up?

198
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,350
- Here's the paper,
read it yourself.

199
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,505
- Good morning.

200
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,141
- Good morning.

201
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,642
- I'm so sorry about getting you

202
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,212
mixed up in all that yesterday.

203
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,913
I hope nothing bad happened.

204
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,718
- No, no, it's okay, it's
nothing I can't handle.

205
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,486
- I'm Elisa.

206
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,322
- I'm Cyril.

207
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,330
- So what's the
story around here?

208
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,067
And what's up with those guys?

209
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,887
- There you are, I've been
looking all over for you.

210
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,757
- My boss.

211
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,592
- Oh.

212
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,597
I should probably get going.

213
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,333
- Okay, I'll see you later.

214
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,170
- So, now you have two friends.

215
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,768
Working hard?

216
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,438
- Who the fuck is that?

217
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,107
I'm what you hold back.

218
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,042
- What're you talking about?

219
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,644
I don't hold anything back!

220
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,979
I do exactly what I want to.

221
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,582
Oh, so you're dating
that girl across the hall,

222
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,154
telling your boss off, and
what about that drug dealer?

223
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,824
- That drug dealer's dead.

224
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,462
Yeah, I know.

225
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,532
And didn't that make
you feel better?

226
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,337
- A little, I guess.

227
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,641
Well, I can make
you feel a whole lot better.

228
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,411
- How?

229
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,945
You're just a voice in my head.

230
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,114
Believe in me
and I will deliver you from

231
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:07,885
your hell on Earth, give you
everything that you desire.

232
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,489
I can give you any
girl that you want!

233
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,190
Hey, how about a raise, huh?

234
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,760
No, no, better yet!

235
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:21,366
I can wreak vengeance upon
those who have offended you.

236
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,002
- Yes.

237
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,874
Oh yeah.

238
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:34,746
I will make those people pay
for what they've done to you.

239
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,951
- I believe in you.

240
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,822
Wise choice.

241
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:35,407
Stick around, I'll be
right back!

242
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,245
- I had a great day.

243
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,315
So I got that little worm
to take on all my workload.

244
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,617
And the best part is,

245
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,686
I'll fire him when he
doesn't come through!

246
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,693
Yeah, well, he's
a total disaster

247
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,562
and he's bringing
down my department.

248
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,632
Whose side are you on, anyway?

249
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,737
Look, Tom, you better get
on board for the future.

250
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,739
You know, I got a lot planned!

251
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,307
Where we're going to live,

252
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,343
where you should
be in your career,

253
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,844
how many kids we're
going to have.

254
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,147
You know I...

255
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,415
Something just fell
in the kitchen.

256
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,818
Hang on, I'll be right back.

257
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,620
Hm.

258
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,433
Well, it looks like I just...

259
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,204
Oh, asshole, how dare
you hang up on me!

260
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,073
What the hell now?

261
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,270
Hello?

262
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,730
- Oh my, you've fallen
and you can't get up!

263
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,903
- What do you want?

264
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,673
- How does it feel to be
the one being stepped on?

265
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,313
Oh, your files are dotted
with troubling things.

266
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,984
How about some origami, huh?

267
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,606
Don't you just hate paper cuts?

268
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,505
Lemons.

269
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,676
And now, for the
piece de resistance.

270
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,824
I would love and stay
and have play time,

271
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,830
but I have others to see and
miles to go before I sleep.

272
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,035
And miles to go before I sleep!

273
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,574
And scene.

274
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,111
Damn, that was good.

275
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,766
- Dude, you'll never believe
what happened last night!

276
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,701
- Must be somethin' big,
everyone's on alert.

277
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,536
- I'll say!

278
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,405
Your boss bit the
dust last night.

279
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,407
- What do you mean,
she was fired?

280
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,409
- You didn't hear the news?

281
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,812
- No, um...

282
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,816
I, uh, I came in early,
I didn't hear any news.

283
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,252
- Somebody killed
Margaret last night.

284
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,787
- What?

285
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,922
- Yeah, they said it was some
bizarre thing involving files

286
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,858
and paper cuts and a...

287
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,134
- Congrats on the promo.

288
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,670
- What?

289
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,640
- Look, I think you're
perfect to take over her gig.

290
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,345
A go nowhere position
for a go nowhere guy.

291
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,748
Look, I wanted to
see her dead, too.

292
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,250
I mean, who didn't around here?

293
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,652
You more than anybody here.

294
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,021
God, she was a real bitch!

295
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,157
- Who's a real bitch?

296
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,726
- Why don't you ask Cyril here?

297
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,429
He's an expert on that.

298
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,097
- You are?

299
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,534
- Derrick Rogers, I work
in the legal department.

300
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,802
- Well, I may need to
ask you some questions,

301
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,071
don't go too far.

302
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,206
- Later, gator!

303
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,044
- Cyril Bass.

304
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,279
- Yes.

305
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,448
- You worked with Margaret Chase?

306
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,718
- I worked for her,
she was my boss.

307
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,353
- Did you get along with her?

308
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,587
- Sure.

309
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,789
- Did she ever talk about anybody

310
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,125
she was having a problem with?

311
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,961
- She, she had a boyfriend.

312
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:41,598
- She put you on
a performance plan

313
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,201
to keep you on probation.

314
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,204
How'd that make you feel?

315
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,674
- I guess she felt I
wasn't doing my job.

316
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,749
- I might have some
more questions for you.

317
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:00,852
Please.

318
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,025
Give me a call if you
can think of anything.

319
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,860
- I will.

320
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,011
- What's up?

321
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,048
- Hi.

322
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,050
- Bitches, man!

323
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,351
What're you gonna do?

324
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,186
- Right.

325
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,123
- They make you do
shit that you don't do.

326
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,760
- Whatever you say, man.

327
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,595
- That's right!

328
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,964
Whatever I say.

329
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,654
- I really thought he
was different, you know?

330
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:28,225
That he had this tough exterior

331
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,162
but underneath it
he was sensitive.

332
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,900
- You never know what lies
just beneath the surface.

333
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,770
I mean, I, I know I'm
still finding out who I am.

334
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,776
You're a
sweetheart, you can't change that.

335
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,211
Hey, I got a dark side.

336
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,412
I'm not all prim and proper.

337
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,714
Hey, just 'cause I
was in the Boy Scouts

338
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,583
doesn't mean I can't
change a little.

339
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,818
- Girls never settle
with the bad boys,

340
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,052
they settle with the good guys.

341
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,555
They just wanna play
with the bad boys.

342
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,925
- But the bad boys
always hurt you.

343
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:24,014
You could've had her!

344
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,216
She was ready, man!

345
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,485
- Shut up, asshole!

346
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,021
Asshole?

347
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,791
Cyril, I am the
champion of your cause!

348
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,160
I make all your
nightmares go away!

349
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,595
- You are my nightmare!

350
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,565
Oh, man, that hurts!

351
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,101
Hey, what should we do
about ol' Todd, huh?

352
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,504
- We're not gonna do shit!

353
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,139
Yeah, sure,
why should we do anything

354
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,476
that could bring you
closer to Callie, huh?

355
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,347
- Okay.

356
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,451
I'm not opposed to
teaching him a lesson,

357
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,055
but do you have to kill people?

358
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,558
Man, I just get carried away.

359
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,893
You know how that is?

360
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,161
I mean, one minute you're
slappin' 'em around

361
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,898
and the next you
cut their throats.

362
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,201
- You see, I don't know
if I can trust you.

363
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:23,207
All right, Cyril,
I promise I will be good.

364
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,644
I mean, after all,
I'm a part of you.

365
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,087
- Okay.

366
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:42,225
You're just gonna teach
him a lesson, right?

367
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,060
Right!

368
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:53,270
- You think I actually
have a chance with Callie?

369
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,276
We settle with good guys!

370
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,343
You remember that?

371
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,312
I mean, even you could
get a girl like that!

372
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,647
- Hey, easy!

373
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,048
Yeah, easy!

374
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,784
Do you believe in me?

375
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
- Yes.

376
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:15,926
Let's do this.

377
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,729
Ha ha, thank you!

378
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,232
Thank you so much!

379
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,591
- Who doesn't want some of this?

380
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,330
I know plenty of girl
who'll want some.

381
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,034
And do!

382
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,537
Yeah!

383
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,973
Oh my God,
are those stretchmarks?

384
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,512
- What?

385
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,347
Where?

386
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,387
Oh yeah.

387
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,456
Let's get a double bicep.

388
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,292
Nice, but you got
nothin' on this!

389
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,297
- Check this out!

390
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,704
- Yo, what about this?

391
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,140
- That's nothin'!

392
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,810
- Whoa, very nice!

393
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,083
- Thank you!

394
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,123
- How ya doin'?

395
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:27,958
Hey.

396
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,275
You don't seem very
big now, do ya, Todd?

397
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,553
Bigger, better, stronger!

398
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,456
Come on, Todd!

399
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,559
How's it feel to have
somebody fight back, huh?

400
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,365
Whoa, nice!

401
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,704
Get the point?

402
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,146
I am the governator
of your pain.

403
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,455
Cyril, open the door,

404
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,056
it's Callie, I have
to talk to you!

405
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,125
- What the...

406
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,229
Oh, shit!

407
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,601
Uh, hang on, I'll
be right there!

408
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,605
Hang on!

409
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,680
I just got
a call from the police

410
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,683
and they said that Todd
was killed last night

411
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,585
while working out
and I turn on the TV

412
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,988
and it appears to
be a freak accident!

413
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:43,994
Oh!

414
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,729
- I really thought that
we could make things work.

415
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,702
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

416
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,928
- I'm sorry, I don't
know what I'm doing.

417
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,734
I'm sorry, I'm
confused right now.

418
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,404
I guess I got carried away.

419
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,008
You're so nice.

420
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:35,913
I like you.

421
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,678
- You should probably get going.

422
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,118
- Bye.

423
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,553
- I'll see ya.

424
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,208
You promised you were only
gonna teach him a lesson!

425
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,843
Did you like kissing her?

426
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,679
- What?

427
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:47,751
I think she liked
kissing you very much.

428
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:54,558
- You promised.

429
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,694
- Hey, it was outta my control.

430
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,797
I mean, I tried
talkin' to the guy,

431
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,233
but he just took it to
a whole different level.

432
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,773
Hey, wasn't it nice
bein' the hero?

433
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,376
Her hero?

434
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,246
And now you're the
big boss at work.

435
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,483
I think I delivered
on my promises.

436
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,666
- Bass.

437
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:42,673
- Hey!

438
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,195
Cyril Bass.

439
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,799
Cyril Bass.

440
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,638
Mr. Bass here.

441
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,213
No.

442
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,616
No.

443
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,019
No!

444
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,354
Yes.

445
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,722
You know what?

446
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:33,956
You're fired!

447
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:49,139
You need to bring your work
up to an acceptable level.

448
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,047
- Hey there!

449
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,348
- Yo.

450
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,751
- You seem to fit right in.

451
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,322
- Well, I was doin'
all the work anyway

452
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,591
and it's not like
it's brain surgery.

453
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:10,593
Well, I
thought you would like to

454
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,696
go grab some lunch to
celebrate your new position.

455
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,531
- Yeah.

456
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,068
Yeah, I could use a break.

457
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,847
- Here you go, ma'am.

458
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,081
For you, sir.

459
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:32,916
I'll be right back.

460
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:33,750
- Thanks.

461
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,157
- You seem different.

462
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:41,992
- How do you mean?

463
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:43,160
- More confident.

464
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,830
Not the same Cyril
I met the other day.

465
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,532
What happened?

466
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,569
- I guess I woke up, you know?

467
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,105
Spiritually.

468
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,810
In this crazy world
crazy things can happen.

469
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,379
If you don't get
yourself together,

470
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,516
you're gonna be sucked down the
drain and washed out to sea.

471
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,153
What's the word?

472
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,855
- Just havin' a little lunch.

473
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,423
- What're you doing here?

474
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,225
- What?

475
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,726
I can't eat?

476
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,629
Me and the fellas have a
usual Thursday thing here.

477
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,465
We saw you guys come in, I
thought I'd come by and say hi.

478
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,933
- Bye!

479
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,170
- Well, I'm actually here
to talk to my man Cyril.

480
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,374
How would you like
to go out with me

481
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,708
and the fellas tomorrow night?

482
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,779
A little party, a
little drinky, huh?

483
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,014
Should be a real good time.

484
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:38,849
- Really?

485
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,419
Yeah, sure, sounds like fun.

486
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,221
- All right, I'll drop
you a little email,

487
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,924
let you know what's
up, all right?

488
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,299
- Are you really gonna
go out with those guys?

489
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,602
- I'm on an equal playing
field with them now.

490
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,171
They know I'm the big dog,

491
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,906
they wanna hang with
the man on the way up.

492
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,676
- Who are you and what
have you done to Cyril?

493
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,544
You're definitely not
the same guy I met.

494
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,780
- I'd like to think
that that Cyril

495
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,282
won't be bothering us anymore.

496
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:15,819
I have to move on.

497
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,695
- Gentlemen, welcome
to the big time.

498
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,530
Huh, huh?

499
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,569
Ah, my home away from home,
my little happy place,

500
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,405
the soft spot in my heart.
- Hey get us some beers, baby.

501
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,540
- Oh, hey, who's this?

502
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,909
Say hello, say hello!

503
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,178
- It's okay!
- We'll talk later, huh?

504
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,114
Okay?

505
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:18,482
It's all good, it's all...

506
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,050
What do we have here, huh?

507
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,753
China, China!

508
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,623
You, you, yeah!

509
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,859
Hot!

510
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,162
I love her, she's fantastic!

511
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,132
Woo!

512
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:36,967
Yeah!

513
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,871
All right!

514
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,906
Yeah!

515
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,375
- Hey, uh, hey, look,
I know we've had

516
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,779
our differences in the
past but, uh, I, I,

517
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,517
come on, that time's behind
us so, uh, to new beginnings!

518
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:55,885
To new beginnings!

519
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,754
♪ <i>I guess its my lucky night</i> ♪

520
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:58,755
♪ <i>I got my mojo back</i> ♪

521
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,556
♪ <i>Because my game is tight</i> ♪

522
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,491
- You know, you
guys are all right.

523
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,059
- You're all right yourself.

524
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,360
- Yeah, oh no!

525
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,228
- Ah, do you see what it's like

526
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,663
when you get into
upper management?

527
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,598
I mean, look at the
doors that open for you!

528
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,306
- Hey, Cyril!

529
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:17,307
- Hey, Lucas!

530
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:18,974
- Thanks for inviting me.

531
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,709
So, what's it like
being my boss?

532
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,911
- It's cool.

533
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,446
- You know, I should
buy you a drink.

534
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,014
- Okay.
- No.

535
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,916
No, no, not a good idea.

536
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,952
I mean, you know how
the company frowns on

537
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:34,958
fraternization between
management and staff so...

538
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,159
- What?

539
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,595
- Got a whole new set
of rules to play by.

540
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,465
- And those rules
specifically said that, uh,

541
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,067
cool people like us cannot
hang out with you mongrels.

542
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,736
- You know, plain and simple.

543
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,073
You don't belong as
this table, so scram!

544
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,608
- Hey, I'm on the way up, man,

545
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,779
and I gotta think about my
future with the company.

546
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,216
I'd be happy to help
you at work but, uh,

547
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,985
we can't socialize beyond that.

548
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,520

598
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,887
What, how?

599
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:36,826
Ugh.

600
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,700
- This is what I do for a living.

601
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,203
Are you disappointed?

602
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,242
- I don't know, I'm
still processing.

603
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,479
- Are you mad?

604
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,984
- I think I should go.

605
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:02,819
Yeah.

606
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:08,491
Yeah, I should go.

607
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,234
- You make me feel so happy!
- You make me feel so alive!

608
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,937
- So happy, how do you do you?

609
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,539
No, I'm sorry...

610
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,674
Where you goin'?

611
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,342
How can you walk out on this?

612
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,279
Look at these ladies!
- So sorry.

613
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,982
- Whatever.
- But I still love you!

614
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,351
What's your problem?

615
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,187
We were havin' a good time.

616
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:38,188
- Leave me alone.

617
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,391
Hey, I'm attached to you.

618
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,860
- I'm tired of your bullshit.

619
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,261
Yeah, well, I'm tired

620
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,697
of bein' around
a pussy like you!

621
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,308
- I didn't give you
permission to come out!

622
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,145
I'm not askin' permission!

623
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,214
- Oh no you don't!

624
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,740
- I've given you everything
and this is how you repay me?

625
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,343
- I didn't want any
of this, not this way!

626
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,078
- You can't keep me in!

627
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:48,724
- I'm not letting you
loose on this world!

628
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,327
- I have more in common
with this world than you do!

629
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,402
You have such a simplistic
idea of what this world

630
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,840
is all about, but that's
not how it works out here.

631
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,313
I have shown you the darkness
which resides in everyone,

632
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,082
inside yourself, Cyril!

633
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,653
And by using this, you
have gained status,

634
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:21,925
closure, everything
you ever dreamed of.

635
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,928
What is wrong about that, huh?

636
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:26,863
- Civility.

637
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,501
Morals.

638
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,104
Ethics.

639
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,405
- Bullshit.

640
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,774
It's all overrated.

641
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,946
- I command you
to come back here!

642
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,981
- Command?

643
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,750
Command, you command me?

644
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,855
Did you really believe you
had any control over me?

645
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,626
I only let you think that
because that's the only way

646
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,729
you would buy into all of this.

647
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,365
You're a loser.

648
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,803
- Come back here!

649
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,408
Come back here!

650
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,016
- Shit!

651
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,118
- I mean, could you believe
that kid pussed out?

652
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,653
Jesus!

653
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,254
- Hey, Derrick, whatever, man,
no skin off my nose, right?

654
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,323
- Shit, I knew he wasn't
ready for the big time!

655
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,893
- Fuck it, let's bounce before
I spend my retirement here!

656
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,528
- Are you fuckin' serious?

657
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,031
- I'm out!
- She made me...

658
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,967
- Dude, don't drive too
drunk, get in the car.

659
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,403
- Fuck you!
- Eat it!

660
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,214
- What the fuck?

661
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:01,050
Shit!

662
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,052
Fuck!

663
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,655
Fuck!

664
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:06,489
Fuckin' cat!

665
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:09,826
Jeez.

666
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,606
- Can you believe that dude?

667
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,475
- Hey, come on, man,
it's not like the night

668
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:29,177
was a total loss, right?

669
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,645
- Where did you get those?

670
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,614
- Well, let's just say that
Amber took a shine to me

671
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:35,684
and gave me what I wanted.

672
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,285
- You're full of it
man, give me this!

673
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,687
- Hey, man, what're
you doing, man?

674
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,988
You're gonna rip it, dude!

675
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,027
- You all right?

676
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:46,863
- Ugh!

677
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,099
Ugh!

678
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,333
- You'll live.

679
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,135
- Fuck you!

680
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:54,704
- What did we hit anyway?

681
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,701
- Time to pay the piper, man!

682
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,875
Georgie Porgie!

683
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,121
Georgie!

684
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,527
Are ya hot, Georgie boy?

685
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,437
Does me butt look big, Sam?

686
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,348
So you wanna role play, huh?

687
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,283
Giddy up, horsie, giddy up!

688
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,202
What's wrong, didn't
you like my dancing?

689
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,037
- Mommy!

690
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,283
- You can't touch the dancers

691
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,019
but we can touch you!

692
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,660
- Good evening.

693
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,596
- Hey.

694
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:36,799
- What happened to you?

695
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,637
- I kinda had an accident.

696
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,829
Can I get into my apartment?

697
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:09,765
- Sure.

698
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,739
You're probably
wondering why I'm here.

699
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,841
Um, no.

700
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,881
- It's because of this rash of

701
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,917
bizarre murders that we've had.

702
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,555
You know...

703
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,625
You live across the hall

704
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,895
from the girlfriend
of one of the victims

705
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,999
and you worked with
one of the other ones.

706
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,072
And that drug dealer?

707
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,809
He was killed not
to far from here.

708
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:33,149
So there seems to be
a lot of coincidences

709
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,085
that have a common ingredient.

710
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:37,920
- What's that?

711
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:41,590
- You.

712
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:44,827
- Me?

713
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,632
What makes you think
I could hurt a fly?

714
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,773
- You're saying you're
not capable of murder?

715
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,311
- I guess anything's possible,

716
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,816
I'm just saying I wouldn't
hurt a fly, much less a person.

717
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,222
- All this is
conjecture, of course.

718
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:21,330
Circumstantial
evidence, at best.

719
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:29,238
But it all looks too
suspicious, don't you think?

720
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:45,888
Yeah?

721
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,291
When?

722
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:54,730
Okay, I'll be right there.

723
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,899
God damn it!

724
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,705
It seems there's been
another bizarre murder

725
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,074
on the other side of town.

726
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,544
Too far from here.

727
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,351
- Hey.

728
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,286
- What do you want?

729
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:57,058
- I'm sorry about last night,
I just couldn't get into it.

730
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,761
I'm not like you
guys in that way.

731
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,297
- You?

732
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,632
That's all you can
think about is you?

733
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,800
What about Georgie and Sam?

734
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,769
How about thinking about them?

735
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,837
- What about Georgie and Sam?

736
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,473
They got home okay, didn't they?

737
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,642
- No, they were
killed last night,

738
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,878
as part of this whole murder
spree that's been happening.

739
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,379
So that's what's
happened to them.

740
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,914
Why don't you get the fuck
out of your little hole

741
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,218
and try thinking about
somebody else for once!

742
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:23,919
- I'm so sorry.

743
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:26,654
It's all my fault.

744
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,527
- What?

745
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,628
- If I hadn't have let him out

746
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,998
none of this would've
ever happened.

747
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:37,766
Fuck!

748
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,305
I guess you reap what you sow.

749
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,375
- What the fuck are
you goin' on about?

750
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,278
Do you know who's
been doin' this shit?

751
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,648
- You pushed me and you pushed me

752
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,719
and you treated me like some
kind of human trash bin!

753
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,454
What was the result you
were all hoping for?

754
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,856
How did you think I would
handle all that abuse?

755
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,592
I couldn't stay quiet forever!

756
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:10,799
- You!

757
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,472
- You're dead.

758
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,974
So you're next.

759
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,543
- Cyril Bass.

760
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,712
You need to come with us!

761
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,080
Cuff him.

762
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,549
You have the right to
remain silent.

763
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,385
Get him!

764
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,155
God damn it!

765
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:35,791
- Cyril?

766
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,262
Cyril, your door was open.

767
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,269
Cyril, is that you?

768
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,040
Cyril, what's wrong?

769
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,778
Everybody's after me.

770
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,147
They think I'm the one who
killed all those people.

771
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,581
- What're you talking about?

772
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,917
- This cop, he came into my work

773
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,321
and he tried to arrest
me in front of everybody.

774
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,590
- Why would anybody
think you're a killer?

775
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,227
- My boss, your boyfriend,

776
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:18,633
my coworkers, that drug
dealer down the street.

777
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,869
- They're all just coincidences.

778
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,440
You couldn't hurt
a fly, I know you!

779
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,176
I'll tell them
that, I'll tell them

780
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,411
how sweet and kind
you are with me.

781
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,414
They wouldn't believe you!

782
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,084
- What makes you say that?

783
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,625
- Because I did kill all of them.

784
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,698
What, so now you're not
gonna vouch for me, huh?

785
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,467
- What are you?

786
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,402
- Someone you know very well.

787
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,670
- I know a lot of people

788
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,406
but I've never seen
anything like you!

789
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,375
- I got a dark side, you know.

790
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,843
I'm not all prim and proper.

791
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,211
I mean, just because I
was in the Boy Scouts

792
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,280
doesn't mean I can't
change a little.

793
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,122
Oh, she just falls in
the arms of any man.

794
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:18,259
I don't know if this is
gonna work out for ol' Cyril.

795
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,898
Tramp!

796
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,705
Hey.

797
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,241
- I don't know what you're doing

798
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,444
but if what they're saying
is true you better stay away!

799
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,312
- Okay, wait, wait,
wait, I can explain!

800
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,948
- Start talking, fast!

801
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,420
- It all started three days ago.

802
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,063
So the creature will
go for Derrick next.

803
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,101
And it will be tonight.

804
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:07,009
Listen, I need your
help to change this.

805
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,611
I need your help to save him.

806
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,048
To save me.

807
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,825
- Hello?

808
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,759
- Hey, it's Elisa.

809
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,862
- Oh, hello, what's up?

810
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,864
- Well, I heard what
happened in the hallway today

811
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,366
and I just wanna check,
see if you needed anything.

812
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:36,404
- No, I'm all right, I'm
just watchin' the game,

813
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,039
hangin' out in my jammies.

814
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,408
- In your jammies, huh?

815
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,443
So you're sure you
don't need anything?

816
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,513
- Well, I mean, I am alone,

817
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,815
a little company
wouldn't be so bad.

818
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,350
- What, me over there?

819
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,253
- Despite what you may think,
I really am a gentlemen so...

820
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,155
- Hmm.

821
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:55,723
I don't know.

822
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,326
- You know, just, just come over

823
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,961
and hang out for a little bit.

824
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,130
You know, you can take
off whenever you want.

825
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,200
I just need to
know that there are

826
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:10,771
some things in this world
still, you know, real.

827
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,140
- You're lucky I'm
feeling maternal today.

828
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,142
What's you address?

829
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:26,655
- Hello!

830
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,825
What the fuck is he doin' here?

831
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,362
Don't try anything, the
cops are right downstairs!

832
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,463
- How useful was that, really?

833
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,498
I made it up here.

834
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,433
- God, I can't believe you.

835
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:40,635
Are you apart of this, too?

836
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,169
- No!

837
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,007
I mean, I am now but there's
something you need to hear.

838
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:48,443
Just show him your back.

839
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:16,237
- So you see, I am responsible,

840
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,707
but I never had any control
over what's going on.

841
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,843
- What, am I just
supposed to believe you?

842
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:26,547
I mean, your fucked up back
could be some weird birth defect

843
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,683
- Oh, come on!
- or, or something!

844
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:29,618
Shit!

845
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:30,851
- If Cyril was the killer,

846
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,954
he would've done away
with both of us by now.

847
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:34,589
- How do you know he still won't?

848
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,124
- Because I'm not a killer!

849
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,598
I know that deep down inside

850
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,502
I had thoughts of hurting people

851
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,238
because of the
way I was treated,

852
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,745
but I was taught
to respect life.

853
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:07,222
I came to understand that
human nature can be cruel.

854
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:11,326
So I took those thoughts
and I packed 'em in.

855
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:18,266
They've decided they didn't
wanna be contained anymore.

856
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,337
I never had any control.

857
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,310
- Freeze, Bass, don't move!

858
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,112
You I didn't expect.

859
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,514
- What the fuck took you so long?

860
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,450
- I guess this should
close the case then, huh?

861
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,052
I knew it couldn't
be only one killer.

862
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,286
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait,

863
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,621
I didn't have anything
to do with the killings!

864
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,089
- Yeah, I'll see about that.

865
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,431
- Don't answer that.

866
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,503
- Shut up, all right, I'm had
enough of your freaky shit!

867
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,706
Who is it?

868
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,675
Police, neighbor called
us about a scream.

869
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,811
Is everything okay in there?

870
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:06,181
Nothin'
like a little extra back up!

871
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,520
- Oh fuck!

872
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:15,757
- Hello, Derrick!

873
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,231
Hold, hold it right there!

874
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,300
- Kill him!
- No!

875
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:33,542
- I think you got him.

876
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:36,477
I think that's police brutality.

877
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,613
I want my lawyer, piggy piggy!

878
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:01,837
- Help me!

879
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,482
- Where do you
think you're goin'?

880
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,752
- We're leaving and
you're not stopping us.

881
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,621
- What makes you
think you can do that?

882
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,490
- Inside you're still
connected to me.

883
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:29,264
If I say that I have no more
bad intentions towards Derrick,

884
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,533
you have to stop.

885
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,935
- I feel as you do.

886
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,507
But I do everything that
you can't go through with.

887
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,910
- We're leaving and I'm
going through with that.

888
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,548
- Oh, I don't think so.

889
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:07,469
What the hell?

890
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:16,710
- This is a place where
you can be yourself,

891
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,145
where you don't have to lie

892
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,881
or hide from those
true feelings.

893
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:21,983
- In the dream!

894
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,426
- What is it that you
want from all this?

895
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:37,765
- I'm not sure.

896
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:39,733
- That's not good enough.

897
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,635
- What're you doing with them?

898
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,304
- What do you want
to do with them?

899
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:44,572
- I don't want them here!

900
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,374
I want them back
where they belong!

901
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:51,712
- What rewards do you wish
when you give of yourself such?

902
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,415
- Can you just speak
in English, please?

903
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,188
- You think these people
really care about you?

904
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,024
- Why does it matter
what they think?

905
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,861
I like myself!

906
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,762
That's what's really important!

907
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:09,897
- Oh, really?

908
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,344
- I was so close to kicking
your ass right outta there!

909
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,479
It would've been so sweet.

910
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,081
I was never going to let you get

911
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,184
anywhere in the company, no way!

912
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,922
- Come on, the only way that

913
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,692
you could possibly
get to Callie!

914
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,996
Normally, she wouldn't even
give you a second glance.

915
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:45,232
In the end, it's the
package that counts!

916
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,034
- Shut up!

917
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:50,839
- Dude, you had somebody else
do you dirty work for you!

918
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:57,144
You can't even express your
feelings, you emotional retard!

919
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,515
- You little motherfucker!

920
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,952
I gave you a taste of the
life you could've never had!

921
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:08,055
You didn't have to kill
me if you didn't like it!

922
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,758
- I have nothing to say to you.

923
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:15,397
No, no!

924
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,868
- We're part of each other,
Cyril, we're the same!

925
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,073
You are.

926
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,812
That's the real you!

927
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:33,213
- You made me this way!

928
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:35,884
- No, I just opened up the door.

929
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,221
So what do you
wanna do with 'em?

930
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:18,826
- Let it course through
your body, Cyril.

931
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,694
Let it take hold!

932
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,307
One more, Cyril.

933
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:47,988
- Cyril!

934
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,625
What's going on?

935
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:53,861
- No!

936
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,148
I'm the boss of me!

937
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,999
You know what I like most
about that door you opened?

938
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,070
I can close it any
time I want to.

939
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,631
- Help!

940
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,166
Help!

941
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,001
Help!

942
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,106
- I got you, dude!

943
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:25,520
- I got it!

944
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:39,900
- You all right?

945
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,202
I feel okay.

946
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,339
Easy!

947
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,574
- What next?

948
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,343
- Live your life, man.

949
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,613
Consider yourself
lucky you got a chance

950
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,382
to correct a mistake.

951
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,785
- Yeah, I got some
things to think about.

952
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,088
- How do we explain all of this?

953
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,489
- Hell if I know.

954
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,826
- Derrick, you're the law guy.

955
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,462
What do you propose to do?

956
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,798
- It's gonna take some time.

957
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,047
- Hey.

958
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,783
So you're outta here, huh?

959
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:30,618
- Yeah.

960
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:36,090
Hey, man, I'm really
sorry about before.

961
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,093
- It's okay.

962
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:44,199
I knew you were possessed
that night anyway.
