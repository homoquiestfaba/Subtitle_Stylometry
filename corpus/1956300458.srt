1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,698
Guys, I'm telling you,
this is it.

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,439
This is, this is...
I've tried everything, okay?

3
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,311
This is my shining moment
as a father for you.

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:10,053
I've tried wrapping up
a pancake like a burrito

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,490
with syrup up on it,
but that gets way too messy.

6
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,753
I've tried taking a bite
of a pancake.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,975
Than just pouring syrup into my
mouth to get that right ratio.

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,195
That has not worked.

9
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:23,588
What I have found works
the best is you cut the center

10
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,461
out of the pancake, right?
You remove the center.

11
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,680
Then you pour syrup
into the center.

12
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,379
So that's gonna soak up that
syrup right in the middle,

13
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,381
and that's gonna be the best
part of the pancake.

14
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:36,166
Plus, what you've done
without even knowing it,

15
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,908
- is you've saved
the middle of the pancake...
- Uh, Dad?

16
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:42,216
- That's the greatest bite
in pancake history.
- Dad?

17
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:45,306
Dad, don't you have
to go to a show?

18
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,308
Figure out the tip.
Who's gonna do it?

19
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,831
I got it,
I got it.

20
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:52,226
Because I know for every $10,
you leave a $2 bill.

21
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,881
So this is $30,
so that's three $2 bills.

22
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:57,535
That's six money.

23
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,276
That's perfect, man.
That's actually a great way

24
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:01,017
to think about it.
Way to go.

25
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,934
Dad, don't forget
your passport.

26
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,892
All right, we gotta move.
Let's go.

27
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:15,727
Ladies
and gentlemen,

28
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,164
Chad Daniels!

29
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,564
Hi, everyone!

30
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,832
Hello! Hi!

31
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,052
I'm glad you're here.

32
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,794
This is, uh,
this is gonna be okay.

33
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,754
I want you to know that I know

34
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,974
that I don't look like
you thought I would.

35
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,457
Take it in.

36
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:50,893
I realize that.

37
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,547
My kids remind me
that I've gotten older

38
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,593
every day "comma" every day.

39
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,206
I dropped my son off
one time and he goes,

40
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,295
"God, you've aged
like a president."

41
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,564
And then my daughter goes:
"I was thinking guacamole."

42
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,610
So, you know, they're pretty
cool, right? Yeah, right.

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,834
I grew a beard, that can
make a guy look older.

44
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,401
But I grew a beard
for two reasons, number one...

45
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,707
Beards are like
sweatpants for your face.

46
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:27,538
Doesn't matter how chubby you're
getting when you're wearing one.

47
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,459
Man, I grew a beard
for a whole year.

48
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:36,939
And then shaved
it to the skin.

49
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,984
What an asshole.
Who does that?

50
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,334
I mean, just in one thing.

51
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,423
Dee, dee-dee,
dee-dee, dee-dee.

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,425
I looked in the mirror
and I was, like...
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

53
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:48,255
It was crazy.
What was I doing?

54
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,301
Just sat in my bathroom
all night going, "Ahh!"

55
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,912
Trying to push hair
out of my face.

56
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,914
But that's just
how you hurt your back.

57
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,269
The other reason
I grew a beard

58
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,358
is 'cause my 18-year-old
son challenged me

59
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,055
to a beard growing contest.

60
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:11,060
And, uh, he lost
because he is 18.

61
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,149
You ever seen
an 18-year-old's beard?

62
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,370
Oh, my God,
they're so gross.

63
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:19,155
It's like a Daddy Long Legs
just crawling out feet first.

64
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,420
Like a whisker up here
and a whisker over here.

65
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,074
I have a grandmother
that could beat this kid

66
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,859
in a beard growing contest.

67
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:30,297
Using only moles.

68
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,567
I think my son challenged me
to a beard growing contest

69
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,526
'cause pubic hair grew in
on other parts of his body,

70
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:43,919
and that grew in full.

71
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,140
'Cause that is how
pubic hair works.

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,753
Nobody has patchy pubes.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,886
Let me rephrase that.
I don't think anybody
has patchy pubes.

74
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,150
Some of you shut down
on that one, you're, like,

75
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,544
"Hey, buddy, right here!"

76
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:05,375
What are you doing
out of the house?

77
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,769
Just stay home and fix your
dick mange or whatever it's...

78
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,466
It's probably not
called that, but...

79
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,251
That's what
I'm gonna call it.

80
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:17,344
I have never seen pubic hair
on my son's body,

81
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,693
but I have for sure
seen it shaved off

82
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,347
of his body
onto my toilet seat.

83
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,829
You know where
my toilet seat is?

84
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,222
It's in my bathroom.
That's an easy one.

85
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,050
Everyone should've got that.

86
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,356
Do you know where
my bathroom is?

87
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,314
That is in my bedroom.

88
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:35,449
So that means he walked
through my bedroom...

89
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,320
And he's not allowed in there.

90
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,584
Because clothes go missing
and pillows get moved.

91
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,805
And I don't trust that.

92
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,111
A crooked pillow is a mystery
I don't wanna solve.

93
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,073
So that goes
in the garbage immediately.

94
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,819
I just picture him
straddling my toilet,

95
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:00,474
and I know, I know
he straddled it.

96
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,911
'Cause there are only
pubes on the back half
of the toilet seat.

97
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,610
If you have a better
theory, I'll listen,

98
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,743
but there isn't one,
that's the only way...

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,614
'Cause I know he wasn't
using painter's tape

100
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,442
and shit to, like,
straighten it out.

101
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,139
"Hold on, it's not even yet.

102
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,924
Let me get a laser level,
I got it."

103
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:22,452
Just over my toilet.

104
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,589
Like he's making a pair
of UGG boots.

105
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,591
Right, walking out
of my bathroom like,

106
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,375
"Fuck it, my dad'll
clean it up!"

107
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,338
"I'm 18, I don't try!"

108
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,078
Or, you know,
whatever kids say

109
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:43,473
when you're not around.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,041
The main problem I have with
these pubes on the toilet

111
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,305
is that during this story,
my kids live with me
Sunday to Wednesday.

112
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,568
They live with their mother
Wednesday to Sunday.

113
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:55,529
And he shaved his pubes
Wednesday before he went
to school.

114
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,183
That means he was not going
to be home for four days.

115
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,663
So I called the cell phone
when he was at school

116
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,622
to leave a message,
but he answered

117
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,101
'cause he's not
a good student.

118
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,934
And I said, "Hey, man,
found some pubes."

119
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:12,154
And he said, "Where?"

120
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:25,689
Which leads me to believe...

121
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,126
I have not found
all the pubes.

122
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,693
"What do you mean where?"

123
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,131
Why are there options
to this conversation?

124
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:36,134
Am I going to happen upon more
pubes later this afternoon?

125
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,006
Boy, I sure hope not.

126
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,356
'Cause I taught him how to prank
and I know he's real good at it.

127
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,490
I haven't checked,
but I bet you

128
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,884
there are pubes in my
sleeping bag right now.

129
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,669
'Cause that's a hard ass burn.

130
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,106
Nobody naps when
they're camping.

131
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,803
The first time you get in that
bag, the food is in the tree

132
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,457
and the fire's out
and you're, like,

133
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,286
"Oh, I can't wait to get some...
Oh, those are pubes."

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,898
You got me.

135
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,384
So I said, "Hey, man, why'd you
shave the pubes at my house?"

136
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,169
And he goes, "'Cause Mom's
not there to yell at me."

137
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,085
And I said, "That is
the dumbest answer
I've ever heard.

138
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,740
So get back here after school
and clean these up."

139
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,003
And he said, "I'm sorry,
Father, but according

140
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,397
to the custody agreement,
I'm at Mother's now."

141
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,010
And I know that was meant
to make me mad, but it didn't.

142
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:30,319
I was thrilled he used
two three-syllable words
in one sentence.

143
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:33,540
'Cause I have watched him walk
into a wall during the daytime.

144
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,153
Natural sunlight,
guiding his way

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,243
and just still... thunk.

146
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,375
So I waited till Sunday,
and he came to my house,

147
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,116
and I said, "Hey, man,
come give me a hug."

148
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,814
And he came to give me a hug
like this and when he did,

149
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,642
I spun him around and I
put him in a full nelson.

150
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,208
And I walked him up the stairs,

151
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,297
and I walked him
into my bathroom.

152
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,821
And I bent him over
the toilet like I was rubbing

153
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,910
a dog's nose in its own shit.

154
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,092
'Cause the pubes
were still there.

155
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,834
They're not mine.
I'm not cleaning those off.

156
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,401
I walked downstairs
in my own home

157
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,622
for four straight days
to use the bathroom

158
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,366
'cause I am committed
to parenting.

159
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,373
So... So I have him
bent over the toilet,

160
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,157
and he starts making
the weirdest noises.

161
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,639
He started going...
like that.

162
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,989
And I panicked a little bit
'cause when he was two,
he had asthma.

163
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,296
When he was seven, it went
away because of a nebulizer.

164
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,951
And I thought, "Oh my God,
did I give my kid back asthma?

165
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,736
But I didn't.

166
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,695
Turns out, he was just
blowing pube dust...

167
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,437
to create a clean
breathing area.

168
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:53,358
Once I figured that out,
I could not stop laughing.

169
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:57,232
Because I'd come to the
realization, my son is pubic
hair waterboarding himself.

170
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,543
And that hits the spot.

171
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,720
I was laughing so hard,
my grip loosened.

172
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,199
He finally wiggles around
aneurysm he goes,

173
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:11,202
"Why are you doing
this to me?!"

174
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,639
I said, "'Cause your
mom's not here

175
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,859
to yell at me anymore either.

176
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,083
Thank you.

177
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,871
I used to have a story

178
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,308
about when my son turned 18,

179
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,267
I was gonna punch
him in the face.

180
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,708
He's 18 now.

181
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,319
On his birthday,
I got up, uh...

182
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:44,322
I got up early.
I set my alarm.

183
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,935
And I went downstairs, and
I made myself a good breakfast.

184
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,937
And then I heard him getting up.

185
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:53,375
And I go, here we go.

186
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,246
It's game time.

187
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,466
My heart started racing.

188
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,120
My hands got sweaty.

189
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,817
Mom's spaghetti.

190
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,873
So dumb.

191
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,617
Oh, God.

192
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,794
Ahh...

193
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,447
I started giving
myself a pep talk.

194
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,842
I was, like, "You can punch him.
He's 18, you can do this.

195
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,889
"Because you did not spank him
and these are all the spankings

196
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,674
that he should have
coming to him."

197
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,458
And then I heard him
coming down the stairs.

198
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,286
So I started walking towards
the bottom of the staircase.

199
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,201
And then he turned the corner.

200
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,334
And I just saw a little boy
walking towards me.

201
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,162
And I was, like, you can't
punch this little boy.

202
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,903
But here's what you can do.

203
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,949
You can put a hockey helmet
on him and hockey gloves.

204
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,647
And then you can
put those on as well

205
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,214
and we can go in the back yard
and we can locker box.

206
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,738
So that's what we did.

207
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,002
And I kept hitting him
in the shoulder.

208
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,047
And he goes, "It doesn't even
hurt, what are you doing?"

209
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,136
And I was, like,
"All right, just wait."

210
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,445
And in the third,
he could not lift his hands up

211
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,316
to protect his face.

212
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:11,801
That's old man knowledge.

213
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,411
President style.

214
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,028
After we locker boxed,
I went inside,

215
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,812
and I checked my social media
and there were over

216
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,163
1,000 messages asking if I'd
punched my son in the face.

217
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:31,647
Happy birthday.

218
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:34,258
That's the kind of world
we live in, I guess.

219
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,260
So I replied to all these
messages, I said, uh...

220
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,958
"Nah, I couldn't punch
him in the face.

221
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,786
"I didn't think
it'd be fair to him.

222
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,092
So instead we went in the back
yard and we locker boxed."

223
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,225
And then I put my phone away.

224
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,575
And then 24 hours later,
I checked and I had a message

225
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,272
from a man in
Little Rock, Arkansas,

226
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,623
and he had replied back
to me with a picture

227
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,582
of Urban Dictionary's

228
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:57,064
definition of locker box.

229
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,979
And I would like to tell you...

230
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,724
That it is not
what I thought.

231
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:13,036
Urban Dictionary's
definition of locker box

232
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,082
is when you're having
sex with someone,

233
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,519
you also shove
your nuts into them.

234
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,146
I mean,
where do you even start?

235
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:43,414
Do people do that?
And if so, how?
How do you do that?

236
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,548
The only thing I know
about that sexual position

237
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,899
is you probably need
the lights on.

238
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:54,556
That does not seem like a feel
around job to finish it.

239
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,036
Oh my God.

240
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,521
So anyways, I sent
over 1,000 people...

241
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:10,790
a message from
my home computer.

242
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:14,794
That said "Nah, man, I didn't
punch him in the face."

243
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:25,805
You know, 'cause that
wouldn't be fair.

244
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,335
Instead,

245
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,293
I brought him in the back yard.

246
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,559
And I put my balls up there.

247
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,177
For, like, a week,
I was nervous

248
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,309
that the green light on my
computer was gonna come on

249
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,355
on the camera and it would
just be the Feds, like,

250
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,139
what else is going
on over there?

251
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,271
All right.

252
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,406
My son no longer lives with me.

253
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:10,327
Not 'cause of locker boxing
or whatever, but...

254
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,156
He, uh, he went to one semester
of college and didn't like it.

255
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,115
And, uh, I get that.
I didn't like college either.

256
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,117
So that's fair for me.

257
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,901
But he also didn't
wanna get a job.

258
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:22,687
And that's where I drew the line
'cause I just, I just can't.

259
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,515
So, uh, I let him go
through the holidays.

260
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,300
We did all that stuff,
hung out a lot.

261
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,217
And then January 1st,
you owe me $400 rent.

262
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:33,176
And then, um, if you don't
have a job by February 1st,

263
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,743
I'm going to kick you out.

264
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,527
If you do have a job
by February 1st,

265
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:39,356
I'm gonna give you
200 of that 400 back,

266
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,837
and we're gonna call that
a happy father rebate.

267
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,017
And then if you have a job,
the first of every month,

268
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,106
you're gonna pay me $200 rent
for the rest of time

269
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,586
until I kick you out
permanently.

270
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,241
And he goes, "200?

271
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,678
What about 150
and I buy my own milk?"

272
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,212
Who in the fuck
drinks $50 worth

273
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,128
of milk in a year?

274
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,478
Are you having bone problems?
What's going on?

275
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:20,049
That's probably why
he can't find a job.

276
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,356
He's a horrible negotiator.

277
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,228
We'll give you $17 an hour.

278
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,404
What about 16?
And I'll drive myself here.

279
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,759
Well, you would be expected...
14!

280
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,763
Okay, we're no longer hiring.

281
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,856
The first month my son left,

282
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,120
my electric bill went down $80.

283
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,383
That's a lot.

284
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,862
Wanna know why?
'Cause his hobby

285
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,691
is leaving my lights on.

286
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:58,479
It's like a passion
project for him.

287
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,133
He wears a Fitbit
around his wrist,

288
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,309
and I bet you, he gets
10,000 steps a day

289
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,355
just turning
my goddamn lights on.

290
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,445
All around the house.
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

291
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,143
"Ooh, that's a lot
of green, all right."

292
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,971
Boing, boing, boing.

293
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,455
I know all my lights
are on at all times

294
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,849
because I live in a place where
a lot of people like to hunt.

295
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,677
Where my friends will get up
early at 4:00 in the morning

296
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,722
and they'll drive out to hunt
and they'll go by my house.

297
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,768
And then they'll call me
and say, "Hey, are you home?"

298
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,204
I go, "No, why?"

299
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,077
"Well, 'cause all
your lights are on."

300
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,341
Well, which ones?
Yeah, all of 'em.

301
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:38,084
Porch to garage, buddy.
Porch to garage.

302
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,481
And you wanna know
why they're on?

303
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:47,180
'Cause my son's scared
when he's there by himself.

304
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:50,183
That's the only logical reason.

305
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,837
He's tough, I mean, he, like,
wanted to live there, right?

306
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,187
He didn't live with,
he doesn't live with me

307
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,102
full time at that point,
you know?

308
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,626
Because he loves me
more than his mom, no.

309
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:01,237
Because he wanted the freedom
when I was on the road working.

310
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,239
"I'm tough.
I'm gonna live
at my dad's house.

311
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,763
"When he's gone,
it's gonna be my house.

312
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,288
'Cause I'm tough."

313
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,205
Until the wind blows a tree and
the branch scratches the house.

314
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,468
Boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing!

315
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,601
Just the steps.
Brr...

316
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,603
Operation Sunshine.

317
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,955
And still
runnin' into walls.

318
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,658
I also have a 14-year-old
daughter, and I gave her

319
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:33,487
a chore list with three
words on it, and she goes,

320
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,271
"Where's your chore list?"

321
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,756
You ever had a kid say something
to you and they're serious

322
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,498
but then you almost
ruin it 'cause you laugh?

323
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,935
That's what I was almost like,
"Oh God, what?"

324
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,458
And I just go,
"What did you say?"

325
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:52,506
And she goes,
"Where's your chore..."

326
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,682
She slowed it down,
like, I didn't...

327
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,640
Like, I actually didn't
hear her, you know?

328
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,255
So I said, "You know,
everything that happens

329
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:03,952
"in this house to make
this home operate.

330
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,215
"The three things
I ask you to do

331
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:09,262
"and that is my chore list.

332
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,394
"Remember when you woke up in
a bed, warm, and not hungry?

333
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:14,615
"Fuckin' check, check, check!

334
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:17,661
I did that shit."

335
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,973
I said, "My chore list also
has three words on it,

336
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,628
and it says 'keep her alive.'"

337
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:31,849
And it expires
in four years so focus.

338
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,120
She's 14 now.
When she was 12,

339
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:45,036
I started listening
to podcasts about periods.

340
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,908
And I know that seems creepy.

341
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:49,780
I'm positive I'm on
a list somewhere.

342
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,568
But I never wanted to be
the dad that had to send her

343
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,744
to her mom to ask her
all those questions.

344
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,225
I don't wanna, you know, like,
"That's a question for your mom.

345
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,618
You know where to find me
if you wanna play catch."

346
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:05,013
I mean, it's, like,
ridiculous, right?

347
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,408
So...

348
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,975
I, uh, I was listening to these
podcasts, but I had to stop

349
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:14,283
because one of them
kind of creeped me out.

350
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,937
It said "If you're
gonna show your daughter

351
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:19,593
how to use a tampon,
you push it into your hand."

352
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,986
And then, so, I was, like, well,
yeah, my hand's been a vagina.

353
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,423
Okay, that makes sense.

354
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:28,428
Sure.

355
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,821
If you're looking for a number
you're not gonna get it.

356
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,304
Justknow that it has been.

357
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,828
But then I pictured myself
pushing a tampon into my hand.

358
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:41,180
And, oh, my God, it just
looks like a magic trick.

359
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,834
Does it not?
Just, like, ay...

360
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,403
Whoa... Ah-ha-ha-ha!

361
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,846
Where's the tampon?!

362
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,938
You better find it
'cause toxic shock is real.

363
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,086
My daughter got her period
in my house for the first time.

364
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,696
And she came downstairs
and she goes,

365
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,656
"Uh, Dad, two things.
Number one, got my period.

366
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,659
Number two, don't wanna
talk about it."

367
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,878
And I was, like,
"Number one, great.

368
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,054
Number two, greater."

369
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,842
And she said, "I have
to go to Mom's house

370
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,757
'cause she bought
me some stuff."

371
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,237
And I said, "I don't know
if you've heard about

372
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,934
"the new legislation
that was just passed

373
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,067
but dads are now
allowed to buy things."

374
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,463
They're letting us
out of the house.

375
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,160
So I said come upstairs.
And we went upstairs

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,945
and I opened the closet
next to the laundry room.

377
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,426
And in there was one box

378
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:56,690
of all of the each...

379
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,914
I had all the kinds.

380
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,874
All, every box
that they make.

381
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,702
Or at least that
were at the store.

382
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,399
'Cause I got there and I was,
like, "Oh, that's different.

383
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,227
All right, oh,
that's different, too."

384
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,664
And I got all of 'em.

385
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,406
And that cost $217
where I live.

386
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:28,591
And I said, "Whatever you need
for this is gonna be in here."

387
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,158
'Cause that is every kind.

388
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,944
They don't make
any more than that.

389
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:36,425
If you need something
that isn't in there,

390
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,514
sorry about your square vagina.

391
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:50,439
And in that case, we are
gonna have to call your mom.

392
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,356
'Cause she's way better
at making appointments.

393
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,843
And then she just goes,
"God, you're so dumb!"

394
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,759
And she grabbed the box
and goes, "It's right here,
I know what I need."

395
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,370
And then she left.

396
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,198
I don't have anything to do
so I brought back

397
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,853
$211 worth of tampons.

398
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,248
That is an interesting exchange.

399
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,776
There were so many boxes left,
and you can't carry 'em in

400
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,778
'cause they're all
individual boxes.

401
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,476
So I had to walk into Target,
get an empty cart

402
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,957
and just walk out
with an empty cart.

403
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,263
And people were, like, is
this bitch stealing a cart?

404
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,396
What is going on?

405
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,224
So then I loaded it up
with all the tampons

406
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,747
and I brought it back in.

407
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,706
And I brought it
to the exchange counter.

408
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,099
And the guy goes, uh,
"You checkin' out?"

409
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,014
And I go, "Hmm, checkin' in."

410
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,762
And he looked at my cart.

411
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,635
And he looked at me
and he just goes,

412
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,201
"I mean, what happened?"

413
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:11,302
That is a reasonable question.

414
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,652
But I didn't know
I was gonna get asked.

415
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,349
So I panicked and I just went,

416
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,133
"Uh, she said pancake mix."

417
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,583
If we could get this done,
everybody's real hungry
at the house.

418
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:44,161
In my opinion,
it is harder raising

419
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,294
a 14-year-old daughter
and an 18-year-old son

420
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:48,035
than when they were little,
'cause when they were little,

421
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,732
I could give them
all the same rules.

422
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,212
I could sit them down
on the couch and both of them,

423
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,606
I could say, "Hey, don't
break anything.

424
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:54,998
"Don't drink
my chocolate milk.

425
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,436
And go outside
till it's dark."

426
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,698
Right? And they'd go,
"All right, Dad."

427
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,395
And that was it.

428
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,179
But now I can't do that.
I have to give them

429
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,486
individual rules, and it takes
longer and I don't like it.

430
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,619
I don't think...
Well, I also don't
think it's fair, right?

431
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,838
I have to tell my daughter,
"Oh, you're going to a party?

432
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,841
"Okay, well, keep your
water bottle close to you.
And keep the cap on.

433
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,669
"And, uh, you know, don't...
If you're gonna play
hide-and-seek

434
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,279
"please don't run into
the woods with four boys

435
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,064
"even if they're your friends,
'cause people could

436
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:21,460
start talking and then
that's not gonna be great."

437
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,462
I don't have to tell
that to my son.

438
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,115
"Hey, if you're going
to a party, please don't run

439
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,117
"into the woods with four
girls, 'cause people could

440
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,119
start talking and then they're
gonna think you're awesome."

441
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,647
It's a really weird double
standard that I don't like.

442
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:36,779
I tell my daughter a ton of
stuff when she leaves the house.

443
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,303
You know what I tell my son?
"Drive safe, don't rape!"

444
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,566
That's it.

445
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,832
That is it.

446
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,399
That is every single thing
I want him to know.

447
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,969
And some of you might be, like,
"You can't say rape, Chad."

448
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:56,016
Well, you sure can if you
say "don't" in front of it.

449
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,757
Yeah, that's, like,
the number one time

450
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,193
they want you saying it,
I'm pretty sure.

451
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,766
One time a guy after a show
honestly asked me.

452
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,289
He goes, "Why would you
tell your son

453
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,986
drive safe, don't rape?"

454
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,901
And I just was like,
"I really did think

455
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,381
that was self-explanatory."

456
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,386
But if you're looking
for an answer, here it is.

457
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:21,084
I want him to arrive safely,

458
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,609
and then when he does,
to not rape anyone.

459
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,787
I don't think he's going to,

460
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:30,703
but it doesn't hurt
to remind people

461
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,357
of big things.

462
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:36,056
Drive safe.
Don't rape.

463
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:39,189
That's four words.
They're all one syllable.

464
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,237
Sounds like a caveman.

465
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,413
Drive safe, don't rape!

466
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,767
And that works well
for 18-year-old boys,

467
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:55,118
'cause they are cavemen.

468
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,772
"Drive safe, don't rape!"

469
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,517
"Me!"

470
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,041
Yeah, you, buddy.

471
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,567
You for sure.
But everybody, everybody.

472
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,439
"Him too!"

473
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:14,790
Him too and me
drive safe, don't rape!"

474
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,358
There you go!

475
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,186
Good.

476
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,712
Good.

477
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,719
"Okay, Dad!

478
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,939
"Me got it!

479
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,767
Fire good!"

480
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,813
Yep, fire is good.

481
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,121
"Fire good, rape bad!"

482
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,080
Isaac smart.

483
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,474
Isaac smart.

484
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,394
I'm gonna start saying that
everywhere I go.

485
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,830
I mean, not like a caveman,

486
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,006
'cause that would creep
people out, of course.

487
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:58,704
You can't walk down
the street,

488
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,968
"Drive safe,
don't rape!"

489
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,492
Everyone would be like,
"Oh, he lost his chaperone."

490
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,509
I think it's a good message.

491
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:24,904
I think guys should say it
to guys all the time.

492
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,340
I don't think there's
any harm in it.

493
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:27,733
Plus, you're gonna learn
a lot about someone

494
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,126
that you say it to... right?

495
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,650
And here's your change.
Have a great day.

496
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:35,044
Thank you so much.
Don't rape.

497
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:38,047
"Why would you say
don't rape to me?"

498
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,614
If that every happens to you,

499
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,791
you are face to face
with a rapist.

500
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:46,447
'Cause why else would you
freak out that much?

501
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,539
I thought about it.

502
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,193
If I was walking down
the street and somebody goes,
"Hey, man, don't rape,"

503
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,760
I'd be like, "Oh, my God,
I was just thinking that.

504
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:58,589
Thank you.
You, too."

505
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,642
I've also told my son

506
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,949
that if he's on a date
and it's not going well

507
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,733
and he doesn't want
a second date,

508
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,083
but the girl wants to kiss him
at the end of that date,

509
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,695
well, just don't,
'cause that's gonna be

510
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,914
a real awkward situation
later on.

511
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,656
It's gonna be awkward for sure
in those five minutes.

512
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,354
But that's okay.
That's five minutes.

513
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,095
You don't wanna have
that shit go on forever.

514
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,706
And if you don't believe me,
why don't you call Aziz.

515
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:30,056
See what he thinks about it.

516
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,717
That come out of the mic wrong?
What happened?

517
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,899
Aziz got in trouble.

518
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,945
For having a bad date.

519
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,251
He's a famous comedian,

520
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,861
for those of you
that don't know.

521
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:55,298
And there was a girl
that he went on a date with,

522
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,909
and he wanted to
have sex with that girl,

523
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,259
and she wanted
a famous boyfriend,

524
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:03,437
and neither of that worked.

525
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,221
There's so much dumb

526
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:08,268
on both sides of this story

527
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:10,749
it is mind-blowing to me.

528
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:12,315
For those of you
that never read the article,

529
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,882
here's what happened.

530
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,492
They got home from dinner.

531
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,451
She sat
on his kitchen counter,

532
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,889
and then they both agreed
that he was going to put

533
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:24,023
his "this part"
on her "this part."

534
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:29,811
Immediately
when they got home.

535
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:32,031
It's like a kid hitting
a ball at Little League

536
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,380
and running
right to third.

537
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:44,608
I mean, yeah, it's adorable,

538
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,393
but there are rules here.

539
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:53,617
Then they both agreed
that she was going to put

540
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:57,404
her "this part"
on his "this part" two times.

541
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,495
Gentlemen, I think
we can all agree

542
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:02,888
that no means no
every single time.

543
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,020
But what about "uh-huh"?
Even then, for sure.

544
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,116
But then, ladies,
you also have to agree,

545
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,596
that no one can
hear you say no

546
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,380
when you voluntarily put
their dick in your mouth

547
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,295
two times.

548
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,088
In the article,
she was quoted as saying,

549
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:32,091
"He wasn't getting
my nonverbal cues."

550
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,527
Well, where I'm from,
sucking a dick

551
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,833
is not a good one.

552
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:46,932
"I'm not having any fun!
Nyah-nyah!"

553
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,108
I mean, that is not
how you call Uber.

554
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,545
Everybody knows that.
Everyone knows.

555
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,590
It's an app.

556
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:07,039
The reason I bring this up
is because I think sometimes

557
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,476
we shift the spotlight from
where it needs to be, right?

558
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,217
My daughter's 14.

559
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:13,175
I'd like to have this shit
figured out in four years.

560
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:14,568
We do, we shift it.

561
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,526
The Me Too movement
is super serious.

562
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,963
Have you read
some of the stories?

563
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,965
They're gut-wrenching
and heartbreaking.

564
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,532
And then there are some where
it's just like, "All right."

565
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,187
There's a lady from Michigan
who got her ass grabbed

566
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,886
by President Bush, Sr.
27 years ago,

567
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,800
and that was
her "Me Too" story.

568
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,106
And, like, you read
the other ones,

569
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:32,325
and you're like,
"How are you limping in

570
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:35,328
with this bullshit?"

571
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,417
He didn't finger
your asshole.

572
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,901
And I want to be very,
very clear about something.

573
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,077
In no way am I blaming
this woman,

574
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:48,819
but I feel like all of us
learn at a very young age

575
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,778
to not stand in front
of an old man

576
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:55,130
for an reason at all.

577
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:59,308
They are
the grossest things...

578
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:02,921
Not people, things...
on the whole planet.

579
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:08,404
It goes old men,
monkeys, seaweed.

580
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,798
Those are the top three
grossest things

581
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,365
on the whole planet Earth.

582
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,367
Monkeys throw shit at you.

583
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:17,631
Yeah, that's an easy
number two, I get it.

584
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:20,329
Seaweed messes with you
when you're swimming.

585
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,941
Buh-duh-luddle-uh!
You don't know what it is.

586
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,681
You can't see underwater.

587
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,471
Old men do both
of those things.

588
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:40,741
An old man will throw
shit up into the air

589
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,526
so you look at it just so
he can give you a wet willy.

590
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:48,488
They're the creepiest
things ever.

591
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:50,403
Have you swam
with an old man?

592
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,755
It's always just like...

593
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:58,977
Like their tits floating
on top of the water.

594
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,588
Like an oil spoil.
Like when you make a pancake.

595
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,068
You know what I'm talking?
How it spreads out?

596
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,765
Just...

597
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,462
I'd rather get eaten
by a shark at that point.

598
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,247
That's re...

599
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:14,166
Now, some people may think,

600
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,037
"Chad, you just think
this way 'cause you're a man."

601
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,778
Well, that has to be
part of it.

602
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:21,956
My brain has been connected
to a dick for quite a while.

603
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,697
But I believe that
all of our lenses

604
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,916
are tinted from several
different things.

605
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,876
I was also raised by
a very strong single mother,

606
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,748
and so I watched her operate
in different situations,

607
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,141
and that's what I learned.

608
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,751
If my mom would've
got her ass grabbed

609
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:37,145
by anyone, doesn't matter
if it's a president,

610
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,582
she wouldn't have
went away for 27 years.

611
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,323
She would've done one
of two things immediately.

612
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,716
She would've either
turned around and said,

613
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,674
"Do it again and I'm
gonna break your hand."

614
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,502
Or she would've just yelled,

615
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:50,419
"This piece of shit
just grabbed my ass!"

616
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,815
And... yeah.

617
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,427
I don't know
if you know this,

618
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,082
but that's how
you end a picnic.

619
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,954
And my sister and I would've
been just cowering in the car.

620
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,957
Like, "Oh, man, we should
clean the house when we
get home,

621
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,829
"uh, you know,
'cause she's pretty mad.

622
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,352
"Did you see what happened?
I didn't even see it.

623
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,615
But there was an old guy,
so probably him."

624
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,102
I live in the same
small town where I grew up,

625
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,278
and nobody likes me
from a long time ago.

626
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:34,159
And I know that sounds sad,
but it's pretty freeing,

627
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,899
'cause I can say
whatever I want

628
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,814
and I'm not gonna
lose friends.

629
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,078
I'm there.

630
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,862
I was at a small cafe,
and a woman was reading

631
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,429
the article about
the lady from Michigan,

632
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,561
and she said,
"Can you believe this?"

633
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:49,043
And I said, "That they would
waste that much ink on that?

634
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,610
No, I can't."

635
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,133
And then everyone
turned their chair

636
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,004
to look at both of us,

637
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,919
like we were gonna
locker box or something.

638
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,756
And she said,
"I will have you know

639
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:09,977
a female American president
would never grab an ass."

640
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,544
And I said, "Well,
neither would a unicorn,

641
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,546
'cause neither
of them exist."

642
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:19,639
You can get as mad
as you want,

643
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,641
but you can't do
an experiment

644
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,644
with a group that doesn't have
any fuckin' people in it.

645
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,131
I thought she had it locked.

646
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,090
She wears pantsuits
on purpose.

647
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,701
What a great
presidential candidate.

648
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:42,227
But 45% of people
that look just like her

649
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:46,318
said, "Eh, maybe next time."

650
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,015
You wanna know why?

651
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:50,322
'Cause women don't get along.

652
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,845
And I know
there's this movement.

653
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:55,240
"Yes, we do."
But you don't.

654
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:57,416
You're at the movement
with a picket sign

655
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,809
and you have the same one,
you're like, "Oh, fuck this!"

656
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,464
I mean... it's...

657
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,118
Heh!

658
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,428
And that's sad to me, 'cause
you're easily the better

659
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:10,907
of the two sexes.

660
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:12,605
You should own everything,

661
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,955
but you're busy bickering
your way to second place.

662
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:17,175
It's crazy to me!

663
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,789
A man could punch a man
in the face

664
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,792
and have a beer with that
same man five minutes later.

665
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:29,056
A lady could hear some shit
she maybe thought was about her

666
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:31,450
and hate that bitch
till she dies.

667
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,017
It's crazy, you guys.

668
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:40,589
Why are you doing that?

669
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,898
Here's my theory.

670
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,465
I feel like
you don't get along

671
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,641
because you've been
pit against one another

672
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,077
since you were little kids.

673
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,644
Right, you're
doing to school.

674
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,080
"Oh, you better get
all cute and get pigtails

675
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,821
"so you can find a boy.

676
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,214
You don't wanna be
an old maid."

677
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,563
Right, that's crazy

678
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,695
that you had to
listen to that shit.

679
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,871
How is the human species

680
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:05,223
the only species where
women have to look nice?

681
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,920
Have you seen nature?

682
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,708
Have you seen
a beautiful peacock?

683
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,884
That's a dude.

684
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,756
That's a dude peacock!

685
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:20,063
Just, "Ha ha!
Look what I got!"

686
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,935
You've ever seen
a female peacock?

687
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,676
Fucking gross.
They're like--

688
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,547
They're gray.

689
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,202
They're gray
and just slothy.

690
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,989
But they have a vagina,

691
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:37,080
so they win the whole thing.

692
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,909
Women, you should not ever
have to put on makeup.

693
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,216
You should be ale to walk
into a bar and just go,

694
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,826
"I'll be in the car."

695
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,789
That's bonkers.

696
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,538
I also think it would be nice

697
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,235
if we could all have
the same rules.

698
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,629
Let's make a big rule book
that everybody agrees on.

699
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,761
I think being
an individual is amazing

700
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,372
and what makes
the planet great.

701
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,070
However, everyone has
their own rules.

702
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:11,854
and you can't get to know
someone in a day

703
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,378
for all their rules, right?

704
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,467
So, I have a friend
on Facebook,

705
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,644
and she posted, "Am I ever
going to be able to go to a bar

706
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,951
by myself and not have
a man ask if I'm okay?"

707
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:25,085
And no is the answer.

708
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,566
And that sucks,
but it worked once.

709
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,742
I don't know when.
Let's say the '40s

710
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,180
There was a drinking a drink
all by herself in the bar,

711
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:36,009
and a man walked in
and he goes, "Are you okay?"

712
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,926
And then they had sex,
and he told everyone
he'd ever met.

713
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,754
And that story's
been passed down

714
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,886
from generation
to generation.

715
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,019
Little boys are walking home
from their grandfather's
homes like,

716
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:50,023
"Ask if she's okay!
Ask if she's okay!
Ask if she's okay!"

717
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,677
Because we're
simple creatures.

718
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:53,592
We go with what works.

719
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,289
In seventh grade,
a teacher told me

720
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:56,595
I look nice in sweaters.

721
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,684
Well, here we are.

722
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:12,959
Well, some of you
like me again.

723
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:15,265
That's good.
Welcome back.

724
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,922
Welcome back.

725
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,708
I try to stay out of
the rest of the politics

726
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,884
because it's...
it's too demanding, right?

727
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,539
And I like to sleep, so...

728
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,236
"Hey, Chad,
did you hear about..."

729
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:31,630
"No, I didn't.
Good night."

730
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,806
That's like my new move.

731
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,332
I do think politics divides us
and makes us softer,

732
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:43,119
because, I mean, people are
so fake taken aback when it
comes to every opinion.

733
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:46,122
They're like, "I don't
want my friend to think
that I think this

734
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,386
and they don't think that,
and everybody... Oh, my God!"

735
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,909
I'm surprised we haven't
changed our national anthem

736
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,954
to... .

737
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,053
I know we're getting
soft as a country,

738
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,490
'cause one time
I heard a guy go,

739
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,709
"If I could just be half
the man my father was."

740
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,973
Well, you are.
That's how genetics works.

741
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,324
You're also half the woman
your mom was,

742
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,761
and you're acting
like her now,

743
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,154
so get your shit together.

744
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,635
And I'll tell you this,
I don't even like that joke.

745
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,332
I just like to watch
some of the women laugh

746
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,812
and some of the women
not laugh

747
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:26,119
'cause it proves
you don't get along!

748
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:28,251
It's crazy!
It's...

749
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:31,298
I just said it, and you're
back on track already!

750
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,265
All right.

751
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,311
I think we're getting
softer as a country.

752
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,140
People say "sorry" all the time
when they don't need to.

753
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,489
Right, you ever
been bumped into

754
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:49,969
and somebody goes,
"Oh, sorry!"

755
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,275
Yeah, for what?
You just barely
bumped into me.

756
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:55,365
Have you been planning this
for two weeks?

757
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,237
'Cause then an apology
is necessary.

758
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:00,240
But this seems like
an "excuse me" moment, right?

759
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,633
Like, what are you gonna say

760
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,810
when someone
important to me dies?

761
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,899
Like, "Oh, I'm so sorry."

762
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,335
Same way like when you
bumped into me?

763
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,645
I went into Starbucks once.

764
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:14,907
I go, "Hey, man,
are you in line?"

765
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,256
The guy goes,
"Yeah, I am, sorry."

766
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,301
Yeah, for what?
Getting here faster?

767
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:21,043
So I stood
right in front of him.

768
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,089
And he goes,
"Hey, man, I am in line."

769
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,918
I go, "Yeah,
but you're sorry, so...

770
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,747
just tying to help
with the guilt."

771
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,579
My daughter says
sorry nonstop.

772
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,015
My daughter will say
sorry three times

773
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:37,799
for the same thing.

774
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,019
And now you're just
being an asshole.

775
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,411
Sorry once.

776
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,109
You can't keep doing it
and think "sorry" is

777
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,502
gonna get you off the hook.

778
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:45,894
So I have a swear jar
in my house.

779
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,722
That costs you a quarter.

780
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,333
I have a sorry jar.
That one costs you a dollar.

781
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,683
What's the lesson there?

782
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,293
Call your dad
a piece of shit.

783
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,338
Just don't apologize for it.

784
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:04,391
'Cause that is a 400% markup.

785
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:07,263
My home is also filled
with hyperbole because
of my daughter.

786
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,484
Everything is "the best"
or "the worst."

787
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,661
Or "the funniest."

788
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:17,012
And can I tell you something?
It never is.

789
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,666
You know something's
gonna be real funny

790
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:20,886
when someone laughs all
the way through it, right?

791
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,105
"Dad, you're not gonna believe,
It's the funniest thing
that ever happened to me!

792
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,324
"Oh, my God, it's
the funniest thing I've
ever seen in my whole life!

793
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,847
Oh, my God,
please, Dad!"

794
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:30,722
Okay, let's hear it.

795
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,419
"There was a girl
running through the hall,

796
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,421
"and her shoe fell off,
and it was the funniest thing

797
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:36,336
I've ever seen in my whole
life, oh, Dad, please!"

798
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,903
When either one of my kids
tells me stories,

799
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,427
my face must
just glaze over.

800
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,864
'Cause all I am thinking
is how in the world

801
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:46,085
do some people have sex
with their own children?

802
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:49,436
Does that make sense to
anyone else in this room?

803
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:53,353
How does a human brain
allow that kind of shit

804
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,528
to take place?

805
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,661
I am so utterly turned off

806
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,752
by both of my kids
in every single way.

807
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,797
And by the way, if you're
not laughing right now,

808
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:04,582
you're the creepiest
person in this room.

809
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:09,891
'Cause that is easily
as anti-kid-touching

810
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:12,633
as it gets.

811
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,896
I said,
"How in the world..."

812
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:18,117
You know, Earth, the world,
the whole one...

813
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:22,600
Do some people have sex
with their own children,

814
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,123
and some of you
went, "Un-uh."

815
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:33,001
I'm protected,
Second Amendment.

816
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:38,485
Everybody knows you can't
change an amendment, Chad,

817
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:41,401
'cause amend means...
All right, hold on.

818
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:52,020
That's how I'm gonna
start choosing hotels
when I'm on the road.

819
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:53,456
I'm gonna walk into
a lobby and be like,

820
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:54,849
"How in the world
do some people

821
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,372
have sex with
their own children?"

822
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,896
And if no one even
looks up, I'll be like,

823
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,813
"Okay, cool, next hotel."

824
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,597
Sometimes when I
tell that story,

825
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:06,644
someone will laugh so hard
their shoulders will shake.

826
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,255
And other times,
someone won't even smile.

827
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:12,214
But on a magical night,
those two people...

828
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:14,042
are sitting right next
to each other.

829
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:19,700
And I get so excited
about the idea

830
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,050
of that uncomfortable
ride home.

831
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:28,361
"Hey, Erica, do you care if
we stop by the gas station

832
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:30,189
and get some Skittles?"

833
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:32,713
"I don't know, Patrick.
Why don't you go fuck a kid?!"

834
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:11,186
You heard me say
"Skittles," right?

835
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,154
I know we're getting soft
as a nation, 'cause
I travel all around it

836
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,286
and I hear soft noises
in comedy clubs.

837
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:28,160
One time, I heard a grown man
go, "Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho."

838
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:30,640
That's crazy.

839
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,469
If that is the noise
your body chooses to make,

840
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:36,037
stay home always and forever.

841
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:39,345
'Cause no one likes you,
for sure.

842
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:40,955
But the worst noise
I've ever heard

843
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,436
at a comedy show is this one:
"Mm, I don't, mm."

844
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:48,789
Man or woman, that
is the twatiest noise

845
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:51,270
that can come out
of the human body.

846
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,793
You should be able
to karate chop that

847
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,100
out of somebody's throat.

848
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:56,318
"Hey, man, how was your day?"

849
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,016
"Mm, I don't..."
Thwap!

850
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,673
I would rather hear choking
than hear that noise.

851
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,634
'Cause you know
who makes that noise?

852
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,549
It's people that wake up
every morning and think,

853
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,856
"How could I be
a victim today?"

854
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,208
And you know who
I'm talking about.

855
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,081
It's people that don't get
enough attention at work,

856
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:22,214
they don't get enough
attention at home.

857
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:23,693
So they're posting
on social media

858
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,088
posting all these
vague-ass statuses.

859
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:29,264
"Sure could use
some prayers today."

860
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,978
Post.

861
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:49,371
It's like you can almost
hear them typing it!

862
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,331
"Mm, I don't, mm, I don't,
mm, I don't, mm, I don't,
mm, I don't, mm, I don't."

863
00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:54,202
You have to be kidding me.
Knock it off.

864
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,596
What do you need prayers for?
Be specific.

865
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:58,337
Everybody's worried sick
about you.

866
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:01,253
There's 150 comments, and
they're all some version of,

867
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,213
"Mary, sending
good vibes your way!"

868
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,784
"Raising the roof
with prayer!" Emoji!

869
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:16,572
And four days later,
Mary comes back,

870
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:19,053
"Tomatoes weren't
as red as I'd hoped."

871
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,537
Well, fuck you, Mary!

872
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:25,625
I hope you get lupus

873
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:28,584
and everybody's
all prayed out.

874
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,984
But your tomatoes
are red, right?

875
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:40,031
They'll have antioxidants,
won't they, Mary?

876
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,555
Best of luck to you,
little girl that cried prayer.

877
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:50,041
How can we not test for
the noise, "Mm, I don't, mm"?

878
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:53,348
We can test for almost
anything in-utero, right?

879
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,828
Let's get one of those
fancy ultrasound machines

880
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,656
and figure it out.

881
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,531
That's your
baby's heartbeat.

882
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:09,712
"Mm, I don't, mm."
We should get that
out of you immediately.

883
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:13,325
'Cause nobody wants another one
of those walking around town.

884
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,240
And you do not wanna live
with a third-grader

885
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:18,591
that doesn't want Oreos
'cause they're made with
hydrogenated oil!

886
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:21,811
"Mm, I don't, mm!"
Fuckin' die.

887
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,640
Just die already.

888
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:35,521
When I hear the noise,
"Mm, I don't, mm"...

889
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:37,305
...I get ISIS.

890
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,005
I get it!

891
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,399
I understand starting a group
to hurt other people.

892
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:47,141
That makes sense to me.

893
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,882
Does that mean I would
join ISIS? Of course not.

894
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,928
Would I scout for them?
I don't know, probably.

895
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:55,106
"Hey, man, how was your salad?"
"Mm, I don't..."

896
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:57,369
ISIS!

897
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:59,501
Bweep bweep!
I found one!

898
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:08,162
You don't wanna mess with ISIS,
man, they're a crabby group.

899
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,120
And we should have
seen that coming,

900
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:12,297
'cause they are all caps.

901
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,864
And, you guys, that's yelling.
How did we not know?

902
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,566
I bet if you asked
everybody in ISIS

903
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:24,918
why they joined,
over 40% would say traffic.

904
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,790
Because traffic
can turn a reasonable,
rational human being

905
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,749
into a murderous monster.

906
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,403
You ever been at
a four-way stop,

907
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,708
and it's not your turn to go,
but it's the person

908
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:34,188
in front you, it's
their turn to go?

909
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,668
But they're not going,
they're doing this:

910
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:37,583
"Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

911
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,802
"No, you. G-G-G-G-Go."

912
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:42,283
And you're behind 'em like,
"Fucking go!"

913
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:46,374
"You have to go,
or nobody's ever gonna go."

914
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,508
There are rules in place
for this situation!

915
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:52,728
You're not gonna get into heaven
for letting somebody go first
at a four-way stop!

916
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:56,210
'Cause I'm gonna stab someone,
and that shit's going
on your tab.

917
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:59,170
Because, "Go, go, go...
go, go, go," is gonna lead to,

918
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:02,303
"Gah gah! Gah gah gah gah!"

919
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,740
Listen, you guys,
you cannot not be nice

920
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:06,220
with someone else's time.

921
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,483
That is not
how kindness works.

922
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,312
If you want to be nice,
join the big brother

923
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,967
or the big sister program,
and bring a kid to the movie.

924
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:17,971
But on your way
to the theater, fu-ckin' go.

925
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,278
You have to go!

926
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:26,980
Now, I want you to know,
traffic is the only time

927
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,983
I get real upset.

928
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,333
That's true.
I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

929
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,509
I love walking around
and seeing other people get mad.

930
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:36,207
I think that's fun.

931
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:39,558
Because I am a hypocrite
and I like to judge others.

932
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,951
And that makes me feel good.

933
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,344
If I see a man yelling
at his kids, I'm like,

934
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:46,173
"Oh, I'm so much
better than him."

935
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,046
And that gets me through my day,
even though it's not true.

936
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:53,398
My favorite kind of anger
is self-produced anger.

937
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,269
We've all seen that.

938
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:57,793
Guy at the grocery store
is holding the door.

939
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,839
Somebody walks in,
doesn't say thank you,

940
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:03,495
and the guy holding the door
is like, "Welcome!"

941
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:07,020
Oh, my God, has anyone
ever needed to hear

942
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:10,241
"drive safe, don't rape"
more than him?

943
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:11,503
Like, ever?

944
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,769
What does he think,
everyone's just at the gym,

945
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:18,597
running on the treadmill,
getting in shape,

946
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,686
"Sure hope somebody holds
the door at the store today!

947
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:24,037
Cannot wait to say thank you!"
It's crazy.

948
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,995
People have other things
going on in their lives, right?

949
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,347
Even if it's something as small
as remembering your list

950
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:30,913
when you're walking through
the parking lot.

951
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,265
Just, milk, eggs, flour...

952
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:35,657
"Welcome!"

953
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:38,269
Okay. All right.

954
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:41,185
Yeah, that was
most likely for me.

955
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:47,147
Were you holding the door?
You were, right? Yeah!

956
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:48,540
I was just trying
to remember my list.

957
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,542
"Yeah, well, you're welcome!"

958
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,504
Nobody likes getting yelled at,
especially in public.

959
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:58,376
Nothing good has ever
happened from that.

960
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,726
A guy is never like, "Oh, I
should take that guy fishing."

961
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,729
All right? It's always
something like,

962
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:06,906
"Oh, I'd kill him
for sure."

963
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:11,302
That's why I admire
psychopaths a little bit.

964
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,695
I think psychopaths have
figured some things out.

965
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:16,698
I do. A psychopath thinks,
"I'm gonna kill that guy."

966
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:19,614
And then they just kill 'em.

967
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:20,920
And the rest of the day,
they're like,

968
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:22,617
♪ Dup duh duh da da ♪

969
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:25,272
They're just so happy that
their to-do list is done.

970
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,626
But a man that fears
society's rules,

971
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:33,889
you can't go killing people
all wily-nily.

972
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:35,456
We're actually like,
"Oh, I wanna kill that guy.

973
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:36,936
"But, uh, eh,
I'm already at the store.

974
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,633
I should probably just
get my stuff."

975
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,115
"Yeah, I'll do that."

976
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,899
And then he goes in the store,

977
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:46,032
but he hasn't forgotten that
he's been yelled at, right?

978
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,686
So ten minutes later,
he's walking around

979
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:49,470
the frozen food section,
just like,

980
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:52,995
"Okay, hold on.
What do you mean I'mwelcome?"

981
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,694
"Why am I welcome?
You're welcome. How 'bout that?

982
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,523
You ever thought about that?
How 'bout you be welcome?"

983
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,915
"I just opened
this freezer door.

984
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,178
"Didn't need your help
there, did I?

985
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,658
"No, man.
I got doors all day!

986
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,269
Fuck! Welcome!"

987
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:08,533
And he strokes out,
in the frozen food section.

988
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,971
And he forgets his list,
and goes home without milk,

989
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,625
eggs, or flour.

990
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:15,061
And his only job all week

991
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,194
was to make his little daughter
a birthday cake.

992
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,249
You assholes.

993
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:33,949
I mean, seriously.

994
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:39,259
Let's review all the things
we've talked about tonight.

995
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:43,655
And cake just
shut ya down, huh?

996
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:47,136
We've talked about
so many topics, you're like,

997
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,748
"Not the cake!
Don't you dare!"

998
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,101
My God, you're so nice.

999
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:58,670
Stop... "The Lord
is alive in Denver."

1000
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,196
You weirdoes.

1001
00:54:05,503 --> 00:54:09,071
Just as a reminder,
a man had just stroked out
in a grocery store,

1002
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:11,596
and nobody had any problem
with that at all.

1003
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,905
And then I mention a girl not
getting cake and you're like,

1004
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:21,170
"Oh, God, is there a bakery
he could stop at?

1005
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,085
"Stop at a bakery
and get some cake?

1006
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:26,088
It's her birthday."

1007
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:28,482
I need you to know something,
when I wrote this story,

1008
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:31,355
I never even thought about
that little girl for more
than one second.

1009
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:35,707
I just needed something
to do with those ingredients.

1010
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:37,404
So I picked cake,
'cause I like cake.

1011
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,800
This little girl is just
supposed to go, "Hey, guys,"

1012
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,541
and leave the story,
that's it.

1013
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,326
She's like one second in,
one second out.

1014
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:49,373
And you guys are like,
"Come here! We'll get you
some cake, come on!

1015
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,549
You come here
right now!"

1016
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:58,120
That's how
we roll, Chad!

1017
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:03,561
This story is about a man on
the verge of a mental breakdown.

1018
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:07,652
I just picture this man
in his kitchen,

1019
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:12,047
stirring an empty bowl
with dead eyes.

1020
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:16,704
Still has his hospital
bracelet on from the stroke.

1021
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:20,360
Just mumbling things like,
"Hold the door for me?
Hold the door for you."

1022
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:26,540
"Didn't need you
to hold the door.

1023
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,020
"It was an automatic door.
You were waving at the camera.

1024
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,630
Now you don't have to."

1025
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,721
His father-in-law
walks in the kitchen,

1026
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:36,811
"How's the cake coming?"
"Fucking welcome!"

1027
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:39,510
Like, loses his mind.

1028
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:46,995
And a whole bunch
of you were like,

1029
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:49,607
"Is there frosting
at the house?

1030
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:51,565
Can we get this kid
some frosting?"

1031
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,006
Which is crazy to me,
because the point

1032
00:55:58,093 --> 00:56:02,533
of this entire story
is this.

1033
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,493
When a woman
is breastfeeding a child...

1034
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,408
...and the child is sick,

1035
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:11,280
that illness is
in the child's saliva.

1036
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,979
It enters the mother's body
through the areola,

1037
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,633
it travels around
the mother's body,

1038
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,330
the mother's body fixes it.

1039
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,897
It puts it back in the milk,

1040
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:20,812
sends the cure out
through the nipple,

1041
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:22,683
kid feels better.

1042
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,078
Our noses can categorize
50,000 smells.

1043
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:29,647
Our eyeballs can see
10 million different colors.

1044
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:34,086
That is the potential
of the human body.

1045
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:37,089
And you can't figure out
a four-way stop?

1046
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:51,103
I know I have had a lot
of problems with humanity

1047
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,149
up here tonight.

1048
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:55,934
But I also want you to know

1049
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,936
I think I could be friends
with almost anybody.

1050
00:56:58,023 --> 00:56:59,677
I mean, the only group
of people I can think of

1051
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,026
that I wouldn't
be friends with

1052
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:02,549
is if we're
walking down the street

1053
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:04,464
and we overhear somebody
say "fingerbang,"

1054
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,945
and you don't even giggle...

1055
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,990
...then I don't care
to have you a part of my life,

1056
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,514
as a part of my life.

1057
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,169
What, we're gonna
go to your house

1058
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,562
and drink gin
and do accounting?

1059
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,695
No thank you.

1060
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:19,348
If you're an adult
and you hear "fingerbang"

1061
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,440
and you don't even go,
"Heh heh, okay," like nothing?

1062
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:26,617
That creeps me out.

1063
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:28,532
That's why I like talking
to really old people.

1064
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,361
Like 95 years or older,
you can say whatever
you want around them.

1065
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,452
They're just
glad your talking.

1066
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,150
You could say "fingerbang"
in front of a 95-year-old woman

1067
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:41,370
and she'd be like,
"I remember fingerbanging."

1068
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:46,506
"I was fingered by
Abraham Lincoln's nephew!"

1069
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,858
"Also a tall man, huge hands."

1070
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,907
"I remember he removed
his riding glove,

1071
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:58,257
and it was like
a fist full of dicks."

1072
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:11,923
"It was thrilling!

1073
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,490
"President Lincoln once said,

1074
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:15,404
"'A house divided
cannot stand.'

1075
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,929
Well, neither could I."

1076
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,114
Dude, old people
can say or do whatever.

1077
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:33,510
That's how old men ended up
as the creepiest things
on the planet.

1078
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,555
I can't wait to be that old.

1079
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:39,603
I cannot wait until my actions
don't have consequences.

1080
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,169
I'm not gonna
throw shit at people

1081
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,823
or be weird
when I'm swimming,

1082
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,566
but I still wanna have fun...
when comedy's done.

1083
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:47,785
I don't have hobbies,
so I'm not gonna

1084
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:49,047
whittle recorders out of wood

1085
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:51,789
and bring them
to middle schools.

1086
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:53,704
I'm just gonna sit
at the bus stop,

1087
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:58,099
and them I'm gonna flick guys
in the dick when they walk by.

1088
00:58:58,186 --> 00:58:59,884
And I know comedy's supposed
to be smarter than that,

1089
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:01,494
but I don't care,
flicking dicks

1090
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,018
is really funny to me.

1091
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:05,890
I'm just gonna sit at the bus
stop with a big coat on,

1092
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:08,327
but my arms not
in the sleeves.

1093
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:14,289
Then I'm gonna sneak attack
out the zipper. Thwap!

1094
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:18,424
"What are you doing?"
Doesn't matter, I'm old.

1095
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:20,948
"Well, I'm gonna call the cops."
Go ahead, I need a ride home.

1096
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:24,778
They're not gonna
arrest an old man

1097
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,172
for flicking dicks, right?

1098
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:30,088
It's probably not even
in the book.

1099
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:34,483
"Hey, uh... we're down
at the, uh, bus stop,

1100
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,617
and we have a..."

1101
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:41,403
"We have a...

1102
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,015
" There's an old guy
down here flicking dicks and...

1103
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,757
"Dude, it is outrageous.
I don't know...

1104
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:49,455
"He's killing people.
It's crazy!

1105
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,109
"I don't know if his
right shoulder is made up

1106
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:52,589
"of only fast-twitch
muscle fibers,

1107
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,329
"but this guy is unreal.

1108
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:56,984
"He's beating younger men
to their crotches,

1109
00:59:57,071 --> 01:00:00,292
"and my God,
is it fun to watch.

1110
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:01,380
"And you know my rule:
If I laugh at something,

1111
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,816
I don't make an arrest, so..."

1112
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,603
"I'm just gonna eat my lunch
here and watch, over."

1113
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:12,521
Because dicks are not
protected by the law.

1114
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:15,916
And I'm in no way saying
they should be.

1115
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:18,745
I'm telling you
straight up, they're not.

1116
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:20,486
You flick a lady in the tit,
well pack your shit,

1117
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:22,357
'cause you're going to jail.

1118
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:26,274
Right?
As it should be.

1119
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,668
But you could curb-stomp...

1120
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:36,197
...a guy's bare dick,

1121
01:00:36,284 --> 01:00:38,983
in front of a cop,
and the cop would be like,

1122
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,375
"It's probably gonna be
a stomach ache.

1123
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:42,987
Catch you guys later!"

1124
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:45,511
Nobody cares about dicks.

1125
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:48,340
That's why sometimes when I hear
women go, "We want equality!"

1126
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:50,864
I always just wanna whisper,
"Yeah, but not all of it."

1127
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:53,040
"You don't want
the curb-stomping part.

1128
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:54,868
"Just take the good stuff.

1129
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:57,131
Take the M&Ms out of the trail
mix, leave the raisins."

1130
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:04,573
'Cause you have equality
across the board, and you
get the good stuff,

1131
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,314
you're gonna have to do things
you don't wanna do, like

1132
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:08,490
start calling your shots
when you play pool.

1133
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,235
Hold on.

1134
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:16,237
Hold on for one second.

1135
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:21,982
I saw some women react like
I said you were bad at pool.

1136
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,854
Those words never
came out of my mouth.

1137
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:25,464
I never said women
are bad at pool,

1138
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:28,597
I said you're cheaters.

1139
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,599
That's different.

1140
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,389
It's gonna be no more of this:

1141
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:38,782
"Oops, I made it
in the wrong pocket,

1142
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,174
"but I'm cute
and you wanna fuck me,

1143
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,567
"so it's still my turn,
still my turn,

1144
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:43,003
still my turn!"
Uh-uh.

1145
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,963
That goes out the door
with equal pay.

1146
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,529
Now you're gonna have
to buy your own drinks,

1147
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:48,922
and they're $17.50 a piece.

1148
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,663
You didn't even
know that, did you?

1149
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,752
Yeah!
Back of the line,
yoga pants.

1150
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:54,711
It's equality night.

1151
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:02,022
If we have true equality
between men and women,

1152
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:05,112
uh, we're gonna be able
to fistfight in the middle
of the street.

1153
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,202
And I can tell you, I don't
wanna live in a world like that.

1154
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:11,031
'Cause I would lose
to upwards of 45% of women.

1155
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:18,822
Sounds like a high number,
but let's go through the groups.

1156
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:20,867
White trash ladies, uh-huh.

1157
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,305
I'd lose to most of them.

1158
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,177
'Cause they're tricky.

1159
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:28,005
They've had to get out
of some tight spots

1160
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:29,746
by thinking on their feet.

1161
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,225
A white trash lady
will say something like,

1162
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,010
"Look at my tits!"
And when you do,

1163
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,534
they hit you
with something real hard.

1164
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:37,536
Probably a glass ashtray.

1165
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,589
You ever seen a kung fu movie?

1166
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:49,026
Little Asian girl
skipping to school.

1167
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:50,157
Old Asian guy walks
around the corner,

1168
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:51,942
"Your skipping is stupid,"

1169
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:55,728
and she floats up into the air
and murders him with face kicks?

1170
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:59,471
You're gonna have to factor in
all little Asian girls to that.

1171
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:02,343
Every single of 'em, 'cause you
don't know which ones can float.

1172
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,172
They don't put stickers on 'em.

1173
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:12,005
You're going to have
to factor in all black women

1174
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,615
and start removing
their earrings

1175
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:15,748
as they're moving towards you.

1176
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,188
Because I don't care
what martial art

1177
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:23,060
you've trained in, gentlemen,

1178
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:25,627
that's gonna be a loss
on your record.

1179
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,590
If you make a black woman
so upset with you

1180
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,287
for whatever bullshit
you're doing,

1181
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,159
and she pulls her earring off
and goes, "What?"

1182
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,987
Just go, "Nothing,
nothing, nothing!"

1183
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:41,818
And you run.
And you find shelter.

1184
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:45,517
And my I suggest
a body of water.

1185
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:55,483
Now... some of you
are gonna be pretty surprised

1186
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,660
by this next part.

1187
01:03:58,747 --> 01:04:01,620
Because a lot of you think
I think black people don't swim.

1188
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:02,926
And that's the craziest thing

1189
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,710
I've ever heard
in my whole life.

1190
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:06,799
You can't think an entire group
of people doesn't do one thing.

1191
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:09,889
That's ridiculous
and how bad stuff starts.

1192
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:12,892
I know black people swim.
I've seen black people swim.

1193
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:15,286
What I have never seen,
and no one has,

1194
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:16,765
is a black woman that
just got her hair done

1195
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,377
get it wet on purpose.

1196
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,772
That has not happened
since the beginning of time,

1197
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:28,038
and black people
were the first people,
they've had more time!

1198
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,257
A black woman will follow you
into a body of water,

1199
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:32,346
but just up to her hair.

1200
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:35,915
And then she'll be like,
"Uh, nope," and back it on out.

1201
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:37,743
And then you're just
treading water in the lake.

1202
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,527
"Are you gonna leave?!"

1203
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,621
"I took the afternoon off
to get my hair done.

1204
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,797
I have nowhere to be."

1205
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,932
I saw a black lady leave
a hair salon one time.

1206
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,195
She looked up, it started
raining on her hair,

1207
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:58,198
and she looked up into the sky,
and she goes, "No!"

1208
01:04:58,285 --> 01:04:59,896
And it stopped raining.

1209
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,163
So... you know.

1210
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,600
Still think Jesus is white?

1211
01:05:19,176 --> 01:05:22,919
I know I talk a lot of crap
about my son up here.

1212
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,399
But I do want you to know
that he's a very respectful
young man.

1213
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:29,447
And he is a smart...
like, too smart, maybe.

1214
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,710
And he has a very dry
sense of humor.

1215
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:33,190
To the point where you
don't know if it's a joke

1216
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,844
or if you're
gonna get murdered.

1217
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,238
Right, you wake up the next day
and you're like...

1218
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:42,634
"That's funny, buddy!

1219
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:44,505
"Good job, it's
a very funny joke!

1220
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,203
Oh, my God, I'm alive!"

1221
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,423
It's like that kind
of sense of humor.

1222
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,602
We were walking
down the street one day,

1223
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:56,256
it was my son
and my daughter and I,

1224
01:05:56,343 --> 01:05:59,868
and, uh, an Asian family
was walking towards us.

1225
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,261
And there were seven of them.

1226
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:02,567
And none of them were higher...

1227
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:11,619
I don't get it.

1228
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,450
"There were seven of them"?

1229
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,365
Is that like
a weird thing to say?

1230
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:25,459
Agh, fuckin' legalize pot.
Here's what happens.

1231
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:29,768
You don't have to say
anything funny,

1232
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:31,248
you just present a fact
and people are like,

1233
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,990
"Oh, my, whoa God!

1234
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,339
"Dad, you're not gonna believe
what happened to me.

1235
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:36,601
"Oh, my God,
it was the funniest thing

1236
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:38,168
I've ever seen
in my whole life."

1237
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:49,222
We were walking towards
an Asian family.

1238
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:51,311
There were seven of them.

1239
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,139
None of them were higher
than my chest.

1240
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:55,707
Now... does that mean I think
all Asian people are short?

1241
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:57,230
No, of course not.

1242
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:58,797
I know Asian people
that are taller than me.

1243
01:06:58,884 --> 01:06:59,798
I'm just telling you
these are the facts

1244
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:02,018
of this particular story.

1245
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,368
So the grandparents passed us,
and then the parents passed us,

1246
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:08,241
and the children passed us.

1247
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:11,375
And my son slowed down,
and he looked at me and he goes,

1248
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:14,856
"Do you think Godzilla was
just a normal-sized lizard?"

1249
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:33,701
And my daughter said,
"Isn't that racist?"

1250
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:35,921
And I said,
"We will figure that out

1251
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,750
when I'm done laughing."

1252
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,709
'Cause sometimes, you just
gotta let 'er buck.

1253
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,368
I brought my son to
a comedy festival in Nebraska.

1254
01:07:48,455 --> 01:07:50,544
It was Johnny Carson's hometown.

1255
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,459
And I was always such
a huge fan of Johnny Carson.

1256
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:54,287
I wanted to show my son
some history, right?

1257
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,984
They have a museum there
and everything.

1258
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,943
So we went there and we
had a great time and the...

1259
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,206
Before the first show,
we're in the green room.

1260
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:01,773
It was me,
a couple friends, my son.

1261
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,167
And then two comedians walked in
that I had never met,

1262
01:08:04,254 --> 01:08:06,821
so they didn't know me and they
certainly didn't know my son.

1263
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:08,997
And so they thought
he was a comedian.

1264
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,825
And they were like,
"How old are you?"
And he goes, "I'm 18."

1265
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:12,523
They go, "Oh, you think
you're gonna go out there

1266
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,655
"and wow the adult crowd
with your 18-year-old humor?

1267
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,092
"Yeah? Is that right?
Is that what you're gonna do?

1268
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,963
"Sure, uh-huh.
You gonna tell 'em about

1269
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,356
how you live
with your parents?"

1270
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:20,400
And somebody
whispered to me, they go,

1271
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,185
"Are you gonna help your son?"

1272
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,621
And I was like, "Nah,
I sharpened the stick.

1273
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,753
I know how it pokes."

1274
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:32,804
So the guy was just
giving it to my son.

1275
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:34,240
And he's finally done,
and my kid goes,

1276
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:35,502
"Yeah, thank you
very much for that.

1277
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:37,243
"I really appreciate
the advice.

1278
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,202
Um, do you mind
if I say something
I like about your act?"

1279
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,986
And the guys goes,
"Go for it."

1280
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:43,031
He goes, "I really like how you
smile at the end of your jokes

1281
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,468
"to let people
know they're finished,

1282
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:47,297
since the punch lines
don't do the trick."

1283
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:54,913
Everybody slowly looked at me,
and I was just like,

1284
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,828
"Daddy raised you right!"

1285
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,179
So thrilled.

1286
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,355
But that wasn't even
my favorite.

1287
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:05,010
A the end of the week,
there was a former
Miss Nebraska there.

1288
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:08,492
Just a lovely woman.
She was like the town
celebrity, so nice.

1289
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,233
And she invited us
all to her home

1290
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,757
to have a buffet
at the end of the week.

1291
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:14,628
And so we got there,
it was my friend Joe,

1292
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,717
my friend Phil,
my son, and myself,

1293
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:18,676
and we got there late,
and there were no plates left.

1294
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:20,504
And Phil is from Canada.

1295
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,070
And I only tell you that
to let you know

1296
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,118
that he doesn't care
about others.

1297
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,773
So we walked in
and there were no plates
left at the buffet.

1298
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,122
And he...
There were three plates

1299
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,906
on the kitchen wall,
and Phil goes,

1300
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:34,082
"Can I use one of these?"

1301
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,127
And she goes,
"No, you may not,"

1302
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:36,868
and he goes, "Why not?"

1303
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:39,218
And she started crying.

1304
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:40,567
And through tears,
she told us this story

1305
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,613
about how her mom
had left Europe

1306
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,789
with just 12 plates
and the clothes on her back,

1307
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:47,357
and then she met the husband,
and they had four kids,

1308
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:49,315
and they all got three plates,
and all four of those kids

1309
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:50,577
had three children
of their own,

1310
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:53,841
so they were all
going to get one plate.

1311
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:55,452
And Phil goes,

1312
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,497
"Is that it?"

1313
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,022
And she goes,
"Yes, it is."

1314
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,068
And he goes, "Well, I'm hungry,
I'm going to get food."

1315
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:06,376
And he turned,
but he had a backpack on.

1316
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:09,422
And it knocked a plate off of
the wall, and it shattered.

1317
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:11,816
And the only thing you could
hear in the kitchen

1318
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:14,297
was the clock ticking

1319
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,777
and this woman sobbing.

1320
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:18,344
And my son goes,
"God damn it, Phil,

1321
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,955
now she's gonna have to
kill one of her kids."

1322
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:30,878
I mean, come on.

1323
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:34,230
This lady went from
crying to laughing,

1324
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:37,668
and she goes,
"Oh, I like you."

1325
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:40,584
And my son goes, "Enough
to let me pick which kid?"

1326
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:44,762
Dude's like a superhero

1327
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:47,243
who doesn't know how
to use his powers yet.

1328
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,898
"I'm flying!
Is that a wall?" Smash!

1329
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,248
Thank you guys very much!

1330
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,554
I appreciate you
coming to the show!

1331
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:55,816
Thank you!

1332
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:57,296
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

1333
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:02,867
You guys are the best!
Thank you very much.

1334
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:15,532
Hang tight.
Hang tight.

1335
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:18,317
I wanna tell you one more story.
You can sit back down if
you would like.

1336
01:11:18,404 --> 01:11:20,058
One more!

1337
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:23,453
What a... what a weird way
to ruin a standing ovation.

1338
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,155
When I was starting comedy,
uh, I had zero money.

1339
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:32,244
And so my son
was about to be born,

1340
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,115
and so I called
this booking agent and I go,

1341
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:36,161
"Hey, man, is there any way
you can get me any work at all?

1342
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:38,642
I just really need
to make some money."

1343
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,034
And he goes,
"How about this week?"

1344
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:41,775
And I go, "Ah,
that's not gonna work,

1345
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,516
"'cause that is the week
my son is going to be born,

1346
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,039
and I need to be
around for that."

1347
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:46,998
And he goes,
"Well, good luck,

1348
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:50,480
because children
ruin comedy careers."

1349
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:54,440
So I would like
to introduce you

1350
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,225
to two people
that beg to differ.

1351
01:11:58,444 --> 01:12:01,273
This is my son Isaac.

1352
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,796
My daughter Olivia.

1353
01:12:13,938 --> 01:12:15,287
Wow, it's loud.

1354
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:28,779
Pretty good, huh?

1355
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,041
Yeah.

1356
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,043
Do you, uh, have
anything to say?

1357
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,827
Just wanted to
let you all know that, uh,

1358
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:36,047
I start my job
on Monday.

1359
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:43,228
Anything?

1360
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:46,187
Anyone bring
their passport?

1361
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:47,711
Ahh...

1362
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:56,154
Uh, kids do not
ruin comedy careers.

1363
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:58,199
Uh, they make them.
But more importantly,

1364
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:01,855
these two have
just made my life
a million times better,

1365
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:04,336
so, uh, I just wanted
to tell you guys that,

1366
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:06,338
because I know
I pick on them a lot.

1367
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,863
But they are the best.
And thank you guys very much.
