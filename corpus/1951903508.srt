1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,580
<i>In ancient times,</i>

2
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,718
<i>there arose in the lands between
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,</i>

3
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,162
<i>a powerful kingdom
called Akkad.</i>

4
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,111
<i>And for generations, her elite warriors,
called the Black Scorpions,</i>

5
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,308
<i>held sway over
all the neighboring tribes.</i>

6
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,894
<i>Bound by their code of honor
to fight and die to the last man</i>

7
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,156
<i>rather than abandon
their master,</i>

8
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,997
<i>they became prized as the personal
bodyguards of princes and emperors.</i>

9
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,285
<i>Most renowned among
the Black Scorpions was Ashur.</i>

10
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>But as for
his own son, Mathayus,</i>

11
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,558
<i>Ashur refused to allow
the boy to compete</i>

12
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,596
<i>for the honor of joining
the Black Scorpions.</i>

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:16,300
I must follow my faith and I
forbid you to go to the games tomorrow.

14
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,666
You think it's
all honor and glory.

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,232
Well, it's not.

16
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,670
I've done some things
that were not noble.

17
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,582
I promise you
that, my son.

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,549
<i>But like
many boys his age,</i>

19
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,019
<i>Mathayus paid no heed
to his father's warnings.</i>

20
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:46,423
You 24 boys are here to show your skills

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,168
in the art of fighting.

22
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,039
Only 12 of you will be
chosen to move ahead

23
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,970
and train for six long years to become
the pinnacle of a warrior.

24
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,948
A Black Scorpion!

25
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,856
Ready!

26
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,926
Advance to combat!

27
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,751
Show some mettle if you want
to be Scorpions.

28
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,248
Mercy is weakness!

29
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,187
Layla?
Mathayus?

30
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,288
I thought your father...

31
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,230
I snuck out.
You're crazy.

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,767
I'm crazy?

33
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,103
I can fight
as well as any boy.

34
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,605
Oh, really?

35
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,803
Prove it!
Hold!

36
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,586
Girls are forbidden
from the games.

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,394
Leave her alone!

38
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,758
Little vermin!

39
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,935
Get him!

40
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,009
Get him back here!
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,031
You dare dishonor
the games by interfering?

42
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,438
Lay a hand on him
and you won't live to regret it.

43
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,669
Arm yourself.

44
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,809
I'm not in the mood
for killing today.

45
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,280
Father!

46
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,431
Arrest them both!

47
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,470
And the girl.
Wait!

48
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,273
King Hammurabi!

49
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,403
They make a mockery
of the ancient games and insult me,

50
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,878
the commander
of your armies.

51
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,744
That may be, Sargon.

52
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,045
But Ashur has earned himself
some forbearance.

53
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,518
I am in your debt,
My Lord. As always.

54
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,421
And you may repay it

55
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,258
by sending your boy
to the Scorpions for training.

56
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,423
If he makes half the mercenary
his father was,

57
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,128
he'll serve the nation well.

58
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,100
You will pay for this.

59
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,076
I promise.

60
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,190
<i>The king's general, Sargon,
had always resented Ashur's fame.</i>

61
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,796
<i>And now, his hatred
knew no bounds.</i>

62
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,694
Father!

63
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,994
Father!

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,280
<i>Though he had no proof,
Mathayus knew in his heart</i>

65
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,977
<i>who had done
this to his father.</i>

66
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,749
<i>He vowed to master
the ways of the warrior.</i>

67
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,153
You fight
like a woman.

68
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,662
<i>Six years had passed.</i>

69
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,467
<i>Mathayus had left Nippur a boy,
and he returned a man.</i>

70
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:31,402
<i>And as he would shortly learn,
much had changed while he was gone.</i>

71
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,931
For these six years past, you have seen
neither kinsman nor any friend,

72
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,030
but blade,
shield and shaft.

73
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,236
You have trained hard.

74
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,906
Some have fallen
by the wayside.

75
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,708
Those who
yet stand before me

76
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,842
represent the pinnacle of generations
of Akkadian fighting prowess,

77
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,640
the Order of
the Black Scorpions.

78
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,479
Go forth proudly to wherever your king
may send you.

79
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,186
Fight nobly!

80
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,925
Bring gold to
our nation's coffers

81
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,556
and honor to
your family names!

82
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,916
Oh, Mom!

83
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,660
Look at you.
You're a man now!

84
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,787
I barely recognized you.

85
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,196
Mathayus! Mathayus!

86
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,296
Mathayus!
Noah!

87
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,300
What do they
feed you, rock stew?

88
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,865
I see you've grown, too.

89
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,639
He eats Enki's portions
as well as his own.

90
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,147
Where is Enki?
Why didn't he come?

91
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,541
He ran away
from home last year.

92
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,586
He's left to
find his fortune.

93
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,245
He'll be back.

94
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,493
Well, well, look at the proud new
Black Scorpion.

95
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,027
I see you've come
to pay your respects, Layla.

96
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,003
I can take you on
and don't you forget it.

97
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,099
Does that sting?

98
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,645
Only if you
dare touch it.

99
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,210
All turn and hail

100
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,045
Sargon, your king!

101
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,047
Present King Sargon!

102
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,188
I heard rumors.

103
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,628
You heard the truth.

104
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,428
Hammurabi's death was no accident.
Sargon killed him.

105
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,229
Such talk is dangerous.

106
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,425
Careful with your words.

107
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,525
Our top graduate, Sire.

108
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,061
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

109
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,058
I think not, Sire.

110
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,829
Ashur was his father.

111
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,027
Ah.

112
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,968
Your father was a skillful warrior
and a patriot.

113
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,765
I trust you will
honor his memory.

114
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,709
Send him to
the palace later.

115
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,412
I may have a special
assignment for him.

116
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,598
You call
yourself a fighter?

117
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,869
Get up!

118
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,308
You better show me
some skills.

119
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,914
Is that all you've got?

120
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,421
You're nothing.

121
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,647
Don't just stand there.

122
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,205
Come to me.

123
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:06,590
There's no place for timidity now that
the scorpion rides on your shoulder.

124
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,127
You're wondering
about their tattoos.

125
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,003
One for each man
they've slain.

126
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,375
You'd like a few of your own,
wouldn't you?

127
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,874
If they deserve
to die, yes.

128
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,917
We all deserve to die.

129
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,852
The only question is in what manner
and how soon.

130
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,616
As a member of
my personal bodyguard,

131
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,921
it'll be your job to insure that you
die long before I do.

132
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,194
Your personal bodyguard?

133
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,494
It's a great honor,
Mathayus.

134
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,634
Beyond the skill and strength
I'm told you possess,

135
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:49,834
the first requirement is an absolute and
unwavering loyalty to me,

136
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,741
your king.

137
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,170
Show him what I mean.

138
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,116
Hail Sargon!

139
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,890
Are you capable
of such loyalty, Mathayus?

140
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,415
I...

141
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,558
Yes,

142
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,127
Sire.

143
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,594
Good.
Then riches and glory will be yours.

144
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,170
But, Mathayus,
betray me even once

145
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,212
and you will pray to the gods
for a quick death.

146
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,679
We'll talk again
in the morning.

147
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,168
Pick one for the night.
Or two or three.

148
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,336
Don't wear yourself out.

149
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,012
Or three.

150
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,552
I hear you're
quite the swordsman.

151
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,820
I'm not quite polished yet, Sire, but
I'm a quick learner, I hope.

152
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,882
I like you, Mathayus.

153
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,895
Bring in the prisoner.

154
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,325
He was overheard
slandering my name.

155
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,961
And the punishment is death.

156
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,337
Wait. But this is my...
I know.

157
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,004
You do the deed yourself,

158
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,740
you prove your loyalty to me
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

159
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,450
I'll permit you
to make it quick.

160
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,051
Mathayus! I'm sorry.

161
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,349
Is this true?

162
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,089
Did you slander the king?

163
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,325
Mathayus! Please!

164
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,491
Answer me!

165
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,836
Are the charges true?

166
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,865
Yes.

167
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,705
Then you deserve
what's coming to you.

168
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,575
You've not only betrayed your king,
but your family as well.

169
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,015
And you've disgraced
our father's name.

170
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,684
Whatever you do,
don't flinch.

171
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,633
Run, Noah!

172
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,543
I said run!

173
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,944
No!
Go.

174
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,004
We stand
and fight together.

175
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,422
Mathayus, behind you!

176
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,711
You killed my father.

177
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,542
This is for him.

178
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,581
Your father was a traitor.

179
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,920
As are his sons.

180
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,786
Turnabout's fair play.

181
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,199
Let's go!
Out the window.

182
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,415
Kill them!

183
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,711
Noah, come on!

184
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,250
Come back! Stop!

185
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,525
Go! Go!

186
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,997
Hold on!

187
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,506
Noah, what's wrong?

188
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,933
Just hold on.
We're almost safe.

189
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,867
Noah.

190
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,974
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

191
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,472
Noah!

192
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,250
Noah!

193
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,252
Hang on! Hang on!

194
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,953
Noah!

195
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,487
Noah!

196
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,887
Noah.

197
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,731
<i>Now with his brother's blood
on his hands,</i>

198
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,171
<i>vengeance had branded itself
in Mathayus' heart.</i>

199
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,154
Shall we kill him now
or bring him back alive?

200
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,625
Neither. I have special plans
for this one.

201
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:18,375
You idiot! Now I'm gonna stink of fish
for the next week.

202
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,481
What are you doing here?

203
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,315
And I hate mackerel.

204
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,288
Next time
I'll use tuna.

205
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,915
Layla, why are you
following me around?

206
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,893
First of all,
I am not following you around.

207
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,690
I'm escaping, too.

208
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,965
My parents pledged my hand to that fat
sheep merchant, Muktil.

209
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,097
We're due to be
married in a week.

210
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,761
Congratulations.

211
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,901
You think it's funny.

212
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,431
Well, I don't know who smells worse,
him or his sheep.

213
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,972
Mathayus, I just want
a life of adventure.

214
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,515
And battle.
Like a man.

215
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,076
There's one small problem.

216
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,886
You're not a man.

217
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,251
Thanks for noticing.

218
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,384
Hey!

219
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,418
I heard you tried
to kill Sargon.

220
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,021
Hey, listen.
I will kill that bastard some day.

221
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,659
Everyone knows he makes sacrifices
to the dark gods,

222
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,826
and they've given him
black magical powers.

223
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,870
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

224
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,769
Layla, that's nice, but a girl would
only get in the way.

225
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,999
I'm not just a girl.

226
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,100
Look, we're not kids anymore
playing games.

227
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,543
I see your Black Scorpion training
also included lessons

228
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,478
on how to become
an arrogant jerk.

229
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,574
Congratulations on passing
with flying colors.

230
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,978
Go home, Layla.
Make the sheep merchant's life miserable.

231
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,355
Fine! If that's how you want it.
You're on your own.

232
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,125
Fine.
Fine.

233
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,803
Ticket to Egypt, please.
Ten pieces.

234
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,236
Ticket to Egypt for one.

235
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,739
Ten pieces.

236
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,239
Ten? That's pretty steep.

237
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,141
Plus one for insurance.

238
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,339
And I highly recommend it,
because there are pirates,

239
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,974
hostile natives
and hurricanes.

240
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,646
Just the ticket.

241
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,522
Piracy has already
started if you ask me.

242
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,082
Egypt. For one.

243
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,354
Ten pieces.

244
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,793
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

245
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,993
Don't push in!

246
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,228
What are you
talking about?

247
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,134
I left the line for 10 seconds
to relieve my bladder.

248
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,763
Liar. Greek.

249
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,371
Madam, I would caution you
never to mix those two words together.

250
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,774
Cretin.

251
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,581
To the land of the pharaohs,
my good man.

252
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,084
Ten pieces.

253
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,453
Ticket.

254
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,438
You are following me.

255
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,970
Admit it.

256
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,342
You know, this may come
as a shock to you,

257
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,849
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.

258
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,508
Then why are you
going to Egypt?

259
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,915
Because...

260
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,479
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.

261
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,221
Why are you going to Egypt?

262
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,054
Personal matters

263
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,521
which don't concern you.

264
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,857
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.

265
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,161
All right.

266
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,606
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.

267
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,201
So, I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow

268
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,271
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.

269
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,175
The Pharaoh of Egypt

270
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,150
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history

271
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,282
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?

272
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,157
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

273
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,854
Actually,

274
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,297
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.

275
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,931
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris

276
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,903
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.

277
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,499
Such as the winged scarab,
sphinxes and cursed mummies.

278
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,768
And you know this how?

279
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,873
Let's just say
I'm well connected.

280
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,281
Really? And who
are you exactly?

281
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,716
Aristophanes of Naxos.

282
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,417
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.

283
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,484
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.

284
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,426
So if you need
any translation services...

285
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,660
Yes, yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?

286
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,134
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.

287
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,900
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.

288
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:41,044
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.

289
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,309
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.

290
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,317
But you are thinking
along the right path.

291
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,120
To defeat a man like Sargon,
well-versed in the black arts,

292
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,022
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.

293
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,686
Like?

294
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,694
Let's see.

295
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,927
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No, too unwieldy.

296
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,662
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.

297
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,067
The Cloak of...

298
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,665
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!

299
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,004
The what?

300
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,011
Damocles. You know.

301
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,638
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths

302
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,550
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.

303
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,456
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?

304
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,960
Not to touch
other men's swords.

305
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,521
Well, in any case,

306
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,590
<i>according to Book Five of
Herodotus' Histories,</i>

307
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,570
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus

308
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,665
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.

309
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,767
Mortal or immortal.

310
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,372
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.

311
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,246
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?

312
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,751
Oh, please.

313
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,784
Anything.

314
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,388
And you know
where this sword is?

315
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,052
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today,

316
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,254
and that is saying plenty.

317
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,696
Oh, and you
have a better idea.

318
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,765
Okay. I've decided.

319
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,400
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.

320
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,567
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.

321
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,272
My friend, such a journey would be
fraught with perils.

322
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,373
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls

323
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,439
suffering unspeakable...

324
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,508
How much do you want?

325
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,714
Exclusive rights to compose
an epic ode of your quest

326
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,814
and one hundred silver staters,
for expenses.

327
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,950
Wait. A hundred?

328
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,688
For risking my life,
it's a pittance.

329
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,863
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.

330
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,392
Here we go.

331
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,166
First of all,
I'm coming along.

332
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,331
Wait. Forget it.

333
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,036
Second, you will treat me with respect
and as your equal.

334
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,412
If not, your superior.

335
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,783
Thirty-fifth, you will launder my
undergarments daily in fresh rosewater.

336
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,656
Forty-seventh, you will bathe and
rub my feet with olive oil once a day.

337
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,289
Don't push it.

338
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,530
Hey, Greek.

339
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,865
Call me Ari, my sweet.

340
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,065
In case you get any funny ideas
about losing us

341
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,267
or making off with my money,
just remember this.

342
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,243
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.

343
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,543
I'm sure that's not the only thing
you're handy at, fair maiden,

344
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,812
whose beauty makes even
goddesses blush with envy.

345
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,581
Hey, save your flowery words
for your scribblings.

346
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,281
Focus on the task at hand,

347
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,984
which is getting
us into that.

348
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,691
Alive.

349
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,464
Of course.

350
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,852
Perhaps, Layla here might use
her feminine wiles

351
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,127
to distract the guards
whilst we slip past them.

352
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,139
This I have to see.

353
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,403
Hi, boys.
Nice night, isn't it?

354
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,104
Concubines around back.

355
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,113
Nice.
She is quite the charmer,

356
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,276
isn't she?

357
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,151
You should see her
in a bad mood.

358
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,385
Hmm.

359
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,621
Guys!

360
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,859
Come on, let's go.

361
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,468
These keys
should get us into the palace.

362
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,530
But then we need
to find the labyrinth.

363
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,338
The portal to the Underworld
lies within the labyrinth.

364
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,742
Get down!

365
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,152
Let's go.

366
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,852
Intruders
in the palace!

367
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:25,985
Stop them!

368
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,522
Intruders!

369
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,435
Hurry up.

370
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,843
Come on.
Come on.

371
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,407
I'm in!

372
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,247
Come on!

373
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,585
Come on!

374
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,922
Ow! Watch your sword.

375
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,152
I think
I've found something.

376
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,251
I think it's a lever.

377
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,488
Hey,
don't touch that.

378
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,540
Are you all right?

379
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,640
Yeah.

380
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,246
I'm fine, too. Thank you.

381
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,753
Who are you people?

382
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,691
Why are you imprisoned here?

383
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,152
He says they are
captives from many lands.

384
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,087
All brought here
to be fed to the Minotaur.

385
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,462
The what?

386
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,794
What do I expect from people who write
on clay tablets?

387
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,632
The Minotaur.

388
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,271
A creature
half man, half bull.

389
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:27,016
A crazed monster whose appetite must
be satisfied daily with human flesh.

390
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,212
King Minos believes that the Minotaur
protects the city,

391
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,756
and as long as it lives,

392
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,315
his reign will be secure
and the people will prosper.

393
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,762
And you were
going to tell us when?

394
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,369
At the appropriate moment.

395
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,241
Speak up sooner next time.
We don't even know who this guy is.

396
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,649
Who will join me
in battling this monster?

397
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,969
You'd rather
sit here in terror

398
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,905
and squeeze out a few more
wretched days of life

399
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,103
than die fighting honorably
for a chance at freedom?

400
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:31,842
My friend, you are wasting your breath.
Most men are slaves to their fears.

401
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,216
Then it's the three of us.

402
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,486
I would just
get in the way.

403
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,887
No doubt.

404
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,624
At least
she came strapped.

405
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,827
Nice.

406
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,076
This way.

407
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,149
Stay behind me.

408
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,017
As you wish.

409
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,530
I've never heard those words
from your mouth before.

410
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,054
You're not scared,
are you?

411
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,065
Don't be ridiculous.

412
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,928
You?

413
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,992
Please.

414
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,047
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

415
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,189
Which way is it?

416
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,701
Let's go this way.

417
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,169
Okay.

418
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:54,117
That Akkadian
looked familiar to me.

419
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,823
Who was his father?

420
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,195
A famous mercenary
named Ashur.

421
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,236
I was afraid of that.

422
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,202
Men.

423
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,806
Illyrian honor calls.

424
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,516
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

425
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,170
I feel like we're going in circles.
Weren't we just here?

426
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,247
What
the hell is this?

427
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,218
It smells like death.

428
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,375
What?

429
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,580
What?

430
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,990
Stay back.

431
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,587
Here.

432
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,830
Where are you going?

433
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,490
Now I'm scared.

434
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,731
Let's go.

435
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,160
Now!

436
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,361
Shouldn't we
be following him?

437
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,270
He's out of his mind.

438
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,905
Or not.

439
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,947
You've gotta be kidding me.

440
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,215
Layla!

441
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,923
Ugly old slab of beef!

442
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,362
Your mother was a cow!

443
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,005
Don't worry.

444
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,303
It didn't go too deep.

445
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,740
A little higher up and you would
have been in trouble.

446
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,941
A little higher up and you might
be in trouble.

447
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,845
You'll be okay.

448
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,955
Wait here.

449
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,399
Your silence is praise enough.

450
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,430
That was you?

451
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,103
Music has charms
to soothe the savage beast.

452
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,842
Say, that's good.

453
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,591
I'm sorry for your loss,

454
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,889
but most grateful
for your help.

455
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,563
It was a debt
I owed your father.

456
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,733
We fought together in the war against
the Hittites.

457
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,771
And he saved my life.

458
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,268
Your debt is repaid then.

459
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,877
Damn right it is.
Let's go, men.

460
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,612
Where we're going we could use
some brave fighters.

461
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,315
There's strength in numbers
and great riches to be had.

462
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,820
Where?

463
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,857
Tell him.

464
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,252
You tell him.

465
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,789
I'll tell him.

466
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,061
The Underworld.

467
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,932
Oh, the Underworld.

468
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,005
There's a portal inside the center
of this labyrinth.

469
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,409
Well, good luck to you.

470
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,240
No one has ever returned alive
from that place.

471
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,942
Gilgamesh did it.
Never heard of him.

472
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,279
So did Herodotus.

473
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,410
So he claims.

474
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,748
Do you know
what else he claims?

475
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,652
When he visited the Underworld
he saw with his own eyes

476
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:36,090
enough gold, diamonds and rubies
to fill a thousand arenas.

477
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,095
He was literally crunching on a fortune
with every step.

478
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:43,691
But you, veteran warriors, wouldn't be
interested in such a hazardous journey

479
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,565
as that taken
by an old Greek historian.

480
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,301
And soon by a poet, a young Akkadian lad
and a girl.

481
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,434
Greeks. Greeks.

482
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,917
Okay.

483
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,437
Wait. Why is he coming?

484
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,139
Well, I thought
we could use the extra body.

485
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,804
I told him the Underworld
was a shortcut back to China.

486
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,995
Now what?

487
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,435
The portal is
in here somewhere.
