an observation.

524
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,291
I had a history teacher
in high school once

525
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,683
that I wanted to be.

526
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,162
She looked like Phoebe
Cates, but with bigger tits,

527
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:27,822
and she had the most
fabulous fucking brain.

528
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:31,292
I stole her pen once. It
smelled like tuna fish.

529
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:34,929
And then I realized,
it's because she ate

530
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:37,264
a tuna fish sandwich every
single day for lunch.

531
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,367
Tuna was never the
same for me after that.

532
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:43,070
I can't decide if it's,
like, a fetish of mine,

533
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,606
or if it's just... just gross.

534
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,178
Hey, can I ask you something?

535
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,780
[Maeve] Yeah, sure, whatever.

536
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:58,819
Margot said it was weird
that people were back up here

537
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,387
because something happened.

538
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,823
What exactly happened?

539
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:03,991
Oh, you mean about Jill?

540
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:06,827
Who's Jill?

541
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,233
Oh, I... I thought
Hadley told you.

542
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,773
Um, Jill. Yeah, so,
Jill was our friend.

543
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,208
Uh...

544
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,676
she's more like Hadley's friend.

545
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,278
They were really close.

546
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,789
She's actually Professor
Bennett's sister,

547
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,715
so she came to
Quincy wanting to be

548
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:29,250
like her hotshot big brother.

549
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,685
I don't think he's hot.

550
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,163
[Maeve] Anyway, so, yeah,
during her first year

551
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:34,364
she developed this
eating disorder.

552
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:35,956
It was so crazy.

553
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,100
She said, like, aliens
were telling her

554
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,993
not to eat and stuff.

555
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,637
I don't think I've heard of
that happening to anyone.

556
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,097
The alien thing?
I know, right?

557
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:45,065
So fucked up.

558
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,901
But none of us could
really do anything.

559
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,470
So. [inhales audibly]

560
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,871
Yeah, she...

561
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,107
She disappeared.

562
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,344
Actually, I think the last place

563
00:27:57,378 --> 00:27:58,445
she was seen was...

564
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,147
here.

565
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,151
But I think she's
gone all, like,

566
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,786
Grey Gardens and shit.

567
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,388
She, like, got
treatment and was, like,

568
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,123
living with her rich old aunt

569
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,892
on Rhode Island and a
bunch of cats. [chuckles]

570
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:14,061
So, you don't actually
know what happened?

571
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:16,797
No, I don't.

572
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:18,766
But, that's my theory.

573
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,434
And it's valid.

574
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:24,471
Hey.

575
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,906
It's for you.

576
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,108
Hm.

577
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:39,386
- [birds chirping]
- [wind whooshing]

578
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,934
- Nice robe.
- It's a kimono.

579
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,804
Went on a scavenger
hunt in Hadley's room.

580
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:58,072
Ooh, anything good?

581
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,773
Hm...

582
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,343
a collection of crime
novels, some lingerie,

583
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,744
Helmut Lang dress.

584
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,213
A pair of sunglasses that
are very Princess Grace,

585
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,515
- but I've seen better.
- Yeah,

586
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,116
Grace Jones is way better.

587
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,509
- And Grace Kelly?
- [Baxter] Yeah.

588
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,419
I was talking about
the sunglasses.

589
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,221
[Baxter] Oh.

590
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,157
I also have some
interesting information

591
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,492
about the lark.

592
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,861
[Baxter] Oh?

593
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:24,999
She knows about Jill.

594
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:28,269
How?

595
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:30,104
Did Margot tell her?

596
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:33,874
Yeah.

597
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,910
I mean, she was going to
find out sooner or later.

598
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,482
What did you say? The
eating disorder thing?

599
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,551
Yeah, but I feel like that
doesn't really hold up.

600
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:44,885
Who came up with the alien part?

601
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,820
Was it you or was it me?

602
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,231
Neither one of us should take
responsibility for that one.

603
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:50,124
That was a full collaboration.

604
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:51,959
You, me, and our friend, "K."

605
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,095
[chuckling] Oh, my God.

606
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,937
- [Maeve] Hello, friend.
- Care to join us?

607
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,873
Into the realm of
the spectacular.

608
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,278
That's a no.

609
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:14,915
I feel high.

610
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,184
Yeah, you just smoked weed.

611
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,555
[Baxter & Maeve]
Spin the wheel!

612
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,424
- [laughter]
- I can't.

613
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:27,127
[indistinct chattering]

614
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:30,130
[Baxter] Across the board.

615
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:33,334
[all] One, two, three,
four, five, six.

616
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,135
- I don't... Why.
- [Hadley] Okay.

617
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,237
- [laughing] Pick one.
- [Maeve] Oh, my gosh.

618
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,907
- [Hadley] What is it?
- Ooh.

619
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,284
- [Hadley laughing loudly]
- What'd you get?

620
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:42,476
What'd you get?

621
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,182
Well, it's not, like, a job.

622
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:52,086
[group laughing]

623
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,254
Yeah, I wanna know
what inspired everyone

624
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:55,465
- to become a lawyer.
- [Maeve] Um,

625
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,990
when I got into law school.

626
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,226
I actually applied
to medical, vet,

627
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,195
and law school, but I
only got into law school.

628
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:02,996
I didn't know about
the vet school.

629
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,341
[Maeve] I thought I told
you about my pet peacock.

630
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,100
- I had snakes.
- Of course you did.

631
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,635
- [Baxter] That's hot.
- No, it's not.

632
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,637
Do you know there are
3000 species of snakes?

633
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,338
- I did.
- [Maeve] No, you didn't.

634
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:13,273
- Yeah, I did.
- [Maeve] No, you didn't.

635
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:14,451
[Arthur] [indistinct]
vet school.

636
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,310
I didn't go to vet school.

637
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,345
[chuckling] That's
what I said.

638
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:20,548
[indistinct chatter]

639
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:24,151
I want... I want Baxter
to answer the question.

640
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:25,419
[Maeve] What question?

641
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,422
What inspired Baxter
to become a lawyer?

642
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:37,164
It was Jake. Jake inspired me.

643
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,167
- Who's Jake?
- [Baxter] He was my partner.

644
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,436
He died five years ago.

645
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,174
- Oh, I...
- [Baxter] Who's next?

646
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,143
- [Maeve] I'm next.
- [Baxter] Mm-mm.

647
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:52,246
[Maeve] I am next.
I'm gonna go.

648
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,315
[board game wheel whirring]

649
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:58,118
[crickets chirping]

650
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,591
Hey, I'm so sorry...

651
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,105
Oh, please, honey.
How could you know?

652
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:08,495
It doesn't make me sad.

653
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,098
I love who I am.
I love what I do.

654
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:12,499
And Jake's a part of that.

655
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,639
I didn't always want to
be a lawyer, you know.

656
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:20,307
I wanted to be a painter.

657
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,709
Really?

658
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,578
[inhaling audibly]

659
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,513
Every weekend in undergrad,

660
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:27,114
I'd take the train
into the city.

661
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,950
This little Georgia peach
never felt more at home

662
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:32,352
'til he made his way
to The Big Apple.

663
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,622
That's where I met Jake.

664
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,559
He was a painter in
the downtown scene.

665
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:40,595
Did these incredible nudes.

666
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:44,364
Like nothing I'd ever seen.
Everything he did had this...

667
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:46,734
pulse, you know?

668
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:50,037
Now, for some reason...

669
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:52,740
he decided to mentor me.

670
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:58,580
And for the next ten
years, everything was...

671
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,181
everything.

672
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,385
But then some of my friends
started to get sick.

673
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,364
You never think
it's gonna happen

674
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:09,657
to someone you love until...

675
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,159
it does.

676
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:13,761
[crickets chirping]

677
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,332
- Do you still paint?
- No.

678
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,401
Lost the impulse.

679
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,405
What about you, songbird?

680
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,710
What brought you
into the lion's den?

681
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:32,045
I don't know.

682
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,083
I think that there is
a lot of things wrong

683
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,184
with the world, and...

684
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,689
if I can have any part
in making it right...

685
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,759
I think that would be nice.

686
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:48,495
I know I'm wild.

687
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,431
But I'm wild like a wildfire.

688
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,267
And some things gotta burn.

689
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:58,338
Now, let's get out of this cold.

690
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,790
[chuckling] Do you want some?

691
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,661
Oh. Oh, no, I'm
fine. [laughing]

692
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,461
Where did Margot put the...

693
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,097
Yeah, she seemed
pretty preoccupied

694
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:25,232
writing her new book.

695
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:28,736
You talked to Margot?

696
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,573
Oh, yeah, we just had some
cocoa the other night.

697
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,844
Did she say anything about me?

698
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,747
[Lark] Not really.

699
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:43,450
You're smoking.

700
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:46,521
Huh?

701
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:47,631
[Lark] You're not
supposed to smoke inside.

702
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,723
You told Margot.

703
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:51,425
[chuckling]

704
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:53,661
Well...

705
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,730
I guess we're more
alike than I thought.

706
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,615

707
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,157

[mysterious music starts]

709
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:46,814
- Hello?
- [man over phone exhaling]

710
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:49,416
- Hello?
- [man] <i>Hello, Hadley?</i>

711
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,185
Yes.

712
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,955
[man] <i>I'm sorry to call so late,</i>

713
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,699
<i>but I wanted to tell you
that I'm just visiting mother</i>

714
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,692
<i>in the city, and...</i>

715
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,227
<i>I'm gonna catch a
train down tomorrow.</i>

716
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,429
<i>Yeah.</i>

717
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:04,532
<i>I know you're resistant to this,</i>

718
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:06,834
<i>but mother, she's
really been on me.</i>

719
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,536
<i>And she's kind of
been spiraling.</i>

720
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:10,203
<i>Uh, it was just
Jill's birthday and,</i>

721
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,707
<i>uh, I had this feeling.</i>

722
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,474
<i>I was just thinking
that I need to come.</i>

723
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:17,411
<i>Just for the day.
Hadley, is that okay?</i>

724
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:18,513
<i>Hello?</i>

725
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:21,481
Okay.

726
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:25,318
- [phone clicking]
- [music stopping abruptly]

727
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,357

- [Arthur cawing loudly]
- [Lark gasping]

730
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,970
Oh, my God. You scared me.

731
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:48,509
Stadius T. Warren, the third.

732
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,244
Hadley's childhood dog.

733
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,549
What are you doing out here?

734
00:36:56,884 --> 00:37:00,287
I'm a burgeoning alcoholic.
We feel best in the woods.

735
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,827
The phone rang
and it woke me up.

736
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,829
- Who was it?
- It was wrong number.

737
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,299
Are there a lot of pets
buried around here?

738
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,401
[Arthur] Pets, and...
Ah, I don't know.

739
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,738
Hadley and Margot summer
here, so, probably.

740
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,239
I had snakes.
It's more of a...

741
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,643
toilet burial situation.

742
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,515
[grunting] Not
great pets, though.

743
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,383
They're kind of
"escape or die."

744
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,586
Look out.

745
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,021
- Where are you going?
- The spot.

746
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,388
You can come if you want.

747
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,490
[crickets chirping]

748
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,263

[birds chirping]

752
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:08,421
Wow.

753
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,026
Yeah. I, uh...

754
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:14,929
it kinda calms me down out here.

755
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,764
Hard to hear myself
think over the...

756
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,576
All that stuff they
were talking about,

757
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,468
like, just stresses me out.

758
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,538
Like, "Ooh, your career,
and life," and then...

759
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:24,672
Why?

760
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,308
I did work really hard
to get here, um...

761
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:32,079
my family isn't like
Hadley's, so, uh,

762
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:34,549
I'm basically just, like,
a poor little orphan boy.

763
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,352
[birds continue chirping]

764
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:41,421
[gulps] We're more alike
than you think, Lark.

765
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,831
[shouting]

766
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:51,966
You ever do that?

767
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,402
You try. It's freeing.

768
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,604
Feels good.

769
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:57,705
Try.

770
00:38:58,506 --> 00:38:59,874
[laughing]

771
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,343
[yelling & laughing]

772
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:10,483
- [shouting]
- I won't look.

[laughing]

776
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:25,158
- It felt good, right?
- [Lark laughing]

777
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,069
- Yeah.
- Pretty good.

778
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,707
Come on.

779
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,076
[Lark shouting]

780
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,512

[door creaking open]

783
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,561
Hi. Happy fall break.

784
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:57,598
Oh, hi. Can I...
Can I help you?

785
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,800
Uh, Johan Bennett.

786
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,103
Um, I think we met
at orientation.

787
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,638
Uh, what was your name, again?

788
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:06,540
- Lark.
- Lark. Right.

789
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,608
Unique name.

790
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,176
Is Hadley here?

791
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:11,991
- What's going on?
- [Bennett] Hadley.

792
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,949
Johan. What are
you doing here?

793
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:19,220
Wha... I called you yesterday.
I... I said I was coming down.

794
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,588
You did?

795
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,089
Yeah, I... I... I talked to you.

796
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:24,692
I told you about how,
uh, I was coming down

797
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:25,860
to visit mother but, um...

798
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:27,173
[Hadley] That was
probably Maeve.

799
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,896
Well, I... I... I
brought you an...

800
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,865
You brought wine. Wonderful.

801
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,900
- Let's take a walk.
- Okay.

802
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,738
- Hi, hi.
- [Lark] Hey.

803
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,573
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

804
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,543
Ah.

805
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,054
Oh, yeah, I keep
forgetting you're new.

806
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,613
Pre-Arthur, those
two had a thing.

807
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,148
Got really intense.

808
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,816
They didn't actually
have a thing, Maeve.

809
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:49,784
But, he's definitely
in love with her.

810
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:50,885
[Maeve] Whatever.

811
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,197
[Lark] What happened
between her and Bennett?

812
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:56,123
At the end of first year,
we all came up here.

813
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,858
Bennett hosted a little retreat

814
00:40:57,892 --> 00:40:59,202
for some of his favorite
students from his seminar.

815
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,028
Basically us, Hadley
and her friends.

816
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,598
- [Maeve] And Jill.
- Right.

817
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:10,247
It's no wonder he's
not a teacher anymore.

818
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,173
He's basically, like,
an administrator now.

819
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:13,841
Wait, I thought he
still taught class.

820
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,676
Okay, like, one class
for second year.

821
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,980
Like, constitutional law
or some bullshit elective.

822
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,915
I really loved that class.

823
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:24,518
Anyway, the retreat weekend,
that was when Jill disappeared.

824
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:25,886
- [Baxter] Maeve!
- What?

825
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,964
I mean, she already
knows she exists.

826
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,723
Or, existed.

827
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,596
- She might still exist.
- [Maeve] That's true.

828
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:33,694
For the record, my memory of
that night is super blurry.

829
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,096
[Baxter] Mine too.

830
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:39,009
We're going to a pub in
town, do you wanna come?

831
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,644
[Baxter] It had a really
good, contentious name.

832
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:41,902
"The Fall of the Maiden."

833
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:43,571
Why is that contentious?

834
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:45,124
[Maeve] Doesn't
matter. You wanna come?

835
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,784
You know, I think I'm
good, I'm just gonna...

836
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,648
I'm gonna stay in and
catch up on some reading.

837
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,078
[whispering] Give
her the thing.

838
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:52,847
[Baxter] Yeah, but
it's in your purse.

839
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,024
- [Maeve] I don't have it.
- [Baxter mumbling]

840
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,916
[Maeve] Give her the thing,

841
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,794
give her the thing, he's
gonna give her the thing.

842
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:59,096
- [Lark] What is this?
- He's gonna give you the thing.

843
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,221
What's going on?

844
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:02,556
- [Maeve chuckling]
- [Maeve clears throat]

845
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,169
[Maeve & Baxter]
You're invited.

846
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,595
- You're invited.
- To this.

847
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:08,929
Starring us.

848
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,564
- Okay.
- You better be there.

849
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:12,233
Thank you, I'll...
I'll try my best.

850
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:19,874
[door slams shut]

851
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:24,145
♪

852
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,633
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

853
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:48,135
Really, it's fine.

854
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:54,809
Are you okay?

855
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,677
Yeah.

856
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:04,351
Johan showing up just
really threw me off.

857
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:07,254
Is he in love with you?

858
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:12,093
No, it's much more
complicated than that.

859
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:22,069
I... At one point, I believe
he saw something in me.

860
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:24,605
His seminar was my
first class at Quincy.

861
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:26,841
Nothing really
happened between us,

862
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:28,314
but people like to
think that it did.

863
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,211
You know?

864
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:32,313
Except that one time
when he made out

865
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,948
with me at Friedman's.

866
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,017
You know that bar?

867
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,185
On Church Street.

868
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,121
He's a regular.

869
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:42,323
You go there any Thursday,
you'll see him in his booth.

870
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:44,825
Do you want some?

871
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,028
So, he's a burgeoning
alcoholic, too?

872
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,065
He's what?

873
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,135
