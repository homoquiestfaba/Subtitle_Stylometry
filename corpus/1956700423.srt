- Good to see ya.

Yeah, what's going on?
Where's your turkey today?

Uh, my sister's house.

15
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,118
My mom just moved in
over there,

16
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:22,184
so we're doing Thanksgiving.

17
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,417
Oh, nice, man. Nice.

18
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:24,917
Well, say hi to your mom
and Beth for me.

19
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,917
I will. You still reffin'
the Catholic League games?

20
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:28,218
Little bit, here and there.

21
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,650
Yeah, my oldest
is at UC Santa Cruz.

22
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,517
So, you know,
every little bit helps, right?

23
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,317
You bet.
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

24
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:34,650
Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie.
Good seeing ya.

26
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,484

Glad you could make it.

37
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:15,917
No problem.
How's the car business?

38
00:04:15,984 --> 00:04:17,084
It is going good.

39
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:18,051
- Thank you for asking.
- Good.

00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:19,283
Would you like some wine?

41
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,051
No. I have some.
Thank you very much.

Don't tickle me!
No, no, no.

45
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,951
- Uncle Jack's getting tickled.
- Hi, sweetheart.

46
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,317
- Hi, Mom.
- [Anne] Mmm.

47
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,517
- Hello, sweetheart.
- [Jack] All right. Good.

00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:32,851
- Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

49
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,550
- [Jack] Sorry I'm late.
- Really?

50
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,550
Yeah.

51
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:36,717
Some people call
when they're late.

52
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:38,350
I didn't have
my phone with me.

53
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,417
Oh. Well,
then why have a phone

54
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:41,751
if you're not gonna use it?

55
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:42,984
I don't know.
That's a good question.

56
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,051
How you doing, buddy?

57
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,517
- I'm good.
- Good to see you.

58
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,283
[Beth] I don't understand
why somebody has a phone

59
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,684
if they don't ever answer it.

60
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,118
[Jack] Can I have
some of those potatoes, Mom?

61
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,051
[Anne] Do you want
some potatoes?

62
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,684
[Jack] Thank you so much.

63
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,984
[Jack] <i>Did your mom ever
tell you about our fish tank</i>

64
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:55,951
- when we were kids?
- No.

65
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:58,484
Well, your grandmother
took us to the pet store

66
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,650
and we got a fish tank,

67
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:00,951
you know,
a bunch of cool fish.

68
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,218
And I came from school
the next day,

69
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,283
and the fish tank
was filled with shampoo.

70
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,118
[chuckles]
And all the fish were dead.

71
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,383
And your mom was there crying.

72
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,751
And Grandma said,

73
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:10,884
"Why'd you put shampoo
in the fish tank?"

74
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:12,151
And your mom said,

75
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,051
"I wanted to give
the fish a bubble bath."

76
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,484
[both laugh]

77
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,051
Why'd she give
the fish a bubble bath?

78
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,484
You're gonna have to ask
your mom. I don't know.

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,517
I guess she always wanted
to take care of everybody.

80
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,218
Mwah. I love you.

81
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,751
Don't let your mom
near those fish.

82
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,184
[chuckles]

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,884
Good night, Uncle Jack.

84
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:30,350
[Jack] Good night, chief.

85
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:35,984
Hey.

86
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:37,250
Hey.

87
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:42,550
How's Mom, uh, settling in?

88
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:46,584
Uh, good. Yeah, really good.
She seems to be.

89
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,317
Can't believe
you got her outta Seaside.

90
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,517
Right? It's different now.

91
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,051
It's just all,
like, young kids...

92
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,417
- Yeah.
- ...and little couples...

93
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:57,417
running around, families.

94
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,650
I think she was feeling
like a castaway out there.

95
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:03,484
[yawns] Yeah, you did good.
I'm glad she's here.

96
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,417
What's going on with you?
What's new?

97
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,617
Not much.

98
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,417
Are you seeing anybody?

99
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:14,984
[scoffs] No.

100
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,851
- I wish you would.
- [sighs]

101
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,450
I really do.

102
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:20,118
I would feel much better.

103
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,417
I hate the idea of you

104
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:22,617
down there by yourself
all the time.

105
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,417
What do you hate
about it so much?

106
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,218
That you're,
you know, just alone.

107
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:30,717
Just drinking
all the time and...

108
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:31,951
I'm fine.

109
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,951
I appreciate it.
But it's... I'm fine.

110
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:45,650
I know that Ang worries
about you, so...

111
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,917
What does Ang
have to do with it?

112
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:50,517
Why do you know
what Ang would worry about?

113
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,917
Because she called

114
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:53,550
and she wanted to see
how you were doing.

115
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,484
- She called you?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,450
- Why?
- Is that okay?

117
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,817
I don't know.

118
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,283
I mean, what, she called you
to talk about me?

119
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,584
Why didn't she just
call me directly?

120
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,817
She just wanted to see
how you're doing.

121
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,218
Well... I...

122
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:09,584
I'm fine.

123
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,017
Look, I know
Kathy Collins says

124
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:19,417
she sees your car outside
Harold's bar every night.

125
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,317
Well, if Kathy Collins
says it,

126
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:23,584
- must be true.
- Mmm-hmm.

127
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,884
You know that
something must be wrong.

128
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,383
So, I go to work,

129
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,084
and then after work
sometimes I go have a beer.

130
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm just saying...

131
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,317
You better start
calling people.

132
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,417
- Okay.
- Better get on

133
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,051
- this fucking case.
- Okay.

134
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,717
She has other things maybe
she ought to be worrying about

135
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,417
instead of worrying
about how much I drink.

136
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:38,784
I mean, she needs
to worry about staying out

137
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,550
- of her fucking refrigerator.
- Nice.

138
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,317
She's losing a huge war
against the refrigerator.

139
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,617
What are you talking about?
Jack...

140
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:44,951
She needs to find
the fucking treadmill.

141
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,218
Stop it. That is so mean.
She's my friend.

142
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,684
Well, she should
mind her business.

143
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,017
- Okay.
- That's why I don't come here.

144
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,051
'Cause it always turns to...

145
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,317
[can clatters]

146
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,417
[chair scrapes]

147
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:55,650
Which one of the 20 bedrooms

148
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,383
am I supposed to be
staying in?

149
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:19,150
Take the second one
on the left.

150
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,050
[Jack] Hey, Ang, it's Jack.

151
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:29,651
I'm just, uh...
Happy Thanksgiving.

152
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,084
[inhales deeply]

153
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,850
I wanted to call you,
see how you're doing.

154
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:37,750
And also because
my sister told me

155
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,917
that you had called her

156
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:43,384
and wanted to know
how I was doing.

157
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:48,883
I'm just saying, if you want
to know in the future

158
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,517
how I'm doing,

159
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,384
you can call me,

160
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:58,484
as I still have
the same phone number

161
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,150
that I had...

162
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,017
when we were married.

163
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,217
[on phone]
<i>Hey, Jack, it's Miguel.</i>

164
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,184

165

<i>Sofia was asking about you.</i>

166
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,917
<i>Thought I'd give you a call
and see how you're doing.</i>

167
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,217
<i>Thought maybe
we'd have you over...</i>

169
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,618

<i>If that doesn't work,
we can chat in the morning.</i>

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,050
<i>Thanks, Jack.
God bless.</i>

177
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,484
[footsteps approaching]

178
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,084
[Betty] Hello, Jack. [chuckles]

179
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,217
Hi.

180
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,417
[Betty] How are you?
Come on in.

181
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,084
[Jack] Thanks so much.

182
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,984
[Betty] So, did you have
a nice Thanksgiving?

183
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,150
[Jack] I did. How about you?

184
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:21,817
[Betty] Oh, it was very nice.

185
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,984
All the kids
and the grandkids were in.

186
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,417
- I was in my glory. [laughs]
- I bet.

187
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:28,817
- Good for you.
- Oh.

188
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,317
You can go right in here.

189
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,984
Father Devine
is just finishing up a call.

190
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,850
So, he will be out
in just a couple of minutes,

191
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,750
so just make
yourself comfortable.

192
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,484
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

193
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,750
We are all so excited

194
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:47,584
at the idea
of you possibly coming back

195
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:50,317
to be with us at Hayes.
[chuckles]

196
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,451
It's nice to see you again,
Jack.

197
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,750
[door opens]

198
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,783
[Father Edward] Hello, Jack.

199
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,184
Hey, Father.

200
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,684
It's good to see you.
Thanks for making the drive.

201
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,883
Sure. No problem.

202
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,384
Sit down, please.

203
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:50,351
So, been a while, hasn't it?

204
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,950
Yeah. Since, uh...

205
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,050
my father's funeral.

206
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:55,451
- That long?
- Mmm.

207
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:58,384
My goodness.
Where does the time go?

208
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,551
- If I knew, I would tell ya.
- [chuckles]

209
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,050
Married?

210
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,451
I'm separated now.
For a while.

211
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,684
Any children?

212
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,517
No kids.

213
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:08,950
Okay. [chuckles lightly]

214
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,184
Well, Jack, it is really good
to see you again.

215
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:14,618
And I suppose you're wondering
why I called you over here.

216
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:17,084
I'm a little curious. Yeah.

217
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,817
Our basketball coach,
Tom McGarrity,

218
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:20,284
had a heart attack
the other night.

219
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,351
Oh, no.

220
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,050
He's expected
to make a full recovery,

221
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,917
but his wife doesn't think
it's a very good idea

222
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,384
for him to return to the team.

223
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,484
And I tend to agree.

224
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,718
We need a new coach, Jack.

225
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,284
You're the first person
I thought of.

226
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,251
Try to suppress
your enthusiasm.

227
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,850
No, I appreciate it.
I just... It's, um...

228
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:42,984
You know, it's just,
I've been away

229
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,417
from the game for a long time.

230
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:45,883
I understand. I understand.

231
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,984
You know, I've never
even coached before.

232
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,084
I just played, so I don't...

233
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,950
Is the, uh... I mean...

234
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:53,584
Is the team any good?

235
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,217
- No. No.
- [both chuckle]

236
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:58,251
We haven't been competitive
for quite a while, actually.

237
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,684
In fact, the last time
they made the playoffs?

238
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,150
Back when you were playing.

239
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,484
Wow.

240
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,618
Well, I really appreciate you
thinking of me, Father.

241
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:08,783
It's just, I...

242
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,184
Go home
and think it over, Jack.

243
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,284
I got a lot going on
in my life right now.

244
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,351
It's very busy.

245
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,084
Go home, think it over.

246
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,618
Call me with your decision
in the morning.

247
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:17,917
Tomorrow morning?

248
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,584
Our next game
is Monday night, Jack.

249
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,284
I don't have a lot of time.

250
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,750
[Jack] <i>Hey, Father,
listen, I...</i>

251
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,950
[chewing] Mmm...
Thank you so much

252
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:35,184
for thinking of me. Um...

253
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:41,084
It's just not the right time
for me to take this on. Um...

254
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,284
You know, my life's very full
right now. Very full.

255
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,551
I just, um...

256
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:53,618
I've just been away from the
game for so long, you know?

257
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:56,017
I've just been away
from the game for so long.

258
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,084
Father...

259
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,417
<i>Listen, I've given it a lot of
thought, and I appreciate it.</i>

260
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:10,817
<i>It's just not the right time
for me right now.</i>

261
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,684
I've been away from the game
for so long.

262
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,084
I don't think I can help you.

263
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,783
I don't think...

264
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,184
I don't think I can help you.

265
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:20,817
I don't think I can help you.

266
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,117
Father. Jack.

267
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,883
Not gonna happen. [chuckles]

268
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,284
[sighs]

269
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,417
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

270
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:36,517
The team can't play.

271
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,551
They're no good.
They're no good.

272
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:38,883
I can't wave a magic wand,

273
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,284
turn them into
fucking Michael Jordan.

274
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,783
I mean, just...

275
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,317
<i>I don't know.</i>

276
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:50,817
<i>Maybe.</i>

277
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,184
I don't know.

278
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,017
<i>I can't help you with this.</i>

279
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,217
<i>I can't help you
with this team.</i>

280
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,783
[inaudible]

281
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:30,351
<i>Father, I've given it
a lot of thought.</i>

282
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,084
I just have no interest

283
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,217
in coaching
your fucking basketball team.

284
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,783
[urinating]

285
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,351
That's all there is to it.

286
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,351
Oh, fuck.

287
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,251
[sighs]

288
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,251
- [Sam] Get back on D!
- [ball thudding]

289
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,783
- [Dan] Make up for it.
- [sneakers squeaking]

290
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,917
[Marcus] What the fuck?

291
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:15,184
[Kenny] Hey, G. G!

292
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:21,217
[Dan] D up! Hey, get back!
Let's go! Let's go!

293
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,217
Move! Go quick!
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

294
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,950
[Sam] Stop him up top.
Chubbs, go to the wing.

295
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,217
Watch it.
Screen, screen, screen.

296
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,050
[Marcus] Yo, get through,
get through.

297
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:32,817
Get through that.

298
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,718
- [Chubbs] Hey, Freeze.
- [Kenny] Go!

299
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,417
- [Dan] Good pass.
- [Sam] Come on!

300
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:37,783
- [Chubbs] Hey, nice job, D-boy.
- [Marcus] What's up, Chubbs?

301
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,184
[players continue shouting]

302
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,251
[Dan] Hey, Coach.

303
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,317
Dan Espinosa.
Nice to meet ya.

304
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:44,984
- You're the assistant?
- I am.

305
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,351
Uh, I also teach algebra
here at the school.

306
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,651
Uh, I really appreciate you
stepping up like this.

307
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,783
It means a lot to the boys.

308
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,251
Um, do you want me
to call everybody in,

309
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,850
- do some intros?
- No, that's okay. Just, uh...

310
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,517
- [Sam] Take the layup, Marcus!
- [Marcus] Money!

311
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,451
[Jack] Just get a feel for
what I'm working with here.

312
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,517
[Dan] Yeah.

313
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,783
This the whole team? Ten kids?

314
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,417
That's all we've got.

315
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:04,417
A lot different than
when you played here, huh?

316
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:05,517
Yeah. No shit.

317
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,284
We got 100 kids just try out.

318
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,217
104 my senior year.

319
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:10,284
Play ball here?

320
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,384
Well, not like you.

321
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,017
Spent most of my time
on the bench,

322
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,750
holding a clipboard
like I am now.

323
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,451
I was a couple of years
behind you. Uh, class of '98.

324
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:22,584
Enrollment's really taken
a dive since then.

325
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,251
[Sam] Freeze, Freeze, Freeze!

326
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,184
I can run down
the starting five, if you like.

327
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,984
- [Sam] Box out!
- Sure.

328
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,917
So, uh, the kid with the ball,
that's Brandon Durrett.

329
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,551
[Jack]
Relation to Russ Durrett?

330
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,417
[Dan] Yeah, that's his son.

331
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:34,718
He's a great player.

332
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:36,584
Really has a good feel
for the game.

333
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:38,651
Easily our most talented guy.

334
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:41,718
And then, um, playing
besides him in the backcourt,

335
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,251
that's Chubbs Hendricks.

336
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,950
His, uh, real name's Ronald.

337
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,783
- [Marcus] Oh, yeah.
- [Chubbs] Right here, this man.

338
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,618
[Dan] And, um,
Kenny Dawes out on the wing.

339
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:53,084
Bit of a showboat, but, uh...

340
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,384
Yeah, he's a solid shooter.

341
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,917
- Whoo!
- [Dan] Good long-range stroke.

342
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,317
[Sam] Get back! Get back!

343
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,684
[Dan] And Sam Garcia,
he's our senior captain.

344
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,584
Not much of a scoring threat,
but he's a solid defender.

345
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:03,651
Good kid.

346
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,317
And then Marcus Parrish.

347
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,217
- [Marcus] Money!
- [Dan] That is our center.

348
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,551
[Marcus] What the fuck
are you doing, bro?

349
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,817
[Jack] That kid's the center?

350
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:10,817
- [Dan] Yeah.
- [Jack] What is he, 6'4"?

351
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,084
Shut the fuck up, man.

352
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,351
6'3".

353
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,150
You guys must get murdered
on the boards.

354
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:17,584
Yeah, it's not
been good at all.

355
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:19,251
[Sam] You're giving 'em
open buckets, Marcus.

356
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,750
[Marcus] This is practice, man.
I don't care.

357
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,184
Who's that kid there?
The white shadow.

358
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,950
Oh, yeah,
that's, uh, Bobby Freeze.

359
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,317
He's our sixth man.

360
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,451
He's actually
a starting strong safety

361
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:29,984
for the football team.

362
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,584
Then the rest of the guys, uh,

363
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,150
Dearborn, Daly, Carter,
and Amato.

364
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:36,883
I had to bring
those guys up from JV

365
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,718
just so we could
hold a practice.

366
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:39,883
- [Sam] Take the layup!
- [Marcus] Money!

367
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,718
[Carter] Come on, box out!

368
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:43,584
All right.
Blow the whistle for me.

369
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,050
- [Sam] Freeze. Chill out, man.
- [Freeze] Yo, take it easy, man.

370
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:46,384
- [whistles blows]
- [Sam] Stop grabbing me.

371
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,017
[Freeze] That's clean.
That's clean D.

372
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,718
[Dan] Bring it in. Let's go.
Hustle, hustle.

373
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:52,050
All right, guys.
As discussed,

374
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:55,384
I am honored to turn things
over to your new head coach,

375
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:56,651
Jack Cunningham.

376
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,184
[players] What's up, Coach?

377
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,651
- [Jack] How you doing, guys?
- [players] Good. Good.

378
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:01,584
[Marcus] What's up, Coach?

379
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,150
[Jack] You're Marcus, right?

380
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:05,950
That's right. Get used
to calling my name, too.

381
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,317
[both chuckle]

382
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,217
All right. All right.

383
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:11,117
Marcus, tell me
what you see out there.

384
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,718
[Marcus] Um...

385
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:17,317
[exhales] I see Nikki's
fine ass keep looking at me.

386
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:18,317
Saw she was bending over.

387
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:19,817
She tryin'
to get my attention.

388
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:21,517
Marcus,
just be respectful, please.

389
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,017
He asked me what I saw. What,
do you want me to lie to him?

390
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,284
- You know what I see, Marcus?
- What?

391
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,451
You're the tallest player
on the team.

392
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:26,950
Oh.

393
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,150
Makes me wonder why you're
putting three-pointers up

394
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:29,618
every time
you come down the court.

395
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:32,184
Oh, that's 'cause I got
a candy-stroke, Coach.

396
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,417
Ask Coach Dan.

397
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,184
I made the most threes
on the team last year.

398
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,950
Coach Dan, how many threes
did Marcus make last year?

399
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:39,783
[Dan] Um, Marcus...

400
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,684
made 34.

401
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,883
[Jack] Outta how many attempts?

402
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,284
- [Dan] Out of 130.
- [players laugh]

403
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,817
[Jack] What's that
a percentage of?

404
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,584
For a percentage of 26.

405
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,718
[players] Damn!

406
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:51,718
26%, Marcus.

407
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:52,984
You wanna know why
they're leaving you open?

408
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,351
It's 'cause they don't think

409
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:55,850
you could hit the ocean
from the beach.

410
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,217
- [players laugh]
- [Chubbs] Oh, shit.

411
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:59,251
Yo, he just spit facts
at your ass, bro.

412
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,684
Man, shut up.

413
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,351
[Chubbs] Look it, come on, man.
Don't get all butt-hurt

414
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,917
just 'cause he droppin'
some knowledge on you.

415
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,584
You wanna see butt-hurt?
Keep talking shit,

416
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,050
- watch me beat your fat ass.
- [Chubbs] Shut the fuck up, yo.

417
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,584
- You ain't gonna do shit.
- [Jack] Hey.

418
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,317
I don't need any help.

419
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:15,384
Who is second in threes
on the team?

420
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:18,850
Number two would be
Kenny with 25.

421
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,217
- Outta how many attempts?
- [Dan] Sixty-one.

422
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:22,251
Percentage of?

423
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,384
- [Dan] Forty-one.
- [Kenny exclaims]

424
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:25,817
Snap. You hear that?

425
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,117
Give me the rock,
let me go HAM on some bitches.

426
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,651
Yeah, more like
ham and cheese, man.

427
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,384
Nah, actually, ham and cheese
is what your sister

428
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,984
fries me up after I'm done
fiddling her bean.

429
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,251
Yo, show some respect.
Coach is here, man.

430
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,917
[Freeze] Watch your mouth, man.

431
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:35,984
- [Chubbs] Kenny, get in line.
- [Kenny] A'ight.

432
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,551
[Jack] All right, run it back.

433
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:39,017
Marcus, this time your feet
don't leave the paint.

434
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,251
- Brandon.
- [Chubbs] All right. Let's go.

435
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,517
- Come on.
- [Marcus] Let's go, y'all.

436
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:43,484
You're the point guard, right?

437
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,984
Put 'em in a motion offense.

438
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,251
- [Brandon] Chubbs.
- [Jack] Call it out, Brandon.

439
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,117
Don't just wave your hand
in the air.

440
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,584
Doesn't talk much, does he?

441
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,850
[Dan] I have been coaching
that kid for three years

442
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,150
and I can count on one hand

443
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:58,618
how many times
our conversations

444
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,651
have gone past,
"Yes, Coach" and "No, Coach."

445
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,351
- [Chubbs] Good shot, baby.
- [Marcus] And that's money!

446
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,084
[Dan] Here you go.

447
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,917
Keys, game balls, and then
I put together a flash drive

448
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,684
just in case
you want to get familiar

449
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,050
with the sets
we've been running.

450
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,451
I'm also gonna give you
my phone number

451
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,718
if you have any questions.

452
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,217
Okay.

453
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:20,783
Hey, why didn't you
take the job?

454
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,184
- Huh?
- Would've made sense.

455
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:24,850
The assistant coach,
step in, take the job.

456
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:28,084
My mom has MS, so...

457
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,817
My sister takes care of her
during the day,

458
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,517
but she's got
three kids of her own.

459
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,651
So I take nights.

460
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:35,150
Sure.

461
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:36,451
Then with practices,
and then you have scouting...

462
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:38,050
Yeah, no. Of course.
It makes sense.

463
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:39,217
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

464
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,517
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

465
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,850
No, no, no. It's cool.

466
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,817
We all have our own cross
to bear, right?

467
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,850
Um... So you should be good.

468
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,451
Great.
Thank you very much.

469
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,517
No problem.

470
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:51,917
[exhales]

471
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:53,817
- Oh, Coach.
- Yep?

472
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:55,917
What's the dress code like
these days?

473
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,384
Oh. Coat and tie
for the head coach.

474
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,184
- Great. Thanks.
- Sure. No problem.

475
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,950
- [sighs]
- [ball bouncing]

476
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:16,783
[player 1] Yeah!

477
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,684
[player 2] Right here,
right here. Yeah!

478
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,950
[player 3] Here we go!

479
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,384
[player 4] Yeah!

480
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:24,384
[Sam] Take the shot.

481
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,484
That's you, Marcus.

482
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,451
Hey, Jack. Nice to see you
in the gym again.

483
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:30,517
[Jack] Thanks.

484
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,150
[Sam] That's you.

485
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:35,384
Jack, this is
Father Mark Whelan.

486
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,950
He is our team chaplain.

487
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,317
Pleasure to meet you, Jack.

488
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,384
You too.

489
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,684
Any first game jitters?

490
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,284
Fuck. I'm nervous as shit.

491
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,150
[chuckles] Yeah.

492
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:45,850
- What's this?
- [Dan] Oh.

493
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,783
They do it before every game.
Gets them psyched up, I guess.

494
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,251
- [buzzer rings]
- [Chubbs] Let's go!

495
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,651
All right, let's go.
Bring it in.

496
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:53,351
[indistinct shouting]

497
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,317
- [Dan] Ready?
- No.

498
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,718
[Freeze] Let's go.

499
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,517
[Jack] All right, guys.
Let's see what we're made of.

500
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,783
[Jack] And the big burly inmate
says, "Don't worry about it.

501
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,084
Everything's gonna be fine.

502
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,217
I just want to play
a little game."

503
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:10,384
He goes, "Okay."

504
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:12,150
And he says,
"In this game, you can pick

505
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,584
whether or not you want to be
the husband or the wife."

506
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,317
And he says, "All right."
"Well?"

507
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,850
"Well, guess I'll be
the husband."

508
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,251
He goes, "Okay.

509
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:20,917
Come on over here
and suck your wife's dick."

510
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,950
- [laughter]
- That's a good one.

511
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:24,750
"Suck your wife's dick."
I fucking love that.

512
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,084
Hey, Doc.

513
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,317
[Doc] Hey.
How'd opening night go, ace?

514
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,783
Yeah, our boy got sent
to the woodshed.

515
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,384
Hey, get Doc a drink, will ya?
And hit me with another one.

516
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:35,651
Doc, did I ever tell you

517
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,284
the one about
the nerdy accountant

518
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,984
who does 15 years
for embezzlement?

519
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,517
- Don't worry about me.
- [Doc] I'm not. I know.

520
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,850
Just let me do... do my thing.

521
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:45,950
Do your thing.

522
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,750
All right. I appreciate it.

523
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:50,317
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna...

524
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:53,084
- All right. Good night, Doc.
- [Doc] Good night.

525
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,184
[unlocks glove box]

526
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,584
[Chubbs] Get your man!
Get your man!

527
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,017
Come on!

528
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:55,750
[Sam] Watch him.

529
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,618
[voicemail]
<i>Jackie! It's Miguel again.</i>

530
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:16,251
<i>Just checking in to see</i>

531
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:18,217
<i>if you got my call
about David's birthday party.</i>

532
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,651
<i>Give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

533
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:23,417
[Angela] <i>Hey, it's me.
I know it's late notice,</i>

534
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:27,050
<i>but I'm gonna be down by you
for a client visit tomorrow</i>

535
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,850
<i>and wanted to see if you

536
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,351
<i>Anyway, call me
when you get this.</i>

537
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,883
- Hi.
- Hey.

538
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,050
Sorry I'm late.

539
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,850
Damn bus broke down on
the 710. It was a nightmare.

540
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,317
[Jack] I just got here.

541
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:55,883
Okay.

542
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,517
[Jack] You look good.

543
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,618
Thanks. You too.

544
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,484
How's the new job working out?

545
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:03,184
[Angela groans]

546
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:05,718
It's insurance. It's boring,
but it pays the bills.

547
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:06,950
Good.

548
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:09,817
Heard you're
coaching basketball.

549
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,117
Beth tell you that?

550
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:12,184
Yeah.

551
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,618
So, you having fun?

552
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,017
Yeah.

553
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:18,783
I'd be having more fun
if we won a game...

554
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,584
[Angela chuckles]

555
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:22,184
...but keeps me occupied.

556
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:24,451
Keeps my mind
off other things.

557
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,718
Good. I was worried about you.

558
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:30,783
What were you worried
about me for?

559
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:35,950
You weren't
moving on with your life.

560
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:39,050
You were seeing the world
in some dark ways.

561
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,783
Why? Are you?

562
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,883
Seeing the world in dark ways?

563
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,883
Moving on with your life.

564
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:56,984
Uh-oh.

565
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:06,284
What's his name?

566
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:12,783
Nick.

567
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,451
How'd you guys meet?

568
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,217
Through mutual friends.

569
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,117
How long has it been
going on for?

570
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,451
Few months.

571
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:33,451
Few months? What, like,
six months? Eight months?

572
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:35,251
Okay. All right. Come on.

573
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,150
[waitress] You know
what we want for lunch?

574
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,417
Um...

575
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,750
Just give us a second,
actually. Thank you.

576
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,084
[waitress] Sure.

577
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:57,050
I wanted to tell you myself

578
00:28:57,117 --> 00:28:59,017
before you found out
through one of our friends.

579
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:09,417
Say something, Jack.

580
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,718
What do you want me to say?

581
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:15,050
- "Congratulations"?
- No.

582
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:16,084
Completely fucking blindsided
by this.

583
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,584
Not "congratulations."

584
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:21,150
Blindsided? We've been
separated for over a year.

585
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,017
Will I see you
at the birthday party?

586
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:37,850
What?

587
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:40,351
Miguel and Sofia.

588
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,817
They're having
a birthday party for David.

589
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:45,384
Said he called you
a few times.

590
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:52,351
Let me know
if you want to go together.

591
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,184
Bye.

592
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,351
[Eric] Jackie hits
his second free throw

593
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,484
and he just holds his hand
like this in the air

594
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,084
for like 30 seconds.

595
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,184
Purcell says,
"Jackie, you keep holding

596
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,384
your hand like that and
Eric's gonna ask you out."

597
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,417
[patrons laughing]

598
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:43,317
Fifty-five points, man.

599
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,950
- [Russ] To the legend.
- [patrons] Yeah.

600
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,417
[man] You gotta dim the lights
for the man.

601
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:48,184
- [Russ] To the legend.
- [man 2] To the legend.

602
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,609
[patrons laughing
and talking indistinctly]

603
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,775
[Jack] Get the fuck outta here.

604
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,475
[man] Why the fuck
do I need a sausage?

605
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,343
He was like, "It's a PK.
It's a Polish kielbasa."

606
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:58,876
[patrons laughing]

607
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,709
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Jack] Ah. Yeah.

608
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,009
[Doc] Fellas. Evening, boys.

609
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,909
[patrons cheer]

610
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:07,508
[Eric] We're talking
old times here.

611
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,109
[Doc] I know
what you're talking,

612
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:10,709
and I'm telling you it's time
for him to get going.

613
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,309
Come on, let's go now.
Come on. Let's go.

614
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,876
- I'm up.
- No, you're not.

615
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:17,209
- Now you are!
- [patrons cheer]

616
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,375
[all laughing]

617
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,976
I'm up.

618
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,209
[patrons] Whoa!

619
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,508
- Shit.
- There you go. That's it.

620
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:25,675
[man] Where are you
taking my friend?

621
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,142
Where are you
taking my friend?

622
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:28,909
[patrons continue chattering]

623
00:31:40,408 --> 00:31:43,909
[Father Mark] Okay, okay.
Uh, where's Kenny?

624
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:47,475
Kenny is the only one missing.
Kenny and Coach.

625
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,642
[Kenny] I just want you to know
that I respect you, a'ight?

626
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,042
- And I love you.
- [girl] Hmm.

627
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,675
Every time that ball
goes through the hoop,

628
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:53,976
I'm gonna be
thinking about you.

629
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,375
- Kenny.
- Okay? And that goes through

630
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,542
- the hoop a lot.
- Kenny, let's go!

631
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:57,976
- The bus is waiting.
- Okay.

632
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,042
Hey, what up, Coach?

633
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:02,209
- Bye.
- Uh... Yeah.

634
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:03,408
- You'll text me?
- Yeah, I'll text you after.

635
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:04,408
- Okay. Cool.
- Okay.

636
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:05,508
Hey, what's going on, man?

637
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:06,876
[girl] Good luck!

638
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,042
Oh, thanks.

639
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:09,142
[Jack] You better watch out.

640
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:10,642
Priests catch you doing that

641
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,209
and you're gonna be spending
your weekends here.

642
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,842
[Kenny] Nah, but it makes
my game better though, Coach.

643
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:18,142
[crowd chanting] <i>Memorial!</i>

644
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:21,842
Memorial! Memorial!

Memorial!

648
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,742
Memorial!

649

[player] Let's go.

652
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:41,609
[Devon] Hold on, hold on.

653
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,276
I want to talk to you.

654
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,109
These scrubs ain't worthy of
being on the same court as us.

655
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:48,575
- [chanting continues]
- [players talk indistinctly]

656
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:51,842
[crowd cheering]

657
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,508
[crowd chanting]

658
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,842
- Hey, Coach.
- [Lombardo] Hey, Coach.

659
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,209
How are ya?

660
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,009
Good, good. I heard you got
a new general in charge.

661
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,609
Yeah. Jack Cunningham.

662
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,309
Yeah. I'm surprised you could
keep him out of the bar

663
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,809
long enough to hold practice.

664
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,675
[crowd continues chanting
and cheering]

665
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,876
Coach Lombardo.

666
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:22,042
Jack Cunningham.

667
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,909
He says that
like I don't know who he is.

668
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:25,508
He's the best
high school basketball player

669
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,109
I've ever seen.

670
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,742
Listen, I was front row when
he hung 47 against Trinity

671
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,442
at the Catholic League semis.

672
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,508
Got quite a team there, Coach.
21's a hell of a ball player.

673
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:36,909
Yeah. So, how ya liking
coaching so far?

674
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,909
[Jack] Great. Just getting
used to the players.

675
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,575
What players?

676
00:33:40,642 --> 00:33:42,709
Ah, I'm just breaking
your stones, Jack.

677
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,709
- Good luck.
- You can have the luck.

678
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,408
I'll take the thoroughbreds.

679
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,009
What an asshole this guy is.

680
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,575
Yeah, big time.

681
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:53,775
[players yelling and cheering]

682
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:02,442
[buzzer rings]

683
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:03,742
Let's go. Bring it in.

684
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:04,942
[Sam] Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

685
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,076
[Chubbs] Holy shit.

686
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,508
[Sam] Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

687
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:09,876
Chubbs. Hey!

688
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:12,109
No more dancing.

689
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,243
Coach, are you serious?

690
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:15,276
Yeah. I'm serious.

691
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:16,609
We're one in nine.

692
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:17,675
You're out there
jumping around

693
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:18,809
like you hit the Powerball.

694
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:20,575
You're embarrassing yourself.

695
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,109
Win a few games, we can
talk about bringing it back.

696
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:24,442
But for now,
that act's retired. Got it?

697
00:34:24,508 --> 00:34:25,842
Yeah.

698
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,775
- [brass band playing music]
- [crowd cheering]

699
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,742
- [Devon] One, two, three.
- [players] Memorial!

700
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,976
- [whistle blows]
- [crowd cheers]

701
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,909
[Chubbs] Hey. Help, help.

702
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:48,109
- [crowd cheers]
- Let's go!

703
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:50,542
[crowd chants]

704
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:52,009
Motion, motion.

705
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:53,475
[player] Let's go!
Bring him through.

706
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,042
[Kenny] Hey, hey.

707
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,475
[Sam] Back up, back up.

708
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:02,942
[crowd] Oh, yeah!

709
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,976
[Jack] Show hands.
Let's go, guys.

710
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:08,042
You guys gotta move.

711
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:09,343
[crowd] Oh, yeah!

712
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,176
[Devon] Let's go.
Lock him up. Lock him up.

713
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,742
[crowd chanting]

714
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,375
- [Jack] Fuck.
- [Devon] Come on.

715
00:35:15,442 --> 00:35:16,675
[crowd cheers]

716
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:19,142
Time-out!

717
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,375
[Lombardo] Get over here.
All right. Listen up.

718
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:24,475
[Freeze] Come on. Fuck.

719
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,508
[Sam] Get back. Get back!

720
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:28,976
[crowd cheers]

721
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:36,609
[cheering]

722
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:37,942
[whistle blows]

723
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:42,009
[crowd chanting]
Defense, defense, defense!

724
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,408
[Marcus] Back screen,
back screen.

725
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,076
You guys gotta move!
Set picks!

726
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:47,142
Then squeeze!

727
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,276
[chanting continues]

728
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:51,375
Go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

729
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,559
[Amato] Shoot!

730
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,659
Watch the clock!

731
00:35:55,726 --> 00:36:00,626
[crowd] Five, four,
three, two, one!

732
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,926
[whistle blows]

733
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,959
[crowd shouting]

734
00:36:04,026 --> 00:36:05,093
Time-out!

735
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:06,726
[blows whistle]

736
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,692
- Full time-out.
- Let's go. Bring it in.

737
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:09,759
[Dan] Come on. Let's go.

738
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:10,959
[Jack] Nobody sits down.

739
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:12,959
Stand up. Stand up.

740
00:36:13,026 --> 00:36:14,325
I thought I said
to force him left.

741
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:15,859
- Coach, I'm trying.
- Try harder.

742
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,026
What did I say about
fading off your man?

743
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,492
Why's shit always my fault?

744
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,292
Freeze, sub in for Marcus.

745
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,626
- You taking me out?
- That's right.

746
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,158
Sit the fuck down.

747
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,993
This is some bullshit, man.

748
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,626
Listen to me.

749
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:29,359
I want every one of you to
reach in your shorts right now

750
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:31,093
and tell me
if you find a pair.

751
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:32,359
'Cause right now,
you're playing like

752
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,926
a bunch of fucking pussies.

753
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:35,325
And that's the truth.

754
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:36,792
Next time 32 goes over
your back like that,

755
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:38,626
put a fucking elbow
in his stomach.

756
00:36:38,692 --> 00:36:39,993
Yes, Coach.

757
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,525
And if Childress tries to
put you on a poster like that,

758
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:42,926
you hit him so fucking hard

759
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,125
he never comes down the lane
like that again.

760
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:45,192
I got you.

761
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:46,892
Have a little fucking pride.

762
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,759
I don't give a shit if we lose
every fucking game this year.

763
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,959
I will not coach a team
that has been out-toughed.

764
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,225
All right? Let's go!

765
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,525
Fuck yeah, man.
Here we go.

766
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,059
[Sam] "Team" on three.
One, two, three.

767
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,325
[players] Team!

768
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:59,592
[crowd chanting]

769
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,525
I'm in for 50.

770
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,826
[whistle blows]

771
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:14,993
[Chubbs] Come on.
Switch up, switch up!

772
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,258
[Brandon] Chubbs.

773
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,425
[Kenny] Let's go, 3.

774
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:21,459
[Chubbs] Come on!

775
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,726
- [player grunts]
- [whistle blows]

776
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,592
[crowd booing]

777
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,592
[Freeze] Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

778
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,525
[Father Mark] Get back here.
Get back here.

779
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:34,459
[Freeze] Get the fuck off, bro.
Hey, get the fuck off, bro.

780
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,258
[Kenny] Bro,
I'll beat your ass.

781
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,359
- I'll fuck you up, bitch.
- [all clamoring]

782
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,993
[whistle blowing]

783
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,559
[Lombardo]
That is a flagrant foul.

784
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:45,292
[Father Mark] Hey,
that's enough. That's enough.

785
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,392
I didn't do fucking anything,
man. Watch yourself.

786
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:47,859
- Get back there.
- Get over there!

787
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:50,525
What the hell is that?
That guy should be out.

788
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:52,492
Control your players,
Cunningham.

789
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,125
- That is bullshit, man.
- [crowd booing]

790
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:56,592
- What the hell? Come on!
- [whistle blows]

791
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,125
Right. All right.

792
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,158
- I'm feeling a comeback.
- Come on.

793
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,692
- Jack?
- Yeah.

794
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,359
Uh... [clears throat]

795
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:28,225
Just wanted to have
a little chat with you

796
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,892
about something
that was on my mind.

797
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,592
Um, I don't know if you recall
from your days as a student,

798
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:38,459
but we have
a code of conduct at Hayes.

799
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,325
Part of that code includes the
use of appropriate language.

800
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,559
I understand you're trying to
motivate the team,

801
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:47,659
I just wonder if maybe
there's a different approach.

802
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,926
So, you would, uh...

803
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:53,626
You would like me to be
a little more, uh...

804
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,993
Christlike on the bench?

805
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,592
I... I'd like you
to keep in mind

806
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:01,492
that our mission at Hayes
isn't to win basketball games.

807
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,592
It's to develop
men of integrity and faith.

808
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:08,158
Just give it some thought
for me. Will you do that?

809
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,125
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

810
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:13,659
Father, let me
ask you something.

811
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,859
With all the terrible stuff
going on in the world,

812
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:18,258
you think who's ever up there

813
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,059
really gives a shit
what I say to these kids?

814
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,325
[inhales deeply]

815
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,325
As Christians,
we are called by God

816
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,492
to integrate our faith
into our daily lives.

817
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,659
So, yes, Jack. I do think
he really gives a shit

818
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:31,325
about the example you set
for these young men.

819
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:34,392
Don't underestimate the impact
you can have on them.

820
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,626
[Jack] All right. I'll take
a look at the game tape.

821
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:51,059
We can talk about if we
wanna use that 1-3-1 zone.

822
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,192
[Dan] Got it. Sounds good.

823
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:53,759
[Jack] Have a good night.

824
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,026
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

825
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:06,258
I noticed some empty beer cans
in the office earlier.

826
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:08,592
Do you...

827
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,359
You've been sneaking
around the office?

828
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:12,425
Well, Garcia lost a contact
lens, so the solution...

829
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,659
A friend came by.
He wanted to look at some...

830
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,258
And we were hanging out.

831
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:18,559
I mean, you're not
gonna break my balls

832
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:20,525
about a couple of beer cans,
are ya?

833
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,926
Just don't let it
happen again, okay?

834
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:24,459
Yeah, no problem.

835
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:48,525
[sighs]

836
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,192
[rowdy laughter]

837
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,659
Hey, hey, Jackie!

838
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,459
I'll set you up inside,
all right?

839
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:25,892
[engine starts]

840
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:09,383
[Jack] All right. We're gonna
change things up a little bit.

841
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,617
We're the smallest team
in the league

842
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:12,317
and our half-court
offense sucks.

843
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:14,817
We're gonna score some points
with defense. We gotta press.

844
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:18,417
1-2-1-1.
Call it the diamond press.

845
00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:20,250
- [door opens]
- Requires two things,

846
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:22,017
toughness and quickness.

847
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:24,817
We're gonna be picking up
after every dead ball.

848
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:26,917
Full court, all game.

849
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,984
Keep your clothes on, Marcus.

850
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,317
[Marcus] Talking to me?

851
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,717
Come late to the game,
you don't play.

852
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,584
We'll talk about it
at practice tomorrow.

853
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,817
What are you talking about?
I'm, like, four minutes late.

854
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:40,484
You know what?
Forget about tomorrow.

855
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,751
Go home. You're off the team.

856
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:46,118
Coach Dan, what the hell is
his problem? I'm barely late.

857
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:48,417
You heard Coach, Marcus.
Go home.

858
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:51,118
[scoffs] Are you
fucking serious right now?

859
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:52,984
I'm barely fucking late.

860
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,851
Y'all fucking stupid, man.
This dumb-ass team.

861
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:03,951
Freeze,
you're starting tonight.

862
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:06,383
Means you're gonna be guarding
the inbounder, okay?

863
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,751
Got it, Coach.

864
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:10,417
[crowd cheering]

865
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:13,350
[Sal] Ah, this should be fun.

866
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:14,851
- Evening, Sal.
- What's up, Jackie?

867
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:16,450
Give us some friendly whistles
tonight, will you?

868
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:17,717
[chuckles] Yeah, right.
That's funny.

869
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:19,051
They ain't paying me enough
for that.

870
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:21,517
[Chubbs] Let's go. Here we go.

871
00:43:22,484 --> 00:43:23,984
[Sam] Freeze, Freeze, Freeze!

872
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,450
- [Sal] Hands up. Hands up!
- [Jack] Freeze, help! Help out.

873
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:26,817
Freeze, help!

874
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:29,784
- That's it!
- [whistle blows]

875
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:32,317
- What? Come on, ref.
- What's the call, ref?

876
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:34,383
White 23 blocked.
Two shots.

877
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,617
Oh, bullshit!

878
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:38,984
Come on! That's a fucking
horseshit call, Sal.

879
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,283
Jack, settle down

880
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,584
- or it's gonna cost you.
- It's bullshit.

881
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,917
And you know
it's fucking horseshit.

882
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:44,817
That's why I didn't make it.
All right?

883
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:46,951
- Tell him to go fuck himself.
- I'll tell him after the game.

884
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,417
[Jack] Bullshit!

885
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:50,383
God damn it!

886
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,851
[Sam] Box out. Box out.

887
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:52,851
[Chubbs] Let's go, y'all.

888
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:55,484
- [crowd chanting]
- [Jack] Box out.

889
00:43:58,684 --> 00:44:00,751
[Chubbs] Come on, fellas.
Hey, let's box this out.

890
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:02,417
Rebound!

891
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:03,917
[fan] Come on, Hayes!

892
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:05,517
Time-out! Time-out!

893
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,417
- Sal, time-out. God damn it.
- [whistle blows]

894
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:08,917
[Sal] Time-out.

895
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:11,851
Full time-out here.
Full time-out here.

896
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,350
[Sam] God damn, man.

897
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:18,084
[Jack] Bring it in. Sit down.

898
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:19,484
All right.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

899
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,951
Let's win this fucking game.

900
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:23,484
We've got 15 seconds left.
We're gonna go on 8.

901
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,550
Gives us time
for a rebound or a tip-in.

902
00:44:25,617 --> 00:44:28,383
<i>Brandon, 20's gonna pick
you up full court. All right?</i>

903
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,817
<i>Freeze, you're gonna come up</i>

904
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:31,450
<i>and set a ball screen
for Brandon.</i>

905
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:32,817
<i>Brandon, you roll around
to the right.</i>

906
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:34,584
Garcia, come up,
set a back screen for Kenny.

907
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,417
Kenny, come out to the wing
for the three.

908
00:44:36,484 --> 00:44:37,917
<i>That way we got three options.</i>

909
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:40,350
<i>Brandon attacking right
will look for Freeze</i>

910
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:41,584
<i>coming off the screen.</i>

911
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,084
Watch the clock!
Watch the clock!

912
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:44,784
[Jack] If neither of those
are there, go to Kenny

913
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:46,617
for the three in the corner.
You got this, okay?

914
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,751
No, don't just nod. I wanna
hear your voice. Yes or no?

915
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:49,283
- Yes, Coach.
- [whistle blows]

916
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,717
[Father Mark]
Set it, set it, set it!

917
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,417
[Chubbs] That's you, B!

918
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:54,817
[fan] Go, Brandon!

919
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:56,751
[Father Mark] Watch the clock!
Watch the clock!

920
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:02,250
[cheering]

921
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,317
[Jack] We won!

922
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:23,450
Brandon, you need a ride?

923
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:25,317
No, I'm good, Coach.

924
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:27,317
Where do you live?

925
00:45:27,383 --> 00:45:28,884
Uh, Los Codona Ave.

926
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:30,450
Come on, get in the car.

927
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,884
You walk home alone
every night?

928
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,283
[Brandon] Mmm-hmm.

929
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,717
Where's Mom or Dad?

930
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:46,017
My mom died three years ago

931
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:49,450
and my dad's at home
with my little brothers.

932
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,617
That's why he didn't come
to any of the games?

933
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:54,151
Yeah.

934
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,884
You played
a hell of a game tonight.

935
00:45:57,218 --> 00:45:58,717
Next time, shoot the ball.

936
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,484
On the last play?

937
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,717
That's your shot, not Kenny's.

938
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:07,817
Yeah, the defense
collapsed on me,

939
00:46:07,884 --> 00:46:09,650
so Kenny was open
in the corner.

940
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,550
Right.

941
00:46:11,617 --> 00:46:13,951
So that was a smart play.

942
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:17,584
Sometimes a smart play
is not the right play.

943
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,951
You're the best player
on the team.

944
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:21,450
The game's on the line,

945
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:23,550
100 times out of 100
I want you taking that shot.

946
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,317
Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

947
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:29,283
What?

948
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,851
That you're the best player
on the team.

949
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:34,717
You understand this game
in a way these guys don't.

950
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:36,383
I saw you get frustrated
at Chubbs

951
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,450
when he didn't go backdoor
on the ball reverse.

952
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:41,450
Or Freeze, when he didn't
duck under on the Atlanta set.

953
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:45,851
Why didn't you call him out
for not making the right play?

954
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:51,017
Uh, it's not really my thing
to call someone out.

955
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:53,951
I'm not, like, the
team captain or nothing, so...

956
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:55,617
So, if I make you the captain,

957
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:57,584
are you gonna chew Chubbs out
when he doesn't go backdoor?

958
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:03,450
Yes or no?

959
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:09,951
[Brandon] I'm just up here
on the left.

960
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,317
Night, Coach.

961
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:29,951
[Russ] Hey, son.

962
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,084
Who that?

963
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:32,517
That's my new coach.

964
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:33,951
[Russ] All right.
Go on, get with that homework.

965
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,250
[Brandon] Yes, sir.

966
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,584
[Brandon]
Atlanta high, Atlanta high.

967
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,650
[Jack] Stop, stop, stop. Reset.

968
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:56,051
- What set are we in, Brandon?
- Atlanta high.

969
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,650
- Did you call it out?
- Yeah.

970
00:47:57,717 --> 00:47:59,084
- Did you guys hear him?
- [players] Nah.

971
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:00,817
We're in an empty gym,
and nobody heard you.

972
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:02,151
Do it again.

973
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,684
[Brandon speaking louder]
Atlanta high. Atlanta high.

974
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:05,884
[Jack] Reset.

975
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,218
Brandon,
I still can't hear you.

976
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:09,851
You're gonna be
our point guard,

977
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,817
people need to be able to hear
what you say on the floor.

978
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:13,650
You hear how loud
I'm talking right now?

979
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,417
- Yeah.
- That's how loud

980
00:48:15,484 --> 00:48:16,784
- you need to be.
- All right.

981
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:18,218
[Chubbs] You can do it, B.
Come on, Brandon.

982
00:48:18,283 --> 00:48:20,118
I can't hear you, Brandon.

983
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:21,383
[Sam] Come on,
break that press.

984
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,017
B, break that press.

985
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:24,684
[Jack] Call it out.

986
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,884
Brandon, I can't hear you.

987
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,350
[Brandon] Yo, are you
fucking serious? Get off me!

988
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,051
There's 3,000 people
at Memorial

989
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,250
screaming their heads off,

990
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:33,383
and I don't know
what set we're in!

991
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,884
[Brandon] Fuck you!

992
00:48:36,218 --> 00:48:37,784
Can you hear me now?

993
00:48:39,118 --> 00:48:40,450
Can you?

994
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:43,884
[quietly] Yeah,
I can hear you now.

995
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:00,317
[knocks]

996
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:09,084
[Marcus] What's up, Coach?

997
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:10,450
How'd you find my house?

998
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:12,250
I looked you up on my phone.

999
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:13,917
Oh.

1000
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,184
What do you want?

1001
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,517
Uh... So my momma, she works
till 7:00 every night.

1002
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:21,884
And she was like,
she doesn't want me

1003
00:49:21,951 --> 00:49:23,517
really being out on my own
after school.

1004
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:24,884
So she was wondering

1005
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:26,817
maybe if you'll let me back
on the team.

1006
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:29,984
I already told you, Marcus.
I don't want you on the team.

1007
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,484
If it's about finding
something to do after school,

1008
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,218
I'll talk to Coach Dan.

1009
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:34,751
We can set you up with study
hall or something like that.

1010
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,350
All right? Sorry.

1011
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,450
[sniffs]

1012
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:56,517
[knocks]

1013
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:04,417
I thought that was
a pretty fair offer, Marcus.

1014
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:07,417
[sniffles]

1015
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:10,184
My momma ain't
sent me here, Coach.

1016
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,584
I'm here
'cause I wanna play ball.

1017
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:16,417
I miss it.

1018
00:50:16,484 --> 00:50:18,650
I don't fucking like
nothing else, Coach.

1019
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,076
Don't swear.

1020
00:50:21,142 --> 00:50:23,176
There's a code of conduct
policy at the school.

1021
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:24,742
- You know that?
- My bad.

1022
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:28,109
There's a big section in there
about swearing.

1023
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:32,375
I'm sorry. I won't swear.

1024
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:34,442
[Jack sighs]

1025
00:50:42,408 --> 00:50:44,408
Be at practice
tomorrow at 4:00.

1026
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,408
- You serious?
- Don't be late.

1027
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:47,809
Ah, fuck no...
I mean heck.

1028
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:50,475
I'm sorry. Heck no,
I'm not gonna be late.

1029
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:52,575
I'm sorry about cursing,
Coach.

1030
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:19,567
[Jack] Let's go. Bring it in.

1031
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,900
- [Sam] Oh, my gosh.
- [Chubbs] It wasn't me.

1032
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,101
A few things
before we get started.

1033
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,533
As you can see,
Marcus is rejoining the team.

1034
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:32,767
Judging by that reaction,

1035
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:33,934
I expect it'll be some time

1036
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,500
before he regains
your respect.

1037
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:38,067
Second thing is,

1038
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:39,567
Sam and I discussed...

1039
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:42,234
we're gonna make a change
to the captain spot.

1040
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:44,167
Brandon, you're gonna be
our captain going forward.

1041
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:48,001
That's it. Get to work.

1042
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:49,734
[Chubbs] All right, fellas.
Let's go. Let's work.

1043
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,134
[Sam] Let's hustle up.
Let's do it.

1044
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:53,800
Good shit, B. I'll follow
your lead. Come on.

1045
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,633
[Kenny] Every time that ball
goes through the hoop,

1046
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,867
I'm gonna be thinking
about you.

1047
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:01,368
- You know that?
- Yeah.

1048
00:52:01,434 --> 00:52:02,734
Yo, let's go.

1049
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,468
- [Kenny] Bro, what?
- [Brandon] Come on.

1050
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:06,101
A'ight. I'll see you after.
Okay?

1051
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,167
[girl] Bye, Kenny.

1052
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:14,334
All right, let's go.
Move.

1053
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:16,401
<i>What did we discover
last night at Baptist?</i>

1054
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,468
[Sam] That defense
creates offense.

1055
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:18,667
[Brandon] We have to maintain

1056
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:20,067
pressure for
all four quarters.

1057
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:21,700
- [Jack] That's right.
- [Kenny] All right.

1058
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,234
[Jack] Discovered that
we're a pressing team.

1059
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:24,834
We don't take any plays off,
we don't let 'em breathe.

1060
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,234
As soon as they get
over half-court, we trap.

1061
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:28,500
Even if the ball's
in the middle of the court?

1062
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:29,900
Anywhere and everywhere.

1063
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,201
You can't trap
if the ball's in the middle

1064
00:52:31,267 --> 00:52:32,667
of the floor.
You need the sideline.

1065
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,201
Who says?
We can do whatever we want.

1066
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:35,700
[Brandon] Get up!

1067
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:37,101
[Jack] There you go.
There you go. Stay with him!

1068
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,800
Pressure, pressure.
Don't let him breathe.

1069
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,334
- There you go.
- [Chubbs] Trap, trap, trap!

1070
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:42,334
Bring it around. Stay on him.

1071
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:44,700
- [crowd groaning]
- No! Bullshit!

1072
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:47,034
That's a chickenshit
fucking call.

1073
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:48,567
God damn it!

1074
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,734
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder.

1075
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,700
Come on!

1076
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:01,667
[Jack] If we're gonna keep
winning games,

1077
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,767
we gotta make our lack of size
an advantage.

1078
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,167
We gotta speed the game up.

1079
00:53:05,234 --> 00:53:06,967
We gotta play every possession
like it's a war.

1080
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:09,101
Oh, come on!
You've gotta be fucking blind!

1081
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,734
That's a horseshit call!

1082
00:53:13,334 --> 00:53:15,001
[Marcus] We done yet, Coach?

1083
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,533
We're a pressing team.
It's not even the third quarter.

1084
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,667
We're just getting warmed up.

1085
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,533
Motion, motion.

1086
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:22,500
[Jack] <i>What did we discover
last night at Downey?</i>

1087
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:23,900
We gotta take charges.

1088
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,234
We gotta play
with chips on our shoulders.

1089
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,667
Play with a chip
on your fucking shoulder.

1090
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:28,101
Goddamn right.

1091
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,767
Marcus. Come on,
you're going in for Chubbs.

1092
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,600
Marcus, I want you
to cover the inbound, okay?

1093
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,468
Big arms. Force him
to pass into the corner.

1094
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:35,533
That's it!

1095
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,767
<i>The little things add up.</i>

1096
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:38,401
Let's do
all the little things right.

1097
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,900
<i>Loose ball gets us two points.
Tip pass gets us to four.</i>

1098
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,934
<i>Steal gets us another two.
Now we're at six.</i>

1099
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,267
Turnover out of our press
gets us to eight.

1100
00:53:46,334 --> 00:53:48,067
All this shit adds up.

1101
00:53:48,134 --> 00:53:51,600
<i>Every box-out, every hustle,
every loose ball, every trap.</i>

1102
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,134
<i>Put all that shit together,</i>

1103
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:54,600
all of a sudden we're pretty
fucking tough to beat.

1104
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,001
[man] Hit that!

1105
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,267
[cheering]

1106
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,067
- [Chubbs] That's how we do it.
- Got that candy-stroke.

1107
00:54:03,134 --> 00:54:04,834
[Sam] What quarter
are we in, Coach?

1108
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,667
[Jack] The fourth quarter.

1109
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:08,134
<i>The other team's gassed.</i>

1110
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,034
<i>Let's see what we got left
in the tank.</i>

1111
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:14,401
[cheerleaders] <i>Hayes, let's go!
Bishop Hayes, let's go!</i>

1112
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,434
<i>Hayes, let's go!</i>

1113
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
<i>Bishop Hayes, let's go!</i>

1114
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:19,934
Kenny.

1115
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,767
Coach, why you gotta do me
like that, man?

1116
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,001
Good luck tonight, Kenny.

1117
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,800
[boys cheering]

1118
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,201
[Sam] <i>What quarter are we in,
Coach?</i>

1119
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:37,101
Holy shit, look at that.
We just went into overtime.

1120
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,034
[boys panting]

1121
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:47,001
[Jack] What did we learn
about ourselves last night?

1122
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:48,867
[Brandon] That we have to
respect the game.

1123
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:51,201
[Jack] That's right.

1124
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:52,867
Respect.

1125
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,834
[panting]

1126
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,967
Yo, Coach,
how many more I got?

1127
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:02,167
Well, Kenny,
it's not up to me.

1128
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:04,067
- [girl 1] Let's keep him moving.
- [girl 2] Come on.

1129
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,567
[Kenny] Hey, y'all. How y'all
gonna do me like that?

1130
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:07,967
I loved each and every one
of you girls.

1131
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,600
- [girl 1] Have fun.
- [girl 2] Bye, Kenny.

1132
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:10,967
- Hayley, you know I...
- [girl 2] No, keep going.

1133
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:12,468
[Kenny] Girls,
you're all in my heart.

1134
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:13,734
You each have
your own little section.

1135
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,967
- [Jack] Hurry up!
- [whistle blows]

1136
00:55:15,034 --> 00:55:16,600
I'm going!

1137
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,533
- [girl 1] Bye!
- [girl 2] Bye, Kenny.

1138
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,267
[bird calling]

1139
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:48,600
[Jack] Hey.

1140
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:49,867
[whispers] Hey.

1141
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:53,034
Ready? [exhales]

1142
00:55:58,434 --> 00:55:59,967
[indistinct chatter]

1143
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,468
- Hi.
- [Sofia] Angela!

1144
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:10,368
- [Angela] Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

1145
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,167
So, the doctors
are optimistic?

1146
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:14,500
So far, so good.

1147
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,101
Great.

1148
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,401
They told us,

1149
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:22,001
"Let him do all the things
any normal kid would do."

1150
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:25,301
But you know
what remission's like.

1151
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:26,667
Yeah.

1152
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:28,301
Living life
waiting on pins and needles

1153
00:56:28,368 --> 00:56:30,368
for the other shoe to drop.

1154
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,934
- [indistinct chatter]
- Spoke to Ethan lately?

1155
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:34,334
[Jack] He called me
a couple of times.

1156
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:35,800
I haven't gotten back to him.

1157
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,900
Andrew's not looking so good.

1158
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,800
And now they're, uh,
talking about hospice.

1159
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,034
Jesus.

1160
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,867
Can I use
a different bat, Dad?

1161
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:48,167
[Miguel] Pick any bat
you want, son.

1162
00:56:48,234 --> 00:56:50,034
But first say hello
to Mr. Cunningham.

1163
00:56:50,101 --> 00:56:52,234
- [David] Hi, Mr. Cunningham.
- Hey, how you doing, pal?

1164
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:53,834
[chuckles] Michael's dad.

1165
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,001
You remember Michael.

1166
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,434
Remember,
we were in the hospital.

1167
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,867
- It's all right.
- Halloween, we...

1168
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:00,334
No, no, no. We put you two
in a wheelchair...

1169
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,167
and then we pushed you
all around the hospital

1170
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:03,800
- collecting candy.
- [David] Mmm-hmm.

1171
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,468
Doctor was gonna
kill you for that.

1172
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:07,034
- Yeah.
- That was your idea.

1173
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,800
- Michael was Dracula.
- That's right. He was Dracula.

1174
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,368
[Sofia] Who's ready to sing
<i>Happy Birthday?</i>

1175
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:11,468
All right, buddy.
Let's do this.

1176
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:13,234
[Sofia] Who wants cake? Whoo!

1177
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,700
- [chanting] Cake, cake, cake.
- [Miguel] It's cake time.

1178
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,067
Come on, son, let's go.

1179
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,934
Cake, cake, cake.

1180
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,267
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1181
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:39,667
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear David ♪</i>

1182
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:44,201
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1183
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:13,600
[Angela sighs deeply]
Hi, Michael.

1184
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,667
[softly] Please, Lord,
look after my son.

1185
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:18,900
Please let him be happy.

1186
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,567
I miss you, pal.

1187
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,633
[Angela] Thanks for coming
to the party.

1188
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:35,633
I know
Miguel and Sofia invite us

1189
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,267
'cause they don't want us
to feel

1190
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:39,734
excluded,

1191
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,834
but I just end up feeling like

1192
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:45,800
even more of an outcast.

1193
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:49,101
It's like I just get angry
all over again.

1194
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:52,633
Look around at all the boys,
and wish it was one of them,

1195
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:54,967
not Michael.

1196
00:59:56,867 --> 00:59:59,201
Does that make me
an awful person?

1197
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:03,767
I never stop being angry.

1198
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:14,900
I know you're suffering.

1199
01:00:17,101 --> 01:00:20,567
Yeah, I'm suffering.

1200
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:24,234
And I miss my son.

1201
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:29,934
And I don't believe
he's in a better place.

1202
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:33,001
I believe
the best place for him

1203
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,600
was right here
with you and me.

1204
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:39,967
Yeah.

1205
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,767
Home.

1206
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:44,900
We're both suffering.

1207
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,101
I don't know, Ang, you seem
to be doing pretty good.

1208
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:50,134
A new job,

1209
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:52,900
fucking some rich guy
while we're still married.

1210
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:05,900
Sorry.

1211
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:23,500
[engine starts]

1212
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:34,934
[Ryan] You could go
to the library.

1213
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,900
They have a book club there
every Friday.

1214
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:39,500
- [Anne] The library? Really?
- [Kurt] Yep.

1215
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:40,967
[Anne] Would you go with me?

1216
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:42,667
- [Ryan] Well...
- [Kurt] It's for senior women.

1217
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:44,834
[Anne] For heaven's sakes,
Kurt.

1218
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,034
I don't have a problem
making friends.

1219
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:49,633
I don't. But it's just
a whole new place.

1220
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,600
I've only been there
a little while. Give me...

1221
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:52,967
[Kurt] Well, it's called
a two-way street, though.

1222
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:56,368
- You gotta get out a little.
- Uh...

1223
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:59,667
You think maybe it's time for
a new shower curtain, Jack?

1224
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,201
No, I hadn't thought about it.

1225
01:02:01,267 --> 01:02:04,134
[Beth] Oh, well, you should,
'cause that thing smells.

1226
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:05,234
Anybody want a drink?

1227
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,700
- [Anne] No. No.
- I'm good.

1228
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,334
[Kurt] So, what does
the scout report look like

1229
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:09,800
for the team today, Jack?

1230
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:12,767
[sighs] Uh, well, they're
struggling a little bit.

1231
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:14,800
Trinity has lost six in a row.

1232
01:02:14,867 --> 01:02:16,967
They have one good shooter,
TJ Edmonds,

1233
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:18,900
but Uncle Jack's team
should win.

1234
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,600
And they kinda have to win.

1235
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,533
'Cause if they don't
win tonight,

1236
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,934
their next chance at getting

1237
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,001
into the playoffs
is against Memorial.

1238
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:28,734
And Memorial's the number one
ranked team in the state.

1239
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,101
[Kurt] You should see him,
Jack.

1240
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,567
Every morning,
the night after your game,

1241
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:32,900
he wakes up early,
he goes downstairs,

1242
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:34,301
checks the stats
on the computer.

1243
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,234
Maybe I should be the
assistant coach tonight.

1244
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:38,001
[all chuckle]

1245
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:40,900
Number 41. Get your head
in the fucking game.

1246
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:42,234
Come on, Brandon.
Let's go!

1247
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,800
[cheerleaders chanting]

1248
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:44,900
Push up!

1249
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:45,900
Defense!

1250
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:48,401
All right.
Motion, motion, motion.

1251
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:50,101
Don't stop.

1252
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,834
41's the shooter.
Watch the drop screen.

1253
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:56,867
[crowd cheering]

1254
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,101
Push it up. Let's go!

1255
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:03,767
Look out.

1256
01:03:04,468 --> 01:03:05,800
Kenny!

1257
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:07,533
Playing with their heads up
their fucking ass.

1258
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,767
They're just really nervous
right now.

1259
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:12,567
These guys have never played
a game that's ever mattered.

1260
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,700
One stop. No threes.

1261
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,533
- [crowd cheering]
- Shit.

1262
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:23,767
- [Sam] Switch up, switch up.
- [crowd] Defense!

1263
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,667
- Move! Move!
- [crowd] Defense!

1264
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:28,034
[Jack] Here we go,
here we go! Go!

1265
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:31,101
Come on, Kenny! That's stupid.
It's the back court!

1266
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,368
- I know.
- Yo, commit to the top.

1267
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,934
- We had an open player.
- All right, all right. I know.

1268
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:36,134
Let's go! 22! 22!

1269
01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:37,967
- [Freeze] Watch the screen!
- [Jack] No threes!

1270
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:40,667
[crowd cheering]

1271
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,700
- Any time-outs?
- None.

1272
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,101
[Jack] Push it, push it!

1273
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,134
[Marcus] Get through,
get through, get through.

1274
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,301
Hayes, look up.

1275
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:47,867
[crowd continues chanting]

1276
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,700
[grunts]

1277
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,234
- [whistle blows]
- Oh, that's bullshit.

1278
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:53,834
What's the call, Sal?

1279
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,834
[Sal] Offensive foul,
number 23.

1280
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,533
That's bullshit.
He was moving his feet!

1281
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,201
- Offensive, number 23.
- He was moving his feet.

1282
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:00,834
He was already set, Jack.

1283
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,700
You don't make that fucking
call at the end of the game!

1284
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,468
- It's the end of the game!
- His feet were set, Jack!

1285
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:06,500
- It's a chickenshit call.
- [crowd booing]

1286
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:08,167
- Come on. That's a pussy call.
- Listen, that's a warning.

1287
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:09,700
And you're a fucking pussy
for making it.

1288
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:10,567
[Sal] All right, you know what?
That's it.

1289
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:10,820
[Jack] Fuck you.

1290
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:10,987
Hey, Jack. Jack!

1291
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:11,957
[Sal] Technical foul,
right here.

1292
01:04:12,267 --> 01:04:14,134
You don't fucking
decide the game! Okay?

1293
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:16,401
The players
decide the fucking game.

1294
01:04:16,468 --> 01:04:18,368
- That's bullshit.
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1295
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:19,834
[Jack] You don't
fucking do that now!

1296
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,767
The players
decide the goddamn game!

1297
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:23,834
- [Dan] Hey!
- You've gotta calm down.

1298
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,434
Technical foul.
You're outta here.

Sorry for
losing my temper tonight.

1305
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,034
I shouldn't have done that.

1306
01:05:06,834 --> 01:05:09,267
You know what my dad told me
last night?

1307
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:11,734
He said that you got
a full ride to Kansas

1308
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:15,201
and that you just quit.

1309
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:17,067
No reason.

1310
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,267
[breathes deeply]

1311
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:22,934
Why?

1312
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:29,800
[sighs]

1313
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:34,800
My father didn't like me
very much.

1314
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:39,900
And then someone told him
I was good at basketball

1315
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:42,134
and he paid
a lot more attention to me.

1316
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,001
And the better I got,
the more love he showed me.

1317
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:51,500
Then I realized
it wasn't me that he loved...

1318
01:05:53,368 --> 01:05:55,101
it was what I could do.

1319
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,567
So, you just quit playing
as a "fuck you" to your dad?

1320
01:06:03,301 --> 01:06:05,201
[sighs] Yeah, I guess so.

1321
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,667
I made a lot of bad decisions,
Brandon.

1322
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:10,201
I got a lot of regret.

1323
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:12,700
Went away from basketball,

1324
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:14,934
got into a different life,
got into drugs.

1325
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:19,067
Spent a lot of time
hurting myself,

1326
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:20,700
trying to hurt my father.

1327
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,867
It was my wife
who got me outta that.

1328
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:40,567
I never picked up
a basketball again.

1329
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,234
[Russ] Yeah, go ahead
and lower it in.

1330
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:59,034
Russ! Yo, Russ!

1331
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:00,368
You got a visitor.

1332
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:02,500
[Russ] Yo! Dump that. Dump it!

1333
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,900
Let's go! All right. Back.

1334
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,234
Excuse me,
are you Russ Durrett?

1335
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:07,301
Yeah, can I help you?

1336
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:08,633
Yeah, I'm Jack Cunningham.

1337
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,800
I coach your son
over at Bishop Hayes.

1338
01:07:09,867 --> 01:07:11,667
Get this tuna
on the scale now.

1339
01:07:11,734 --> 01:07:14,034
Yeah, man, I know who you are.

1340
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:17,067
Yeah, I used to come watch you
play down at Cheviot Hills.

1341
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:20,101
You and Benny Green
and YaYa Davis.

1342
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:23,201
Yeah, man. YaYa and Benny,
man, we used to do our thing.

1343
01:07:23,267 --> 01:07:24,734
So, how can I help you?

1344
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,633
[Jack] Well, I want to talk
to you about Brandon.

1345
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,001
Has he shown you any of

1346
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,434
the recruiting letters
he's been getting?

1347
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,101
Brandon ain't
shown me nothing.

1348
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,834
Well, he's getting a lot of
attention from good schools

1349
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,633
that want him
to come play ball for 'em.

1350
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,800
Thanks for coming by here
and letting me know,

1351
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,633
Coach.

1352
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,633
How come we don't see you
down at any of the games?

1353
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,500
'Cause I got responsibilities
at home.

1354
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:46,067
I got two boys
that need to be bathed,

1355
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:47,633
fed, and helped
with their homework.

1356
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,533
[Jack] Well, we got a big game
this week.

1357
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,001
If we win it,
we go to the playoffs.

1358
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:54,600
Listen, I don't come
to any games

1359
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,434
'cause I don't support
my son's ideas

1360
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,101
about the game, okay?

1361
01:07:58,167 --> 01:08:00,667
I don't want him relying on
basketball to make a life.

1362
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:03,834
That was my mistake
and it ain't gonna be his.

1363
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,900
These schools are offering him
full scholarships.

1364
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:08,234
Oh, come on, man.
It don't matter.

1365
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:10,001
They offered me the same.

1366
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:11,434
Putting your faith
in basketball,

1367
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,001
it don't work out.

1368
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:14,767
And if anybody ought to
know that, it oughta be you.

1369
01:08:17,434 --> 01:08:18,633
Yeah.

1370
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:23,500
Your son loves the game.
He's gonna keep playing it.

1371
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:37,401
- [indistinct shouting]
- [woman] Let's do this!

1372
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:40,401
Let's go Bishop!
Whoo! Let's go!

1373
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:44,201
[man] It's the Tigers, baby!
Let's do this, Hayes!

1374
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:45,934
[crowd cheering]

1375
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:07,533
Um... So, are we gonna stay

1376
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,201
in the press
the whole game or...

1377
01:09:09,267 --> 01:09:10,533
Yep, right from the tip.

1378
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,167
Okay.
I'd better get the lineup

1379
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:14,767
out to the scores table.

1380
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,368
And, uh...

1381
01:09:17,434 --> 01:09:19,633
I know nobody expected us
to be here

1382
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,900
and we got no business
winning this game,

1383
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:25,134
but I really want
to beat these fucking guys.

1384
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:34,900
[cheerleaders cheering]

1385
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,700
[man] Come on,
Coach Cunningham!

1386
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,167
[woman] We love you, Coach!

1387
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:55,900
[cheering continues]

1388
01:10:01,533 --> 01:10:02,934
- All right.
- [Jack] Let's fly.

1389
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:08,201
Coach.

1390
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:11,334
[buzzer sounds]

1391
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:13,633
Let's go. Bring it in.

1392
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,267
[indistinct shouting]

1393
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:19,767
All right.

1394
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,734
We're on Diamond press
right from the tip.

1395
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,001
Keep that pressure up.

1396
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:25,201
They break it,
fall back into 22.

1397
01:10:28,134 --> 01:10:30,368
Look, you're nervous.

1398
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,633
I get that.

1399
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,034
The truth is,

1400
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:35,800
they got more talent
over there than we do.

1401
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:37,468
Probably got a better coach.

1402
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,867
Nah.

1403
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,867
But I promise you,
they are not a better team.

1404
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,301
I would take anyone
on this bench right now,

1405
01:10:45,368 --> 01:10:47,201
for any one of those players.

1406
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:50,234
You worked hard to be here,
you earned this.

1407
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:51,667
Have some fun out there.

1408
01:10:51,734 --> 01:10:53,434
Now go out there
and earn the playoffs.

1409
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,101
[Sam] All right, do it!

1410
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,434
Win on three.
One, two, three...

1411
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,533
[players] Win!

1412
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,700
[cheering]

1413
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,167
Up! Up!

1414
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,934
- [Marcus] Get your man.
- [Dan] Hands up, hands up!

1415
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:17,434
Gonna eat us alive,
if we give that shot.

1416
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,767
Push him to his left.

1417
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,234
[Brandon] Atlanta high,
Atlanta high.

1418
01:11:20,301 --> 01:11:21,134
[Kenny] Quick, quick!
Switch, switch, switch!

1419
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:23,934
[Sam] Get back, get back!

1420
01:11:26,001 --> 01:11:27,201
That's it.

1421
01:11:27,267 --> 01:11:28,834
[crowd chanting]

1422
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,734
[Lombardo] Box out!
Watch it! Watch it!

1423
01:11:31,533 --> 01:11:33,900
[Kenny] Rebound!

1424
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:36,101
Switch up. Come down,
come down, come down!

1425
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,667
- [Devon] Corner, corner, corner.
- [Sam] Hey!

1426
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:38,934
[Devon] Go, go, go!

1427
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:42,767
[crowd cheering]

1428
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:47,767
[Jack] Help out!

1429
01:11:48,867 --> 01:11:49,934
[grunts]

1430
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:53,468
Time-out, time-out.

1431
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:55,500
[chanting]
Get up and yell "Bishop!"

1432
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:56,633
[Jack] We need stops.

1433
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,967
So let's double-team Childress

1434
01:11:58,034 --> 01:11:59,834
every time he comes across
half-court.

1435
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,800
Make somebody else
fucking score.

1436
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:04,500
Stay on him! Press!
Pressure! Don't give up!

1437
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:05,867
[man] Watch the pick.

1438
01:12:05,934 --> 01:12:07,267
Pick left.
Switch off to the side.

1439
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,334
[Brandon] Go! Let's go.

1440
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,667
[man] Throw it in!

1441
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:13,667
That's it! That's it!
Here we go, here we go.

1442
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:18,267
- Put it in there.
- [Brandon] Go on, go on!

1443
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,834
You guys gotta move.
You can't stand around.

1444
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,134
[Brandon] Switch, switch,
switch, switch, switch.

1445
01:12:25,034 --> 01:12:26,034
[crowd cheers]

1446
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:27,834
[Brandon] Let's go.
Bring it through.

1447
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,934
- [Sam] Here we go!
- [man] Pick him up. Pick him up.

1448
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:32,434
Look, we're not gonna make it
all back in one possession.

1449
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,734
You gotta just keep chipping
away, and chipping away at it.

1450
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,101
[man 1] Watch him, watch him.
Down the rail.

1451
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,633
- [man 2] Up!
- [Chubbs] Come on. Come on.

1452
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,001
Little things,
do the little things.

1453
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:41,867
[Chubbs] Take it to the rack.
That's you.

1454
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:43,368
Let's go, baby. Let's go, huh!

1455
01:12:43,434 --> 01:12:45,034
- [crowd cheers]
- Let's go, son.

1456
01:12:45,101 --> 01:12:47,101
[Jack] Yeah!

1457
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,600
There you go.
All right. Up, up, up!

1458
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:51,934
- [Brandon] D-up, D-up.
- [man] Let's go.

1459
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,567
[Brandon] Get your man,
get your man.

1460
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:55,067
[Jack] Get up in their faces.
Get in their face.

1461
01:12:55,134 --> 01:12:56,500
[Dan] Bobby, Bobby,
watch this guy. Watch this...

1462
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:57,567
[Jack] Let's get a trap!

1463
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:58,834
[man] Pass it.

1464
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,201
- Yeah! There you go!
- [crowd cheering]

1465
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:05,067
Too easy.
That's too easy.

1466
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:07,267
[Devon] Switch, switch.
Get through it.

1467
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:09,900
[Brandon] Motion, motion.

1468
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:11,334
[Freeze] Here you go,
here you go, here you go.

1469
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:13,167
[Kenny] Hey, coming through,
coming through.

1470
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:14,567
[Brandon] Pick left, pick left.
Go through, go through.

1471
01:13:14,633 --> 01:13:16,468
- [Jack] Nice pass.
- [cheering]

1472
01:13:16,533 --> 01:13:17,767
- Time-out! Time-out.
- [whistle blows]

1473
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:20,201
Keep pressing, trapping,
taking charges.

1474
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:22,368
Make our lack of size
an advantage.

1475
01:13:22,434 --> 01:13:23,567
Play like
we've got a fucking chip

1476
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:24,800
on our shoulders. Let's go!

1477
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,567
[Brandon] Go, go, go. Lock up.

1478
01:13:26,633 --> 01:13:28,301
- Oh! Offensive!
- [whistle blows]

1479
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:29,434
- Offensive.
- Yeah!

1480
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,034
Come on!

1481
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:33,434
Jesus, you guys. We're playing
right into their hands.

1482
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,267
[Jack] Move the ball.
Move the ball.

1483
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:37,567
[Kenny] Let's go!

1484
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:39,600
[all cheering]

1485
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:41,434
Diamond, Diamond, Diamond!

1486
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,934
Zach, he's six inches
shorter than you.

1487
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,500
How does he make that shot?

1488
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:47,600
Chips on our
fucking shoulders. Let's go!

1489
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:49,001
[Brandon] That!

1490
01:13:49,067 --> 01:13:50,700
- [Devon] Defense!
- [player] Stay on your man.

1491
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:53,767
- [cheering]
- That's it. Beautiful.

1492
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:55,567
I don't even know
who I'm looking at.

1493
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:58,334
[man] Go, go, go.

1494
01:13:58,401 --> 01:13:59,401
- [whistle blows]
- [referee] Out!

1495
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,633
[man] Ran out. You ran out.

1496
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,500
[man 2] Get him, get him.

1497
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:03,934
[cheering]

1498
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:05,368
- [Kenny] Hey, Diamond! Diamond!
- [man] D-up!

1499
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:06,567
- [Jack] Pressure!
- [Marcus] Come on,

1500
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:07,700
- break through.
- [Jack] Pressure!

1501
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:08,967
[Sam] Reach. Shoot.

1502
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,600
Attack this.
Attack their pressure!

1503
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:18,734
[Sam] Switch, switch, switch.
Come on! Box out.

1504
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,468
[Jack] Twenty-two.
Plot it out! Plot it out!

1505
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:23,800
- [whistle blows]
- [crowd shouting]

1506
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:27,533
That's it, that's it,
that's it. That's it!

1507
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,800
Yeah, that's a great call.

1508
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,001
[Lombardo]
That is a bullshit call.

1509
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,734
How many time-outs
do we have?

1510
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,134
- One time-out left.
- His hands were all over 'em.

1511
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:34,667
- It's a home job.
- [Jack] All right. Time-out!

1512
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:35,967
[whistle blows]

1513
01:14:36,034 --> 01:14:37,434
Time-out.

1514
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,900
[Jack] All right.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1515
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:43,034
- What's up? Say something.
- Hey, hey, hey. Chill. Chill.

1516
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:44,700
- [Lombardo] Bring it in.
- [Chubbs] Chill, man. Come on.

1517
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:45,967
[Dan] What're you gonna do?

1518
01:14:46,034 --> 01:14:47,301
I'm gonna run Atlanta
for Brandon.

1519
01:14:47,368 --> 01:14:48,600
But Childress is on him.

1520
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:49,967
You gotta expect
a double-team.

1521
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:52,633
So, is he gonna get
an open look?

1522
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,934
[softly] Yeah.

1523
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,667
All right.
12 seconds, no time-outs.

1524
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,734
We're gonna run the Hawk
for Kenny.

1525
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,234
Marcus, set the high pick.

1526
01:15:03,301 --> 01:15:05,134
Freeze, Garcia, come round,
set a double screen.

1527
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,434
Brandon, go right,
look for Kenny on the wing.

1528
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,867
Three, we're stopping three.

1529
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:11,101
He gets the ball,
he doesn't go five feet.

1530
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:12,434
We lock him up. One stop.

1531
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,334
[Jack] Stay focused,
run our set.

1532
01:15:14,401 --> 01:15:15,567
Get out there and win this.

1533
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:16,934
[players shouting indistinctly]

1534
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,533
- Team on three.
- [Sam] Win on three.

1535
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,700
[Lombardo] One, two, three...

1536
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:21,934
[players] Win!

1537
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,134
[Sam] Let's go, man!
Let's do this.

1538
01:15:27,034 --> 01:15:28,401
Brandon...

1539
01:15:28,468 --> 01:15:30,800
Forget that.
Take the shot.

1540
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:32,500
Don't nod your head at me.

1541
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:33,767
I got this.

1542
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:36,234
[mellow music playing]

1543
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:44,134
[whistle blowing]

1544
01:15:58,067 --> 01:15:59,867
[inaudible]

1545
01:16:38,368 --> 01:16:40,167
[all cheering]

1546
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,700
[music continues]

1547
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,134
[cell phone vibrating]

1548
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:48,667
[Jack] Hello?

1549
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,500
[Angela] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1550
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:52,067
Hey.

1551
01:18:52,134 --> 01:18:55,500
<i>I just got off the phone
with Miguel, and...</i>

1552
01:18:56,434 --> 01:18:57,600
What?

1553
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,533
[Angela sighs]

1554
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:24,834
- Hey.
- Hey.

1555
01:19:26,368 --> 01:19:28,201
[sighs] What happened?

1556
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:29,767
A few weeks ago,
he was hitting baseballs.

1557
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:33,334
Yeah, he, um...
He had a fever at school.

1558
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,734
Sofia picked him up, and
then he just started seizing.

1559
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,434
Is he conscious?

1560
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,134
He's sedated.

1561
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,368
Is he, uh,

1562
01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:51,667
gonna be okay, or...

1563
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,500
[Angela] They don't know.

1564
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:55,567
They did a scan this morning,

1565
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:57,633
they're just waiting
on results now.

1566
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,567
[inaudible conversation]

1567
01:20:11,368 --> 01:20:12,368
[Sofia] No!

1568
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:15,934
[sobbing] No! No!

1569
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:18,867
[continues sobbing]

1570
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:24,667
[exhales sharply]

1571
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,267
I can't. I... I gotta go.

1572
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:34,867
[Angela] Just wait.

1573
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:36,167
- Where are you going?
- [Jack] I gotta go. I gotta go.

1574
01:20:37,134 --> 01:20:38,934
[Sofia continues sobbing]

1575
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,167
[somber music playing]

1576
01:22:23,533 --> 01:22:25,934
[Doc] Come on. Come on.

1577
01:22:26,001 --> 01:22:27,667
[straining] Just a few more.

1578
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,368
[Jack slurring]
You should see my moves.

1579
01:22:29,434 --> 01:22:30,734
They're better
than my old man.

1580
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,600
[grunts] Your old man
didn't have moves.

1581
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,700
I used to carry him
up the stairs.

1582
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,800
Got the key? Huh?

1583
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,667
Let's go.

1584
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:42,334
- [keys jangling]
- No. No, no, no.

1585
01:22:42,401 --> 01:22:44,001
Give it here.

1586
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:46,767
There you go.

1587
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:08,700
- [sneakers squeaking]
- [Dan] <i>Look at Marcus!</i>

1588
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,134
[Marcus] <i>Come on, man,
I'm right here!</i>

1589
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:11,900
[Dan] <i>Let's see
the ball move, okay?</i>

1590
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:15,434
- [Brandon] Double back to me.
- [Dan] Go, go, go!

1591
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,734
[Sam] Snap it back through!

1592
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,967
Nice, Sam.

1593
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:22,767
Call 'em out! Call 'em out!

1594
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:24,867
[children shouting]

1595
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:41,867
[panting]

1596
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,600
[Brandon]
Get through, get through.

1597
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:02,700
Come on, get through,
get through.

1598
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:04,234
[Dan] Nice, Kenny.

1599
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:05,633
[players shouting]

1600
01:24:07,067 --> 01:24:09,167
- [Chubbs] Come on.
- [Marcus] Come on.

1601
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:11,834
- [Dan] Hey, Jack.
- [Jack] Coach.

1602
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,368
[Dan] Are you all right?
Where you been?

1603
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:16,633
Yeah. Had a power outage
in my, uh,

1604
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:18,667
neighborhood.

1605
01:24:18,734 --> 01:24:20,667
Alarm didn't go off so...

1606
01:24:20,734 --> 01:24:23,134
I overslept.
I apologize.

1607
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:25,267
Bring it in.

1608
01:24:25,334 --> 01:24:26,600
[exhales]

1609
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:29,600
I had a power situation
at my place.

1610
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:33,434
I overslept.
That's on me, okay?

1611
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,067
Let's get into a Hawk set.

1612
01:24:35,134 --> 01:24:38,533
Brandon, take the ball.
Kenny and Garcia on the wing.

1613
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,267
Marcus and Freeze,
start in the box.

1614
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:52,167
[sighs deeply]

1615
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,101
[knocking on door]

1616
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:26,167
Yeah.

1617
01:25:28,934 --> 01:25:31,401
Hey, Padre.
How's it going?

1618
01:25:31,468 --> 01:25:33,468
How are you, Jack?

1619
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,500
I'm all right.
What can I do for ya?

1620
01:25:36,134 --> 01:25:37,600
[sighs]

1621
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:39,468
Jack, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to ask you

1622
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:42,101
to step down
from coaching the team.

1623
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:47,134
Why?

1624
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,633
[Father Edward]
It's come to my attention

1625
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,700
that you've brought alcohol
around the players.

1626
01:25:53,767 --> 01:25:55,667
We're gonna have to
let you go.

1627
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,967
And I'm gonna need
your office key.

1628
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:01,567
I'm worried that this might be

1629
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:03,267
part of a larger problem,
Jack.

1630
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:04,567
Would that be true?

1631
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,134
You didn't want to
just come talk to me?

1632
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:07,867
[Dan] I did come talk to you
about it, Jack,

1633
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:09,167
- and then you lied to me.
- [Jack] I never lied to you.

1634
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:10,800
I didn't lie to you
about anything.

1635
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:12,234
You lied to me today
about your alarm clock.

1636
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,800
[stammers] I had
a power outage at my house.

1637
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:16,734
- You were drunk at practice.
- Oh, bullshit!

1638
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,201
- [Dan] I could smell it on you.
- Bullshit.

1639
01:26:18,267 --> 01:26:20,500
[Dan] The boys
could smell it on you.

1640
01:26:26,468 --> 01:26:27,900
[Dan breathes deeply]

1641
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:29,101
[sighs]

1642
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:33,567
Uh...

1643
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:38,767
All right, look...

1644
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:43,700
Let's just get
to the playoffs, all right?

1645
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:49,034
Guys, please.
Just don't do this. Okay?

1646
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:51,900
I had a bad night. And,
I got it under control now

1647
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:53,468
and I can take care of it.

1648
01:26:53,533 --> 01:26:56,500
Let's just, please...
I'm asking you, please, okay?

1649
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:59,834
I'm sorry.
Please, don't do it, do this.

1650
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,600
Jack, you've made
this decision for me.

1651
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:07,267
I can't accept responsibility

1652
01:27:07,334 --> 01:27:10,533
for allowing you to be
around the boys anymore.

1653
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,500
[Jack] You know...

1654
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:32,134
[clears throat] Fine.

1655
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:35,934
Look, please, just...

1656
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,167
Please, don't do this.

1657
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:41,001
[Father Edward]
Our decision is final, Jack.

1658
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:42,700
We have
a zero-tolerance policy

1659
01:27:42,767 --> 01:27:45,001
- when it comes to alcohol.
- Fine. Fuck it.

1660
01:27:45,067 --> 01:27:47,667
I tried to do something good
with these kids.

1661
01:27:47,734 --> 01:27:50,334
You know...
[mumbles indistinctly]

1662
01:27:50,401 --> 01:27:52,301
It's your choice.

1663
01:27:52,368 --> 01:27:53,600
Who's gonna coach the team?

1664
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,167
You? You're a fucking
math teacher.

1665
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:59,034
I came to help you out.
Look what we did.

1666
01:27:59,101 --> 01:28:01,134
Tried to come in here
and help you.

1667
01:28:01,201 --> 01:28:03,067
You asked for my help.

1668
01:28:03,134 --> 01:28:06,633
And I tried to help you.
This is such bullshit.

1669
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,800
I can't get this fucking...

1670
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,267
I don't need this job.

1671
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:10,734
[Edward Devine]
We are trying to help, Jack.

1672
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,867
- You know what? Stick...
- [keys clatter]

1673
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,967
[door opens]

1674
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:05,667
[indistinct chatter]

1675
01:29:26,201 --> 01:29:27,201
[Jack] What's this?

1676
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,201
From the blonde in the corner.

1677
01:29:31,101 --> 01:29:32,633
Says she knows you.

1678
01:29:40,434 --> 01:29:42,633
[lively blues music playing]

1679
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,767
[Matty] Another one
from the blonde in the corner.

1680
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:04,700
Only this time it comes
with a message...

1681
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:08,533
"Stop being a jerk-off
and come over and talk to me."

1682
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:11,834
I think it's one of
the Pearson girls

1683
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,234
from Saint Dorothy's.

1684
01:30:15,434 --> 01:30:16,934
Yeah, I think it's Diane.

1685
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,533
I paid for you.
I paid for the whole bar.

1686
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,700
[Diane] You didn't pay for me.

1687
01:30:29,767 --> 01:30:31,234
I mean, if everybody...

1688
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,567
Here, give me...
Can I have a drag of that?

1689
01:30:33,633 --> 01:30:35,600
- Mmm.
- Please?

1690
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:37,600
God.

1691
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:42,767
Thank you. You know,
I'll tell you a secret.

1692
01:30:42,834 --> 01:30:44,034
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

1693
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:45,500
No. You're driving.
No. Fuck off.

1694
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:46,800
Yes, I am driving.
Give me a kiss.

1695
01:30:46,867 --> 01:30:47,867
Okay, just one.
Just one. Just one.

1696
01:30:47,934 --> 01:30:48,800
[Jack] It's one kiss. My, God.

1697
01:30:54,967 --> 01:30:56,468
- [car alarm blaring]
- [dogs barking]

1698
01:30:56,533 --> 01:30:57,800
[Jack] Shit.

1699
01:30:57,867 --> 01:30:59,533
Oh, God!

1700
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,900
- [Jack sighs]
- Oh, shit. Shit!

1701
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:03,633
- This is my neighbor's house.
- What?

1702
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,167
[Diane] You've gotta go
round the back.

1703
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:06,468
- Hurry up! Just go round the back...
- [Jack] All right.

1704
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:07,734
[Diane] I'll meet you there.

1705
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,967
It's the third house
on the right.

1706
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,734
[tires screeching]

1707
01:31:49,234 --> 01:31:50,500
[in sing-sing voice] Hello?

1708
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:55,700
Forget to pay
the electricity bill?

1709
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:15,001
[grunts] I think we made it.
Think we're safe.

1710
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:18,633
Somebody's gonna come out
for a fucking surprise,

1711
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,500
check their mailbox
in the morning,

1712
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:23,101
find out their boat's
fucking [chuckles]

1713
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:25,867
sunk. [sniffs]

1714
01:32:26,468 --> 01:32:27,468
[exhales]

1715
01:32:27,533 --> 01:32:28,800
[urinating]

1716
01:32:39,734 --> 01:32:41,967
Pull your fucking pants up.

1717
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:43,834
My wife's calling the cops
right now, asshole.

1718
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,368
[woman] Yes, my husband's
speaking with him now.

1719
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,167
Diane's your wife?

1720
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:48,633
[man] Who the fuck is Diane?

1721
01:32:49,533 --> 01:32:50,700
I don't know.

1722
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,700
Who's...

1723
01:32:54,267 --> 01:32:55,700
I'm in the wrong house, man.

1724
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:57,900
Oh, you're goddamn right,
you're in the wrong house.

1725
01:32:57,967 --> 01:32:59,101
Look, I'm sorry.

1726
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,900
I'm real sorry.
I'm just gonna go home.

1727
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:04,301
Nah, you're not
going anywhere.

1728
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:06,001
Sit down. Wait for the cops.

1729
01:33:06,067 --> 01:33:08,468
Come on, sit down.
Sit down!

1730
01:33:09,101 --> 01:33:10,334
Hey!

1731
01:33:10,401 --> 01:33:11,734
[grunting]

1732
01:33:31,468 --> 01:33:33,633
[siren wailing in distance]

1733
01:34:03,567 --> 01:34:05,001
[breathes deeply]

1734
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:12,600
Okay?

1735
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,800
Can I get you anything?

1736
01:34:28,401 --> 01:34:29,867
Did they tell you

1737
01:34:29,934 --> 01:34:32,001
that they found you
unconscious in the street?

1738
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,633
And that you broke
into someone's house?

1739
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:42,067
Yeah.

1740
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,234
Just...

1741
01:34:55,301 --> 01:34:57,101
You're gonna kill yourself
if you keep going like this.

1742
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:03,509
That's why I'm gonna
get you some help, okay?

1743
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:09,476
[Dan] It has been decided
that he will no longer

1744
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:10,843
be with the team

1745
01:35:10,908 --> 01:35:13,843
due to personal issues
that we'd rather not go into.

1746
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:17,743
I will step in
as the interim coach.

1747
01:35:17,809 --> 01:35:19,042
And I don't see why...

1748
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:20,275
[doctor]
<i>During our family session...</i>

1749
01:35:20,342 --> 01:35:21,809
[Dan]
...anything has to change.

1750
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:23,409
[doctor] <i>...your sister
and mother said that</i>

1751
01:35:23,476 --> 01:35:25,142
you've isolated yourself
since Michael died.

1752
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:29,342
Would you agree with them?

1753
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:31,809
Yeah. I mean,
I certainly don't see them

1754
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:33,242
as much as I used to.

1755
01:35:34,743 --> 01:35:37,309
They also said you never talk
about your son.

1756
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:49,509
[sniffles]

1757
01:35:49,576 --> 01:35:51,476
I don't know
what they want me to say.

1758
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:57,542
I could talk about the, uh,

1759
01:35:57,609 --> 01:36:00,642
tumors in his brain
and his spine.

1760
01:36:03,309 --> 01:36:06,075
[sighs]
Thirty rounds of radiation.

1761
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,275
He used to scream
when he had seizures.

1762
01:36:15,975 --> 01:36:17,542
Nobody wants to hear that.

1763
01:36:24,008 --> 01:36:26,242
We can't change
the past, Jack.

1764
01:36:26,843 --> 01:36:28,175
[sighs]

1765
01:36:29,743 --> 01:36:32,642
What we can do is choose
how we move forward.

1766
01:36:36,509 --> 01:36:37,576
Think about Michael.

1767
01:36:41,075 --> 01:36:42,942
What would he want for you?

1768
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:50,042
[breathes deeply]

1769
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:19,542
Hi.

1770
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:21,342
[Jack] Hey.

1771
01:37:21,414 --> 01:37:23,142
Thanks for coming.

1772
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:25,008
Can I take your coat?

1773
01:37:29,809 --> 01:37:31,442
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

1774
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:37,609
How's it going?

1775
01:37:38,442 --> 01:37:40,576
Good. Good.

1776
01:37:40,642 --> 01:37:43,975
Good. I'm really glad
you're here, Jack.

1777
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:46,409
Yeah. Me too.

1778
01:37:48,342 --> 01:37:50,875
[sighs] I shoulda come here
a long time ago.

1779
01:37:53,309 --> 01:37:55,642
I just want you
to know that, uh,

1780
01:37:57,509 --> 01:37:59,409
I know that I failed you.

1781
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:03,275
And I know
that I failed our marriage.

1782
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:09,476
I failed our son

1783
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:15,875
'cause I didn't take care
of his mom.

1784
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:23,242
And I hope that, uh,

1785
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:26,875
one day you can see in me

1786
01:38:28,008 --> 01:38:30,442
the man that, uh,

1787
01:38:32,109 --> 01:38:35,442
that you once hoped
I would be.

1788
01:38:43,476 --> 01:38:45,209
I'm so sorry.

1789
01:39:18,209 --> 01:39:20,142
[indistinct chatter]

1790
01:39:26,109 --> 01:39:28,008
[indistinct chatter continues]

1791
01:39:56,142 --> 01:39:58,875
[cell phone buzzing]

1792
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:02,609
Hello?

1793
01:40:02,676 --> 01:40:05,576
Hey, Dan.
How you doing?

1794
01:40:06,109 --> 01:40:07,743
It's, uh...

1795
01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:09,008
It's Jack.

1796
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:13,142
[Father Mark] Heavenly Father,

1797
01:40:13,209 --> 01:40:14,776
we welcome your presence here

1798
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:16,376
among us
and your spirit of love

1799
01:40:16,442 --> 01:40:19,175
alive in the community
of Bishop Hayes.

1800
01:40:19,242 --> 01:40:21,442
Please help us
to be the best we can be.

1801
01:40:21,509 --> 01:40:25,908
To strive not so much to win,
but to play fairly and well.

1802
01:40:25,975 --> 01:40:29,609
We ask this in your name,
Lord Jesus. Amen.

1803
01:40:29,676 --> 01:40:31,142
[players] Amen!

1804
01:40:31,209 --> 01:40:33,542
Hey, fellas, let's win
this fucking game

1805
01:40:33,609 --> 01:40:34,776
for Coach Cunningham, baby.

1806
01:40:34,843 --> 01:40:36,309
[all shout excitedly]

1807
01:40:40,442 --> 01:40:42,075
I'll talk to him.

1808
01:40:44,759 --> 01:40:45,993
[Brandon] Let's go.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1809
01:40:46,059 --> 01:40:47,258
[Sam] Bring it home.

1810
01:40:47,325 --> 01:40:48,559
All right, we stay in press

1811
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:50,093
- all game, okay?
- All right.

1812
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:51,325
Nobody gets past you.

1813
01:40:51,392 --> 01:40:52,626
You stay in their faces,
all right?

1814
01:40:52,692 --> 01:40:54,225
Play with that chip
on your shoulder,

1815
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:55,525
stay hungry. Who are we?

1816
01:40:55,592 --> 01:40:56,826
- [players] Hayes!
- Who are we?

1817
01:40:56,892 --> 01:40:58,592
- [players] Hayes!
- Right! Win on three.

1818
01:40:58,659 --> 01:41:00,225
Let's go.
One, two, three...

1819
01:41:00,292 --> 01:41:01,492
[players] Win!

1820
01:41:11,225 --> 01:41:13,325
[crowd cheering]

1821
01:41:26,592 --> 01:41:28,459
[announcer] <i>To the sharpshooter
Dawes in the corner.</i>

1822
01:41:28,525 --> 01:41:30,559
<i>He fires up a three</i>

1823
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:31,826
<i>and it's good!</i>

1824
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:34,093
<i>Hayes is hitting
on all cylinders tonight.</i>

1825
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:35,525
[commentator] <i>For a team that</i>

1826
01:41:35,592 --> 01:41:37,425
<i>hasn't made the playoffs
in 25 years,</i>

1827
01:41:37,492 --> 01:41:39,158
<i>they seem to be awfully
comfortable out there.</i>

1828
01:41:39,225 --> 01:41:41,093
[announcer] <i>Full-court pressure
again from Hayes.</i>

1829
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:42,425
[commentator] <i>Dougherty has
just not been able to</i>

1830
01:41:42,492 --> 01:41:43,926
<i>figure out the Hayes pressure.</i>

1831
01:41:43,993 --> 01:41:46,692
<i>The defense has been
absolutely suffocating.</i>

1832
01:41:46,759 --> 01:41:48,559
[announcer] <i>Sanders
trapped in the corner.</i>

1833
01:41:48,626 --> 01:41:50,459
<i>He fires across the court
to Jenkins.</i>

1834
01:41:50,525 --> 01:41:52,258
<i>Pass intercepted by Durrett!</i>

1835
01:41:52,325 --> 01:41:54,325
[commentator] <i>Brandon Durrett
is gonna take it by himself.</i>

1836
01:41:54,392 --> 01:41:56,726
[announcer] <i>Reverse layup
and it's good!</i>

1837
01:41:56,792 --> 01:41:58,926
- <i>And he's fouled!</i>
- [commentator] <i>Wow!</i> [laughs]

1838
01:41:58,993 --> 01:42:00,359
[commentator] <i>He has been</i>

1839
01:42:00,425 --> 01:42:01,859
<i>really special today,
hasn't he, Tom?</i>

1840
01:42:01,926 --> 01:42:03,792
[announcer]
<i>He has been magnificent.</i>

1841
01:42:03,859 --> 01:42:06,792
<i>And now Hayes is out to its
biggest lead of the game.</i>

1842
01:42:06,859 --> 01:42:09,659
[commentator] <i>We said earlier
that Coach Jack Cunningham,</i>

1843
01:42:09,726 --> 01:42:12,726
<i>the man responsible
for this amazing turnaround</i>

1844
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:14,792
<i>wasn't able
to be on the bench today.</i>

1845
01:42:14,859 --> 01:42:17,659
<i>But you have to imagine
he'd be very proud</i>

1846
01:42:17,726 --> 01:42:19,559
<i>of the way
these boys are playing.</i>

1847
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:21,525
[announcer] <i>I can remember
watching Jack as a player.</i>

1848
01:42:21,592 --> 01:42:23,859
<i>He was tough, intense,
competitive,</i>

1849
01:42:23,926 --> 01:42:25,826
<i>and he has instilled
in these boys</i>

1850
01:42:25,892 --> 01:42:28,726
<i>all those qualities
that made him such a winner.</i>

1851
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:30,892
[commentator] <i>And you can see
Jack's imprint</i>

1852
01:42:30,959 --> 01:42:32,525
<i>all over this team.</i>

1853
01:42:32,592 --> 01:42:33,993
[announcer] <i>Clearly
a reflection of their coach.</i>

1854
01:42:34,059 --> 01:42:35,559
<i>I have never seen
a high school team</i>

1855
01:42:35,626 --> 01:42:37,093
<i>with this much composure.</i>

1856
01:42:37,158 --> 01:42:39,225
[both continue speaking
indistinctly]
