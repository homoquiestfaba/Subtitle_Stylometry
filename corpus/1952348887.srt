1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:03,088
It is always easy to see the end
a nightmare.

2
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,367
The front door is
difficult to find.

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,070
I think particularly
in my case...

4
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:11,341
... began with a storm.

5
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:22,482
Guys, guys, you have
to do this.

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,838
There is fog everywhere, not
can see beyond your nose.

7
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,566
It's so surreal.

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,211
What is the problem?

9
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,393
It is raining a lot out there.

10
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,987
Can not even see the other
side of the boat.

11
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,596
Do you think we will sink, captain?

12
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,189
Yes, start transmitting
our position.

13
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:50,704
I have to find a
way out of this thing.

14
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:56,562
They need a bit of fresh air.
We knew it would be bad weather.

15
00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:57,886
- Right?
- Fresh air?

16
00:00:57,923 --> 00:00:59,876
Yes, fresh air.
In a figurative sense.

17
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,559
- This is worse than a roller coaster.
- How did worse than a roller coaster?

18
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:03,956
You love it!

19
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,335
- But hold much.
- Nothing ever happened, right?

20
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,914
We took two weeks on this, not
I think I can bear it.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,200
I get no response.

22
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:18,788
Not get anything at 16.

23
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,539
- Hey, Stack?
- What is it?

24
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,604
Take a look.

25
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:28,288
Wait, you know what you need?

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,253
They need a group photo.

27
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,085
Do not you dare to ask us
we say "X".

28
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,100
See?
That is the sense of humor that I seek.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,855
Well, let's at 3.
Ready?

30
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,083
- 1...
- What is it?

31
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:41,196
2... 3.

32
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,010
Honey are you okay?

33
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,922
Yes, but I'm a
tremendous headache.

34
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:18,705
What the hell happened?

35
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,131
Well, it seems that survived
the storm.

36
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,205
- Storm?
- Where are we?

37
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,963
Capi... what is our position?

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,749
How far we
San Juan?

39
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:50,505
The storm damaged the engine, not
have electricity and no radar.

40
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,044
Nothing, the barometer is round
like a top.

41
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:56,314
- I do not know what is going on.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,814
Hey, capi.

43
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:07,189
- Yes?
- We are at the mercy of the water.

44
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:13,273
Well, review the engine
is probably something electrical.

45
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,511
Dried up the reserves.

46
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:19,966
They drank almost all the water before
I could go down and stop them.

47
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,206
The barometer is also screwed.

48
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,414
We keep things between us?

49
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,005
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,492
Land!

51
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,295
Thank God.

52
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,488
What island is this?

53
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,857
You know what?
There should be no land for miles.

54
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,319
Perhaps the storm in
took the course.

55
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,264
Are you sure you do not know
our position?

56
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,612
It's hard to say without the instruments.

57
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,452
We have instruments?

58
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:13,516
He said it is difficult, not impossible.

59
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,728
Stack is working to
fix the engine.

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,583
- Okay, Stack?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,378
Anyway, it seems that the tide in
is leading to the island.

62
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:25,975
Finally some good news.

63
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,900
Well, pull the anchor.

64
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,025
I think she will resist.

65
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:40,685
What do you think if we take the
Zodiac and go to earth?

66
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,246
- Yes!
- Yes!

67
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,356
To me.

68
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,656
The key is to replenish the
our reserves of water.

69
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,489
Without it we will not achieve
get anywhere.

70
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,229
You may stumble on
piña colada there.

71
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,282
My Times explorer
prepared me.

72
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,451
- Yes?
- Come here, I think I saw something.

73
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,213
What?

74
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:10,054
- Like what?
- There in the water.

75
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,310
- How was it?
- I do not know, great.

76
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,128
- As a whale?
- No.

77
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,843
- Maybe it was a shark.
- No.

78
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:23,184
You know what?
I'll stay here.

79
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,145
- What?
- Is that...

80
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,757
Wait, no, no, dear.

81
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:29,557
It was a crazy night, you
'll be fine.

82
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,521
- Do not believe me.
- Karen, do not you get off the boat?

83
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,215
- Yes, but...
- Wait, wait.

84
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,089
Why are not you too?
Two.

85
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,262
No, I'm with you guys.

86
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,840
The accursed shark is not going to stop me
to feel the sand on my skin.

87
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,795
Okay, fine.
I'll stick with it.

88
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,552
No, no, you will.
I'll be fine.

89
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,401
You can stay but I need
of all possible hands.

90
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:58,446
Then all men will
to the land.

91
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,190
- I love you.
- Take care.

92
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:03,556
Be right back.

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,663
Take care.

94
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,335
You see that?
It is a flag.

95
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,461
Loaded.

96
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,076
Closes pulls the precursor.

97
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:36,881
Place on top of your
head and shoot.

98
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:41,783
We will see the signs and know
that is bad.

99
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,872
And if you are having problems?

100
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:53,227
Well ..
back as soon as possible.

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,431
Immediately.

102
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,336
So I like.

103
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:37,088
No more boats, no more boats.

104
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,625
- They can pass, we...
- Here, Romeo.

105
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:43,492
Hours.

106
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,208
- Come on.
- I want to stay here.

107
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,829
Come on, get up.

108
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,079
Remember where we came from,
You see that hill?

109
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,917
This is your job.

110
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,323
<i>What is happening here.</i>

111
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,626
Hey, Stack?

112
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,771
Yes?

113
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:49,258
Go up and look around to find
where we have to go.

114
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,953
All right, captain.

115
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,812
See why keep him around.

116
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:08,115
Stack is more useful than
can imagine...

117
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,835
... in an environment like this.

118
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,882
Fantastic.

119
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:15,179
All your effort is
give me head.

120
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,215
Where the hell you been?

121
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:23,832
- Thank you.
- She's fine.

122
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,258
That view is here!

123
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:44,604
There are some birds on the East.

124
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:48,051
- Wait!
- This is a good sign.

125
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,220
Animals usually
indicate that there is water.

126
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,897
Hey, Stack, down.
We go there.

127
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,042
The flag!

128
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,439
What?

129
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,813
The flag!

130
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,765
Oh, my God!

131
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,923
Oh, shit!

132
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,876
Wait!

133
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,222
You can not go out like running.

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,584
What?

135
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,798
What the heck is that?

136
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:29,305
Crap!

137
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:39,768
Move!

138
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,488
Come on, guys.
Let's try to stay together.

139
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,297
- Run.
- Go, go!

140
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,942
Let's run to where?

141
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:11,638
Where is it?

142
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,707
Where is the boat?

143
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:16,946
The Zodiac is also gone.

144
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:18,836
Was right here!

145
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,963
Take it easy, okay? We are in
jungle, after seeing these eggs...

146
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,636
We have to leave this island!

147
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,769
- Would you relax?
- Karen took the boat!

148
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,869
Karen did not take the boat!

149
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,656
Perhaps the anchor has been detached.

150
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,872
- The flag.
- What?

151
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:38,005
The flag! That's what the Stack
was shouting at the top.

152
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,816
The flag!

153
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:48,204
We are exposed here.
We have to go to the trees.

154
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,797
Yes, go to the trees.
We have to go.

155
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,706
- Wait, wait!
- The boat is not here.

156
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,947
Come!

157
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,563
Come!

158
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,793
It seems a good place to stay.

159
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:12,602
What about your friend?

160
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,360
- Honey...
- Do not call me darling now.

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,281
- Let's calm down.
- I have to continue.

162
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,519
What are we doing here?
Gotta go...

163
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,398
- What is this place?
- We can not go back.

164
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,134
Captain and now?

165
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,834
Look...
we know that the Haiti...

166
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:28,844
-... But do not come to San Juan.
- San Juan?

167
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,133
Not seen any of those things that
smashed your friend...

168
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:33,248
-... In the package of Puerto Rico.
- Please.

169
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,804
What? What?
All this was your fault.

170
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,412
- If something happens in...
- It's all a lie, ok?

171
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:42,264
Just calm down, Lindsay.

172
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,996
Stay here, do not run away.

173
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,975
... first instance. Probably
is derived from somewhere.

174
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:49,001
... let's save our lives first.

175
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,344
A knife is all.

176
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,658
Thou Lindsay stay here.

177
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,172
The captain and I will find
this thing that took the Stack.

178
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,686
No, no, we should be together.

179
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:09,769
We do not know what is out there,
Lindsay want to get hurt.

180
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,458
- Are you okay?
- Yes

181
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:24,203
- And if not come back?
- I'll be back.

182
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,105
Collect anything
that you can burn...

183
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,723
... to score a fire
after dark.

184
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:29,662
I will not spend the night in this place.

185
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,383
You remember when we were skiing
and broke my ankle?

186
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,713
And you helped me to return
the mountain?

187
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:39,742
Yes, you fainted by
time.

188
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,812
Now we're on that mountain.

189
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:48,154
I'll be back.

190
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,480
Hey, it helps a little
help here.

191
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:18,385
Ross...

192
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,569
I regret what I said.

193
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:27,149
- What?
- That this was all your fault.

194
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,893
It was not your fault.

195
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,613
Or rather, most
was your fault.

196
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,937
The barometer was not damaged.

197
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,881
What?

198
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:44,941
The barometer of the boat is not that
he was not working well.

199
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,057
Ross, really need
you to control here.

200
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,784
What led the Stack lived during the
period of pre-history of this planet...

201
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,593
... when was the level of
oxygen higher.

202
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:56,805
The sufficiently high
keep the animals of this size.

203
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,834
Even more so.

204
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,693
Cole, that's a Tyrannosaurus.

205
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,981
Ross, I want to go home.

206
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,257
We need more wood.

207
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:44,262
- What do you think?
- Why do not we give back?

208
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,590
Since when do you know Ross?

209
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,467
- There are some 15 years.
- Ah... are now friends.

210
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,818
We work together.

211
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:04,327
I just wanted to know...

212
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:09,713
If we go back... you know...
to Key West...

213
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:14,931
Maybe you could pay me
a little more money?

214
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,934
Good luck.

215
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:39,864
Fill it there.

216
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,965
Look at this!

217
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,173
Cole takes a look at this!

218
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,681
- Did you see that?
- It was incredible.

219
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,705
She could have shit on me.

220
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,065
That was funny.

221
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,745
You better...
back before dark.

222
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,628
Picked.

223
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:03,072
Hey, Cole looks, no pets
back.

224
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,844
There is fresh meat.

225
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,618
- I think it should go.
- Yes, we.

226
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,281
Go, go.

227
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,996
Hurry, hurry.

228
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,227
Take a large piece.

229
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,156
Oh, my God.

230
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,176
Flawless!

231
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,708
Come on, captain!

232
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:01,446
Oh, shit!

233
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,635
Come!

234
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,827
Get down, Get down.

235
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,509
- What?
- Where was it?

236
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,613
Maybe hiding.

237
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,981
No, wait.
And if he is hiding?

238
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,423
No, no, come on.
We can not stay here.

239
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,341
Why would he so without
more or less?

240
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,835
- Oh, my God.
- What is this place?

241
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,775
Where are we?

242
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,899
So what's the plan, Ross?

243
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:41,716
We shift to keep
the fire burning.

244
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:44,832
And hopefully in the morning
find Karen.

245
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,773
I'm so hungry...
I eat dinosaur.

246
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,531
I do not think you can continue
long in this place.

247
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,246
Do not worry, we will
find Karen.

248
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,125
I hope so.

249
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:15,284
Oh, I wish both touching me.

250
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,617
Sometimes the eggs are sufficient.

251
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:33,762
But I'm so hungry
could eat a horse.

252
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:43,887
Who are you?

253
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,481
Sorry, you sleepyhead.

254
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,623
I think you missed the presentations.

255
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,322
- I'm Jude.
- Jude Jackson.

256
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:54,790
This is Joe.
Does not talk much but...

257
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,296
... is great to hear.

258
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,851
Where the hell are we?

259
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:03,109
That is the question of
1 million dollars.

260
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,695
We are in a hole if
understand what I say.

261
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,054
Never heard of this place.

262
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,659
Even in flight school.

263
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,396
How long you been here?

264
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,522
1 year, 2 months and 11 days.

265
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,499
Who's counting, right?

266
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:24,638
Thank you.
I'll tell you one thing...

267
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,259
... is not an easy task
survive here.

268
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:30,873
Spend the day without turning the
lunch someone is like...

269
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:34,154
... a meeting with the Andrew Sisters,
know what I mean?

270
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:38,282
This is a tremendous find!

271
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:45,975
We have many women
here.

272
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,922
I had a...

273
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,953
... that appeared when I
here but...

274
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,860
... did not last long.

275
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,011
Should be the group that came
the boat, right?

276
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:08,809
- The boat?
- Did you see the boat?

277
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,894
Yes, here is a boat like an egg
Easter for an orphan.

278
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:16,639
Where?

279
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:18,951
It's a little difficult.

280
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,576
I do not care how hard it is.

281
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,920
My wife is in the boat, I
to find it now.

282
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,820
Reach the boat requires
all your skills.

283
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,095
I'll take you to him.

284
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:33,565
But I can not promise
that is still there.

285
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:38,544
Maybe not to return is not
an easy game.

286
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:44,036
Mind if I get one?

287
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,069
Let.

288
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,945
Know?
Survival is the highest capacity.

289
00:25:58,532 --> 00:26:01,033
I can not believe that
brought no weapon.

290
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:02,822
Only knives?

291
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:05,603
We would not fight a war.

292
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,343
Repeats.

293
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:52,823
This is where I landed in
small island paradise.

294
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:55,299
I left one arm in the process.

295
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:02,596
I was hanging there as an ornament
Christmas, until I found.

296
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,086
It was there that I met Joe.

297
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,081
Everything is gathered here
some part of the island.

298
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:17,111
Is more like a small museum.

299
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,427
Crap!

300
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:26,386
Oh, it's Conrad.
Conrad... staff.

301
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,877
Hello

302
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:40,905
- Where are they?
- What? I'm from Manhattan.

303
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:46,447
- What year?
- Yes, I also thought he was crazy.

304
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:49,861
Maybe he and I also.

305
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:53,470
Conrad was the captain of a
boat called "Connemora"

306
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,463
Were on board the Connemora?

307
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:57,763
Yes, excellent boat.

308
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:03,602
It was rescued in 1955.

309
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,790
You are 54 years here?

310
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:10,942
10 years and 311 days.

311
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:16,826
Feel that smell?
Feel that smell?

312
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:21,166
- This is the oil?
- Get out of the ground.

313
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,796
I'll never know this
place as well as Conrad.

314
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:27,529
You are going to guide us?

315
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:35,378
Great.
How far we will take a crazy...?

316
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,499
Perhaps not so
crazy as you think.

317
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,161
So Jude, where you found
our boat?

318
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:07,101
Just like the others on the beach.

319
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,392
But I knew that there
people in it.

320
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,593
Know? If you have a boat, why
do not you use off the island?

321
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,897
It is impossible.

322
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,965
Believe me, I tried...

323
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,592
... and almost became a snack...

324
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,313
... the children's mother
live in the depths.

325
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,742
Wait a minute, what?

326
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:32,058
There it is.

327
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:48,623
There is something that bothers me.

328
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,759
What kind of plane you said
which drivers?

329
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,355
TBL avenger, flight 19.

330
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,942
Did you know that the whole squad
Flight 19 disappeared in 1945?

331
00:30:58,221 --> 00:31:00,523
Yes, two weeks before
I make 26 years.

332
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,575
He had planned a tremendous
party when he returned to base.

333
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:08,481
Wait a moment.

334
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,611
You were on Flight 19 and
him in Connemora.

335
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,566
Affirmative.

336
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,278
What?

337
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:19,392
We passed an area where
always thought it was fiction.

338
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,514
Known as the Devil's Triangle.

339
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,342
Wait, we crossed the Triangle
Bermuda?

340
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,924
I thought that was not been
proven, something like the invention.

341
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,146
Friend, we have dinosaurs.

342
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,580
Flight 19 and Connemora.

343
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:38,737
Disappearances well proven.

344
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:44,325
We have gone through
a portal. Something.

345
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:50,241
Come on, we are wasting time.

346
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:52,242
Let us search for the Karen.

347
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,766
This thing? You're kidding, as
know if it floats?

348
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:59,083
Let us know.
Trust me.

349
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,502
Let.

350
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,292
Give me your hand!

351
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:51,075
- Where is he?
- What happened?

352
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:53,764
Go get it!

353
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,500
- There it is.
- Come on!

354
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:03,649
- Give me your hand.
- Come on.

355
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:07,719
Help him.

356
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,746
- He will get it!
- Give me your hand!

357
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,254
- Come on.
- Get him.

358
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,459
What the hell was that?

359
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,079
- Honey.
- What was that?

360
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:24,986
Come on, let's get out of here.

361
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,380
- What was that?
- Are you okay? You okay?

362
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:33,855
- I am, I'm fine.
- Can you continue?

363
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,641
Yes, we.

364
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:40,319
You will not leave your friend to rest?

365
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:42,640
- Why?
- He's fine.

366
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,455
- He's fine, okay?
- Yes

367
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:46,000
We have to go looking
my wife...

368
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:47,588
... and to make sure you are well.

369
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,215
Ok, let's go.

370
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:53,729
Flawless.

371
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,897
Oh, my God.

372
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,749
- Is it better not to see us.
- Ok

373
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:33,924
So let's take only what is necessary.

374
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,881
This means that our boat may
be around anywhere.

375
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,495
Could be.

376
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,193
Just keep your eyes open
and all the rest closed.

377
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,113
- Ok
- Come on.

378
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,611
Who are they?

379
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,599
Germans. I do not think they are the
that kick in the butt.

380
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:06,533
Seized this part
the island since they arrived.

381
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:09,351
<i>Let me go!</i>

382
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:11,994
Karen.

383
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:14,856
<i>Let me go.</i>

384
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,856
Relax, we must have a plan, okay?

385
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:20,118
In any way, we will.

386
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,843
- Let me go.
- Conrad know how to go back

387
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:25,969
... that's how we got the gunpowder.

388
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,199
We'll get your wife.

389
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,756
- Come on.
- Okay.

390
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,833
Hey, there's nothing that
juice yellow?

391
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:56,684
It is a good idea.

392
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:00,728
Here.

393
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,705
- What are you doing?
- We need lighting.

394
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:23,085
Unless you want to go blind.

395
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:25,545
I will not go there.

396
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:28,602
Look, my friend said that this
the cave will take up the Germans...

397
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:30,768
... so, you can go with us
or stay here.

398
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:32,811
But you'll be on your own.

399
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:37,308
Everyone keep your head
down and not make noise.

400
00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:09,549
There are many of these around.

401
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:14,677
It's okay.
Let.

402
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:35,927
Here is the output.

403
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:15,453
Yes, let's take it safely...

404
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,324
... we need a distraction.

405
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,675
You know, get them out of
somehow.

406
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,770
Forward.

407
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,586
Okay, I'll tell
we do.

408
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:40,289
Conrad and I will give back
ahead...

409
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,881
... to draw your attention.

410
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,178
The rest come in and take
she this place.

411
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:47,190
There are weapons there, then once
she is safe...

412
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,802
... grab what they can to
charge of soldiers.

413
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:53,267
I have an idea, I'll take
Conrad and Jude...

414
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,580
... and if I can go
for my boat...

415
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:00,386
... so I can prepare you
to escape quickly.

416
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:02,533
Wait, wait, that
distractions?

417
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,566
It will be something that will not
unnoticed.

418
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:10,803
Okay, just be careful, ok?

419
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:12,381
Thank you.

420
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:20,535
I'm going back to Karen.

421
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,967
Captain, stay here and watch the boat.

422
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,132
Just got back.

423
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,762
What we do with these
German idiots, ah, Conny?

424
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:44,880
We have no weapons.

425
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:50,883
We need something... to
keep everyone busy.

426
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:53,844
And that gives us the opportunity
to take care of them,

427
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:55,890
... if you understand me.

428
00:42:58,487 --> 00:43:00,651
How are you of your leg?

429
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:05,662
If he could dance with whom.

430
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,561
- Would you enjoy it?
- Come on.

431
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,118
Jesus.

432
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:42,449
Better find a place, Conny.

433
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,657
I do not want behind me.

434
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,158
So when running mean something,
if you understand what I mean.

435
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,876
What are you waiting for?

436
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,095
Lukas!

437
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:20,034
I have lived long in this
island to miss this opportunity.

438
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:24,557
Now we are alone.
If you kill each other.

439
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:54,771
Let.

440
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:02,607
Not a good idea.

441
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:20,379
Hey, what are you doing?

442
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:05,571
They took my boat.

443
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:08,118
Stop, Lonzo, stop.

444
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,875
Run, they took my boat.

445
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,060
Let.

446
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:18,819
Let's get the boat.

447
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:21,604
They took my boat.

448
00:48:37,757 --> 00:48:42,139
Hey! What are you doing?

449
00:48:43,718 --> 00:48:45,217
Hey!

450
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:47,349
Come back!

451
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:54,874
We can all go us!

452
00:48:55,787 --> 00:48:58,463
Come back!

453
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,905
Come back!

454
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,399
Let.

455
00:49:37,776 --> 00:49:39,473
Stopped.

456
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:04,330
Stops.

457
00:50:16,963 --> 00:50:19,288
It's just blood, my, it's just blood.

458
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:24,930
Hey, guys, this is not blood.

459
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:39,029
Hey, just because you cry, do
means that you understand, idiots.

460
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:47,997
They speak very little English.

461
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:52,649
And I speak very little German,
then we are in it.

462
00:50:53,378 --> 00:50:54,878
<i>Touché.</i>

463
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,393
You speak very well.

464
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,743
I'm still an idiot?

465
00:51:02,899 --> 00:51:06,747
I studied 3 years at the University of
Cambridge before the war...

466
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:11,621
Did you know that the war fought
ended long ago?

467
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:14,513
What do you mean by that
the war is over?

468
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:23,154
Listen, you came in
diving, right?

469
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,672
I and many others...

470
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,379
... as they could see the cemetery.

471
00:51:28,624 --> 00:51:34,735
Listen, there may be a way
all leave here.

472
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,483
What are you talking about?

473
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,135
Get down

474
00:51:52,934 --> 00:51:56,218
The old Conrad said
there was oil here...

475
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:59,838
... and that old T-Rex the
tracked so far.

476
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:03,884
So... if you find
that T-Rex...

477
00:52:04,282 --> 00:52:07,991
... may be the only way
we leave this island.

478
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:14,010
But we must work together.

479
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:26,379
First we have to end
job.

480
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:41,804
Where you going?

481
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:46,287
Be right back. Stay here, I
you to stay safe.

482
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,951
What about you?

483
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,098
I'll be back soon.

484
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,536
Do not go.

485
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:06,512
From what we saw,
extremely dangerous.

486
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:09,130
We gave him the name of Kriegsnarbe.

487
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,341
Means "scar".

488
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:15,007
He fought hard.

489
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,820
And more than half of the island
is its territory.

490
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:27,843
We have special regard for him.

491
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,634
Protect your back.

492
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,050
Hey! Oil.

493
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:06,533
Zander, Zander.

494
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:10,951
Oil.

495
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:14,298
Hey, Hey, Frost.

496
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,444
And if we get there?

497
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,949
It's fast.

498
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:53,828
Oh, yes, this is good.

499
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:04,416
Crap.

500
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,976
Come on.

501
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:08,364
Let.

502
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:35,971
Ok, let's.

503
00:56:57,159 --> 00:56:58,801
Come on.

504
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:05,333
Quick, quick.

505
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,124
And now what, sir?

506
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:29,876
Now...

507
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:33,655
Now...

508
00:57:34,956 --> 00:57:36,646
Now...

509
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:42,341
Now comes the dangerous part.

510
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,371
Okay.

511
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,750
Apparently this device
can be distilled alcohol.

512
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:03,727
What is not much.

513
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:08,171
No, actually we have to heat the
oil to separate its components.

514
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,475
Gas is up and gasoline in the background.

515
00:58:13,307 --> 00:58:17,107
Petrol... Diesel.

516
00:58:17,337 --> 00:58:19,738
Pour the oil here.

517
00:58:19,879 --> 00:58:21,691
In theory if we apply heat.

518
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:27,680
The oil will be distilled, and will
through this copper pipe.

519
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,783
Here, here.

520
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,884
And will end this reservoir
cooling.

521
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:40,847
Obviously we can not control
much heat, so...

522
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:44,986
... I have to explain to them what happens
when oil is very hot...

523
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:48,122
Exactly.

524
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:51,984
So I think we should
much room for it.

525
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:55,604
I think we should work in shifts
and start right now.

526
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:00,474
- Everything is ready.
- Lonzo.

527
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:02,087
Personnel.

528
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:04,285
Personnel.

529
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:12,334
We had to remove it from the
camp...

530
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:16,536
... and now we are completely
exposed to everything.

531
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,670
You might want to go with the others...

532
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:24,791
... until at least know
how this works.

533
00:59:28,452 --> 00:59:30,428
We are sure together.

534
00:59:55,631 --> 00:59:57,169
Wow.

535
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,038
Yes, wow.

536
01:01:06,665 --> 01:01:08,241
Okay.

537
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:10,769
The honor is all yours.

538
01:01:17,276 --> 01:01:19,040
God help us.

539
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:25,313
Yes

540
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:46,082
With music all is bearable,
even weeks below the sea.

541
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:59,181
What would be missing for this
submarine working again?

542
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:05,451
Require more gallons of
we use for this...

543
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:11,834
Suppose we
get fuel.

544
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:15,566
Some simple repairs.

545
01:02:20,439 --> 01:02:24,573
Judging by the moon, high tide will
in one or two weeks.

546
01:02:27,922 --> 01:02:30,567
You want to try to go on a submarine?

547
01:02:33,551 --> 01:02:36,622
It may be the best opportunity
we have.

548
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,525
First...

549
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,388
... we have to charge
a big problem.

550
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:52,335
That's not what I said?

551
01:02:53,716 --> 01:02:56,365
- I understand.
- It's okay.

552
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:24,453
Why not hunted the T-Rex?

553
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:26,128
We tried.

554
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:29,886
Our weapons were not much damage
mainly to a safe distance.

555
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:33,293
When you are injured, are still
more dangerous.

556
01:03:34,387 --> 01:03:36,950
We have to destroy it altogether.

557
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,030
How long do you think it takes?

558
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,248
Know?

559
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,070
I have an idea.

560
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:05,297
As a child, my father used
some tricks, fireworks...

561
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,794
... to scare the deer
the fields of hay.

562
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:12,259
I know it scared a T-Rex is very
more dangerous to dismiss...

563
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:16,489
... a deer from a field of hay, but
can use anything...

564
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:21,250
gunpowder, smoke, explosives, any
thing to do a lot of noise.

565
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:22,834
We hypotheses.

566
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,589
We must follow the advice of
ancestors.

567
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:28,515
They were smoking in places steep.

568
01:04:29,018 --> 01:04:30,869
We would do the same thing.

569
01:04:31,226 --> 01:04:34,875
Would use explosives to
attract the T-Rex.

570
01:04:35,533 --> 01:04:39,453
Somehow we need to take it
to the oil tank on the beach.

571
01:04:39,863 --> 01:04:43,936
What this island is so great for
down something that size?

572
01:04:44,688 --> 01:04:47,726
We have to be lucky, to be precise.

573
01:04:48,328 --> 01:04:52,860
But if we succeed, we
access to all the oil we need.

574
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:56,690
There is only one problem, as we
able to remove the T-Rex?

575
01:04:56,969 --> 01:04:58,491
He's right.

576
01:04:58,735 --> 01:05:02,202
When you use the explosive to
him out of his lair...

577
01:05:03,113 --> 01:05:05,242
... will ignite all the oil.

578
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:08,575
We will not survive.

579
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,635
True.

580
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:17,561
I will instruct me to get him.

581
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:44,384
Come on, lagartixão.

582
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,067
Now!

583
01:07:04,492 --> 01:07:06,060
Hey!

584
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:17,077
Hey, come!

585
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,659
Lindsay!

586
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,048
Now!

587
01:08:00,714 --> 01:08:02,418
Run!

588
01:08:04,393 --> 01:08:05,909
Run!

589
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:25,157
Come!

590
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,822
- Come on!
- No!

591
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:40,007
Hey.

592
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:43,503
I know that now you want to be alone but
have to be careful...

593
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,830
... to walk alone here, is
very dangerous.

594
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:52,975
He hugged me and made me feel
I was not alone.

595
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,239
I do not know is...

596
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:12,680
... can not believe he's gone.
It makes no sense.

597
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:18,031
It's not fair...

598
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:26,707
... but we opened the door, Linds,
as it always did.

599
01:10:27,317 --> 01:10:29,901
Everyone has to try harder
to get out of it.

600
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:33,262
You have to do your part.
I need you for this.

601
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:36,789
You're not alone.

602
01:10:45,795 --> 01:10:47,589
I'll wait outside.

603
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:03,042
We'll have to dig, dig and dig.

604
01:11:03,163 --> 01:11:04,990
We'll have to dig much.

605
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:12,379
We will have to remove the sand from
base throughout the submarine.

606
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:20,164
He said he would dig up the hell
thereby return to his girlfriend.

607
01:11:21,137 --> 01:11:27,122
If we get enough sand for
down, water from the base...

608
01:11:27,187 --> 01:11:31,711
... the high tide to move it from
sand to the sea.

609
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:33,731
When we realize that
engines have linked...

610
01:11:33,776 --> 01:11:36,206
... we can empty the tanks
ballast and put a floor.

611
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:50,531
His girlfriend... she...

612
01:11:50,661 --> 01:11:53,642
... you may have
aged much.

613
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,230
It may even be dead.

614
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,496
The world is different from
as the left.

615
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:09,351
I have a wife and a son.

616
01:12:13,151 --> 01:12:15,949
There are many great mysteries, captain.

617
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:19,872
We must not lose opportunities
that are before us.

618
01:12:24,403 --> 01:12:26,298
You have a man?

619
01:12:58,902 --> 01:13:00,436
Yes

620
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:02,148
Oh, my God.

621
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:05,110
- Okay, I think I can do it.
- Let me teach you something.

622
01:13:31,262 --> 01:13:32,831
Here, here.

623
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,398
Come.

624
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,143
We finish on time?

625
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:50,069
Yes, I think so.

626
01:14:50,677 --> 01:14:55,225
We need a lot of oil
when we take the sand...

627
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,825
... and drown in the sea.

628
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:04,459
Just let us have a chance
when we take the ballast.

629
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:13,064
Other than that, you have to
to worry about.

630
01:15:35,445 --> 01:15:38,171
All supplies are exhausted,
water, food, everything.

631
01:15:38,244 --> 01:15:41,500
When we take the ballast
will not be back.

632
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:43,571
Now we have high tide.

633
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:45,450
But they are bringing the
fuel right now.

634
01:15:45,547 --> 01:15:47,228
We need to sink now.

635
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,785
We can only hope that the
food reaches us.

636
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:51,974
The tide does not wait, man.

637
01:18:16,698 --> 01:18:20,538
The tide rose, it's now or never.
Let's get it out of the sand.

638
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:23,059
- Remove the weights.
- Now!

639
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:30,537
Wait.

640
01:18:34,612 --> 01:18:37,112
Wait, wait, they do not
back yet.

641
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,491
Lonzo!

642
01:18:42,912 --> 01:18:44,498
Come.

643
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:51,556
Lonzo!

644
01:18:55,074 --> 01:18:56,991
We have to go to the submarine.

645
01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:04,097
Let.

646
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:42,085
Liga engines.

647
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,590
We are moving us.

648
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:41,809
We did it!

649
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,580
What?
What did he say?

650
01:20:49,685 --> 01:20:51,763
It seems that Frost does
able to return.

651
01:20:51,783 --> 01:20:53,628
I think we lost.

652
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,192
- Karen! Karen!
- I was here a minute ago.

653
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:28,760
Frost.

654
01:21:31,405 --> 01:21:32,926
Hey.

655
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,666
You okay?

656
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:39,645
It's too late, they were.

657
01:21:44,697 --> 01:21:46,553
Why do not you go with them?

658
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,107
Not without you.

659
01:22:04,242 --> 01:22:06,810
We may never know
if the attempt was successful...

660
01:22:06,832 --> 01:22:09,591
... and the submarine could
escape this place.

661
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:16,615
Perhaps someday, someone
come here as we...

662
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:19,625
... and went home
again.

663
01:22:22,047 --> 01:22:27,792
Meanwhile, life goes on
time passes.

664
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:33,112
Even in this place lost,
forgotten by the world,

665
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,341
... we can build a house.

666
01:22:39,818 --> 01:22:45,381
Finish my story and send it in
bottle to any destination...

667
01:22:45,472 --> 01:22:49,670
... reminds me that whenever
we are starting.

668
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:52,195
May God bless us on this journey.

669
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:54,872
Frost Michaels.
