1
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,792
Take this I'll call you up
next time.

2
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,120
Thanks.

3
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,358
I'm fainting.

4
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,663
The building would collapse,
they're supported only by glass.

5
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,861
Judge,
count me in if you have other deals.

6
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,868
Forget it.

7
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,304
- Do you know it.
- You son-of-the-bitch.

8
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,777
Boy,
don't leave any traces in the car.

9
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,972
Don't blow it.

10
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,911
- Don't worry.
- Don't make mistake.

11
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,348
Let's go...

12
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,816
What's the word on his back?

13
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,215
Foul word.

14
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,150
Get the whore...

15
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,378
What's the hell going on?

16
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,327
Stand straight. Turn right.

17
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,757
Good morning.

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,031
Good morning.

19
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,336
Mo, you've signed it.

20
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,034
Yes. How can I forget?

21
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,442
Times have changed,

22
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,706
the new boss don't like this.

23
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,008
Don't say that I doublecross you
when you blew it.

24
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,110
If I didn't blew it,
you won't be the one doublecross me.

25
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,519
How can you say that!

26
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,125
I'm just giving you some advice.

27
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,020
Sergeant,
the whole section will be doomed,

28
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,490
if this was discovered.

29
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,961
You've signed it last week.

30
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,631
Shut up,

31
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,165
I don't need your advice.

32
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,428
Don't say that I didn't warn you.

33
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,401
The new Inspector Lo is straight.

34
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,304
He's notorious for scolding people.

35
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,570
I've heard of him
when I was being trained.

36
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,043
As long as I make no mistake,

37
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,840
he's got nothing to do with me.

38
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,541
How dare you,
you're new and you won't learn.

39
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,119
Good morning, Inspector Lo.

40
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,915
Good morning, Inspector Lo.

41
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,725
- Where's the occurrence book?
- Over there.

42
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,896
Why would it go over there.

43
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,194
Who's on duty today?

44
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,664
Me, sir.

45
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,136
Where's the guys?

46
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,568
Team 6 is in court today.

47
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,199
Team 3 and 5 is out,

48
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,937
the others are in.

49
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,636
District Sergeant Cheung
signed 5 min ago, where's he now?

50
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,981
- He just went out for work.
- Work!

51
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,421
Where did your inspector go?

52
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,489
I've been here for a week,

53
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,024
I've never seen this person.

54
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,692
I must see him in 15 minutes.

55
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,396
Fetch him here.

56
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,497
Did you hear me?

57
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,994
Yes, sir

58
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,032
No discipline at all.

59
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,294
Goodbye, Sir

60
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,106
What's go funny? Go to work.

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,640
Chiu, you talked too much this time.

62
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,142
What are we going to do?

63
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,346
Who told you
to flatter the boss wrongly.

64
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,380
I didn't tell you to take this up,
this is your own fault.

65
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,244
Kong,
only you know Boss's telephone number.

66
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,720
Please tell him the message. Please.

67
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,290
Sergeant, please beg him,
it's not my business.

68
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,461
Help me.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,596
I'm only helping
the district Sergeant.

70
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,359
- Not you.
- Yes!

71
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,373
It's Kong, where are you?

72
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,136
I'm making love.

73
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,315
The new CI tell you to go back
to the station.

74
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,474
Return quickly.

75
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,244
Return, he must be crazy.

76
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,251
That new guy wants you back
in 15 minutes.

77
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,252
I have things to do,

78
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,788
we talk when I come back.

79
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,099
You show up at last?

80
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,900
Damn your mother,

81
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,970
why did you stop the car
so suddenly.

82
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,301
How can you pull over
in the middle of the road?

83
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,204
It's my fault.

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,468
- Move it aside. Hurry up.
- Sorry.

85
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,645
Hurry up or I'll beat you up.

86
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,871
What're you guys up to?

87
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,949
Damn.

88
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,616
Drive it away immediately.

89
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,079
You're trying to murder people!

90
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,380
Is that truck yours?

91
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,385
Yes, so what?

92
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,889
- I want to talk to you.
- You're crazy!

93
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,095
I've to arrest you.

94
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,167
- Go and check what is doing.
- O.K.

95
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,333
Don't be so polite, swear at me.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,100
You're policeman.
You can park anywhere.

97
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,303
- Stand still and have an eye on him.
- Okay.

98
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,914
- Hold it.
- He's running that way. Go after him.

99
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,208
You...

100
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,547
Why did you hit me!

101
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,906
Run faster.

102
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,913
Don't stop. Good.

103
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,915
Run faster.

104
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,052
Get up and keep on running.

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,285
You're faster than my car.

106
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,980
But you're still slower
than my bullet.

107
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,022
Little brat, you want to run?

108
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,592
Run back the same way
as what you just did.

109
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,587
Run.

110
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,023
What a Lucrative return?

111
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,532
Check how many bikes are there?

112
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,798
There's a few boxes of spare parts.

113
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,940
Give me the total amount.

114
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,369
- For you!
- Of course.

115
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,510
Check the owner
of the pulling truck afterwards.

116
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,678
- Yes.
- Sir.

117
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,040
District sergeant, come here.

118
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,114
I didn't know you were a cop,
I'm so sorry.

119
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,341
If you don't swear at my mother,
you're good citizen.

120
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,746
You said I am a good citizen?

121
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,886
How did you catch those 3 robbers?

122
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,452
- These 3 convicts...
- Sir.

123
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,747
Should I be awarded
with the "good citizen" prize?

124
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,859
If no, I'll give you one myself.

125
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,723
These 3 convicts stole that truck.

126
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,853
I flew down to catch them.

127
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,094
Inspector Lo.

128
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,233
What happened?

129
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,305
District Sergeant is smart,
he caught 3 guys by himself.

130
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,340
And retrieved the truckload
of Yamaha motorbikes!

131
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,645
He's over there.

132
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,370
- What's your number?
- 105663

133
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,505
- What department?
- 1st team of criminal investigation.

134
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,378
Boss, this new boss.

135
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,448
How are you, sir?

136
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,743
Sir...

137
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,452
The convicts said
they have to examine their wound.

138
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,818
Forget about him,
fix him up for me first.

139
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,186
- Ok.
- Thanks, sir.

140
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,950
This is stolen as well,

141
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,822
what should we do about it?

142
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,589
Find the car owner.

143
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,787
You're Cheung.

144
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,060
Lo sir.

145
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,893
Return to the station immediately,

146
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,797
and write a detail report for me.

147
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,234
- Wong sir.
- Reporters want to talk to you.

148
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,201
- Tell them to wait.
- Yes sir.

149
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,832
Go right away.

150
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,567
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,703
What should we do now?

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,938
Wait in the car.

153
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,513
Inspector Lo was in a rage
this morning.

154
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,082
He knew you didn't come to work
for a whole week.

155
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,048
But I was working outside?

156
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,583
I have been in the field
for over ten years.

157
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,086
I've seen enough fierce bosses!

158
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,926
But he's really ferocious.

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,721
- Lock him back first.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,157
Do something. Don't just stand here.

161
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,558
Sir, you didn't write down
my address.

162
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,308
Inspector Lo.

163
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,675
Why are you writing here.

164
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,041
Is this your office?

165
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,273
What impudence. Sit down.

166
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,651
I am used to standing around, sir.

167
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,081
My report today.

168
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,896
What is this?
Is this a child's composition.

169
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,726
Rewrite it.

170
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,026
I've spent two hours
to write this up.

171
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,498
You can understand it.

172
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,138
I've read over your file.

173
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,701
You've been working for over 10 years,

174
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,373
and received many complaints.

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,943
Sir, it's true.

176
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,476
But many commanders
have commended me.

177
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,677
Didn't you read it?

178
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,248
Really?

179
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,912
It's over here, this pile.

180
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,484
Do you know what it means?

181
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,286
I know all the 28 alphabets.

182
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,253
But it's more difficult
if they're stringed.

183
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,424
Cheung, don't be impudent.

184
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,995
And be over confident.

185
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,931
And treat your superiors rudely.

186
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,536
Inspector Lo,
I've always respected my superiors.

187
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,642
And I'm always responsible.

188
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,471
I haven't seen you for whole week.

189
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,846
Is that being responsible?

190
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,114
I've been watching those few convicts
for the whole week.

191
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,218
Can I catch robbers
if I sit in the station?

192
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,484
What are you implying?

193
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,352
This unit is under my supervision,

194
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,392
you must listen to what I say.

195
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,187
From now on.

196
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,363
You sign for attendance everyday,
understand?

197
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,657
No problem.

198
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,860
Take it.

199
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,166
If you're finished,

200
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,464
then I'll write up my report again.

201
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,346
See you tomorrow.

202
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,851
Concise, fluent and accurate.

203
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,078
If he can't understand this,
it's hard to explain.

204
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,686
District Sergeant,
What did CI commend you?

205
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,183
Damn you,

206
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,551
it took a whole week
to catch those convicts.

207
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,919
Now he wants to boot me.

208
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:08,991
He's a hard boss to work with.

209
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,026
He must have some abilities.

210
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,357
It's not easy to be a inspector.

211
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,963
Stop flattering, okay?

212
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,627
Even if he 'boot' me,

213
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,200
you're not qualified
to take my place.

214
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,304
- Put it down.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,532
When you award
the "good citizen" prize for me?

216
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,902
I will contact you when it's ready,

217
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,236
be patient.

218
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,344
Thanks.

219
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,537
Boss, the report.

220
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,271
I want to complain about him.

221
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,143
You hit me without any reason.

222
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,186
- Shut up,
- you don't have the right to complain.

223
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,652
I was being complained many times
anyway.

224
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,325
I got the permission to hit you!

225
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,824
Remember, I'm Cheung.

226
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,588
Lock him in the cell, no bail.

227
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,660
YES, SIR...

228
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,888
Follow me.

229
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,633
Sir.

230
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,160
- What's so funny?
- Sit down.

231
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,668
What are you writing?

232
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,173
Check.

233
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,642
Why don't you write in Chinese.

234
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,812
What is this L stands for?

235
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,145
What is this stands for?

236
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,980
Location.

237
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,487
Why didn't you write
the Chinese word.

238
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,186
Copy it again.

239
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,286
What is it?

240
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,021
Boss, I can't read scribbles.

241
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,792
Do I have to write in English.

242
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,360
For your reference,
let me sign it after you copied it.

243
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,935
Yes, sir...

244
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,074
I know all the alphabets,

245
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,938
and about a hundred Chinese characters.

246
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,338
I still am an officer.

247
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,446
You're so brilliant,
district Sergeant.

248
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,444
Of course, how is my office?

249
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,083
Very big.

250
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,684
I don't come back often.

251
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,113
You've been playing at the station
all the afternoon,

252
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,416
go home now.

253
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,616
I'm going now.

254
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,227
Don't forget my price.

255
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,362
Sure.

256
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,232
Let's go and relax.

257
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,022
Judge, what's the background
of this old man?

258
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,557
He owns these two buildings.

259
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,723
Take a shower.

260
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,359
Judge.

261
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,891
Chicken. Where are you going?

262
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,090
Going to whorehouse.

263
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,867
Go to the pier immediately.

264
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,093
O.K. I'm coming.

265
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,399
Room checking,
present your ID cards.

266
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,872
My penis has retreated.

267
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,386
- How is that guaimui.
- It's good!

268
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,451
- Bull!
- Judge!

269
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,126
Smut you must be cooled.

270
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,123
Better than taking medicine.

271
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,693
Of course, it's fun.

272
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,194
Brother, don't wander around.

273
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,926
The stuff will arrive tomorrow,

274
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,835
we'll start tonight
for some capital.

275
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,866
Chicken ravage
Bill's gambling joint.

276
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
Not enough!

277
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,338
Fix him.

278
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,139
Judge, what do you think?

279
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,545
It'd be the easiest,
fastest and safest deal.

280
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,207
Just like drawing cash

281
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,111
if everything goes smooth.

282
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,652
With those millions of dollars,

283
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,251
we can get as many women as we want.

284
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,959
Remember, do in next week.

285
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,129
Tonight we must be on our toes!

286
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,325
See you tonight.

287
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,928
I've lost all of it,
but I'll get it back in the next round.

288
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:48,279
L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, T, Z, Z.

289
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,516
There's 29 alphabets,

290
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,846
there couldn't be one more.

291
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,318
I don't have a talent for English.

292
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,818
Don't waste time.

293
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,624
You come here...

294
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,263
I'll go out and patrol,
you will take care of this place.

295
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,266
You...

296
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,199
What are you afraid of?

297
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,635
Just pretend you don't know.

298
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,705
Call me if anything happen,
I'll be here in 15 min!

299
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,002
That is. Cheer up.

300
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,041
Boss, but.

301
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,067
Who?

302
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,301
Yes, Judge?

303
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,569
Get me a car.

304
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,970
Okay, when?

305
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,875
Quick, I'll see you
at the old place in 20 min.

306
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,583
No problem, don't be late.

307
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,383
C.R.B.

308
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,416
I'm District Sergeant 105663,
please check.

309
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,555
Function 60 Delta Fox 5654,
it's a private car.

310
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:23,323
It's silver in color,

311
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,894
check if it's a stolen car.

312
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,092
Wait a minute.

313
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,856
Damn you mother-fucker!

314
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,964
What did you say?

315
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,795
I'm sorry,
I'll not scolding your mother.

316
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:31,965
Repeat the license number.

317
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,665
Delta Fox 5654.

318
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,506
The owner is Mrs. Johnstone.

319
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,803
Her address is at 66 Repulse Bay.

320
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,478
Judge.

321
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,207
- Take it.
- It's great.

322
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,978
Judge, take me with you.

323
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,211
Next time. Alright, bye.

324
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,716
- The car is not reported stolen.
- Thank.

325
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,569
Smartass, what do you want?

326
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,362
Straighten up!

327
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,306
Straighten up!

328
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,100
Don't go! Watch it...

329
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,410
You'll regret if you run again!

330
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,617
- Why should I regret!
- Stand straight.

331
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,247
- What is it?
- Stand straight.

332
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,887
Why should I.

333
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,021
I tell you to stand straight.

334
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,383
Crazy.

335
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,084
Don't go. Mother fucker.

336
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,593
- What are you doing
- Why didn't you stand straight.

337
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,922
- Let me go.
- A nutcase. You don't listen to me.

338
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,257
Stand straight for what?

339
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,599
I'll break your skull.

340
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,531
Let me go!

341
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,641
Let me go, or I'll beat you up.

342
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,470
Let me go.

343
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,948
Psycho, I'll stamp you.

344
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,781
Don't move!

345
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,456
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

346
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,817
I won't move...

347
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,420
Don't play tricks.

348
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,718
I dare not to...

349
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,664
Stand aside.

350
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,363
Don't be impulsive,
you may misfire it.

351
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,831
- Lock yourself.
- No problem.

352
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,678
Lock the handle. Quick.

353
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,707
Lock myself, okay.

354
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,128
I shouldn't have done it that way.

355
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,294
- Chicken.
- Speaking!

356
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,493
- What time?
- Around 1 o'clock.

357
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,564
No problem.

358
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,670
Go. Alright, I go.

359
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,874
Go.

360
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,571
Chang sir,
what time you arrested him?

361
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,681
One missed.

362
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,109
And cropped out again.

363
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,649
Chang sir, I say that
what time you arrested him.

364
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,090
- Half past twelve.
- Thanks.

365
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,317
You'll be punished.

366
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,225
Where's the car?

367
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,527
Come with me, if you lose.

368
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,250
What can do for you?

369
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,214
How about it?

370
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:41,791
Please, come in.

371
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,487
How much you lose?

372
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,027
About 250 thousand.

373
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,664
Where you got the money?

374
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,763
Please come in!

375
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,897
Please...

376
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,371
Brother.

377
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,448
How many do you want to change.

378
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,913
All of it.

379
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:09,849
Boss.

380
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,449
Don't move!

381
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,760
Crouch down,
how dare you come to gamble.

382
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,462
How a lot of money!

383
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,206
Kill.

384
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,714
Get down, don't breath!

385
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,552
You came out if you know
the second shot is no bullet,

386
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,450
Go.

387
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,486
Why don't you fight back?

388
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,294
Chicken, we can go now.

389
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,699
Just now a rich man
give us a thousand dollars.

390
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,307
Don't move.

391
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,169
This car was theirs.

392
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,108
What is going on?

393
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,407
The joint was ravaged.

394
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,918
If I become unproductive,
you would be suffered.

395
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,414
I'll help you.

396
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,552
Where did you steal that car?

397
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,888
Did you see me stealing it, sir?

398
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,056
DF5456, 5546.

399
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,794
Be careful of
what you are accusing me for.

400
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,398
Do you think I'm stupid.

401
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,933
I have all the records
at the radio station.

402
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,634
Your want to trick me?

403
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,596
Don't trick me. Go.

404
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,541
Don't walk around.

405
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,077
He molested me
when I was walking along the street.

406
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,238
She said you molested her.

407
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,713
No. I'm not.

408
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,318
When she rushed to me,
I pushed her away.

409
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,313
You've asked me for the whole night.

410
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,588
What's happening?

411
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,952
D. Sergeant, he is a school master.

412
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,320
The girl said he molested her.

413
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,687
He said you bump into him yourself.

414
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,159
Of course he'll say that.

415
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,558
He didn't admit he molested her.

416
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,567
What a pretentious beast.

417
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,367
I saw you with Saboman.

418
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,099
Are you his disciple.

419
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,033
What Saboman,
I don't know what you're talking about.

420
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,472
Don't pretend to be stupid.

421
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,615
You can't pick the guy's pocket,
so you trick him.

422
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,817
What pickpockets?
Don't blame for nothing.

423
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,215
He's molested me,
why did you question me instead.

424
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,321
What is the matter?

425
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,319
Inspector Lo.

426
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,424
I don't know what this guy
is talking about?

427
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,583
- Shut up,
- What do you want?

428
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,886
- Stop the nonsense.
- He's asking me.

429
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:29,961
Sit down.

430
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,357
Don't I have a right to talk?

431
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,588
Not bullshitting.

432
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,097
Lo sir, I suspect this girl is
from the pickpocket organizations.

433
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,758
When they blew it,

434
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,665
they blame the guy for raping.

435
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,300
Who is in charge of this case?

436
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,802
Chiu.

437
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,737
- Don't nonsense.
- It's me, sir.

438
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,810
I really didn't do anything
like that.

439
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,646
Speak when you're questioned only!

440
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,306
Why are you here then?

441
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,111
I caught the car thief.

442
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,153
Don't bullshitting.

443
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,116
I didn't steal any car.

444
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,787
What car did he steal?

445
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,794
That car was driven away.

446
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,090
I was walking on the street,

447
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,994
he hit me and accused me
for car-stealing.

448
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,402
How can you do that?
Don't you have better things to do?

449
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,467
- Come over.
- Stand straight.

450
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,601
Chiu.

451
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,365
Inspector Lo, I'm all ears?

452
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,634
Someone was wounded.

453
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,568
Check out the case at the location?

454
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,679
Yes.

455
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,780
- Kam.
- Inspector Lo.

456
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,746
Lock him up
and go to court tomorrow.

457
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,245
- Yes, sir.
- Lighten up.

458
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,784
I thought I could off duty.

459
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:29,951
Come here.

460
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,454
You've got the wrong guy.

461
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,751
You're too optimistic,

462
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,018
- take him down as well.
- Mo, yes.

463
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,754
- Bring him along.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,125
You've got to be careful.
This guy is very tricky.

465
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,355
Don't mess around, brother.

466
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,760
Quick, we'll meet in court.

467
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,235
- What is the matter?
- Inspector Chan.

468
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,171
How's that going?

469
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,072
Inspector Cheung.

470
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,108
The gambling joint is being robbed.

471
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,906
- Is that right.
- What are you doing here?

472
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,812
Inspector Lo said
I should have more overtime allowance.

473
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,884
The case was handed
to the homicide section.

474
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,020
Two dead, one seriously wounded.

475
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,554
That bad? The big boss is here too.

476
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,885
Don't disturb him.

477
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,794
DELTA FOX 5654

478
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,700
Sir, is this a stolen car?

479
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,436
Right, the owner is Mrs. Johnstone.

480
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,468
Right.

481
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,672
What?

482
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
Something was detected
in the stolen car.

483
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,835
Could be.

484
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,808
Did you have the midnight snack yet?

485
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,273
Since the homicide section
had took up the case,

486
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,607
we can go home earlier.

487
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,276
Are you the one who decide
when to call off the investigation?

488
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,577
Stand straight beside the car.

489
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,447
This is order.

490
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,713
Go. Chiu.

491
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,249
Damn, he only listen
when I speak in English.

492
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,482
It makes me mad.

493
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,253
Many superiors are here,
don't say the wrong words.

494
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,291
Please take a look.

495
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,555
There are so many superiors here.

496
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,821
We don't have right to say anything.

497
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,362
I'm going. Bye.

498
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,646
Calling for more people?

499
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,612
This way.

500
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,398
Where's the goods?

501
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,348
What's the price?

502
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,457
$20,000, including your watch.

503
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,020
Damn, fool.

504
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,926
Don't move!

505
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,555
What're you doing?

506
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:58,067
Don't play tricks,
give me the watch.

507
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,203
Here.

508
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,197
One is not enough,
is there anymore goods?

509
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,473
Yes, bring the long one.

510
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,739
- Okay.
- Quick.

511
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,087
Good.

512
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,756
How much?

513
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,390
$40,000 for one.

514
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,269
Chicken, give them the money.

515
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,134
Yes.

516
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,547
I'll pay you more for the guns
your men are holding.

517
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,979
Give it to us.

518
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,544
$200,000, come over...

519
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:54,213
Give them all, sell them all.

520
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,826
We'll sell them the bullets as well.

521
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,129
Put them all here.

522
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,896
Great, give me the money.

523
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,365
Give it to him.

524
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,894
Hide it first.

525
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm rich. This is for you.

526
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,841
- This is for you.
- How about me?

527
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,739
Okay, you're great.

528
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,515
This is for you.

529
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,083
All included.
What's this supposed to mean?

530
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,519
You hid one. I'll kill you.

531
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,352
Damn, you don't keep your word.

532
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,917
I'll pay you still.
Don't play tricks.

533
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,226
I've been on the streets for decades.
Now you're in Hong Kong.

534
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,435
You're far behind. Go.

535
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,583
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

536
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,353
Come in.

537
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,349
Good morning, Inspector Lo.

538
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,130
How's the case last night?

539
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,300
Gambling den robbery.
Two dead and one seriously injured.

540
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,937
Department of criminal investigation
has already taken over the case.

541
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,941
Do you have any idea who did it?

542
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,573
The owner of that joint is Bill.

543
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,305
I think he knows who did it.

544
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,775
But they won't talk.

545
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,883
Any other traces?

546
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,955
The car the robbers left.

547
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,851
It's the same
as the one I caught last night.

548
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,626
I suspect the two cases are related.

549
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,656
Good, then put the kid in the files.

550
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,794
And charge him for car stealing,
robbery and murder.

551
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,428
Inspector Lo, how'd you do this.

552
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,867
Put all the blame on him.

553
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,709
I don't mean it that way.

554
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,906
I mean, that kid was caught
and put into the cell.

555
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,377
In a different location.

556
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,514
Have a thorough check.
Don't take the wrong person.

557
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,317
Cheung, we're serve the law.

558
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,584
We don't judge
whether he's guilty or not.

559
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,688
The judge do that, not you.

560
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,622
Not you. Is it clear?

561
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,227
Very clear, Inspector Lo.

562
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,064
- Is it alright?
- Get out.

563
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,967
He's guilty alright,
but wrongly charged.

564
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,501
Let me out.

565
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,510
You're all dead, right?

566
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,173
- Don't let me go.
- Shut up.

567
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,509
Don't go away. I haven't finished.

568
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,549
Let me out, I'll sue you.

569
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,185
Damn you.

570
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,754
Let that monkey out.

571
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,461
I've to ask him something. Thanks.

572
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,526
God, my wrist.

573
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,432
What am I charged for?

574
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,743
You can't jailed me
for more than 48 hours.

575
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,046
You're up to your neck
and still mouthing?

576
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,943
Don't bluff me.

577
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,753
You can't do that in court,
you need evidence.

578
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:14,354
Right, see if the judge trust you
or me.

579
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,461
I'm frightened, really.

580
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,693
Someone is committing suicide,
open the gate.

581
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,627
Someone is committing suicide!

582
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,827
Stand here, kid.

583
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,998
Quick, come here and help.

584
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,836
Take him down first.
Call the ambulance.

585
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,010
- What is wrong?
- Tell D.O. A prisoner hanged himself.

586
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,117
The suspect hanged himself.

587
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,352
Why did he commit suicide?

588
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,727
He's O.K.

589
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,899
He's alive. It's alright.

590
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,269
- Quick...
- Come here.

591
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,037
- You hold it.
- Quick.

592
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,937
What's going on?

593
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,839
I didn't molest her!

594
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,643
- Inspector Lo.
- Inspector Lo is here. Step aside...

595
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,679
What are you doing?

596
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,943
The prisoner hanged himself.

597
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,053
Hanged?

598
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,317
You said you're innocent.

599
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,516
Now you're so afraid
to be convicted that you rather die.

600
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,026
Why didn't he die?

601
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,963
Inspector Lo, just let him die.

602
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,004
The school kids will be saved then.

603
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,407
Right! He's better dead than alive.

604
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,412
Then there'll be no appeals?

605
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:48,007
As the motto says:
You can't trust a cop.

606
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,484
What did you say? Why are you here?

607
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,184
I told him to record the statement.

608
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,960
Inspector Lo,
I have the file on that guy.

609
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,627
He's unemployed
He's probably involved in the robbery.

610
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,025
- Don't just wag your tongue.
- Okay...

611
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,627
Is it your turn to talk?

612
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,163
Lock him in.

613
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,270
Yes sir...

614
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,233
I want to see my lawyer first.

615
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,565
- Go!
- Don't push?

616
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,936
Give me his statement now.

617
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,517
Thanks.

618
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,351
I'm not more lucky than you,

619
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,917
Walk.

620
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,688
Walk.

621
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,402
You won't admit to car stealing?

622
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,932
What a stupid question.

623
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,866
Come here...

624
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,071
Why did you give me food?

625
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,940
I don't want to send you
to the hospital.

626
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,309
You should co-operate afterward.

627
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,746
Dirty trick again.

628
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,184
Your boss is quite trash!

629
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,489
What are you talking about?

630
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,923
Inspector sir,
he dares to frame anyone for anything.

631
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,895
How dare you insult
the Royal police.

632
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,862
He almost killed that old man
as well.

633
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,095
And you were scolded.

634
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,731
It's your business.

635
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,437
Don't talk so much, it will be worse
if I want to incriminate.

636
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,608
You won't.

637
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,806
Do you know what I'll accuse you of?

638
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,174
Maybe attacking your penis.

639
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,984
Don't be so scared to shit here.

640
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,087
I'm charging you for car stealing,
robbery and murder.

641
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,119
You're worse than your boss.

642
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,823
Don't look at me like that.

643
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,790
I found the car you stole.

644
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,926
That car was proved to be used
for the robbery.

645
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,101
Two died and one wounded.

646
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,296
But I was taken here
when I got out of the car.

647
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,736
How can I rob
when I'm locked in the cell?

648
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,677
So you admitted you stole the car.

649
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,346
Yes, I won't be hanged for that.

650
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,349
Say it! Give the car to whom?
It is good for you.

651
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,182
Don't bluff, I don't know anything.

652
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:08,556
I've expected
that you won't confess.

653
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,994
You should have a bright future,
in Stanley prison.

654
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,727
Bring up that chair.

655
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,433
Come on, help me.

656
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,737
Don't touch me, you're diseased.

657
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,038
Don't touch me.

658
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,482
- D. Sergeant.
- What are you doing?

659
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,544
Got nothing else to do.

660
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,244
No...

661
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,012
Come with me to a drive.
Take him out.

662
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,254
Tell me clearly,
what's happening now?

663
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,724
Alright.

664
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,053
Where are you going?

665
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,956
- Quick!
- Where are we going?

666
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,097
Why should I tell you?

667
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,390
Do I have to report to you.

668
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:02,770
Come here.

669
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,243
I gave him the car here last night.

670
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,679
They live on the top floor,

671
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,147
I don't know which flat.

672
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,782
Take me up.

673
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,382
Boss, forgive me.

674
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,357
You want to take my life, don't you?

675
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,121
If he's really up there,

676
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,955
I'll be dead for sure.

677
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,023
Are you bargaining with a cop?

678
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,930
What do you want from me?

679
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,833
Just let me go up alone first.

680
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,232
And check what's going on,

681
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,238
then I'll report to you.

682
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,841
If we let you go, I'll be a moron.

683
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,382
Alright, let you go.

684
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,117
Open it...

685
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,256
This brat's got some idea.

686
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,854
D. Sergeant, this guy is tricking us.

687
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,356
Go up.

688
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,228
Wait here for me.

689
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,196
- Don't play tricks on me!
- Ok.

690
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,764
I wonder what's he up to.

691
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,739
Watch the end of the street,
you watch the corner,

692
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,907
- I'll follow him.
- Yes sir.

693
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,108
Should I tell Inspector Lo about it.

694
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,477
Do you want to shoe shine again.

695
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,119
You're right.

696
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,397
Did you bet on horses?

697
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,996
I've finished dinner.

698
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,032
What's a answer.

699
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,427
Quick...

700
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,927
Do you have your dinner?

701
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,392
Where did you go last night.

702
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:38,901
Don't bow out, go, charge.

703
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:43,770
Not this one,

704
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,203
quick...

705
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,106
Judge.

706
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,443
Who is it?

707
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,850
Me, boss, don't shoot.

708
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,222
What are you doing here?

709
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,683
To look for you guys.

710
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,258
Come up first.

711
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,395
You scared me.

712
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,162
Thanks.

713
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,266
- I almost killed you.
- Never mind.

714
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,767
Bull, why did you shoot.

715
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,502
I pulled the trigger by mistake.

716
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,614
You saw all the cops
at the racing stadium.

717
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,250
You're very well informed.

718
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,815
What news?

719
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,422
They're going to deal with you.

720
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,786
I deliberately come here
to inform the two bosses.

721
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,688
I'm not afraid even
if an army came up!

722
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,023
- Afraid of them.
- Of course.

723
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,264
Wait for me outside.

724
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,605
Bull, even the kid knew about it.

725
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,402
Don't think about it,
we'll take it as it comes.

726
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,902
No, We can't stay here any longer.

727
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,979
We'd better leave.

728
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,045
With so many guns,
we can go anywhere.

729
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:09,518
Go away, they have machine guns.

730
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,362
Follow me.

731
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,220
What are you doing here?

732
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,629
Judge, get me a car.

733
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,098
What car, can't we take the taxi.

734
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,941
It's coming, what can we do now,
the D. Sergeant not here.

735
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,502
Just wait.

736
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,237
Let's go.

737
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,473
- Run.
- Actually I...

738
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,379
Stop mumbling.

739
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,989
Excuse me.

740
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,058
Step aside.

741
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,234
So you appeared finally.

742
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,770
You're the judge,
my nickname is Dummy.

743
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,103
How dare you.

744
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,175
How's that going?

745
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:39,880
They've got so many people.

746
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:45,813
My mother.

747
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,156
Mother...

748
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,407
Run.

749
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:15,847
Help, Boy.

750
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,349
I'm the judge, come out.

751
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:26,954
Mother.

752
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,197
Mother.

753
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,967
Come out.

754
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,464
It's enough, let's go.

755
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,940
Don't go out, he has machine guns.

756
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,977
Don't fool around.

757
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,942
Give me that.

758
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,852
Stop, listen to me...

759
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,349
I've got nothing to do with that.

760
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,955
How can you bargain with the cop
when holding a gun.

761
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,483
Now you're involved.

762
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,523
How many shots did you fire?

763
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,290
I can find, that out later anyway.

764
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,500
Where did you get the gun from.

765
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,041
After stealing a car,
robbed and killed,

766
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,537
now you're involved in the massacre.

767
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,373
What else would you be doing?

768
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,646
I don't know,

769
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,643
I've only stole a car.

770
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,645
Sir, I want to tell you something.

771
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,320
I want to tell you something too.

772
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,021
Wait for me in my office.

773
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,190
Yes, Sir.

774
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,322
- Chiu.
- Yes.

775
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,961
Take him down to the cell,
I'll charge him myself.

776
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,100
Yes, Sir.

777
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,302
Do you think you're Rambo.

778
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,736
You didn't tell me with something
so important happening.

779
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,208
Do you want to frame me.

780
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,738
If I knew they have
that much ammunition,

781
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,345
I will inform you.

782
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,206
Alright, what's your relationship
with that kid?

783
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,050
How dare you let him out
to kill people.

784
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,477
I don't know how you're promoted
to D. Sergeant.

785
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:34,051
I'm promoted for my ten years
of service.

786
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,188
We're in
the criminal investigation department.

787
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,756
I know the kid didn't kill anyone,

788
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,827
so I took him out to help
in the investigation. Sir.

789
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,523
What are you yelling for?

790
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,224
I was afraid that you can't hear me.

791
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,526
You.

792
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,702
You're not on this case anymore.

793
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,634
From now on, you will stay
at the station, get out.

794
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,339
Thanks for your recommendation, sir.

795
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,011
D. Sergeant.

796
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,788
What did Inspector Lo say?

797
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,353
He took away my case.

798
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:07,421
What.

799
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,082
I was the one who caught the guy.

800
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,194
Now he will be accused of murder.

801
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,588
I know he is innocent.

802
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,760
You can't fight with the P.I.

803
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,263
I wouldn't care.

804
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,399
I don't feel ashamed for that.

805
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,904
I have no regrets.

806
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,935
What the hell. I won't die.

807
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,768
- Don't follow me.
- Yes sir.
