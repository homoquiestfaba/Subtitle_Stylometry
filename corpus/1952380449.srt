1
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,915
Hello?

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,838
I have a collect call
from Wayne Felde...

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,270
...a death-row inmate at
the correctional facility.

4
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,517
- Will you accept the charges?
- Hold on.

5
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,756
Why am I in your bed?

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,391
Go back to sleep. Go back to sleep.

7
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,593
Will you accept the charges?

8
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,314
- Hold on, just a second.
- Ma'am?

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,554
Ma'am, will you accept
the charges?

10
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,074
- Ma'am?
- Yes, I'll accept the charges.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,235
Go ahead.

12
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,714
- You didn't wanna talk to me.
- No, it's not that.

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,315
I didn't get much sleep.

14
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,829
Yeah. I didn't get me much either.

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,670
Just had me a fine meal
of fried chicken and gravy.

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,910
That's what everybody wants
for their last meal.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,074
Don't be sad, girl.

18
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,631
I'm getting what I want.

19
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,989
It's what I deserve.

20
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,236
I am glad
I had the chance to know you, Wayne.

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,918
Time's up.

22
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,393
Well...

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,638
...I better go now.

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,229
I got some place I gotta be.

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,317
You tak e care, darling.

26
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,238
- Graves Thomas.
- Good morning, Prissy.

27
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,112
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what?

28
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,788
Let me give my home number
to Wayne Felde.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,468
- He called you?
- Yep.

30
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,751
- Are you all right?
- Yep.

31
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,713
Well, he was guilty anyway, darling.

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,036
He even admitted it himself.

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,715
And you was the only one
kept trying to help him.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,512
Obviously didn't help him enough.

35
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,280
You don't know that.

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,552
What's this?

37
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,672
- Why is this case back on my desk?
- Do you know Calvin Willis?

38
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,518
I thought you said
he was a lost cause.

39
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,233
Was a lost cause.

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,035
Now, I got the detective coming in that
worked on the case for a little chat.

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,913
Well, I'm officially resigning
as a babysitter to the doomed.

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,999
Thing about old Calvin here, though,
he might actually be innocent.

43
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,515
- Right.
- No, I'm telling you, darling.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,837
You don't need a law degree or cane
pole to smell something fishy here.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,190
You remember
that detective I mentioned?

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,517
She was a metre maid about
the time the city council decided...

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,115
...that the old boys needed
more women on the force.

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,313
So they call in Miss Loretta Brooks,
give her a badge, give her a gun...

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,954
...and tell her to go to work
on this child-rape case...

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,351
...involving an 11 -year-old girl.

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,959
Her first case.

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,276
Right out of the chute,
no experience whatsoever.

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,233
Hey, I don't know how innocent he is,
but that man ain't guilty.

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,113
I don't wanna work on a rape case.
This one's with a child.

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,878
And a man that's wrongly accused...

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,435
...given a life sentence,
without a chance for parole.

57
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,870
Well, if he's innocent,
you'll get him out.

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,230
You do know
there are other paralegals in town...

59
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,953
...don't you, Miss Prissy?

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,038
None as smart and as cheap,
Mr. Graves.

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,758
Well, that's true.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,718
Here's daddy.

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,036
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

64
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,468
Give me some sugar.

65
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,669
Hey, darling.

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,359
Hey, baby.

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,959
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you.

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,479
Thanks for coming.

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,795
Hey, baby.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,479
Baby.

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,108
I missed you so much.

72
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,269
I want that candy.

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,994
No, no, no. Share.
You got to share, now.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,111
Why Papa didn't come?

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,273
He wasn't feeling up to it today.

76
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,952
He said I should give you a kiss
for him.

77
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,074
Just losing strength, Calvin.

78
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,713
Just losing strength.

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,793
Willis.

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,388
Move away from her.

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,033
That's my wife, man.

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,950
I don't care if it's your dying mama.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,310
You keep your distance,
or the visit is over.

84
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,637
You can't tell me
I can't touch my own husband.

85
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,115
Visit's over.
Escort these folks out of here.

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,309
Come on, man.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,750
What are you talking about?
I just got here.

88
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,155
I just got here.
What are you talking about?

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,712
You don't have the right to keep me
from seeing my own husband.

90
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,270
- Michelle.
- Get off of me.

91
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,630
It's all right, baby. They in a rush.

92
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,038
Hi, this us. Leave a message.

93
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,117
Prissy, please pick up. It's Margie.

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,151
Something happened
down at the lak e today.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,157
Graves and I were on the boat.

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,352
I can't believe
y'all took the boat out anyway.

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,358
I thought Graves was like a cat,
didn't wanna get his hair wet.

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,472
He's dead. He's dead, Prissy.

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,399
Lightning, and he got struck down.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,831
And he's dead.

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,235
Is this for real?

102
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,754
Yes.

103
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,110
- The storm. The storm...
- Oh, my God.

104
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,278
...and lightning struck him.

105
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,831
- Mama?
- Oh, that's awful.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,713
I don't know what to do.

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,873
I don't know.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,113
Hey, Prissy.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,753
Hey, Reynolds.

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,111
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about Graves Thomas.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
I don't know how many times
I heard the man say:

112
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,070
"If I am lying,
may I be struck by lightning...

113
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,429
...by the Lord Almighty."

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,431
Must have been one big-ass lie
he told on that boat.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,478
Well, he sure thought the world
of you.

116
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,515
Always boasted you could out-brief
any attorney in town.

117
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,074
You know, Prissy...

118
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,953
...I could use a top-shelf paralegal
in my office.

119
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,594
The job's yours if you want it.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,230
I might have to take you up on that.

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,438
You're?

122
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,873
You wanna come in with me?

123
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,516
No, this is as close as I wanna get
to another coffin.

124
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,671
When you get ready to go back
to work, you come by my office.

125
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,677
Thank you.
I might need a day or so.

126
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,995
Okay.

127
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,433
Look.

128
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,511
Hey, who are you?

129
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,592
What you doing here?

130
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,994
- Well...
- Keisha.

131
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,919
Child, haven't I told you
a thousand times...

132
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,510
...any talking to strangers need doing,
you come get Granny?

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,190
Are you Calvin Willis' grandmother?

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,994
Whatever you have to say
about my Calvin...

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,475
...I hope you don't say it
in front of his children.

136
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,319
I'm Prissy Gregory.
I'm from Graves Thomas' office.

137
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,954
Oh, you Mr. Thomas' girl.

138
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,798
He told us all about you.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,434
Told us about
how you was playing with a gun...

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,596
...and shot yourself in the leg.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,792
Boy, that story made
a great impression on my grand.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,956
Now, y'all run on over there
to play now.

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,878
Your mama be on directly.

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,517
Come on in.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,555
I can't say as I understand
why God take him that way.

146
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,115
Lord know more than me.

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,914
- Afternoon, Mama.
- Michelle.

148
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,554
- How you feeling, Papa?
- I'm okay.

149
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,318
This here is Prissy Gregory.

150
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,909
- She works with Mr. Thomas.
- Hi. Hi.

151
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,829
Michelle is Calvin's wife.
She's just like my own daughter.

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,319
Prissy just told us
that Mr. Thomas passed last week.

153
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,677
I brought Calvin's case file.

154
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,875
I know Mr. Thomas was only on this
a few months...

155
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,674
...but he'd gone through
your retainer.

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,908
Unfortunately, I don't know of a lawyer
who would do the case pro bono.

157
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,031
I'll take care of it.

158
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,149
Child, please,
how you gonna take care of it?

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,079
All right, now, Mama, you
got enough on your plate already.

160
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,276
Thank you for coming.

161
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,471
Hey. You shouldn't have come here.

162
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,113
You should've called me.

163
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,595
I thought it was Mr. And Ms. Newton
who hired Graves.

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,677
They was. They gave him
every cent they had.

165
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,677
Now all they got
is heartache and worries.

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,359
That woman in there raised Calvin.

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,437
More of a mother
than the one that left him.

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,870
His granddad,
you see him eaten away with cancer.

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,313
And you come here carrying this
burden they can't do nothing about?

170
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,509
Shame on you.

171
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,311
I was just doing my job,
and I didn't know.

172
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,714
No, I don't suppose you did.

173
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,434
Don't suppose you got any idea
what it's like...

174
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,189
...to have the one you love most
taken from you for no reason at all.

175
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,870
Keisha, Booji, come on,
it's time to go home.

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,717
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

177
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,831
I'm sorry.
Why don't you give me the file back?

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,759
And I'll do what I can
to get you a good lawyer.

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,634
Fine. I won't hold my breath.

180
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,068
No, don't.

181
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,316
If I do find you one,
you need to be ready...

182
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,115
...to go through everything
about this case all over again.

183
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,349
Would you tell your boss...

184
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,074
...Graves Thomas
left him a little something in his will?

185
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,991
No, but if I tell him
it's a pro-bono case...

186
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,077
...he won't call me back, will he?

187
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,799
Okay.

188
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,558
- Hello?
- I'm here to see Graves Thomas.

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,830
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I'd cancelled all...

190
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,076
No, I told him not to write it down.

191
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,998
Look, if he's not here,
it's fine by me.

192
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,077
No, wait a minute. Who are you?

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,113
- Loretta Brooks.
- The detective on the Willis case?

194
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,199
You know, I am so tired of having to
defend that damn police photo line-up.

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,630
Just because I didn't know
to keep a record...

196
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,400
...of how it was assembled,
doesn't mean it wasn't legit.

197
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,956
It's not like I put pictures of white guys
in there. They were all black.

198
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,878
That girl pointed at Willis, all right?

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,438
I don't know
what you're talking about.

200
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,551
Graves won't be working
on the Willis case.

201
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,558
Then what the hell am I doing here?

202
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,397
Hi. Are you Jo Anne Johnson?

203
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,672
Reggie send you down here?
Lady, I ain't got his money.

204
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,235
No, no, no,
I'm not here about money.

205
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,795
I wanted to ask you
about your daughter Lucretia.

206
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,598
What business you got
asking about her?

207
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,519
- Can I come in?
- No, Lucretia don't live here no more.

208
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,110
- She lives with your sister in Ohio?
- How you know that? You police?

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,551
No, I'm a paralegal.
And I'm just helping out on the case.

210
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,478
I've been reading
the trial transcripts.

211
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,511
There are things
that I don't understand.

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,554
Like how come you identified
Calvin Willis...

213
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,398
...as your daughter's attacker...

214
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,670
...when you weren't actually home
that night?

215
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,598
- I ain't got time for this.
- No, please.

216
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,395
I just need to know, why did
you give the detective Calvin's name...

217
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,158
...before she started investigating?

218
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,874
Because Chante saw his car
parked outside my house.

219
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,548
Right, but did Lucretia
know Calvin too?

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,950
She picked his picture
out of a photo line-up.

221
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,958
But she couldn't identify him
in court, right?

222
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,110
Now, I understand that Lucretia
was a special-education child.

223
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,118
And that means
that she couldn't qualify as a witness...

224
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,709
...to give testimony in court.

225
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,876
When your baby girl look at you...

226
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,152
...her face swollen up, bleeding,
half her teeth gone...

227
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,715
...and point to a man...

228
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,311
...you believe her.

229
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,799
Hey. Listen,
I still haven't found you a lawyer yet.

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,116
I had hoped
that I could help you myself.

231
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,392
But this case, it's just like...
It's riddled with holes.

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,352
It's just that...

233
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,438
I'm just really not the right person.

234
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,559
What happened?

235
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,035
Papa died.

236
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,679
Calvin.

237
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,276
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Hi, Booji.

238
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,792
- Mama.
- Baby.

239
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,193
This is Miss Prissy.

240
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,789
She made it
so you could be here today.

241
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,992
Hey.

242
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,231
What you go and do that for?

243
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,314
Calvin.

244
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,112
Who are you to me or my papa?

245
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,115
This ain't the day
for you to forget your manners.

246
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,469
You thank this woman.

247
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,989
It's okay, it's okay. I did it for you.

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,668
And you've thanked me plenty.

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,556
I'm gonna leave you all
to your family and friends.

250
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,835
Okay?

251
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,879
Goodbye.

252
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,912
Look here, boy.

253
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,918
I will not allow your papa's body
to be laid to rest...

254
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,749
...till you show some respect
to Miss Prissy.

255
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,592
We'll be waiting right here on you.

256
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,469
Mama, you know Calvin.

257
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,353
Hey. Miss Prissy, hold up, now.

258
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,872
I'm...

259
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,592
I'm sorry for disrespecting you.

260
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,271
Mama said you used to be
Mr. Graves' secretary or something.

261
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,991
You helping out on my case now?

262
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,394
Maybe.

263
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,473
If I can convince a lawyer
that you're innocent.

264
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,313
What you mean, "if"?

265
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,149
Woman, I don't need your charity.

266
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,839
Why don't you take your white ass
back to where you came from?

267
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,631
I will.

268
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,589
Shut up.

269
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,113
What are you...?

270
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,794
What's this for?

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,149
"Sorry"?

272
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,510
You been acting mad at me
since Papa's funeral.

273
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,233
I ain't mad at you.

274
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,873
You need to talk to your mama.

275
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,550
Yeah, she mad at you because you
weren't nice to that white lady she like.

276
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,988
Your ears is way too big.

277
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,237
What I got to be nice to her for?
She the one acting high and mighty.

278
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,634
Ain't even a real lawyer.

279
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,229
Like you got lawyers
waiting in line to help you.

280
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,671
Granny said Miss Prissy
know the law real good.

281
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,995
That's right, she smart?

282
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,760
She got you out of here
for Papa's funeral, didn't she?

283
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,559
Send that card to her, then.

284
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,354
Tell her I had no call
treating her like that.

285
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,996
Tell her how
I ain't got no sense sometime.

286
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,472
Ryan?

287
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,234
What kind of soup you want
with your sandwich?

288
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,751
Tomato or chicken noodle?

289
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,199
Earth to Ryan.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,958
You in a chicken noodle
kind of mood?

291
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,470
Mama, what does rape mean?

292
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,077
Does it mean all beat up?

293
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,193
I told you never to open
Mama's files.

294
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,712
I didn't. I found it on the ground.
I was trying to put it back.

295
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,989
What else did you see?

296
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,519
Nothing.

297
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,630
Is this the man that hurt that girl?

298
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,390
Mr. Graves was sure he didn't.

299
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,318
He got put in jail for it?

300
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,398
Why, if he didn't do it?

301
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,034
So you yourself tested
the boxer shorts found at the scene?

302
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,878
The boxer shorts
encrusted with semen.

303
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,593
- The size 44 boxer shorts.
- Yes.

304
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,711
Yes, I performed the test myself.

305
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,595
And did you know that Calvin Willis
at the time had a size 36-inch waist?

306
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,109
I believe they told me.
How'd you get downstairs here?

307
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,038
Told them I was hungry.
So you did know.

308
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,356
How could you testify
for the district attorney...

309
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,232
...that Willis was the guilty party?

310
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,034
Because the semen on the shorts
came from a type O secretor.

311
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,676
Calvin Willis is a type O secretor.

312
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,755
Silly me. Thanks.

313
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,079
What percentage of the black
population are type O secretors?

314
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,918
Basically 40 percent. Excuse me.

315
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,350
Well, that's a lot of black men.

316
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,189
Let me get this straight.

317
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,119
Forty percent of all black men
are type O secretors.

318
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,676
So you decided that Calvin Willis was
the only one who could've left semen...

319
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,077
...on a pair of boxers
that were 8 inches too big for him?

320
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,838
I don't know how you sleep at night.

321
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,075
You know, if I recall...

322
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,510
...there were witnesses
who placed him at the scene.

323
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,632
There was a witness.
She saw his car.

324
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,751
You know, I don't remember.
Go ask her.

325
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,518
- Go ask her.
- I will.

326
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,434
How could you be so sure...

327
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,838
...the car you saw the night Lucretia
was raped was Calvin's car?

328
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,636
You never did see a man
so vain about his car as Calvin Willis.

329
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,435
Always riding around
like he better than everybody else.

330
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,074
Hey, Calvin.
Check out Luther over there.

331
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,474
He the man.

332
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,669
Yo, Luther.

333
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,434
Luther.

334
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,873
Luther.

335
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,115
Yeah.

336
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,470
You getting desperate
in your old age, man.

337
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,753
What you talking about, fool?

338
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,352
Running with a ho like Chante.

339
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,152
Look out.

340
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,438
Who you calling a ho?

341
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,713
You the biggest ho around here.

342
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,832
I can't even believe you fixed
your mouth to call me no ho.

343
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,359
You need... Get on out of here!

344
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,119
Get the hell off my property,
okay, creep!

345
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,436
Put me down, worthless!
Just standing there.

346
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,232
How you gonna let him
call me a ho?

347
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,595
You know what?
You can kiss my ass!

348
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,711
You sorry sucker!

349
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,672
Just gonna talk to me?

350
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,553
Hell, I'd have thrown
a rock at him too.

351
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,513
Fact is,
I wouldn't blame you if you set him up.

352
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,518
Told the police
you saw Calvin's car...

353
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,712
...at a time his wife swore
he was at home with her.

354
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,672
That skinny-ass wife of his...

355
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,599
...been putting up
with his tomcatting for years.

356
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,156
Wasn't no surprise to me
she made up that story.

357
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,352
Too bad for her it didn't work.

358
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,714
Calvin say they about to move him
down south to some max prison.

359
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,593
Say it like it ain't no big thing.

360
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,314
That's an 8-hour drive from here.

361
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,192
Michelle,
I need to ask you something.

362
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,908
Did you make up that alibi
for Calvin?

363
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,954
I'm not asking
if you think he did it or not.

364
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,233
I'm asking if you lied about him
being home by midnight.

365
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,277
Or maybe it's not even a case
of lying.

366
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,517
Just pretending you were sure
when you weren't.

367
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,154
I was not happy
with Calvin going out that night.

368
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,158
Calvin was always going out.

369
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,237
So I told him...

370
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,514
...you not home by 12:00,
I'm gonna lock your ass out.

371
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,471
So I was sitting...

372
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,429
...looking at that clock.

373
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Calvin being Calvin...

374
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,711
...he got back here.

375
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,992
But not even five minutes to spare.

376
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,396
Judge Pifer,
I wanted to talk to you...

377
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,398
...about a client of Graves,
Calvin Willis.

378
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,999
Can't say that name rings a bell.

379
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,034
It was about five years ago,
1981, child rape.

380
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,036
The original defence attorney thought
that the evidence was so flimsy...

381
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,834
...he waived the right to a jury trial,
asked you to rule.

382
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,076
That's way too much water
under the bridge.

383
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,872
Let me get that for you.

384
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,914
Do you remember that you
allowed an evidence testimony...

385
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,396
...of a photo line-up
there was no real record of?

386
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,192
Or that the defendant had an alibi...

387
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,994
...or that the victim
couldn't identify him in court?

388
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,031
You're wasting my time.

389
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,716
Your Honour, I...

390
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,995
I know and understand
how this system works.

391
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,352
I know how an inexperienced detective
could botch an investigation.

392
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,519
I know how the DA has to prosecute
cases on low evidence...

393
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,995
...because basically
he's working an assembly line.

394
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,990
But what I don't know is what was it
that let you go along with it.

395
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,918
I am not God.

396
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,157
I don't pretend to be.
I do my job as I see fit.

397
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,239
You don't like the results,
you go complain to the appellate court.

398
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,476
Because I don't give a damn.

399
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,113
Excuse me.

400
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,955
There's a child rapist on the loose.

401
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,311
And this innocent man, Calvin Willis,
is doing life imprisonment.

402
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,512
Hey, don't let me persuade you
to give a damn.

403
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,192
Hope I didn't make you late
for your golf.

404
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,710
This is a post-conviction application.
I need your signature.

405
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,797
And I'll find a warm body
with a law degree.

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,911
He can sign it and I'll file it.

407
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,112
Why you doing this
if you don't like me?

408
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,949
- What I don't like is your attitude.
- I'm supposed to act different?

409
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,116
I'd be surprised
if you didn't behave badly.

410
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,276
It doesn't mean I have to like it.

411
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,595
I just wanna know why you doing it.

412
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,791
Because this case
reeks of injustice.

413
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,511
Maybe it's because I wanna show
my son that the truth matters.

414
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,797
My grandmother says you came
into our lives because of God's will.

415
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,073
Now, are you gonna disappoint
a faith like that?

416
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,596
I'll work on my attitude.

417
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,473
Thank you.

418
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,238
You're welcome.

419
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,675
I think.

420
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,192
Hey, look, you just handle it,
all right?

421
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,229
That's more like it. All right.

422
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,318
Looky, looky.

423
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,909
If it ain't the new brother.

424
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,229
You ain't too much for socializing,
is you?

425
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,513
You brain-dead or something, man?
That's why you don't talk?

426
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,472
I need to make my call.

427
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,477
It speaks.

428
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,876
So, what crime put you in here?

429
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,351
Brother, you writing a book?

430
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,519
Better watch
who you're getting big with, brother.

431
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,435
We'll rap later.

432
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,598
- Let him know who run things, Matthew.
- Yeah, Big M.

433
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,518
Move, guys. Back.

434
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,029
You know how to get off your head?

435
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,913
So, what's your next move?
You still filing that writ?

436
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,997
Yeah, just need to get it signed.

437
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,599
Got it right here in front of me.

438
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,950
It's a pretty little thing,
if I do say so myself.

439
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,229
Sounds good.

440
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,433
Hey, how you get him
to replace my ID that got stolen?

441
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,709
You talk ed to the warden?

442
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,399
No, not him. His right-hand man.

443
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,596
What'd you do?
Make promises you can't keep?

444
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,310
None of your damn business
what promises I make.

445
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,158
And how do you know
I can't keep them?

446
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,715
I ain't laughed in a long time.

447
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,518
It feels good.

448
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,631
Calvin Willis?

449
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,548
I told you I don't want you
working on this on my time.

450
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,557
Don't snap.
I worked on that writ at home.

451
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,193
All I want is your signature.

452
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,671
- I signed a post-conviction application.
- It was denied.

453
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,269
Your list of reversible errors was
compelling. On what grounds?

454
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,357
Judge denied it per curiam.

455
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,915
Because-l-said-so response, huh?

456
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,951
My favourite.

457
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,519
- You've put a lot of work in on this.
- Are you gonna sign it?

458
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,439
Or do I take the afternoon off
and harass some other attorney?

459
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,473
I'll sign it, you tell me
why you're devoting yourself to this...

460
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,874
...like a nun to the Church?

461
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,514
You're a defence attorney.
I don't know how you can ask.

462
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,994
You got a thing for this guy?

463
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,270
No, why?
You upset I don't have one for you?

464
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,108
I was just kidding.

465
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,789
Thank you.
That's a lovely wedding ring.

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,433
Was it expensive?

467
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,593
You know, Graves never told me
you were such a pain in the ass.

468
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,712
That's because Graves
was a true Southern gentleman.

469
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,270
Put some shoes on.

470
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,598
This is Louisiana State Prison
operator.

471
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,631
I have a collect call
from a Calvin Willis.

472
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,752
- Do you accept the charges?
- Yes, I'll accept.

473
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,635
- How's my baby doing?
- I don't know.

474
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,831
Tired, I guess.

475
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,239
I worked long hours this week.

476
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,517
Ain't nobody remember nothing.

477
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,914
So how's my kids doing?

478
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,997
They okay.

479
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,269
Act up sometimes.

480
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,517
You tell them their father said
they best mind their mama.

481
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,028
I been thinking about you
so much, baby.

482
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,274
Been thinking about them nights
after we put Keisha to bed.

483
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,878
We'd go into the living room.

484
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,312
I got turned down
for a house loan today.

485
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,435
A house loan?
What you doing trying to get a house?

486
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,995
We can't stay here no more, Calvin.

487
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,155
Everything's broke.

488
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,033
Just getting the kids
from the house to the car scares me.

489
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,357
We can't own no house.
Who you know own a house?

490
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,073
- I work.
- Name somebody you know...

491
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,191
...own their own house.
- I got good credit.

492
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,553
But today the bank said
they can't give that kind of money...

493
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,797
...to a woman
who has a husband in prison.

494
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,798
Because the husband is entitled
to half ownership.

495
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,718
And you...

496
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,189
Convicts is considered high risk.

497
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,718
Convict?

498
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,675
- That's how they see me?
- That is how everybody see you.

499
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,348
But you know what's true.
I don't see why you gotta yell.

500
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,516
This the first time I yelled at you.

501
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,154
Most wives get a chance
to yell at their husband.

502
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,794
I don't even get that.

503
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,277
I can't do this. I can't.

504
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,914
I can't do this no more.

505
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,795
I can't do this no more, Calvin.

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,718
I just can't.

507
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,989
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,553
Michelle.

509
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,793
Michelle.

510
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,795
That's enough.

511
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,638
Move it, all of you.

512
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,794
I think she trying to make herself
fall out of love with me.

513
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,598
I know she thinking about
every bad word I done called her.

514
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,791
Every time
I got with another woman.

515
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,751
Be better off for her if I was dead
and she'd just grieve and move on.

516
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,757
You're wrong.
I've buried two husbands.

517
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,316
You don't just get to move on.
Their ghosts follow you around.

518
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,431
She gonna leave me
to sit up in here alone...

519
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,198
...so she can buy a damn house.

520
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,995
Think you're the only one who got
a life sentence out of this relationship?

521
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,155
No, you're right.

522
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,759
Why would she want
a decent house?

523
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,633
Why can't she just spend
the rest of her life in that dump...

524
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,432
...she and your children are in?

525
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,631
You saying
I ain't got no right to be hurt?

526
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,512
Oh, of course you've got the right.

527
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,637
Now go on.
Moan and bitch all you want.

528
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,673
And I'll keep my smart-ass comments
to myself.

529
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,237
Go on, you must got more
to complain about.

530
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,317
Maybe I don't want to no more.

531
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,119
I see a man ain't got no business
coming to you for sympathy.

532
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,788
Nothing but a heart of stone.

533
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,432
Jeez.

534
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,432
If you're good, I'd like to talk business
before my eight-hour trip home.

535
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,029
Take a gander at this brief
that's headed to the state.

536
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,198
Last time you were bitching
and moaning about some little detail...

537
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,789
...that you wanted me to rewrite
the whole thing over...

538
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,274
...so I went home, did that.

539
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,790
Hey, shut your mouth, man.
I'm trying to sleep.

540
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,314
Yeah, wait till I see
you in the yard, boy.

541
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,112
- I'll knock you out.
- You got nothing.

542
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,192
Mama, go to bed.

543
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,118
It's late.

544
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,159
I'm just gonna...

545
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,551
Our house don't make no noise.

546
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,273
It's just silence.

547
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,074
The word says to let your light
shine within me...

548
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,317
...that they may see your good deeds
and praise your Father in heaven.

549
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,238
You gotta let your light shine.

550
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,112
Whereas nobody will know
who you are...

551
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,470
...and nobody will know
who you represent.

552
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,513
Our Lord Jesus says,
"I am the light of the world.

553
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,950
Whoever follows me
will never want to die...

554
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,151
...but will have the light of life."

555
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,749
Listen here.

556
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,075
What you doing?

557
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,874
Are you sad?

558
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,356
May I please spend the night
at Trevor's?

559
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,869
No. You're grounded.

560
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,559
Well, how about I file an appeal?

561
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,352
File your appeal.

562
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,549
I won't curse again...

563
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,558
...and I'll do an extra hour of yard work
next Saturday.

564
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,715
Make it two.

565
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,194
- Fine.
- Fine.

566
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,834
Appeal granted. Go to Trevor's.

567
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,560
Can you ask his mom
if you can stay tomorrow night as well?

568
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,830
I've gotta drive down to the prison.

569
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,999
I have a baseball game tomorrow.

570
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,191
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to
miss this one.

571
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,595
It's not like you don't have
18 more coming up.

572
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,189
Not 18, three,
and the season's over.

573
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,595
Well, you're gonna have to
fire me as your mom.

574
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,518
Sounds good to me.

575
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,310
- I'm going to your game, all right?
- I don't care.

576
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,239
Well, I don't care if you care.
I'm going.

577
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,439
So, what you're saying is
federal court denied me again?

578
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,914
Oh, Calvin, I'm sorry.

579
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,678
It's been denied per curiam.

580
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,509
You know, I hear myself thinking...

581
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,668
...that I can't take
one more day in here.

582
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,516
Then I realise it's a whole year later
than what I thought it was.

583
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,235
You know Michelle
filed for div orce?

584
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,514
Oh, Calvin, I'm...

585
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,438
I gave it to her.

586
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,399
When I ask you to file a request
for initial police reports...

587
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,637
...I did not say,
"Oh, and add Calvin Willis to the list."

588
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,831
Is this the police report
for Lucretia's rape?

589
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,439
You know, you're not hearing me.

590
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,313
I'm tired of stumbling over
Calvin Willis every time I turn.

591
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,238
So no more phone calls
to that prison...

592
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,069
...and no more using this office
to further your little obsession.

593
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,077
Understood?

594
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,275
You can go in now.
He's back from lunch.

595
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,915
Come on in. Have a seat.

596
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,359
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

597
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,869
Just running a little behind
here today.

598
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,396
You remember Lucretia
told the police...

599
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,558
...the man who raped her
was wearing a cowboy hat?

600
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,513
But Calvin told them at his trial,
he don't wear no cowboy hat.

601
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,119
He had had a haircut.

602
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,438
And he wasn't gonna cover up
that $65 haircut. No, no, no.

603
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,358
It says here one of Lucretia's
girlfriends said that a big guy, Harry...

604
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,996
...wearing a cowboy hat showed up
at Lucretia's house earlier that day.

605
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,952
Harry?

606
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,196
They didn't mention no Harry
at Calvin's trial.

607
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,992
I didn't hear nothing about no Harry.

608
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,351
Well, because Calvin's defence
never even knew about this.

609
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,189
Before this new law passed...

610
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,119
...the defence never even got to see
the initial police report.

611
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,034
But now we have this. This is proof that
the district attorney, Heinz Harris...

612
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,639
...withheld exculpatory evidence.

613
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,116
That's evidence
favourable to the defendant.

614
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,551
Which means we can ask
for a certificate of probable cause.

615
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,875
Probable cause, is that good?

616
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,278
We can appeal again.

617
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,314
Can I get a "hell, yeah"?

618
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,956
We'll be back!

619
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,749
Here's to the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals.

620
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,029
Okay.

621
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,838
Randy?

622
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,678
- Randy Arthur?
- Prissy Gregory.

623
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,713
Look at you. I haven't seen you
since you were in high school.

624
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,717
- Was that you?
- That was me, that was me.

625
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,115
You still got that
cute green cheerleader outfit?

626
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,756
What? You were not a cheerleader.

627
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,714
- Oh, yeah, she was a cheerleader.
- You are so dead.

628
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,793
So you still dating that guy
with the long blond hair?

629
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,070
What's his name? Svein?

630
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,750
His name wasn't Svein. It was Chris.

631
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,838
No, I'm not seeing him.
I haven't seen anyone in a long time.

632
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,995
How about you?

633
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,078
Me? I just got out of
a very intense relationship.

634
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,235
Anyone I know?

635
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,670
Sure, most people know her
as Southern Comfort...

636
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,519
...but I just call her Life-Ruining Bitch.

637
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,714
Sorry, I guess I'm in a bitter stage
of that breakup.

638
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,989
I guess this is the last sip
I'm having of this, then.

639
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,277
You know, that just makes me
wanna ask you out right now.

640
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,514
But I guess I'd better not.
I'm on a liver-transplant list.

641
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,995
You always were funny.

642
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,474
You don't look yellow.

643
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,158
Are you serious?

644
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,672
Oh, shoot. You don't know how much
that tempts a girl like me.

645
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,395
I have a special talent for tangling up
with men on the verge of dying.

646
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,593
I have no plans to die, girl.

647
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,839
- I got too many things I wanna do.
- Like?

648
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,510
Well, like write a hit album.
Maybe two.

649
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,590
Jumping out of an airplane.

650
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,436
Having sex in that airplane,
maybe with a cheerleader.

651
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,719
No, I wouldn't mind at all.

652
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,759
- I'll see you in court on Thursday.
- That sounds good.

653
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,393
All right.

654
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,556
You think I'm lick ed.
Well, I'm not lick ed.

655
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,150
And I'm gonna stay right here
and fight for this lost cause...

656
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,397
...even if this room gets filled
with lies lik e these.

657
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,434
Okay, Tina will be here by 5.

658
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,753
Come on, stand up. Give me a hug.

659
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,995
Hey.

660
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,111
Well, what, you don't wanna give
your mama a hug goodbye?

661
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,715
Just so you know,
this is my last trip down to the prison.

662
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,638
The only reason I'm driving there is...

663
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,434
...I need to tell Calvin
face-to-face that I'm quitting.

664
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,390
Because I can't do this anymore.
I can't.

665
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,156
Then you better hit the road.

666
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,671
We ain't got all day.
Get your shirt off.

667
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,113
Hey, bossman, you got any kids?
Like little girls?

668
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,308
Face front. Matthews, shut up.

669
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,112
Hey, I'm just asking, man...

670
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,392
...because I hear your boy Calvin here
likes them real young.

671
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,989
- That's a damn lie.
- Shut up.

672
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,549
Thank you.

673
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,715
I love you.

674
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,469
Don't spend all that money
on that candy machine.

675
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,909
Watch him, you hear?
And don't say nothing.

676
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,634
I appreciate
you taking my kids with you.

677
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,558
You're welcome.

678
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,232
I'd also appreciate it...

679
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,399
...if you didn't say anything to Calvin
about me being married right now.

680
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,277
Don't you think your kids will tell him?

681
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,471
They promised they wouldn't.

682
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,711
- Damn, they're big.
- Your face'll break out.

683
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,708
I want you to get either the Nabs
or get some peanuts. Now which one?

684
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,309
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna sit on their heads...

685
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,397
...make them stop growing.

686
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,588
Calvin.

687
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,476
You know, the certificate
of probable cause was our last hope.

688
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,233
People around here are talking about
this inmate in Michigan...

689
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,432
...who was set free
because of something called DNA.

690
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,108
- You heard of that?
- Yeah, yeah, I heard of it.

691
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,154
And I've also heard that
DNA testing is very expensive.

692
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,352
- You wait forever for the results.
- Don't think it's worth a shot?

693
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,916
We don't even know if the district
attorney has preserved the rape kit...

694
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,439
...or the boxer shorts.

695
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,518
I mean, Calvin,
it's been 11, 12 years.

696
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,998
And even if they did, they might not
agree to release it for testing.

697
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,193
- This is one long shot after another.
- Don't mean it ain't worth trying.

698
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,358
Do you even know
what DNA evidence is?

699
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,278
You understand that it's irrefutable?

700
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,630
- You know what that means?
- What are you saying?

701
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,273
Yes or no?

702
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,237
Well, I...

703
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,557
I can understand it. I understand if you
wanna go that route. It's just that...

704
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,517
It's just that I can't. I can't.

705
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,278
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,000
It's just that I need to
be done with this.

707
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,357
And I need you
to find someone else.

708
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,389
Calvin, my son
is hardly talking to me anymore...

709
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,034
...and my boss
is this close to firing me.

710
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,673
And I'm no use to you...

711
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,429
I'm no use to you
if my life is falling apart.

712
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,916
Please, Calvin, just tell me
that you understand.

713
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,268
Please just let me off the hook.

714
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,511
Wasn't never no hook.

715
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,478
Just me feeling lucky to have someone
willing to look me in the eye...

716
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,076
...willing to tell me what was what.

717
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,354
You best go on now.
Do what you got to do.

718
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,711
Ain't gonna give you no grief, not
after everything you've done for me.

719
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,399
Calvin, why'd you have to
make this so hard on me?

720
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,796
- I'm trying to make it easy.
- Well, you're not, neither of you.

721
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,391
I mean, we don't even know
if the district attorney still has any...

722
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,592
Anything that you can get
any evidence from.

723
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,394
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea...
- No, it's okay.

724
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,431
It's all right, it's all right. I'll...

725
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,073
We just... I'm gonna...

726
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,068
I'll try and find you someone else
who can help you with this DNA idea...

727
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,350
...but I'm not promising anything.

728
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,513
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,715
Thank you.

730
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,395
Yeah.

731
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,431
We are adjourned.

732
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,155
- Good job.
- Thank you.

733
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,874
Mr. Harris. Heinz Harris.

734
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,640
I saw you look at me.
You're gonna make me chase you?

735
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,115
I received your letter.
I haven't made a decision.

736
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,197
I sent that letter two months ago.

737
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,834
How long does it take you
to release a kit for testing?

738
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,873
- I'm not even sure we retained that kit.
- You did, I checked.

739
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,911
Are you a glutton for punishment?

740
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,509
You've tried to appeal this case
how many times now?

741
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,871
You know exactly how many times.
Your office challenged it each time.

742
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,516
- That's because Mr. Willis is guilty.
- So prove it, release the kit.

743
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,359
- Lucretia's mother needs to know this.
- What do you mean?

744
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,676
I mean, if you can get her
to sign a statement...

745
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,350
...saying that I can release the kit,
I'll give it to you.

746
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,391
You have a good day.

747
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,389
I ain't signing it.

748
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,955
I know who raped Lucretia:
Calvin Willis.

749
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,037
It was his car. It was him.

750
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,276
This DNA test
will prove it conclusively.

751
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,119
Calvin Willis?
He drive that funky-ass Lincoln?

752
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,833
That was Adela's grandson, Ray.

753
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,758
- What kind of car he drive?
- Ragtop Caddy.

754
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,757
Chante saw it that night,
clear as day.

755
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,999
I got no use for someone trying to set
him free after what he did to my baby.

756
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,156
Why would I wanna set him free
for no reason?

757
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,591
This test will tell you 100 percent
for sure if he's the one.

758
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,270
- Police told me they got the right one.
- What, you always believe them?

759
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,038
Why you trying to take this away?

760
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,593
You heard the woman. Now go on.

761
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,079
Jo Anne, I have lived for eight years
now with Lucretia's photos.

762
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,998
Poor baby's face swollen,
her teeth...

763
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,191
- That's enough of that.
- Don't you touch me.

764
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,188
I know you wanna be completely sure
you get that monster who did it to her.

765
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,710
Look, lady, you can either walk out
or get tossed out.

766
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,797
It's all good to me.

767
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,430
All right, I'm sorry.

768
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,431
I'm gonna leave it here
and I just want you to think about it.

769
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,717
If for no other reason...

770
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,435
...your baby can know that her mama
put away the right man.

771
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,959
Wait.

772
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,835
That's the problem.

773
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,238
I can't get anyone to quote me
less than $6000 for a DNA test.

774
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,078
I thought you applied to that...

775
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,589
What do you call that?
That Barry Scheck deal.

776
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,392
The Innocence Project.

777
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,955
They get hundreds and hundreds
of applications...

778
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,037
...so the odds are really against us.

779
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,550
And even if they do take the case,
what they do is handle the legal work.

780
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,716
I still have to raise the money
for the test.

781
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,989
So raise the money.

782
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,794
Do I look like someone who can
make money rain from the sky?

783
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,797
I hear you've been working
with God.

784
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,516
No, God is working through me
according to the gospel of Ms. Newton.

785
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,959
Randy, I'm kind of tired.
I don't really...

786
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,593
Come on, I can sing if I want.

787
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,360
No, it's not about your singing.
I love your singing.

788
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,437
I just don't really...

789
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,830
- Baby?
- Oh, come on, baby.

790
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,553
Randy, stop.

791
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,717
I just don't wanna... l...

792
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,875
Randy.

793
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,270
Don't hold me! Don't pin me down!

794
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,918
I'm sorry.

795
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,635
I'm sorry, I just...

796
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,910
I don't like being held down.

797
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,157
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

798
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,270
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

799
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,677
We got any of those
barbecue chips left?

800
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,836
You're getting fouled, man.

801
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,109
- Come on, man.
- Line up. Line up.

802
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,030
Good game, good game.

803
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,231
We'll go again? We gonna go again?

804
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,714
You all right? You all right?

805
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,913
All right, let's go.

806
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,874
Back up. Get off! Get off!
Get off him!

807
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,640
- Break it up.
- Get back. Get on back.

808
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,593
The guards can't protect you
if you don't name names.

809
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,678
The guards know
I'm accused of raping a child.

810
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,914
- They ain't gonna protect me.
- Those guys broke your ribs.

811
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,236
If you don't name names,
they could do it again.

812
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,193
- They will do it again.
- I wish you'd let me talk to somebody.

813
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,800
I've been trying to call
Michelle and the kids.

814
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,270
She won't take my calls no more.

815
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,796
- She got another man?
- I think you should ask her that.

816
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,753
You ain't got to pussyfoot like that.
I ain't no child.

817
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,473
- Tell me.
- Okay, yes, she's got a man.

818
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,153
That's good.

819
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,953
It's real good.

820
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,755
She got herself someone to love
just like you got yourself someone.

821
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,553
As long as you bitches is
getting some, that's all that matters.

822
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,398
That why you ain't got
my DNA test yet?

823
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,477
- Busy spreading your legs?
- That's enough.

824
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,240
Tell me you was in that mood,
I could've scratched that itch.

825
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,749
- What's wrong with you?
- Not a damn thing wrong.

826
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,598
If you let me get under this table...

827
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,076
...I guarantee you'd be wrapping your
legs around my neck like an octopus.

828
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,793
I'd tell you to go to hell...

829
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,037
...only, lucky for me,
you're already there.

830
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,638
It's gotta be Calvin.

831
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,795
Then don't answer it.

832
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,877
He's written you
a dozen letters of apology.

833
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,991
How long you gonna let him
twist in the wind?

834
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,634
I know he blew off a lot of steam
in the wrong way...

835
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,037
- Are you defending him, Randy?
- No, I'm with you on that.

836
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,992
But look what
he's been going through.

837
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,590
Are you saying I don't know
what he's been through?

838
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,430
So you want another number?

839
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,392
No.

840
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,511
Can you try that one again, please?

841
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,594
I'm not really mad at him anymore.

842
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,315
I just need a break from him.

843
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,839
I'm tired.

844
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,474
- And you're also an amazing woman.
- No.

845
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,159
Will you marry me?

846
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,991
- It's a simple yes-or-no question.
- There's nothing simple about that.

847
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,872
I love you, you love me.

848
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,071
I love Ryan, he loves me.
What's complicated?

849
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,316
You're still on the transplant list.

850
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,557
- I'm not gonna die on you, Prissy.
- Lf I marry you, you might.

851
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,395
I'm not gonna marry you, Randy.

852
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,636
Listen to me, darling.

853
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,437
I'm no angel.

854
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,553
I spent half my life drunk,
hurt all kinds of people.

855
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,279
If I do die, it's because
of my own curse, not yours.

856
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,831
So I'm gonna ask you again.

857
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,156
Oh, God.

858
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,709
Now, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

859
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,876
- No, I don't wanna look.
- Look at me.

860
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,638
Look at me. Come on, come on.

861
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,390
Janet "Prissy" Gregory...

862
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,352
...will you marry me?

863
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,272
Oh, my God.

864
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,552
I do. I mean, yes, I will accept.

865
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,674
Hi, this is Vicki Tanner
with the Innocence Project.

866
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,518
I'm looking for Janet Gregory.

867
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,029
This is her. I'm sorry,
who did you say you're from?

868
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,195
The Innocence Project.

869
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,868
We've accepted your application
for Calvin Willis and l...

870
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,789
My God, they've just accepted
Calvin's application. I can't believe it.

871
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,195
- What a day.
- Oh, my God.

872
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,914
What's wrong?

873
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,590
Nothing, it's all great.
I just got a call from the l...

874
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,509
Hello? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

875
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,956
Yeah, it's wonderful.
So how can I help?

876
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,277
The Innocence Project.
They said yes.

877
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,358
Reverend, thank you so much
for having folk stay after service.

878
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,996
Miss Prissy here been working
herself thin for two years...

879
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,556
...trying to raise enough money
to get my boy's DNA test.

880
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,470
They now need $12,000 because
the evidence is so old, it's hard to test.

881
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,959
I have literally tapped every person
I know, and I'm still short about 1500.

882
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,674
And she said to me,
"Don't worry none."

883
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,919
But I said, " It's my Calvin,
and I have to worry too."

884
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,430
Ms. Newton was saying that your
church might sponsor a fundraiser.

885
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,916
A rummage sale, a bake sale.

886
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,309
- That'd be good.
- Yeah.

887
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,310
It is such a shame about
your grandson, Sister Neralvil, but...

888
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,111
...well, I just don't see how
that's a concern for the church.

889
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,879
What?

890
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,957
I'm sorry,
wasn't Calvin baptised here?

891
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,593
Sure was. He was 11 years old.

892
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,633
Yes, yes.
Well, that was a long time ago.

893
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,879
The fact is, there aren't many here
who even remember Calvin.

894
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,875
Does anybody here
remember Calvin Willis?

895
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,873
As a boy,
he came to this church every Sunday.

896
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,832
He was taken from his home...

897
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,793
...and thrown in prison
for over 14 years now...

898
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,514
...for a crime he did not commit.

899
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,428
Are y'all saying
you don't remember Calvin Willis?

900
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,715
Ms. Newton,
is this the right church?

901
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,399
This is the right church.

902
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,550
Sorry. I think I'm gonna wait
for you in the car.

903
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,670
Lord, Neralvil, where did you find
that crazy white woman?

904
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,394
She ain't crazy.

905
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,070
If y'all knew what that woman
had done for me and mine...

906
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,319
She's standing here doing
the Lord's work on this holy day...

907
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,751
...calling on your conscience.

908
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,550
Now I wanna know,
did you hear or didn't you?

909
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,713
No, I suppose you didn't.

910
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,593
Black folk get deaf...

911
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,518
...when one of their own
get in trouble.

912
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,510
Lord, have mercy.

913
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,713
Ryan, I thought you said
you were gonna clean up.

914
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,195
Ryan. You said
you were gonna clean up.

915
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,197
Randy said
he wanted to show me something.

916
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,073
What you thinking? Your dad's
weaker than a 2-day-old kitten.

917
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,478
But not for long. You forget I'm now
number two on the transplant list.

918
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,874
Yeah.

919
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,514
You were number three
for about five months.

920
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,349
Come on, get your big yellow ass
back on that couch.

921
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,278
Dad.

922
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,395
What you got, man?
You gotta have something.

923
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,033
Hold on, let me holler at this
white lady real quick. Hold on.

924
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,678
Hey, Miss Lady.
Miss Woman-on-a-Mission.

925
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,033
I forgot your name.

926
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,673
That's okay. I forgot yours too.

927
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,909
Shelton.
But if it's all the same to you...

928
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,749
...l'd rather you forget it
after I tell you what I got to tell you.

929
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,039
Fine. Whatever floats your boat.

930
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,798
So about a week ago...

931
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,390
...I run into this brother just got back
in town named Luther.

932
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,715
So, you know, we chilling.

933
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,639
We drinking it up real good, smoking,
you know what I'm saying?

934
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,478
I say to him,
"Remember Calvin Willis?

935
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,274
The one that got popped
for raping that 11 -year-old girl?"

936
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,835
His drunk ass just start laughing...

937
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,669
...talking about, "Them fool police
ain't ever figure out he ain't do it."

938
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,553
I'm like,
"How you know he ain't do it?"

939
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,876
He just smile like Satan.

940
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,877
Start doing like this here:

941
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,830
But you ain't heard it from me.

942
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,753
So do you know this Luther guy?

943
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,078
Yeah, I know him.

944
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,868
Didn't hang with him, though.

945
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,748
Used to pay Chante for trim.

946
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,154
What'd he look like?

947
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,157
Big, ugly.

948
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,035
Hairy-ass beard.

949
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,672
- What did you just say?
- I said, he was big...

950
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,394
...he was ugly
and he had a hairy-ass beard.

951
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:19,152
When Lucretia's friend said "hairy,"
could she have meant "hairy face"?

952
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,273
He was a big talker. Said he robbed
liquor stores he ain't never set foot in.

953
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,789
I spoke to a couple of detectives
about Luther.

954
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,070
As far as they're concerned,
the case is closed.

955
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,874
But I was thinking,
if I can find him...

956
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,834
...maybe I can get some of his DNA
off a fork or something.

957
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,349
What is going on with you?
Are you pissed at me?

958
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,150
This cat came in here the other day
to visit another inmate.

959
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,958
Said he knew me back in the day,
and Michelle.

960
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:50,069
Said she not only got herself
a husband, but a baby girl.

961
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,675
If that were true,
somebody would've told me by now.

962
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,234
One of my kids, Mama,
certainly you.

963
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,034
You wouldn't lie to me
about something like that?

964
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,357
- Calvin, let's not go there again.
- No.

965
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,391
It is not my place to tell...

966
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,716
Wasn't your place?
What kind of answer is that?

967
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,309
Everybody got their place.
Mine's in here with nothing.

968
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,353
No, that's not true.
You've got your two kids.

969
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,836
- And when you get your freedom...
- My what? My freedom?

970
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,553
Does setting a coloured boy free...

971
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,069
...somehow make you feel
like a better person?

972
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,192
Don't matter if you've been lying
to him the whole damn time.

973
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,276
I don't wanna see you no more.

974
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,436
I don't need your help.

975
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,956
And I certainly don't trust you...

976
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,115
...bitch.

977
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,640
How could you do me like that?!
Play me for a damn fool.

978
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,035
You got them to lie to me,
Prissy, my kids, Mama?

979
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,038
- Calvin, l... I just...
- How could you do that?

980
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,390
It's because I still care about you.

981
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,034
What I mean, I just didn't
want you to hurt no more.

982
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,593
You don't know about hurt.

983
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,678
First you give a man my place
in your heart, my place in your bed.

984
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,553
Now you give him my place
as a father? They're my damn kids!

985
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,637
I did not cause you to go to prison.

986
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,353
This is not all my fault.

987
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,709
This part sure as hell is!

988
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,878
My life ain't worth a damn now
because of what you've done to me!

989
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,789
What's the matter, man?

990
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,275
Did your girlfriend lose
her Barbie doll at daycare?

991
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,195
Willis!

992
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,796
- Let go of me! Let go! Let go!
- Get off him, Willis.

993
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,877
- Get off him!
- Hold him down! Hold him down.

994
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,675
Willis!

995
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,356
- Goddamn. Hold him down!
- Stay down, Willis.

996
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,754
Stay down!

997
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,030
Stay down. Stay down, Willis.

998
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,917
You seriously still
going through with this?

999
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,439
Yeah.

1000
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,029
I just talked with Tina at the diner...

1001
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,869
...and she won't let anyone
bus the table...

1002
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,798
...so I just have to get
the beer mug...

1003
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,788
...or whatever else this Luther guy
puts his mouth on.

1004
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,989
What are you doing?

1005
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,270
I'm going. I'm gonna
get a table close by...

1006
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,833
- No way.
...and watch you.

1007
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,917
- Not happening.
- So he doesn't try anything.

1008
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,078
I may not be able to do
a lot of things, darling...

1009
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,510
...but I can still protect my wife.

1010
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,711
I'm going.

1011
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,233
Aren't you gonna drink your beer?

1012
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,637
No, I was waiting on
some dead presidents.

1013
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,356
And I thought you forgot.

1014
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,633
So, what you wanna talk about?

1015
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,069
Calvin Willis.

1016
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,478
Poor Calvin.

1017
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,240
The famous rapist
of Pan Street, huh?

1018
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,399
Why him?

1019
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,556
I'm trying to prove he's innocent.

1020
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,435
So are you his lawyer or something?

1021
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,434
No, Luther.

1022
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,710
I just heard you were a friend of his.

1023
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,115
Yeah. Yeah, I knew you was
too fine to be a lawyer.

1024
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,835
- You fine as a...
- So you don't believe he's innocent?

1025
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,119
Well, I mean, that all depends on what
you call innocent, now, doesn't it?

1026
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,675
He don't deserve what he got,
that's for damn sure.

1027
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,795
I mean, after all, God made women
to be good to their men.

1028
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,073
It's biblical, as far as I'm concerned.
Ain't no such thing as rape.

1029
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,512
What'd you say?

1030
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,799
Oh, girl, come on now.
It's written right there in the Bible.

1031
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,150
It says that God
put women on this earth...

1032
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,079
...to be a vessel for their man.

1033
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,751
And that's...
That's all women, baby...

1034
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,755
...no matter their age or colour.

1035
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,190
Take your hands off me,
you son of a bitch!

1036
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,039
- Go on, get out or I'll rip off your head!
- You crazy...

1037
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,117
Go on, get out of here!

1038
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,470
I'll kill you! I'll see you again!

1039
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,989
Get off me, Randy.

1040
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,832
God. Well, I think
that went really well.

1041
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,035
- What the hell was that?
- He was scum.

1042
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,549
You didn't... You screwed up.
You didn't get his DNA.

1043
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,990
Thank you.
You couldn't hear what he was saying.

1044
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,192
You'll never have a chance
like this again, girl.

1045
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,395
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

1046
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,879
That you were raped.

1047
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,513
You think because I overreacted
to that skanky-ass son of a b...

1048
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,553
You more than overreacted.
You've been working on this for years.

1049
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,320
You also overreacted
when I held you down that time.

1050
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,991
Give me the keys, Randy.
I wanna go home.

1051
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,555
Did you think I would judge you
or love you less?

1052
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,514
I judged me. I thought I deserved it.

1053
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,551
How old were you?

1054
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,799
Old enough to know better
than to go off with some redneck...

1055
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,558
...just because he's good-looking.

1056
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,716
Nineteen.

1057
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,193
Nineteen.

1058
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,392
He told me that he was gonna
take me to a concert and he didn't.

1059
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,795
He took me off to his trailer
in the woods instead.

1060
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,070
To be perfectly honest,
I didn't think about it.

1061
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,554
I just went in.

1062
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,031
And then he got me
liquored up real good...

1063
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,277
...and before you know it,
he's holding me down and...

1064
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,878
I had a choice: Get my head blown off
or go along with it.

1065
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,833
- He had a gun?
- Yes, he had a gun.

1066
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,993
After he'd done everything he could
to me, you know what he said?

1067
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,918
"Well, Prissy,
you were asking for it...

1068
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,111
...from the minute you came in,
weren't you?"

1069
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,232
I thought, "Damn if he ain't right."

1070
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,476
He wasn't right...

1071
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,716
...and you know that.

1072
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,276
You did not deserve
what he did to you.

1073
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,195
Thank you for coming.

1074
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,115
I sure do appreciate
you carrying me down here.

1075
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,309
Oh, you're welcome.

1076
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,671
I know you should be home
with your husband after his surgery.

1077
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,599
Oh, him and his new liver
are getting on fine.

1078
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,236
You know men. If I treat him
like an invalid, he'll sure act like one.

1079
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,715
- He's fine.
- That's what I prayed for.

1080
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,639
Because if God wanted him,
he sure would take him.

1081
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,112
Like using his lightning on Graves?

1082
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,389
Yes, ma'am. Now, that's right.

1083
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,433
I wanna get out down there.

1084
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,949
Can you drive down
just a little further?

1085
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,115
Okay, sure.

1086
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,195
Pull around over there.

1087
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,478
Hey.

1088
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,274
- Look over there.
- Oh, my God.

1089
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,118
You see how the Lord do?

1090
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,232
You did that?

1091
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,715
I don't belie...

1092
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,235
Everyone should have
a mother like that.

1093
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,910
You know, she took me
to a surprise fundraiser.

1094
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,193
She rallied the whole church
and she raised the rest of the money.

1095
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,755
Well, high-five on that.

1096
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,668
What's this?

1097
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,155
Oh, it's a new tune
I've been working on.

1098
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,590
Now, you're feeling better.
Take your pills?

1099
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,074
Are you gonna be my mama...

1100
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,192
...or are you gonna crawl under here
and be my wife?

1101
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,797
You'll be popping your stitches.

1102
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,752
Sorry.

1103
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,635
It's feeling better?

1104
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,400
You sure scared the crap out of me.

1105
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,752
Oh, I know. But we got through it.

1106
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,951
Now you gotta get on
with important things.

1107
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,878
There's nothing
more important than you.

1108
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,957
- And Ryan and Calvin.
- And Ryan.

1109
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,118
- Are you playing with me?
- I'm fixing to.

1110
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,635
I sure do love you, Miss Prissy.

1111
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,597
Adela's "my sweet Lord" cookies.
I had them when I was knee-high.

1112
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,633
Oh, she had a line at her table.

1113
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,991
She said she's gonna make you
a batch for when you're out of there.

1114
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,873
- She said that?
- Yeah, she did.

1115
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,992
So I'm gonna get
a cashier's cheque tomorrow...

1116
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,634
...and send it to the lab
for the rest of the test.

1117
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,434
I also spok e with the woman
from the Innocence Project.

1118
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,030
- Vicki?
- She's gonna follow up once a week.

1119
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,151
Oh, praise God.

1120
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,673
You said Reverend Hollis,
he remembered me?

1121
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,916
A lot of people
remember you, Calvin.

1122
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,318
A lot.

1123
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,391
Sorry.

1124
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,635
I hate waking you up too.

1125
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,149
You want me to
make you breakfast before...?

1126
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,799
Mama?

1127
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,197
Mama, what's wrong?

1128
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,154
Hey, sign here and here...

1129
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,588
...and here.

1130
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,915
What are you doing here?

1131
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,915
My job.

1132
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,511
You just buried your husband
two days ago.

1133
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,153
I'm well aware of that, Calvin...

1134
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,635
...but we still have to file
our notice of intent...

1135
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,751
...with the DA
before the end of the month.

1136
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,712
- Come on.
- It can wait.

1137
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,911
- Randy would've wanted you to...
- Do me a favour.

1138
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,112
Do not tell me what
a dead husband number three...

1139
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,515
...would or wouldn't have wanted.

1140
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,153
You need to take some time
grieving for yourself.

1141
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,510
This is me grieving.

1142
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,429
I just make it look easy
because I've had lots of practise.

1143
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,710
I know how bad it got to hurt.

1144
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,718
Let go of me, Calvin. Come on.

1145
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,909
You feel hard...

1146
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,030
...like you're made of stone.

1147
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,673
Your whole body
must be sore from it.

1148
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,310
Deep down inside,
you feel fiery hot.

1149
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,078
Hot with all that injustice
burning inside you.

1150
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,954
It's all right, let it burn on through.

1151
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,031
I can't. Calvin, I can't.

1152
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,719
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

1153
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,433
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

1154
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,232
Come on, talk to me.

1155
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,236
You taken my pain, Prissy. You've
been there for me a thousand times.

1156
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,555
Go on and give me yours.

1157
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,069
- Stop.
- Come on.

1158
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,999
I don't get to fall apart.

1159
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,398
I got a son and I've at least
gotta try and be there for him.

1160
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,149
Sometimes I'm feeling nothing
and then I feel angry.

1161
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,239
And I'm just... I'm just so angry.

1162
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,953
I'm just angry.

1163
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,674
- I'm just so angry.
- That's all right. That's all right.

1164
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,269
I'm just mad.

1165
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,118
I let him in and I let Ryan down.

1166
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,436
- It's okay.
- I have Ryan...

1167
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,075
And he's not here.

1168
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,520
And he's not here.

1169
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,676
Oh, Calvin.

1170
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,592
It's all right.

1171
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,435
I'm back.

1172
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,312
That's a very long half-hour.

1173
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,750
You got a message on your desk.

1174
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,758
Vicki Tanner
from the Innocence Project.

1175
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,679
Something about
DNA results being in.

1176
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,276
I'm leaving again.

1177
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,076
Oh, come on.

1178
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,432
What time is it now?

1179
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,189
It's seven minutes later
than the last time.

1180
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,438
Maybe there's a problem.

1181
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,836
- We were getting worried.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

1182
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,995
I got lost.

1183
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,237
I was told to take Interstate 10
to the 55, and that put me back...

1184
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,670
- Vicki, give him the letter.
- Right.

1185
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,157
- Here are your results.
- You didn't open it?

1186
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,794
No, I just stuffed them in my bag
and hopped in the car.

1187
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,516
- No.
- We already know what it says, right?

1188
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,312
You seem a mite nervous.

1189
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,278
Well, aren't you?

1190
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,194
You forget I know
what I was doing that night.

1191
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,395
It says they tested the DNA...

1192
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,034
...in the fingernail scrapings
and the boxer shorts...

1193
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,550
...and compared it to Calvin's DNA,
and there was no match.

1194
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,319
There's no match.

1195
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,192
No match.

1196
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,268
Praise God.

1197
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,949
Thank you, Lord.

1198
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,116
Thank you, Lord.

1199
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,436
My boy walking free.

1200
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,358
Walking free.

1201
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,476
I got your room
already ready for you.

1202
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,716
I just got to make the bed.

1203
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,430
- Ms. Newton.
- Mama.

1204
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,556
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Newton,
but you can't take him home just yet.

1205
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,275
We have to get a judge who'll agree
to even consider this new evidence.

1206
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,036
You telling me
we got proof in our hand...

1207
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,879
...and he got to go back to the cell?

1208
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,957
I know. It ain't right.

1209
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,799
No, it ain't right.

1210
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,709
It sure ain't.

1211
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,519
- You all right, baby?
- I'm good, Mama.

1212
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,433
It's our position, Your Honour...

1213
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,552
...that just because Mr. Willis' DNA
could not be identified...

1214
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,990
...does not make him
innocent of this crime.

1215
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,033
Now, remember, the victim
identified him from a photo...

1216
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,596
...and there's eyewitness testimony
placing him at the scene.

1217
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,950
Now, we see no reason
to overturn a decision...

1218
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,630
...that stood for 20 years
and numerous appeals, Your Honour.

1219
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,469
Your Honour, over 75 percent
of wrongful identifications of rape...

1220
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,353
...are due to misidentifications
by eyewitnesses.

1221
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,472
In my experience in these cases,
the district attorney's office...

1222
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,513
...cares more about saving face
than it does finding justice.

1223
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,438
Ms. Tanner...

1224
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,234
...if I want your opinion
on investigative procedure...

1225
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,353
...or Mr. Harris' motives, I'll ask.

1226
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,993
I've heard your arguments.

1227
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,191
I plan to go over your briefs
one more time...

1228
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,789
...give you my ruling
this afternoon at 4.

1229
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,279
- We are adjourned.
- All rise.

1230
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,959
All right.

1231
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,030
You heard the questions.
He may rule against us.

1232
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,913
- Not if I have anything to do with it.
- Where are you going?

1233
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,157
- I'm gonna have a chat with the judge.
- Do not go into his chambers.

1234
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,998
Vicki, you heard the man.

1235
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,270
- All of our work...
- He's gonna rule against us.

1236
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,789
And I think I have the right,
after all these years...

1237
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,310
...to end this on my terms,
or screw it up.

1238
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,595
Your Honour...

1239
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,758
If you want to speak with me,
make an appointment. I'm busy.

1240
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,589
Busy with that load of bull crap
Heinz Harris just shovelled in your face.

1241
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,429
Excuse me?

1242
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,791
That man wouldn't recognise the truth
if it bit him in the ass twice.

1243
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,599
Graves Thomas once told me
that you could be depended on...

1244
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,270
...on Tuesdays and every other
Thursday to give a fair ruling.

1245
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,630
Will you please listen to me?

1246
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,919
I've spent nearly half my life
on this case.

1247
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,192
I think the least you could do is
give me one minute of your attention.

1248
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,355
It wouldn't matter.

1249
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,629
I've already made my decision.

1250
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,116
And even though
it's not a Tuesday...

1251
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,279
...I just signed the order
releasing Calvin Willis from prison.

1252
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,389
You mean, Calvin's getting out?

1253
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,277
We don't wanna spoil the surprise...

1254
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,074
...for old Heinz now, do we?

1255
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,755
No, sir, we don't.

1256
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,918
Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.

1257
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,519
Lord, you're just so good.

1258
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,792
You're most kind, Lord. Lord Jesus.

1259
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,719
You've just been so good.

1260
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,236
Thank you, blessed Jesus.

1261
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,237
- Thank you!
- Are you getting this?

1262
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,396
Thank the Lord.

1263
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,672
Thank you.

1264
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,356
Oh, I wouldn't wanna step
without you, Lord.

1265
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,028
Lord, I thank you. I thank you.

1266
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,196
Thank you, Lord.

1267
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,274
Your lady friend
brought these for you.

1268
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,791
Get dressed.

1269
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,435
Hey, Calvin.

1270
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,872
Miss Prissy.

1271
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,673
All right if I walk out with you?

1272
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,235
I'd be honoured.

1273
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,835
You ready?

1274
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,234
There's a lot of people out there.

1275
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,197
Thanks for these.

1276
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,514
You know, these white folks' clothes.

1277
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,195
Yeah. I thought you wouldn't mind.

1278
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,710
I bought the shirt for Randy,
but it's never been worn.

1279
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,678
You know...

1280
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,750
...I never known nobody like you.

1281
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,952
Well, that's because
you've been inside for 20 years.

1282
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,916
I just wanna say thank you.

1283
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,832
I don't wanna be crying.
I don't wanna cry.

1284
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:05,316
You know, I see
why Randy never wore these.

1285
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,076
- It's dry. Ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

1286
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,357
Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.

1287
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,108
Thank you, Lord.

1288
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,474
It just feels wonderful. Just wonderful.

1289
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,671
I've waited a long time.
