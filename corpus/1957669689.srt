00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:52,226
Beautiful,
don't you think?

521
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:55,229
The park Lane
is the first luxury hotel

522
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,797
to be built in Manhattan
in seven years.

523
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:01,757
There are 47 stories,
640 rooms,

524
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:05,457
and it's the tallest structure
on central park south.

525
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,459
I want you to know

526
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,548
the credit all goes

527
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:12,638
to my wife Eve.
That's all true.

528
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,031
<i>Come here.</i><i>
Come on.</i>

529
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,731
Eve is a quaker.

530
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:21,168
Quakers tend to stay
out of the limelight.

531
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,171
Quakerism teaches you
to stay in the background,

532
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,738
not boast about
what you have--

533
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:31,265
like a good husband.

534
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:34,616
Park Lane is
Eve Helmsley's hotel.

535
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:37,445
They're both
pretty special,
don't you think?

536
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,971
Now, if you'll
follow US, we'll
take you to the pool.

537
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,149
Eve: <i>Harry gets</i><i>
his exercise</i><i>
by swimming.</i>

538
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,327
He loves to swim
every morning.

539
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,633
- <i>I prefer walking.</i>
- On water, no doubt.

540
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:54,549
Ooh, you are acting
like a jealous schoolgirl,

541
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,639
and on a woman your age,
it's not quite becoming.

542
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,426
- I don't know
why I like you.
- Oh yes, you do.

543
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,733
I'm the only one who
knows that inside that
rough exterior of yours,

544
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,562
there's an even
rougher one on the--

545
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,695
I know your game,
I know your next move.

546
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,219
I can call foul
even before you
hit the ball.

547
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,308
Keep me your friend, Leona.

548
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,355
You don't want me
walking behind you.

549
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,532
I'm gonna get him.

550
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:23,709
You are looking at
one very determined broad

551
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,494
who is gonna knock
a quaker queen off
her throne.

552
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,237
Miss Roberts,
you can't go in there.

553
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,500
Mr. Helmsley
is in conference.

554
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,548
Lunchtime.

555
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:38,593
Excuse US, gentlemen.

556
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,509
Leona, we're right in
the middle of a meeting.

557
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,206
It can wait.

558
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:44,773
You know what time
it is, Harry?

559
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,558
It's 10 minutes
after 1:00.

560
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,820
That's right, so?

561
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,779
From now on, lunchtime
is at 1:00 sharp.

562
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,521
- Excuse US,
gentlemen.
- Harry?

563
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,350
Sorry.

564
00:39:56,481 --> 00:40:00,093
Maybe we can finish
this off after lunch.

565
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,184
Skim milk,

566
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:07,056
vitamins,
fruit group,

567
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:12,410
and skinless
breast of chicken.

568
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,890
[ Laughs ]
Lee, this is all
very nice of you,

569
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,719
but you can't just
bust into my office
like this.

570
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,548
Harry, do you know
how attractive you are?

571
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,071
No.

572
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:23,899
You're tall, you got
a great physique,

573
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,727
you're quick,
you're alert,
you got power.

574
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:28,687
But you gotta start
taking care of yourself.

575
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:29,688
I'm not talking
about swimming.

576
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,080
I know you do that
every morning.

577
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,256
I am talking about
a maintenance schedule--

578
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:34,780
eating properly.

579
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,738
Look at this chicken breast.

580
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,045
So your body knows
that it can depend
upon you

581
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:41,613
to take care of it.
I baked that this morning.

582
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:43,658
So from now on,

583
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,269
lunch is at 1:00 sharp.

584
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,707
Dinner is at 8:00.

585
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:51,753
Not 9:00,
not 7:00.
8:00.

586
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,930
But I have meetings,
obligations to fulfill.

587
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,368
The only obligation
you have is to keep
yourself healthy and fit.

588
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:02,764
Please don't
fight me in this.

589
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:05,506
You are so adorable.

590
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,641
No, not now, Harry.

591
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,557
Now you eat.
Come, darling.

592
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,690
[ Laughing ]

593
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,649
Want me to cut
that for you?

594
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,607
There, my sweetheart.

595
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:21,609
Here.

596
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,611
Eat.

597
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:28,007
65 signatures?

598
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,878
That's four more
than we needed.

599
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,315
Well, file the papers
immediately.

600
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,622
No, now.
Right now.

601
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,109
- Secretary: <i>
Ms. Roberts?</i>
- No calls.

602
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,720
- <i>But there's</i><i>
a Mr. Benjamin schecter--</i>
- I said no calls.

603
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:49,289
Are you deaf
or you stupid?

604
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,509
Do that again
and you're fired.

605
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:56,644
I'm sorry.
Ms. Roberts is in
a meeting at the moment.

606
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,777
May I take a message?

607
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:14,880
It's not 1:00 yet,
is it?

608
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,187
I did it, Harry.

609
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,715
345 east 56th street
went co-op.

610
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:26,761
65 tenants signed.

611
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,981
Four more than we needed.

612
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,810
It's a birthday present
just for you.

613
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,856
That's wonderful!
Wonderful!

614
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,684
You're wonderful.

615
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,791
Lock the door, Harry.

616
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,577
I've got another
present for you.

617
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:22,948
I gave Sylvia
all of mama's furniture.

618
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:24,427
I hope you don't mind.

619
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:26,821
No, she needs it.

620
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,258
Besides, she has
no taste.

621
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,394
I was wondering
if you wanted mama's watch.

622
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:37,397
No.

623
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,008
You keep it.

624
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:43,621
Besides, she always
wanted you to have
it anyhow.

625
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,630
I love him.

626
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,897
I'm good for him,
and he knows it.

627
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:01,769
You should see US
dance together.

628
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,469
It's as if we've
been dancing together
all our lives.

629
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,733
Everybody says so.

630
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:11,126
Everybody
says so.

631
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:12,954
You want this?

632
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,310
No.

633
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,933
We're good
for each other.

634
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,828
It's me, sweetheart.

635
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,924
My god, you're beautiful.

636
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:13,711
Oh, you make me
beautiful.

637
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:22,981
Tonight is very special.

638
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:26,636
Veal in white wine
and lemon sauce,

639
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,682
- asparagus--
- look at all these flowers.

640
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,858
Harry, come here.
Give me your jacket.

641
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,860
I have a surprise
for you.

642
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,733
Where did they come from?

643
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:36,864
- Here, sweetheart.
- I didn't send them.

644
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,866
Put this on.

645
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,781
Give me your arm.
Come on.

646
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:43,088
Harry, feel this.
Doesn't this feel
like butter?

647
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:44,916
Nice, nice.
Thank you.

648
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:48,920
You look so handsome.

649
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,749
Let me put on
another record.

650
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,757
Who's Vincent?

651
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:09,244
I thought I put that
with the box.

652
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,594
What are you
talking about?
Who the hell is Vincent?

653
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:14,032
Did the roses
come from him?

654
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,645
Harry, I didn't
know what to do.

655
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,169
I mean, when
the first ones came,

656
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,389
I threw them out,
but then he just--

657
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,913
he kept sending
more flowers.

658
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,959
- Give me that.
- Harry!

659
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,917
I said give it to me.

660
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,063
He wants you
to move to Atlanta.

661
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:48,066
He wants me
to marry him.

662
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,722
He's given me 10 days
to make up my mind.

663
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,725
- Have you been seeing
him all the time--
- oh, Harry.

664
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:59,294
I met him long
before I met you.

665
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,383
It didn't mean anything,
not as far as I was concerned.

666
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:05,648
At first he sent letters,
and then--

667
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,476
then the flowers.

668
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:14,832
I love you, Harry.

669
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:17,269
But I am not gonna be
somebody that you see

670
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,620
two or three nights
a week and then--

671
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,230
then you go home
to your wife.

672
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:25,843
Lee, we've talked
about this before,

673
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,235
about my being married
to Eve for 33 years--

674
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:29,716
has she been
your lover, Harry?

675
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,588
Does she make you feel
the way I do?

676
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,329
No.

677
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,028
But there's more
to marriage than just--

678
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:42,903
well.

679
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:49,867
Then there's something else
you ought to see.

680
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,394
You can't be serious.

681
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,700
He's devoted to me.

682
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,180
Well, so am I.

683
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,052
You're married.

684
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:04,185
For 33 years.

685
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:07,449
- Are you happy, Harry?
- For 33 years, Lee.

686
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,451
Are you happy, Harry?

687
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:12,759
I don't see how I can
possibly tell her that--

688
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,719
she's such a gentle woman.

689
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,113
So kind, so--

690
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,507
we're very comfortable
with one another.

691
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:25,206
For over 33 years,
we've done everything
together.

692
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,165

860
00:58:51,484 --> 00:58:54,487
Mrs. Helmsley,
would you mind
very much

861
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:55,662
if I asked
your husband
to dance?

862
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,537
There's not a chance
in hell that's gonna
happen, honey.

863
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:15,943
Harry: <i>
That young lady was</i><i>
so charming and so innocent.</i>

864
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:18,555
Leona: <i>Innocent?!</i><i>
You are more innocent</i><i>
than she is.</i>

865
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:21,558
Harry: Oh yeah?
Well, let me ask
you something.

866
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:25,083
Damn it to hell!
Don't keep walking
away from me.

867
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:26,867
- I am trying
to talk to you!
- If I am so vulgar,

868
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:29,130
why don't you crawl
back to your sweet,
simple Eve?

869
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:30,784
Don't think that
hasn't crossed my mind.

870
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:33,526
At least I had
some peace then.

871
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,484
I could fight my battles
in the office,

872
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,269
but home was like
a sanctuary--

873
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:39,967
- calm and peaceful.
- <i>It was killing you.</i>

874
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:42,056
You were becoming
an old man.

875
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,972
Sometimes
you suffocate me.

876
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:48,062
<i>In public,</i><i>
you grab ahold of me</i><i>
like a jealous schoolgirl.</i>

877
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:50,412
You comb my hair,
pick the lint off
my jacket.

878
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:52,632
You treat me like--

879
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:56,723
I treat you like
you are the center
of my universe.

[ Groans ]

881
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:01,249
When I'm with you,
it's--

882
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,907
it's as if
everything else
is out of focus.

883
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:09,475
You're right.

884
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,521
I don't want
anybody else near you.

885
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,915
And I would be
perfectly willing

886
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:18,397
to kill anybody
who tried to take
you away from me.

887
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:21,835
Harry.

888
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:25,622
Harry!

889
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,627
If anything
happened to you,

890
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:36,981
I would die.

891
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:39,897
Together,
we're immortal.

892
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,685
We make magic.

893
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:52,431
Everything I do

894
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:56,043
I do for you.

895
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:59,525
So you better
decide, Harry--

896
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,659
what is it
you really want?

897
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:08,316
Sweet, simple Eve

898
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:13,408
or me?

899
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,524
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you're all wondering

900
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:44,657
why I called
you here today.

901
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:48,095
Well, it's for
a very special reason--

902
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:51,533
the unveiling
of our plans

903
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,927
to build the most
magnificent hotel

904
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,930
New York
has yet to see.

905
01:01:57,061 --> 01:02:00,368
I give you
the palace hotel.

906
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,117
As this model
clearly shows,

907
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:12,424
we've kept our promise.
We've done everything
possible

this exquisite villa</i>

910

<i>No expense</i><i>

912
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,960
Now I want to introduce
you to the woman

913
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,180
who will
not only oversee

914
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,225
the creation
of this magnificent hotel,

915
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:34,620
<i>but will also be president</i><i>
of the newly-formed</i>

<i>[ Applause ]</i>

919
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,205
I want to know
what we can throw out,

920
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:56,773
what we can keep.

921
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:59,384
Okay, what you wanna do
is preserve the interior

922
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:00,994
to the fullest
possible extent

923
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,343
because of
the historic nature.

924
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:05,085
The cubicles
the church put in--
they can go.

925
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:07,000
- Mark, are you
taking notes?
- Yes, ma'am.

926
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,046
The gold room,
thank god,

927
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:10,264
is pretty much
the way it was.

928
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:12,223
And the chandelier's intact.

929
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:15,356
- <i>But in here--</i><i>
Mrs. Helmsley?</i>
- Huh?

930
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:19,012
In here, we're talking
millions of dollars.

931
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,014
I know that, Sarah.

932
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,799
I don't care
about that.

933

The rag.

934
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:38,771
Now, I have the highest
possible standards.

935
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:41,252
If we are gonna spend
millions of dollars

936
01:03:41,382 --> 01:03:44,646
redecorating
and restoring
this hotel,

937
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:47,127
then I want
only the best
from you.

01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:49,086

you've got the job.

Oh, I'm up to it,
Mrs. Helmsley.

940
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:54,091
Good.

941
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,093
Oh, good.

Bring a pad, Mark.
Come on, Sarah.

943
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:05,015
As you know,
Mrs. Helmsley,

944
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,974
part of the condition
of appointing your son
vice president

945

of deco incorporated

946
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:13,893
was that I supervise
all bookkeeping,

947
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,112
- <i>invoices,</i><i>
transactions.</i>
- Yes, Stanley.

948
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:19,856
Since your son had
little experience
in this field,

949
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:22,336
Mr. Helmsley felt that
in-house regulations

950
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:23,947
be put into effect.

951
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:26,036
Leona: <i>Stanley,</i><i>
are you going to get</i><i>
to the point eventually,</i>

952
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,864
or should I order lunch?

953
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:34,000
Your son is ripping
off your husband,
Mrs. Helmsley.

954
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:38,875
<i>The Helmsley corporation</i><i>
is being double-billed,</i>

<i>sometimes triple-billed</i><i>

956
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,228

For a 200-room hotel,

he orders furnishings
for 300 rooms.

959
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,540
The surplus is then sold
to another chain

960

the difference.

01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:59,330
<i>Now I understand</i>

Harry about this yet?

What was that job, Jay?
Give me a job description.

983
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,923
To organize

986
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:17,451
- No other hotels,
no other chains?
- Yes, sir.

987
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:20,411
Then what the hell
is this?!

988
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,979
Harry, there is no need
to scream at him.

989
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:24,981
I'll scream at whomever
I damn well please,

including you
if you don't shut up
and sit down.

<i>Well?</i>

992

Jay: <i>
It's our catalogue.</i>

993
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,861
I've been around
a long time, hotshot.

994
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,863
I know all the schemes.

995
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,256
Half of them
I invented.

996
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:42,433
And no snot-nosed
little brat

997
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:45,436
is gonna get away
with double-ordering,

998
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:47,655
double-billing,
and selling furnishings

999
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,266
that I've already
paid for to other hotels

1000
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:50,615
and then pocketing
the difference!

1001
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:52,530
Jay would never
do such a thing.

1002
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,445
Why not?
He's your son,
isn't he?

1003
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,447
Yeah, you've been
pretty clever.

1004
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:58,405
Somehow you've managed
to sidestep Stanley

1005
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:01,582
on most of this.
Well, no more.

1006
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:04,803
From now on,
he's gonna be breathing
right down your neck.

1007
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,501
You're gonna have to get
his approval on every
damn thing you do,

01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,503
even when you
go to the toilet.
You understand?!

1009
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:13,333
And he'll send me copies
of every purchase order,

01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,988
every memo,
every scribble
that you make.

1011
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,383
How will I explain
that to my staff?

You've had three
heart attacks.

1013
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,996
Tell them that your
stepfather is concerned
about your health

1014
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,824
and sent someone down
to help you out.

1015

01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,308
I'm rehiring Stanley
permanently.

1017
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:37,227
Now get this straight,
both of you:

1018
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,318
Just one more time,

1019
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,929
one more thing

1021
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:49,195
Oh!

1022
01:07:57,638 --> 01:08:00,424
I apologize for interrupting
your honeymoon, Mimi.

As you know,

I am a very
determined person.

1027
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:29,366
And I determined long ago

01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:32,238
that I was gonna marry

01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,285
all buried
in their accounts

1198
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:30,156
charged off
to deco incorporated.

1199
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:32,202
So it's all
a business expense.

1200
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,726
Not only do you
not pay for any of it,

1201
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:37,033
- it's a tax write-off.
- Why not?

1202
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:39,905
Only the little people
pay taxes, right?

1203
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,305
- Lee.
- Dreamboat.

1204
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,263
What are you doing
home so early?

1205
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:52,091
Good, we can talk about
the pool enclosure,

1206
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:53,789
- because I just
found out--
- Lee.

1207
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:56,095
- What?
- Jay's had another
heart attack.

1208
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,412
Where is he?
Take me to him.

1209
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:10,370
[ Sobbing ]
It's too late.

1210
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,068
He died over
an hour ago.

1211
01:20:23,253 --> 01:20:25,124
Oh, Harry.

1212
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:27,474
Take me out of here.

1213
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,108
Now it all makes sense.

1214
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:54,153
What?

1215
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:57,243
I wondered why

1216
01:20:57,374 --> 01:20:59,332
that precious
daughter-in-law of mine

1217
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:02,205
had to rush back
to Orlando after
the funeral.

1218
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:04,990
What are you
talking about?

1219
01:21:06,339 --> 01:21:10,169
She left New York
before Jay was even
cold in his grave.

1220
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,432
She did not sit Shiva,

1221
01:21:12,563 --> 01:21:16,219
<i>she did not stand</i><i>
by US as a family,</i>

1222
01:21:16,349 --> 01:21:18,961
and now she is claiming
she has a legal right

1223
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:20,832
to take over deco.

1224
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:22,834
That's impossible.
We own the business.

1225
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:25,184
<i>Well, she is</i><i>
trying to jump in</i>

1226
01:21:25,315 --> 01:21:27,273
and grab it.

1227
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:29,406
Now we are going
to have to lock her out,

1228
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:31,756
and we're gonna
have to move fast.

1229
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,107
Okay, I'll get
a court order.

1230
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:37,762
No!

1231
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:41,113
I want a lock
on everything tonight.

1232
01:21:41,244 --> 01:21:44,290
She did not honor Jay,

1233
01:21:44,421 --> 01:21:47,293
and I'm gonna
teach her a lesson

1234
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:50,035
- she will not forget.
- Okay.

1235
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:55,040
I want her evicted
from the house.

1236
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:57,913
I want--

1237
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:00,350
I want her and the kids
out of the house.

1238
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,221
Okay, but where are they
going to live?

1239
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:06,182
I don't care!

1240
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:11,796
Jay is dead,

1241
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,754
and as far
as I'm concerned,

1242
01:22:13,885 --> 01:22:16,322
she killed him.

1243
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:19,325
No, Lee...

1244
01:22:19,456 --> 01:22:22,589
Your son died
with his pants down

1245
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,115
in a hotel room
with another woman.

1246
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:28,813
Well, if she were
a better wife,

1247
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,816
it wouldn't
have happened.

1248
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,211
I want her
out of my life.

1249
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:37,691
Harry!

1250
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:54,752
What is it?

1251
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:57,755
What's wrong?
Harry?

1252
01:22:57,885 --> 01:23:00,236
Huh?

1253
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:02,151
What?

1254
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:04,240
What happened?

1255
01:23:09,332 --> 01:23:11,769
Nothing.
Nothing happened.

1256
01:23:11,899 --> 01:23:14,685
Nothing.

1257
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:16,252
Nothing.

1258
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:24,129
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

1259
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,285
Did you ever play
52 pickup, may?

1260
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:51,417
I thought you loved
the playing cards.

1261
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:54,072
You personally approved
every photograph
of yourself.

1262
01:23:54,203 --> 01:23:57,249
<i>You picked the colors,</i><i>
the style of the numbers.</i>

1263
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,817
<i>Leona, we have</i><i>
printed up</i>

1264
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:02,559
10,000 decks
of cards here.

1265
01:24:02,689 --> 01:24:05,040
We've packaged them,
we've wrapped them
in cellophane,

1266
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,042
<i>we've spent a year</i><i>
designing the damn--</i>

1267
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:11,524
excuse me.

1268
01:24:11,655 --> 01:24:13,483
These cards have been made
to your specifications,

1269
01:24:13,613 --> 01:24:15,267
and it's too late
to change them now.

1270
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:17,356
They're too small.

1271
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:21,230
They're regular cards.

1272
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,232
Harry plays with
pinochle cards,

1273
01:24:23,362 --> 01:24:25,103
and they're larger.

1274
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:27,627
My picture is on those cards,
and I want it to look right.

1275
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:30,500
<i>These cards are gonna</i><i>
go in my hotels.</i>

1276
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,241
I wanna make sure
they look like
they belong,

1277
01:24:32,371 --> 01:24:33,938
so I want them larger,

1278
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,419
and I want
the edges gold-leafed.

1279
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:39,248
Gold leaf?
You said you didn't
want gold leaf.

1280
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:42,207
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1281
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:44,862
I gave you that option,
and you specifically said
you didn't want it.

1282
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:48,083
No arguments.

1283
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,347
I'll get right on it.

1284
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:55,699
<i>Oh, and may?</i>

1285
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:59,616
Every time you send
a messenger with
your ad copy,

1286
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:03,098
it costs me $5.95.

1287
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:05,361
Don't you think
mailing it makes
more sense?

1288
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:09,234
Whatever you say.

1289
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:13,108
- [ Door slams ]
- [ Sighs ]

1290
01:25:20,724 --> 01:25:23,118
Well?

1291
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,775
Pick those up.

1292
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:34,564
Don't just stand there.

1293
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,957
<i>Pick those up.</i>

1294
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:40,091
Pick them up yourself.

While you're at it,
pick that up, too.

1296
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,288
Hold on just a second.

1297
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:06,378

- Something about
the helmsleys.
- Thanks.

1299
01:26:10,426 --> 01:26:12,602
Hello?

1300
01:26:12,732 --> 01:26:14,386
Woman: <i>
Are you interested</i><i>
in winning a pulitzer prize?</i>

1301
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:16,432
[ Chuckles ]
Of course.

01:26:16,562 --> 01:26:18,651
<i>I'm serious.</i><i>
If you meet me tonight,</i>

<i>I assure you you'll</i><i>
win a pulitzer prize.</i>

1304
01:26:20,653 --> 01:26:23,439
That's good salesmanship,
but what's this all about?

1305
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:26,572
<i>The helmsleys.</i><i>
They're thieves.</i>

1306
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:29,619
<i>Meet me tonight</i><i>
and I'll tell you</i><i>
the whole story.</i>

1307
01:26:29,749 --> 01:26:31,795
First tell me
a little bit more.

1308
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:34,450
<i>For instance,</i><i>
their mansion in</i><i>
Connecticut--</i>

1309
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,147
<i>they've built a brick-</i><i>
and-marble enclosure</i>

1310
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:37,627
<i>for their outdoor</i><i>
swimming pool.</i>

1311
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,455
<i>It's the finest</i><i>
that money can buy,</i>

1312
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,239
<i>and it didn't</i><i>
cost them a penny.</i>

1313
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,155
They dummied up
a bunch of expenses,
a bunch of bills,

1314
01:26:44,286 --> 01:26:45,461
and sent them
to the graybar building

1315
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:47,071
and the Helmsley building
for payment.

1316
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,508
The helmsleys
personally initialed

1317
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,945
a million dollars' worth
of these fake invoices.

1318
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:53,469
And you're gonna
love this:

1319
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:57,516
Included is a $12.95
bloomingdale girdle.

1320
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:59,692
- A business expense.
- [ All laughing ]

1321
01:26:59,823 --> 01:27:02,478
She tried to fill a table
for a charity event

1322
01:27:02,608 --> 01:27:05,220
and couldn't find
one person to join them.

1323
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,134
They had to fill it
with business acquaintances.

1324

Man: <i>
If they come home</i><i>
at 3:00 in the morning,</i>

<i>I think he's had</i><i>

<i>Sometimes</i><i>
he drifts.</i>

Al, you said
you needed more proof.

<i>Well, you got it.</i><i>
Take a look at this:</i>

1342
01:27:49,176 --> 01:27:51,962
You got $250,000
worth of invoices

<i>all charged</i><i>
to the helmsleys'</i><i>

Leona!

1350
01:28:15,507 --> 01:28:17,553
The state Attorney General

that in addition
to federal charges,

1352
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:20,425
he may initiate
state charges.

1353
01:28:20,556 --> 01:28:21,992
We've done nothing wrong.

1354
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:23,863
Former employees

- of being tyrannical.
- Why don't you
print the good news?

$33 million
to New York hospital?

Or that in
the last five years,

we have paid
$340 million in taxes?

1360

That's over a quarter
of a billion dollars.

How much did you pay?

I have a search warrant
pertaining to certain records
on file here.

- Man: Harry,
I want to speak to you.
- Woman: <i>Mr. Helmsley!</i>

1364
01:28:57,636 --> 01:28:59,638
Please, please,
clear the doorway.

1365
01:28:59,769 --> 01:29:01,292
Mr. Helmsley,
you've spent a lot
of years in real estate.

1366
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:03,468
What do you consider
your greatest accomplishment?

1367
01:29:03,599 --> 01:29:05,601
I married her.

1368
01:29:09,561 --> 01:29:11,607
Woman: <i>Leona,</i><i>
Harry, just a few more</i><i>
questions, please!</i>

1369
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:12,782
<i>Just a few</i><i>
more minutes</i><i>
of your time.</i>

He's been found
incompetent to stand trial

1371
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:20,355
because of the strokes,
memory loss.

1372
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:25,664
Well, then I'll have
to face it alone.

1373
01:29:25,795 --> 01:29:27,405
That's right.

1374
01:29:57,783 --> 01:29:59,655
Up to now,

1375
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:05,443
we haven't had
to face anything alone,
have we, Harry?

1376
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:15,061
Sometimes you were
such a boy.

1377
01:30:18,717 --> 01:30:21,067
I had to straighten
your tie.

1378
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:25,507
I had to smooth
your hair.

1379
01:30:26,682 --> 01:30:28,727
You would get
so impatient with me.

1380
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:35,560
Right from that
very first dance,

1381
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:41,566
we were perfect partners,
weren't we, Harry?

1382
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:49,444
Oh, how we danced.

Man: <i>
Leona.</i>

1384
01:31:25,392 --> 01:31:27,133
<i>Leona.</i>

1385
01:31:30,093 --> 01:31:33,488
<i>Leona, we're due in court</i><i>
for the verdict.</i>

1386
01:31:35,446 --> 01:31:37,535
I'll be right there.

1387
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:10,568
Are you
all right?

1388
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,529
Wait till they see
this performance.
