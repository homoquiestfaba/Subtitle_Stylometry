Damn it!

00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,520
He's probably faster
than Carl Lewis

7
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,924
He's definitely faster
than Carl Lewis

8
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm a Korean detective

9
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,435
I always chase them

10
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,838
But there's nowhere for them to hide

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,907
No matter how fast they run,
they can't run away

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,741
Our country is surrounded by the sea

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,284
There's a huge army in Norhh Korea

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,113
There's nowhere to hide

- What are you doing tonight?
- I have an appointment

18
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,446
Hey, I know you're lying.
How about a drink tonight?

19
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,643
- It's my mother's birhhday
- Really?

20
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,289
Hey Cheol-gu!
How about a drink?

21
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,650
We're starhing the Victoria
investigation today

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,125
Young-man, what about you?

23
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,024
I'm going with him

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,467
Aren't you going home?

25
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,503
Myung-hwan, how about a drink?

26
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,732
It's my wedding anniversary

27
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,430

31
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,523
It's no use being nice
to those assholes

32
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,253
I should've worked them to the bone

- No, sir

35

- Ki-choon?
- Sorry, Mr. OH

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,264
Eleven of us are going in,
including Myung and Gahp

37
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,465
Are you making a soccer team?
You're not in charge now

38
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,007
I forced the youngsters to do it.
Forgive them

39
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,908
You forgot the magic word,
"Please"

40
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,309
Lieutenant! I'm going home

41
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,147
Where are you going?

42
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,745
I'm backing up Team 1 today

43
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,051
I see

44
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,217
- Young-dahl, are you ready?
- Go ahead

45
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,124
Hurry up

46
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
- Jay, lock them up
- Yes

47
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,661
Are you going somewhere too?

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,204
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,103
A new investigation starhs today

50
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,697
I understand

51
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,910
I've got a little time
for just one drink

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,604
Just forget it

53
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,779
Hey, c'mon

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,119
Hey!

55
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,218
This one looks expensive

56
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,991
It's just a restaurant.
Let's go in

57
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,629
Why is it so dark?
Turn on the lights

58
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,598
Happy birhhday!

59
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,541
They are lovely

60
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,638
It's so nice to get flowers

61
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,148
I owe your wife.
Say thanks to her

62
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,412
Don't mention it.
They are all over my house

63
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,284
What is this?

64
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,856
Open it. You'll like it

65
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,653
- Bremen...
- They're Bremens

66
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,165
Made in Germany.
Swedish Raybeks were the best,

67
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,226
but now Bremens are better

68
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,603
Criminals like them because
they're light and comforhable

69
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,676
Right.
These old ones were too heavy

70
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,142
Why can't we make them like these?

71
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,045
They're just for criminals anyway

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,644
Ours are nice, too.
They are just heavy and loose

73
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,814
- Remember Snakehead?
- Yeah

74
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,257
One day I was writing a reporh
He says "Lieutenant" and

75
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,891
he looks at me and his wrists

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,033
And I noticed that
the cuffs were loose

77
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,469
I said, "What the hell"
and he put them back on himself

78
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,443
I searched the entire market for them

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,014
- Whose idea was it?
- Jay-soo's

80
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,777
Thanks boy

81
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,081
Lieutenant, why don't you try them on?

82
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,911
Okay

83
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,519
They're very light

84
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,124
I can't feel any weight

85
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,288
A toast for the lieutenant

86
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,562
- For Lieutenant Biannual!
- Cheers!

87
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,071
What is it?

88
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,378
I left it in the office

89
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,715
Don't be kidding

90
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,887
I'm not kidding

91
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,747
Hurry and go get it
before you drive him mad

92
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,489
Ok! Ok! Bastards

93
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,528
Everything is on me tonight.
The drinks, the karaoke, everything

94
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,356
Satisfied?

95
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:28,779
When you truly love someone

96
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:34,151
a million roses will bloom

97
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:39,088
Without hatred, just love freely

98
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,387
They buried him with a shovel

99
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,759
When's he going to stop?

100
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,353
I am sick of this song

101
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,456
When he sings it a million times

102
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,764
then the farmer ran for office!

103
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,475
A long life to you!

104
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,040
Who are they?

105
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,514
- Looks like a new gang
- Those rats...

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,249
Detective OH!

107
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,649
8 months ago, on March 5th at 2 am,

108
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,990
you shot twice at
the drug dealer suspect Hong

109
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,694
He accused you of using
excessive force. You know that, right?

110
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,494
Use of Force Rule clause 1,
The first shot must be a blank

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,729
Clause 2, you must warn them
to give up at least 3 times

112
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,398
If you shoot, you must shoot
the lower parh of the body

113
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,176
Did you follow the regulations?

114
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,442
How can I tell someone
in a car to give up

115
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,515
and shoot the legs?

116
00:08:55,735 --> 00:09:00,229
He was only 10 meters
away from you

117
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,840
10 meters or 100 meters,
What's so imporhant about it?

118
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,807
It's imporhant

119
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,973
He was only 10 meters away from you.
How could you shoot him in the back?

120
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,017
We had to catch him

121
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,017
That's a use of excessive force

122
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,839
Stop the bull shit!

123
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:52,085
He would sell drugs
even in a wheelchair

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,021
You were suspended for a month

125
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,497
in 1995 for the same reason

126
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,759
It was 25 days

127
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,403
That's it for today

128
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,078
Do you know that Korean Police work
more than 168 hours a month?

129
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,785
Quit if you are tired

130
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:30,259
We work 15 nights a month,
but they only pay for 75 hours

131
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,729
Quit if you don't like it

132
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,497
For the last five years, out of
all government employees,

133
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,058
police officers were most likely
to die on duty

134
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,899
Quit before you die

135
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,637
You memorized all that?

136
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,473
- Of course
- Why?

137
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,239
It makes me look cool

138
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,333
Excuse me. I'm doing random checks.
Your lD please?

139
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,475
KANG Nana 760624-2235013

140
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,313
58-2 Sinsa-dong Kangnam Seoul

141
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,584
Thank you for your cooperation

142
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,996
Find anything?

143
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,199
Looks like they killed her for money

144
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,738
- What's that?
- It's the CCCV tape

145
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,585
Did you contact her family?

146
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,019
Not yet

147
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,922
Then how are we going to
do the autopsy?

148
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,120
Who's going?

149
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,435
Chil-sun, stop by tomorrow morning

150
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,536
Um, l...

151
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,106
Is there a problem?

152
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,773
I'll go

153
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,907
Good

154
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,419
What are we going to tell them?

155
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,160
I feel like a confessing criminal

156
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,195
I have several things to ask you

157
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,793
Did you get any strange calls?

158
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,003
Any visitors?

159
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,847
No

160
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,881
I feel very...

161
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,966
Fucking killers...

162
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,602
She had a blow on the head.
No cuts or incisive wounds

163
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,841
The wound isn't sharp,

164
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,744
and the weapon could've been
a blunt metal object or bat

165
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,477
Right now, this tape is all we have

166
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,318
We can't tell anything except
that there were four of them

167
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,021
HAN Tae-jung, age 40,
a money exchanger in the black market

168
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,124
Her husband died 4 years ago.
She lived with her mother and two children.

169
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,695
had about 2 million Won
and 2,000 US Dollars with her

170
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,272
It doesn't seem like
any kind of revenge

171
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,066
I see

172
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,178
Then, there's a high possibility
that it was just for the money

173
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,842
Criminal Team 3 take this case.
You had the best results last year

174
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,578
during the intensive enforcement period

175
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,087
That's it

176
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,082
Which do you hate most?
Rape or murder?

177
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,287
Murder

178
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,887
Me too.
Imagine yourself as a victim

179
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,666
Dying of no reason
all of a sudden

180
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,965
Fucking lunatics

181
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,301
At least robbers tell you to freeze.
These lunatics just kill

182
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,541
If someone strikes the back
of your head and runs away,

183
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,875
which way will he run?
The palace, City Hall,

184
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,210
the Arch or downtown?

185
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,517
- Myung-hwan, tell me
- Yeah?

186
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,819
- City Hall
- Downtown Downtown

187
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,861
But, how can you know?

188
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,886
Who knows where he'll go?

189
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,990
I wonder if the arrest rate is real

190
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,601
Cut it out

191
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,629
We don't need to spoil
the beer before we open it

192
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,737
What's going on?
Put that out!

193
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,140
Jay-soo, give me the names of
the subway stations in Seoul

194
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,108
Apgujung, Sinsa, Jamwon,
Cheongdam, Nonhyun, Hakdong...

195
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,179
- Bus stops
- Yeah?

196
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,116
Can you count them all?

197
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,780
You can't!

198
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,884
What are you going to do?

199
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,658
Young-dahl!

200
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,730
Arrest all the gangs in the area
and torhure them until

201
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,924
- we get something
- Correct!

202
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,194
Patrol and patrol, work and work
and arrest anyone suspicious!

203
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,865
Reporh to me at 5 am.
Every morning

204
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,439
Chli-sun, what does that mean?

205
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,505
It means we can't go home

206
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,179
Over

207
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,641
You look awesome!

208
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,347
Mr. OH I work hard now

209
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,352
Hard?

210
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,756
You seem to be making easy money

211
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,624
Where's Sang-taek?

212
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,596
I haven't seen him for a while

213
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,204
You, you and you.
The three of you!

214
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,067
Be at the office with Sang-taek by 2

215
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,510
I really don't know, detective OH

216
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,114
Do you think I do?

217
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,581
- 2 o'clock. Ok?
- Yes, sir

218
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,192
You're pathetic

219
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,665
Cover up!

220
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,899
What's wrong with your hand?

221
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,303
- Got hurh
- When?

222
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,034
- A few days ago
- Where?

223
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,337
- At a nightclub, sir
- How?

224
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,434
Opening a beer

225
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,206
Not opening someone's
head with that beer?

226
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,477
What? I'm a lefty.
This is my right hand

227
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,917
Horsenose and Hoon were there too

228
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,147
You can ask them

229
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,021
Then come to the office with
Horsenose and Hoon by 2 tomorrow

230
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,615
Yes, sir

231
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,316
Lie down

232
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,763
Myong-hwan!

233
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,689
What's up?

234
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,725
- Got anything new?
- Not yet

235
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,463
What about Chil-sun?

236
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,609
You ask me

237
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,807
Let's go. Catch you later

238
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,643
Take care

239
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,750
- I like you and you know that, right?
- Thanks

240
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,448
But sometimes you drive me nuts

241
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,553
What was Chil doing last month
during the intensive enforcement period

242
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,425
when we were risking our lives?

243
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,261
He arrested teenagers
fighting around schools

244
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,304
and tricked them into handcuffs
with pizzas

245
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,602
Only 16 or 17 years old!

246
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,110
I am not a teacher or a minister,
but it ain't right

247
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,612
You should talk to him!

248
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,704
Why do you always shut up
when it's about Chil!

249
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,146
Jay-soo...

250
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,716
I like you too

251
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,369
What brings you here detective

252
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,269
Don't worry

253
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,802
Take care, detective

254
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,915
That's mine

255
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,010
Treat others' things like yours,
you asshole!

256
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,054
How much do you get for these?

257
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,256
I pick them for 10,000 and
pass them on for 30,000

258
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,885
30,000? You said 15,000!

259
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,226
- I knew you were cheating
- Behave, you shitheads

260
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,291
Hurry and get in 1,2,3

261
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,464
Can't you get a bigger car?

262
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,106
From 8pm 23rd to 4am 24th

263
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:55,550
Write down everything
you did In detail

264
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,890
Where you ate and
when you shit. Everything!

265
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,819
If you fool around, you know
what'll happen. Do it now!

266
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,795
What are you looking at, asshole?

267
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,063
Sit straight! Where do you live?

268
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,431
Chamsil, sir

269
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,271
What does your father do?

270
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,340
Owns a gas station

271
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,311
Then you must be well off

272
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,313
Why the hell is a rich kid
doing such a thing!

273
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,316
What's his phone number?

274
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,655
- His phone's not working
- Not working?

275
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,992
- Don't you dare give me bullshit!
- Can I talk for a second?

276
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,228
Why? I'm busy

277
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,386
- Look after him
- Yes, sir

278
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,970
Is this your home?

279
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:59,009
What are you doing with a kid when
we are fucking after a murder case?

280
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,212
He had a knife.
You know that kind of kids

281
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:07,450
He was prying coins from
videogames They're on my desk

282
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,755
I used to have that kind of knife
at school, too

283
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:12,021
You can let him go with a warning

284
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,394
You don't know what you're saying

285
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,229
Those bastards turn into pickpockets,
robbers and killers

286
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:17,901
You got to nip out the bud

287
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,903
Not nurhuring it?

288
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,698
- What do you mean?
- So you will send him to prison?

289
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,176
Perhaps you can recommend
a lawyer to his parents

290
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,782
You son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me like that

291
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,647
Right. I want the kickback
from the lawyer

292
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,278
Jay-soo, go in

293
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,983
I'm not working with that dirty cop

294
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,889
Son of a bitch

295
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,759
Do I have to work with disrespect?

296
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,423
Calm down.
What's wrong with you two?

297
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,968
You mean I'm wrong?

298
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,198
This is an emergency.
Jay-soo wasn't totally wrong

299
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,639
- Hey!
- Do you have a light?

300
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,377
There was a murder in the jurisdiction

301
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,840
This is a house of death

302
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:10,414
Who fights in a mourner's house?

303
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,886
After washing all the socks...

304
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,388
of those senior detectives,
and it's not turning out like

305
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,588
you thought it would?

306
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:24,597
Don't act like kids
after 10 years of experience

307
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,031
stubborn fools

308
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,886
Sook, where's my underwear?

309
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,716
Right corner of the bottom drawer

310
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,918
He's not the detective type

311
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,051
Why not?

312
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,295
What kind of a detective changes
his underwear everyday?

313
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,059
Right. Some don't change it
until the case is solved

314
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,095
Of course.
That's how it should be

315
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:14,481
The inspectors came by
They were very inquisitive

316
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,420
They even had the cerhification of
your family's land

317
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,490
So what did you tell them?

318
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:25,357
I almost said that
you're running to be buried,

319
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,528
not to get money

320
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,566
Just quit that job

321
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,727
Detectives who can't shoot.
What good are they?

322
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,397
Quit and water flowers?

323
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,904
Or you can run a karaoke

324
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,342
and sing A Million Roses
over and over

325
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,741
Enough. Let's go

326
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,406
Good night

327
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,041
The phone's ringing

328
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,686
Flower shop!

329
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,353
I'll burn your fucking roses bitch!

330
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:01,228
I'll shave your head and
shove it down the fucking drain

331
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,391
Your husband ruined me by
sending me to that fucking prison!

332
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,402
Where's your fucking husband?

333
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:20,181
Who told you to hang up bitch!
Do that again

334
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:25,689
and I'll fry you,
your husband and your baby!

335
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,859
You still don't get me bitch?

336
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,867
Why don't you call up his mobile?

337
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:41,167
It's 016-285-1605

338
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,536
You fucking

339
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,301
Son of a bitch

340
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,178
Why didn't you hit him, damn it!

341
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,543
- A car was passing
- Why did you hesitate?

342
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,208
- They could've seen me
- You should've hit him earlier

343
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:28,114
- Damn it!
- Stupid fucking loser

344
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,153
- Fucking moron
- Motherfucker!

345
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,189
You asshole!

346
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,490
Fucking hell!

347
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,563
Damn it, you think you can

348
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,065
just kick me out like that?

349
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:47,332
Drive in hell forever, motherfucker!

350
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:50,502
She's something

351
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,509
You like her?

352
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,168
Come on

353
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,275
Motherfucker! Get off me!

354
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,350
Let me go

355
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,486
Get off me! You assholes!

356
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,627
Help him

357
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,929
Hey, put that away

358
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,568
- What's that?
- Hold on

359
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,472
We'll send you to paradise

360
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,044
Stop it!

361
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,380
I'll do it! Stop!

362
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,179
Get that thing off me. Do it

363
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,756
Now you're talking

364
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,219
Motherfuckers! Go ahead

365
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,669
You motherfuckers!

366
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:00,139
Say something!

367
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:04,142
I was raped on a main street!

368
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,847
Not one but by four, damn it

369
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,115
The patrol car drove right by!
Are you cops blind?

370
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:15,156
I wouldn't have come here if
I was raped in a back street!

371
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:21,356
I won't put up with this

372
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,991
I'll sue the Korean government

373
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,005
And reporh this to the
Women's Association!

374
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:31,768
Bargirls can be raped on the street?

375
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,208
Who is in charge!
Where's the chief?

376
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,514
Please calm down

377
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,612
- Are you the chief?
- I'm a lieutenant

378
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:50,050
I don't want any lieutenants!
Where's the fucking chief?

379
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,108
Did they threaten you with a knife?

380
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,444
No

381
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,342
Any weapons?

382
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:15,376
Oh, they put a metal ball in my back
and almost crushed me

383
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,023
Let me see

384
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,661
I don't know

385
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,002
They all look the same.
It's damn confusing

386
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,406
Have a good look.
Only eyes are left now

387
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,918
What does the lD Team say?

388
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,286
It could be a metal ball given
the shape of the wound

389
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,920
- Really?
- Yes

390
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,153
Please take a closer look

391
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,294
She has such a temper

392
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,172
- Biannual had a very hard time
- Yeah, right

393
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,634
Who gave him that nickname?

394
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,774
Do you know?

395
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,074
His wife, when she was pissed off

396
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,253
Why?

397
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,822
He used to be number 1 in arrest rate

398
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,893
He'd catch one on his way to work
and two on the way back

399
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,021
Guess how many days he went home?
He lived in the office

400
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,190
Ah! He went home biannually

401
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,825
Use your brain!
He does her biannually

402
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,603
There must be a million in that bag

403
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:18,401
Look at that expensive watch.
He must be going to the dawn market

404
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,698
Oh my! Fucking old hobo

405
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,434
Let's go

406
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:24,668
Murders and thefts have occurred

407
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:30,340
in the downtown area

408
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,214
Yesterday at 5 am, a man in 70's

409
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,152
was found dead with
a wound in the head

410
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:39,654
The police are looking for witnesses,

411
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,557
and yet are investigating
the area for clues

412
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,857
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What?

413
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,661
This old man

414
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:52,365
If we had walked out from
that store 5 minutes later,

415
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,598
he wouldn't have died.
Damn it!

416
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,536
Where are you going?

417
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,010
Thieves will catch thieves

418
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,486
Come out, Teddy Bear!

419
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,327
Come on out, Teddy Bear!

420
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,762
Aren't you gonna come out,
Teddy Bear?

421
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,101
Gosh! It's being torn!

422
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,068
Hurry up. Teddy Bear

423
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,008
My brother's ruining your tables!

424
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,675
God damn it

425
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,310
Anything wrong?

426
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,513
Not at all. Please continue

427
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,110
You have good cards

428
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,020
I'll kill the Bulldozer...

429
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,294
Forgive me for not stopping by
for a while

430
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,955
Hey, the fabric's too soft

431
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,829
- Hi, Teddy Bear
- How are you, sir?

432
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,399
You look good

433
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,201
A small world is better
than the big cell, isn't it?

434
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,640
Of course, sir

435
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,273
- Where's Sang-chun?
- Sang-chun?

436
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,578
- I haven't seen him
- Really?

437
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,650
I heard you live off of dirty money

438
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,553
It's all I can do to feed myself, sir

439
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,749
Who gave you the money for
the gambling house

440
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,393
Fucking Sang-chun did, bastard
Where is he?

441
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,159
- I don't know
- Really?

442
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,102
You don't know?

443
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:43,106
I can find out through other sources

444
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,010
After wiping out this
place with the bulldozer?

445
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:50,211
Should l?

446
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,014
I will if you want

447
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,317
He'll kill me if he finds out

448
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,996
Who's Sang-chun?

449
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,362
You know the Elegance Gang party?

450
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,566
Hairhail, Flatfish, and that
bar owner Sausage?

451
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,804
- He's their boss
- Fucker of the fuckers

452
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,608
A king fucker

453
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:23,175
Sang-chun! Where are you?

454
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,984
- Who is Sang-chun?
- Your boss

455
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,217
There's no one here by that name

456
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,282
Excuse me, sir!

457
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:35,898
What's Sang-chun doing?

458
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,427
- Sang-chun, where are you?
- Shut the door!

459
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,006
What's Sang-chun doing?

460
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,103
Boss, look!

461
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,743
Oh dear

462
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,353
How can 2 devils appear
in this decent place at once!

463
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,790
I'll take care of them

464
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,860
No, they're not the corrupt kind

465
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,156
Don't make us go crazy

466
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,459
Where is he?

467
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,902
Who the fuck are you?
Who's talking so loud?

468
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:17,598
You look like a weasel,
just like your boss

469
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,800
- Shut up you motherfucker!
- You asshole!

470
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,746
Who are you?

471
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,879
Police

472
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,655
Don't kill all my boys

473
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,623
I won't hold back today!

474
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,702
Detectives!

475
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,937
How've you been, gentlemen?

476
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,204
You look marvelous!
This way, please

477
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,377
What are you doing?
Hurry and let them in!

478
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,016
They're new here.
Please forgive their rudeness

479
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,052
Please come inside

480
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,315
Please

481
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,889
What are you doing?

482
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:11,086
Go back to work!

483
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,390
Left turn, gentlemen

484
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,841
Hanna! Bring us the
sweet turhle blood

485
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,500
OK Ok OK

486
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:29,537
This is how I live

487
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:31,546
Anyway, what brings you here sir?

488
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,583
From now on, don't talk or ask

489
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,946
Why not, sir?

490
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:38,419
It's very disturbing.
Just answer my questions

491
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:44,155
You know that there'd been
two serial murders, right?

492
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,421
You can speak when I ask

493
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,432
I didn't know.
When did that happen?

494
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,164
I've no idea who they are
but they must be

495
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:55,466
Stop!

496
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,072
You are a legend among muggers.
You are a king to them

497
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,376
It doesn't make sense that
the king doesn't know anything

498
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:06,241
Gather your boys by tomorrow

499
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,642
I can't.
They'll starve to death!

500
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,820
You can't?

501
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,185
Giant Hotel lobby, restaurant row

502
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,559
Holy Nightclub.
Your muggers did all those

503
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,628
Excuse me, sir!
What are you saying?

504
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,235
They're not muggers. They just
took wallets from some drunks

505
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,899
They're just pickpockets

506
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,135
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

507
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,677
Those happened ages ago

508
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,474
There are tons of crimes to lock
you up. Want me to count'em?

509
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,977
That's enough

510
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,917
Call everyone. Hairhail, Flatfish,
Teddy Bear and Sausage

511
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,521
Everyone. No exceptions!

512
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:47,851
Sure, I get you

513
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,688
Enjoy the drinks
