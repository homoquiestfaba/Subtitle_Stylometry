Gio.

7
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,128
Come on, come on.

8
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:28,995
[Gio] No!

9
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:29,863
Baby.

10
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:30,565
[Gio] I don't wanna go!

11
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:31,198
Listen, listen, listen to me.

12
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,001
Come on, come on, come on.

It's okay, honey, it's okay.

Listen to my voice, baby.

[dramatic music]

27
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:55,748
[Lawyer] When was the
first time you were contacted

28
00:02:55,782 --> 00:02:57,651
by this inspector?

29
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,787
A bout a year ago, I think?

30
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,324
I was at work when I got a call
from HR

31
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:08,361
asking why there was a man by
the name of Inspector Davis

32
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,699
attempting to confirm
my address of employment

33
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,134
so that he could serve me
judgment papers.

34
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,303
For the next four months,

35
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:21,141
he continued to call my
job, blow up my cell phone,

36
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,810
threaten to have me arrested.

37
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:26,346
He harassed my daughter
in Memphis, my ex-husband,

38
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,816
telling them that I was a
deadbeat.

39
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:32,385
I lost weight, I couldn't
eat, I couldn't sleep,

40
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,322
I almost lost my job.

41
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:39,193
All of this for a 10 year old
debt.

42
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,662
For $453 and 12 cents.

43
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,335
Your witness, Counselor.

44
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,770
Ms. Reynolds, out of
curiosity,

45
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,939
how did you trace this Inspector
Davis

46
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:54,308
as an employee of my client?

47
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,010
I Googled the number
that kept showing up

48
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,846
on my caller ID,

49
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,313
that led to a consumer's forum

50
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,282
where there were plenty of other
people

51
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:04,317
receiving similar calls.

52
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,820
I traced that to AMG
Receivables.

53
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:15,028
Do you have any real proof,
recordings of conversations?

54
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:15,730
Well, no.

55
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,632
Verified witness statements?

56
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:20,367
Was that a no?

57
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,500
No.

58
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:22,569
Surely your phone bill
will show proof of the calls.

59
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,171
Did you bring a copy of
that bill with you today?

60
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,741
I'm no longer with that phone
company.

61
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:28,809
[Michael] 'Cause you
didn't pay your bill.

62
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,144
[Lawyer] Objection.

63
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,679
Overruled!

64
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,312
[Reynolds] I was a
few months behind, yes.

65
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:36,750
In fact, other than the phone
bill

66
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,117
and this medical debt in
question,

67
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:40,319
you've got quite a few
derogatory marks

68
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,788
on your credit for failure to
pay.

69
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:42,790
Isn't that correct?

70
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:44,724
Correct.

71
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,427
[Michael] Three
repossessions, an eviction,

72
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,097
four credit cards currently
120 days past due.

73
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,766
I've fallen on hard times.

74
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,834
So hard that you're now suing
my client

75
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,069
for thousands of dollars

76
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:59,273
for allegedly collecting on
a debt that you lawfully owe.

77
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,108
How is that any different from
extortion?

78
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:01,975
Objection!

79
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:02,942
Come on, Mike, please.

80
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,079
[Michael] Withdrawn.

81
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:07,882

82
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:16,956

[men chattering]

84
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,313
[Brandon] To another outright
dismissal,

85
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,449
what is that, four in a row,
Michael?

86
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,384
This one's a little
too close for comfort

87
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,554
thanks to Inspector Davis over
there.

88
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,521
Eat a bag of dicks.

89
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,423
Oh, I'm sorry, you must have
me confused

90
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,259
with your old cellmate.

91
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,125
[glass breaks]

92
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,026
What the fuck?

93
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:31,865
You motherfuckers need to start
taking this shit seriously.

94
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,967
There's no way you can
operate a business like this

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,834
on the defense.

96
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,469
Yeah, says the Jew.

97
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,305
I can't with this guy,
Brandon.

98
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:41,242
This guy is the driving
force behind AMG, Michael.

99
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,944
The type of paper we collect,

100
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:45,978
we're good at what we do

101
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,581
because we use alternative
methods of recovery.

102
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:49,983
Ever buying Saver Paper?

103
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:51,852
Where the fuck is the fun in
that?

104
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,422
Look, I'm just trying to
protect what you've built.

105
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:58,091
The reality is, the climate's
changed.

106
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:02,896
The FTC, CFPB, FCC,
they've all caught wind

107
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:03,963
of what's going on.

108
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:07,234
17 operations have gone
down in the past 6 months.

109
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,269
The number of FDCPA lawsuits
like this one

110
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:10,437
tripled last year.

111
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,872
It's a different animal.

112
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:14,274
Fine, I tried.

113
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,079
What is this?

114
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:20,180
It's porn.

115
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,216
Just that trainee shit that he's
into.

116
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,284
Close, it's actually my bill.

117
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:27,321
Your E&O declined the insurance
claim on this lawsuit,

118
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:29,389
now you have to pay me directly.

119
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:32,025
So, do you want to cut me a
check now,

120
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,026
or send me a wire-

121
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:33,894
- Fucker.

122
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:34,595
All right.

123
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:36,930
- Come on, come on.
- Want me to cut you a check?

124
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:38,632
I'll cut you a fucking check
right now.

125
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:39,499
You piece of shit!

126
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,433
Come on, come on.

127
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,470
Get your fucking
wombat under control or-

128
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,004
- Hey, go fuck yourself!

129
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,439
I mean it!

130
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:47,441
[cell phone rings]

131
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,543
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

132
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,044
Sit down.

133
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:51,946
God.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,615
Your blood pressure must be sky
high.

135
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,582
You take your pill today?

136
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:56,516
[Ross] I'm good.

137
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:58,384
Here.

138
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:05,992
You remember in sophomore year

139
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,096
when you dropped like a
sack of shit, speech final?

140
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,631
Hm?

141
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,331
Well, fuckin' Tommy Slate's
mom

142
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,334
was the nurse that day.

143
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,069
Yeah, I was looking for an
excuse

144
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,371
to bask in those titties
for a few hours, you know?

145
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:19,505
[Brandon chuckles]

146
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,574
She did have a great pair of
tits.

147
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,609
Oh, God, did she.

148
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,543
Fake.

149
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:24,444
Stop!

150
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:25,411
You could never tell the
difference.

151
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:27,480
I mean, I was always more of
an ass man.

152
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:28,548
Mm.

153
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,251
Clearly you never discriminated.

154
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,019
Missy Novak?

155
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,254
Dude, I mean her chin looked
like

156
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:36,322
two fuckin' testicles

157
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,691
hanging from her lower lip.

158
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,959
Right?

159
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,927
[Brandon laughs]

160
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,495
She had a dick face, bro, you
know it.

161
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,596
Yeah, but great ass.

162
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:44,498
Great ass.

163
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,531
Dick face, bro.

164
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,570
[Brandon chuckles]

165
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,507
You think maybe the Jew could
be on to something here?

166
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,544
[Brandon] What do you mean?

167
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,579
Paper quality.

168
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,383
I'm just saying, I think
that maybe we should

169
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,484
keep our options open here.

170
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,219
We got a stack of bullshit
lawsuits

171
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,386
sitting on your desk right now

172
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,555
that we gotta pay outta pocket
to defend.

173
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,159
So, maybe it can't hurt to
diversify

174
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,259
the portfolio a bit.

175
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,226
You're joking, right?

176
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,528
No.

177
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:18,565
Look, we buy some repo
packages from Chase Auto,

178
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,433
we collect on the deficiency
balance.

179
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,434
We run some hard pulls.

180
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,301
Hell, if that doesn't work,

181
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,236
we file an action to collect,
right?

182
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,605
It's all legit.

183
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:28,108
You know, we're good at what

00:32:13,872 --> 00:32:14,706
just not possible right now.

545
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,076
I could take a card over the
phone.

546
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:18,943
[Woman] I'm sorry, I
got no job right now,

547
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,012
I just can't do it.

548
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:21,714
I need a commitment from
you on this bill, sir.

549
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:22,848
I'm a female.

550
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,050
You just called me sir, ma'am.

551
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,752
Or I'm gonna have to mark your
file

552
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:27,986
as a refusal to pay.

553
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,520
I don't give a damn what you
do,

554
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:30,956
just don't call here anymore.

555
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,601
Hey!

556
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:43,469
Wait, wait, wait!

557
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,369
Hey, wait, wait!

558
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,842
Fuckin' shit!

559
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,376
Tu madre!

560
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,077
Pendejo!

561
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:56,682
Fucking shit!

562
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:01,619
Fuck!

563
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:02,820
I'm only 10 days behind,

564
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,623
and I spoke to somebody
over there last week

565
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:06,392
telling them that I'd be a
little late.

566
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:07,859
I've made arrangements to pay

567
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,495
and you still take my car?

568
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:13,030
No, I understand that
it's not the first time,

569
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:13,999
but look, I am trying,

570
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,967
I'm doing my best.

571
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,903
I just need my car back, okay?

572
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,071
Hello?

573
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:22,740
Fuck!

574
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:23,641
Come on.

575
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,080
[seductive dance music]

576
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:40,558
[cell phone rings]

577
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:46,932
Hey.

578
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:47,798
[Ross] All right, so
halfway through round one

579
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,970
you got Juanita at first, Gerald
second,

580
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,204
mixed bag for the rest.

581
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:54,506
What about the kid?

582
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:55,673
[Ross] I don't know, man.

583
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:56,708
Kid seems broken.

584
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,177
Well, put Humpty Dumpty
back together, okay?

585
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,913
[Ross] Since when do
you give a donkey's twat?

586
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,848
Just do me the solid.

587
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:05,951
Trust me, the kid's got
potential.

588
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,185
[Ross] Fine.

589
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,755
Wait, hold on, are you at
Daddy's Angels

590
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:11,190
at one in the friggin'
afternoon?

591
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:12,056
Goodbye, Ross.

592
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,459
[Ross] Wow!

593
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,997
[Brandon coughs]

594
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,735
Excuse me.

595
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:26,672
Is Svetlana working today?

596
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:27,873
[Woman] I haven't seen her.

597
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,117
Ooh, mamacita.

598
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,887
Where the hell have you been,
Edgar?

599
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,224
Mexico City for a while, jump
and all.

600
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:48,826
So you can't call, shoot me a
text?

601
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,128
I had to ditch both burners.

602
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:53,731
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

603
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:54,833
Judging from the looks of you,

604
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:57,902
I say you've been having muchas
fiestas.

605
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,137
[Edgar laughs]

606
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,739
This is funny to you?

607
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:02,040
Just relax.

608
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:09,014
What is this?

609
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:09,981
It's all I got.

610
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:11,148
Where's the rest of it?

611
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:13,117
Call it a finder's fee.

612
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,984
Wow.

613
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,721
When Mario finds out about this,
he's...

614
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:17,956
[tense music]

615
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,191
[Gio] Let go of my mom!

616
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,194
[Christina screams]

617
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:27,932
He's stuck in a cell for the
rest of his miserable life.

618
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,268
You think about that, huh?

619
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,771
Fuck that, new leadership now.

620
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:36,707
Consider yourself lucky I even
came back

621
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,043
to give you anything, you
ungrateful puta.

622
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:42,715
You really want more money, huh?

623
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,050
Maybe you and me can work out

624
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,653
another arrangement, huh?

625
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:49,121
Huh?

626
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:50,021
Yeah.

627
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,204
[dramatic music]

628
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:32,864
Baby.

629
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,301
Baby, please.

630
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:40,271
I'm out of Xanax.

631
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:43,175
You were supposed to get me a
refill.

632
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:50,716
You need help.

633
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:51,750
You wanna help me?

634
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,652
Get me my fucking meds.

635
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,656
Baby, you're sick.

636
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,759
You haven't left the house in
months.

637
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:03,061
Please, I need my wife.

638
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:07,998
Come on, when was the last time

639
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,603
that we went on a date night,
huh?

640
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,612
Oh, is that what this is
about, Bran?

641
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,347
Hm?

642
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:27,987
You wanna get laid?

643
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,088
Come on, honey.

644
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,025
You wanna get fuckin' laid?

645
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:34,092
Stop it.

646
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:34,960
Huh?

647
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:36,728
[Brandon] Come on, stop.

648
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,396
[Wife] You wanna fuck?

649
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,262
[Brandon] Stop it!

650
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:39,130
Let's fuck.

651
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:39,998
Huh?

652
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,132
Is that what you want?

653
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,135
You wanna fuck me, Brandon?

654
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:45,003
Is that what you fuckin' want?

655
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:46,038
Huh, Bran?

656
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,739
Is that what you fucking want?

657
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:49,440
You want to have another fucking
baby,

658
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:50,309
is that what you fucking want?

659
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,711
You want another fuckin' baby?

660
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:54,378
Huh?

661
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:55,880
So you can murder him too?

662
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,050
Is that what you want?

663
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,753
[Wife screams]

664
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:07,259
[dramatic music]

665
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:21,105
Wake the fuck up!

666
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,182
I've listened to most of the
tapes,

667
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:32,250
and you're well on your way

668
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:33,786
to being the first man out.

669
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:39,157
I don't know what the
hell Brandon sees in you,

670
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,094
but he's my boy.

671
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:50,001
Oh, yeah, Regina Becker.

672
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:53,371
First little cunt that exposed
you.

673
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,106
One shot deal here, cupcake.

674
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,275
Regina Becker.

675
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:58,977
[Regina] Yes, who is this?

676
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,012
Tom Ross with AMG Receivables.

677
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:02,313
Did I catch you at a bad time?

678
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:03,015
A bad time?

679
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,182
It's 7:30 on a Saturday morning,

680
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:07,152
plus I already disputed this
debt,

681
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:08,953
and I told you to stop calling
me.

682
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,122
I know my rights.

683
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,957
Actually, you asked us to
stop calling you at work,

684
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:12,924
you never mentioned your cell
phone.

685
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,193
I want you to stop
calling me in general.

686
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:16,862
All phones, just stop, okay?

687
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:17,862
Absolutely.

688
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,397
But I'm just going over
your credit report here,

689
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:22,399
and I see that you've
just applied for a refile

690
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:24,068
on your first mortgage, is that
correct?

691
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,903
[Regina] Yes, my
application's still pending.

692
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:26,904
Why?

693
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:28,206
Well, right now your
credit score is a 650,

694
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,974
which is marginal,

695
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,376
but if you force me to
report this debt to Experian

696
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,346
that's gonna drop you down to
520?

697
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,314
Wait a second.

698
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,382
Yeah.

699
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:38,849
It's highly doubtful that
a lender's gonna approve

700
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:40,918
a refile on a credit score that
low.

701
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,154
In fact, what's likely to happen

702
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:43,288
is that after your denial,

703
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,422
you're gonna lose your house.

704
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:47,057
And then your Visa card rates
will triple,

705
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,126
if they don't cancel them all
together.

706
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,795
All because you were too
stubborn

707
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:53,031
to live up to a medical
obligation.

708
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,000
Insurance was supposed to
cover it.

709
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:56,000
And that may be the case, Miss
Becker,

710
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,302
but that's between you
and Anthem Blue Cross.

711
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,038
If you would like to stay in
your home

712
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,806
for the foreseeable future,

713
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,342
how about you just give me your
debit card number right now,

714
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,110
and we can make this all go
away.

715
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:17,021
You do your homework before
you pick up the phone.

716
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:17,888
Okay?

717
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:19,224
Pull their credit reports,

718
00:40:19,257 --> 00:40:20,892
scour their social media feed.

719
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:23,228
You learn as much about
the deadbeat as you can

720
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,197
so you can expose their
Achilles' heel,

721
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,965
that's when you hit them.

722
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:28,365
You threaten to take away the
one thing

723
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:29,534
that matters most to them.

724
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,469
You close every time.

725
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:35,106

What do we know about it?

934
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:26,036
High profile mortgage debt,

935
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,005
virtually uncollectible.

936
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:29,974
We're gonna have to be
real creative on this one.

937
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:33,443
Well, you don't seem too
concerned.

938
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:35,679
At the end of the
day we 10x'd our money,

939
00:54:35,713 --> 00:54:37,081
we all made personal profit,

940
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:39,384
and we got cushion for
the next run, right?

941
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:44,054
I think they forgot the vodka.

942
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:47,924

[wistful music]

944
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:12,215
We've been partners

00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,686
Best friends for longer, right?

946
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:17,922
Yeah.

947
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:24,095
So, is there anything
you need to tell me?

948
00:55:25,394 --> 00:55:27,097
What do you have in mind,
Ross?

949
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:30,300
Oh, I don't know,

950
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:33,403
like did you have a
giant fucking brain tumor

951
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:34,471
or an organ eating amoeba,

952
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,373
or some kind of shit that
I need to know about?

953
00:55:36,405 --> 00:55:39,043
Because you haven't been
in the office for weeks,

954
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:40,211
you're not returning phone
calls,

955
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:42,179
you're not returning texts.

956
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:44,047
The timing of it really sucks a
dick

957
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,750
considering everything
that's at stake here.

958
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:48,118
Now, if Sean wasn't out
here slaying it for us,

959
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:50,954
who by the way, I taught to do
this

960
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:51,955
as a favor for you

961
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,858
while you were jerking
off in some titty bar,

962
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:55,226
but that's besides the point.

963
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:58,161
If Sean hadn't been out
there slaying it for us,

964
00:55:58,195 --> 00:56:00,798
we would've lost our
investment and its portfolio.

965
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:03,300
Right.

966
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,837
If you stop worrying
about my personal life

967
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:10,340
and start worrying
about the hotshot, then-

968
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:14,010
- Are you fucking kidding me?

972

973
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,228
Rough night?

974
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,529
It's none of your business.

975
00:56:35,298 --> 00:56:37,101
You didn't deposit the check.

976
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:38,001
Why?

977
00:56:38,802 --> 00:56:39,937
You know, maybe part of me
thought

978
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,439
that there was a chance of
a reconciliation, who knows?

979
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:44,974
Who cares?

00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,376
It's all history.

981
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:47,277
Your mother.

982
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:49,447
She's spiraling downward.

983
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:52,917
You should get in touch with
her.

984
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,086
She's your family, Sean.

985
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:59,791
No, AMG Receivables is
my family, it's my life.

You know, seeing you go to
town on that

really gives me the feels.

powered attorney, go figure.

time despite the plea.

That makes sense, given
the current profession.

existence,

door,

1036

01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,272
But he was different.

1040
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,676
I took him under my wing.

1041
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:24,748
Actually, it turned
out to be the opposite.

1042
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:27,717
Right out of the gate,

1043
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:28,852
he comes up with this idea

1044
01:02:28,885 --> 01:02:31,788
to start taking bets in high
school.

1045
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,623
You know, he crunches, I
collect,

1046
01:02:33,657 --> 01:02:36,126
it was perfect pairing.

1047
01:02:37,827 --> 01:02:41,565
Worked out well for years
too, until that night.

1048
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:48,938
Then you got out, and
the rest is history?

1049
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:50,674
And now, here you sit,

1050
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:56,713
looking to extort money out
of a drug cartel lieutenant.

1051
01:02:58,614 --> 01:02:59,549
From his wife.

1052
01:03:00,884 --> 01:03:01,885
So, why me?

1053
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:05,588
I need help.

1054
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:10,793
And from where I'm sitting,
it looks like you do too.

1055
01:03:14,264 --> 01:03:14,932
50/50?

1056
01:03:20,336 --> 01:03:21,271
All right.

Agent Frida Lando with INS.

1067
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,528
You might if I step inside?

1068
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:48,632
I did not give you
permission to enter this house.

1069
01:03:48,664 --> 01:03:51,300
My husband is on his way home.

1070
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,769
Well, I guess we'll
be waiting for a while.

1071
01:03:53,802 --> 01:03:55,471
How long was his sentence again?

Racketball court, 7 car garage.

1076
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,628
It's a hell of a property,

1077
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:20,364

Talk about life coming at
you like a fright train, huh?

01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:33,043
Yes, I once lived a glamorous
existence,

1081
01:04:33,076 --> 01:04:34,744
and now my husband is locked up,

1082
01:04:34,777 --> 01:04:37,980
our house is foreclosed
upon, and we lost everything.

1083

The American dream.

1084
01:04:41,885 --> 01:04:43,520
Are you here to rub salt on the
wound

1085
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:45,454
or does your visit serve a
purpose?

1086

I don't know if you
recall, Miss Salinas,

1087
01:04:48,425 --> 01:04:50,661
but when the DEA arrested Mario,

1088
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:54,730
your house was seized
as a matter of right.

1089
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:55,965
However, unbeknownst to us,

1090
01:04:55,998 --> 01:04:58,934
your husband had previously
refinanced his second mortgage,

1091
01:04:58,967 --> 01:05:01,971
freeing up almost 5
million dollars in cash,

1092
01:05:02,005 --> 01:05:03,907
which has seemingly disappeared.

1093
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,976
Now, in order for us to take
possession of that property,

1094
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,745
we had to pay off to lean on the
second

1095
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:10,647
in order to get free and clear
title.

1096
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,882
I'm not following.

1097
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:16,552
Essentially, you owe
us a very large debt.

1098
01:05:18,355 --> 01:05:19,456
I'm here to collect it.

1099
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:21,824
I don't know if you noticed,

1100
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:24,428
but I'm not exactly
swimming in cash right now.

1101
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:28,665
Are you a U.S. citizen, Miss
Salinas?

1102
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,637
Neither is your son, right?

1103
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,743
I do not wish to speak with
you

1104
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:40,911
or answer your questions,

1105
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:43,012
I am exercising my
constitutional right

1106
01:05:43,045 --> 01:05:44,513
under the Fifth Amendment of
the-

1107
01:05:44,547 --> 01:05:45,615
- Okay, look.

1108
01:05:45,648 --> 01:05:48,485
You may give off the
appearance of being destitute,

1109
01:05:48,518 --> 01:05:53,490
Miss Salinas, but I
happen to know for a fact

1110
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,659
that your husband transferred
a very large sum of money

1111
01:05:56,693 --> 01:05:58,095
to an account in Mexico City

1112
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:00,463
right before he went inside.

1113
01:06:00,496 --> 01:06:02,998
Now, if the U.S. government
is not in possession

1114
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:04,735
of the full four and half
million dollars

1115
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:06,103
within the next 7 days,

1116
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:07,304
I've been instructed to come
back here

1117
01:06:07,336 --> 01:06:10,673
with half a dozen ICE agents
and throw your ass in jail,

1118
01:06:10,706 --> 01:06:11,708
and deport your son to Nicara-

1119
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,976
- No, don't you dare take my
son!

1120
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,814
I'm sorry, Miss Salinas,
I have my marching orders.

1121
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:18,848
And you have a week to come up
with

1122
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:20,450
four and a half million dollars.

1123
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:21,585
No, wait, no, please.

1124
01:06:21,617 --> 01:06:23,152
I don't know anything about this
money.

1125
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:25,422
Well then, I suggest
you familiarize yourself

1126
01:06:25,454 --> 01:06:27,857
with your husband's business
affairs.

1127
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:28,759
Okay?

1128
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,862
[tense music]

1129
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:51,947
[Ross sighs]

1130
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:53,550
Well?

1131
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,451
We're in play.

1132
01:06:56,585 --> 01:06:57,453
What's next?

1133
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:00,423
Now we wait.

1134
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:09,665
[dramatic music]

1135
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,442
You lied to me.

1136
01:07:18,474 --> 01:07:20,043
Oh, come on, don't
start this shit again.

1137
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:21,911
I'm not talking about that,
Mario.

1138
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:25,882
I'm talking about all the debt.

1139
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,152
The lines of credit you
took out on our homes,

1140
01:07:30,186 --> 01:07:31,954
the back taxes you owe the IRS.

1141
01:07:31,987 --> 01:07:33,155
That's on me, you don't have
to worry.

1142
01:07:33,188 --> 01:07:34,891
No, that's on us.

1143
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:38,195
Specifically on Gio, your seed.

1144
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,695
And they want it all back.

1145
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:40,763
Who?

1146
01:07:40,797 --> 01:07:44,101
The U.S. government, the
IRS, the INS, who knows.

1147
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:47,237
All I can say is that
they paid me a visit,

1148
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:49,005
and if I don't deliver it,

1149
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:51,007
ICE is gonna come knocking down
on my door

1150
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,675
and take our son away.

1151
01:07:53,376 --> 01:07:55,644
You know what's been
happening at the border?

1152
01:07:55,677 --> 01:07:58,047
Children getting separated
from their families.

1153
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:00,115
They're getting sick, they are
dying.

1154
01:08:00,148 --> 01:08:01,550
That can happen to Gio.

1155
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:02,852
No.

1156
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:03,753
No!

1157
01:08:05,855 --> 01:08:06,690
How much?

1158
01:08:06,722 --> 01:08:07,958
4.5 million.

1159
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:11,628
They know about the accounts,
Mario.

1160
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:13,896
The money you hid from them,
from us.

1161
01:08:15,565 --> 01:08:17,501
Hey, we were supposed to be a
team.

1162
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:18,501
We're supposed to be partners.

1163
01:08:18,534 --> 01:08:20,970
It was an insurance
policy to keep you safe

1164
01:08:21,003 --> 01:08:22,171
until I got out.

1165
01:08:22,872 --> 01:08:24,140
Edgar was supposed to handle
this.

1166
01:08:24,172 --> 01:08:25,842
Until you got out?

1167
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,613
You're serving two
consecutive life sentences.

1168
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:32,249
You saw how we've been living,

1169
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:33,516
what I've been doing to myself

1170
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,051
to keep this family above water.

1171
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,019
I'm sorry, baby.

1172
01:08:37,686 --> 01:08:38,555
I'm sorry.

1173
01:08:39,622 --> 01:08:41,057
You have to make it up to me.

1174
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:45,061
Cash out that policy.

1175
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:47,564
Please.

1176
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:02,613
[tense music]

1177
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:29,699
Wake up.

1178
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:31,234
Ross.

1179
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:32,068
You know, it's not every day

1180
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,070
that your girlfriend stands you
up.

1181
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:35,904
Fuck that guy!

1182
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:38,274
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

1183
01:10:38,306 --> 01:10:39,274
Wait.

1184
01:10:39,307 --> 01:10:41,810
Just wait, just wait, just wait.

1185
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:43,880
Look, it's not a good time,
okay?

1186
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:45,281
Can we talk about this later?

1187
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:47,850
Not a good time?

1188
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:49,118
No.

1189
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:51,121
I was up all night waiting for
you.

1190
01:10:51,154 --> 01:10:52,322
Like, no drugs all night,

1191
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:53,355
you could at least text me.

1192
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:55,158
I said I was sorry.

1193
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,725
Brandon, I need you to leave.

1194
01:10:56,759 --> 01:10:58,261
What are you not saying?

1195
01:10:58,293 --> 01:11:00,896
Brandon, leave, please.

1196
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:02,831
You know, if you're in
trouble-

1197
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:03,699
- No!

1198
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:04,367
I can help you.

1199
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:05,234
Don't touch me.

1200
01:11:05,268 --> 01:11:06,302
It's a family issue, okay?

1201
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:08,372
You're not my husband, I'm
not your responsibility.

1202
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:16,112
Fuck.

1203
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:20,216
Jesus Christ.

1204
01:11:21,884 --> 01:11:22,819
He's playing us.

1205
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:25,921
It doesn't make sense.

1206
01:11:25,954 --> 01:11:27,990
I told you, he's off.

1207
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:31,961
I'm not gonna let him dick us
over.

1208
01:11:33,195 --> 01:11:36,132
[cell phone rings]

1209
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,268
Okay.

1210
01:11:40,235 --> 01:11:41,837
Agent Frida Lander.

1211
01:11:41,871 --> 01:11:43,140
[Christina] Enjoying the view?

1212
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,744
How can I help you, Miss
Salinas?

1213
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:50,180
You'll have your money by 4:30
tomorrow.

1214
01:11:50,212 --> 01:11:52,215
Until then, give us one night of
peace.

1215
01:11:52,247 --> 01:11:53,949
Okay?

1216
01:11:53,983 --> 01:11:57,688
Let's hope it's all
there, for your son's sake.

1217
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:01,692
What about Brandon?

1218
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:03,827
Fuck him.

1219
01:12:05,494 --> 01:12:06,363
He's my problem.

1220
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:10,332

[cell phone buzzes]

1222
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:07,157
[Brandon] Hey buddy, is that
you?

1223
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:08,957
Yeah, can't really talk right
now.

1224
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,359
Are you guys okay?

1225
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:11,927
I'm worried about your mom.

1226
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:12,795
Not sure.

1227
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:15,430
She's been freaking out about my
papi.

1228
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:16,532
What about him?

1229
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:19,469
Something about how he
owes someone a lot of money.

1230
01:13:21,203 --> 01:13:22,037
[Brandon] Your dad.

1231
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,139
Gio, we gotta go.

1232
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:23,972
What's his name?

1233
01:13:24,006 --> 01:13:25,809
[Christina] Gio, baby, let's
go.

1234
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:29,179
[tense music]

1235
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:02,537
Nice of you to finally show up
for work.

1236
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,506
What was the play, huh?

1237
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:05,507
I'm not following.

1238
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:07,409
Once you collected,

1239
01:15:07,443 --> 01:15:09,045
what bullshit were you gonna
spew

1240
01:15:09,078 --> 01:15:10,914
to hide that money from us?

1241
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:11,748
Kinda funny that the mark

1242
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,515
just happens to be your
girlfriend.

1243
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,355
You know, I think you need
to back down on this one.

1244
01:15:19,387 --> 01:15:21,623
Oh, I'm not gonna back down on
shit.

1245
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:23,525
Brother, it's not about the
money, okay?

1246
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:24,393
Not on this.

1247
01:15:24,426 --> 01:15:25,260
No, bullshit, it's about the
money.

1248
01:15:25,293 --> 01:15:26,962
It's always about the fuckin'
money,

1249
01:15:26,996 --> 01:15:28,398
that was our deal from the get
go.

1250
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,965
Back when we started taking
bets,

1251
01:15:29,998 --> 01:15:32,100
and muscling needs from
their daddy's allowance.

1252
01:15:32,134 --> 01:15:35,270
I sacrificed five years of
hard time for you, Brandon.

1253
01:15:35,304 --> 01:15:36,405
Five fucking years!

1254
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:37,974
And this is how you pay me back?

1255
01:15:38,006 --> 01:15:39,341
You go and get pussy-whipped.

1256
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,511
Bro, your head is so far
up her fuckin' vagina,

1257
01:15:41,543 --> 01:15:43,179
I can't even pull you out with a
rope,

1258
01:15:43,212 --> 01:15:44,314
and you're out of your damn mind

1259
01:15:44,346 --> 01:15:45,414
if you think for five seconds

1260
01:15:45,448 --> 01:15:46,983
that her kid's gonna replace
Sammy.

1261
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:47,983
Shut the fuck up!
