1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:08,008
(static buzzing)

2
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,526
(gentle ringing)

3
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,677
[Voiceover]
Scientists and dreamers.

4
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,482
They travel the world
with watchful eyes

5
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,684
and guzzled hope like water.

6
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,156
The journey's were separate,

7
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,158
but their purpose was common.

8
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,794
To map the world.

9
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,800
One begged for
money and pencils.

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,303
Another tore his
shirt to strips,

11
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,838
carefully wrapping
his shredded feet.

12
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,876
Yet another thirsty,
near starving

13
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,345
suckled the sap from plants.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,982
None had an easy road.

15
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,620
Though utterly dependent
on one another,

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,324
most found the others'
maps unsettling.

17
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,326
They denied one's perspective

18
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,696
by charting the land
incomprehensibly,

19
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,699
calling into question
one's very being.

20
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,837
Still when they met
on the lonely roads,

21
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,308
the explorers would present
one another with their maps.

22
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:25,679
Some seemed to say
so plainly, directly.

23
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:29,016
The world is like this.

24
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,387
Others were more
oblique, skating,

25
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:37,024
impressionistic, unstable.

26
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,861
They froze mere slivers
of the infinite earth

27
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,497
as it skittered by in orbit.

28
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,436
If ever these maps could
be gathered together,

29
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,974
they would comprise an
atlas of unsettling vision.

30
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,410
A final proof that truth

31
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,380
is conjecture.

32
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,116
(light music)

33
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,803
(murmuring)

34
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:01,342
(engine revving)

35
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,823
(grass shuffling)

36
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:54,755
(foreign music)

37
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:33,494
(gentle scat music)

38
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,294
(car honking)

39
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,771
(speaking in foreign language)

40
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,055
But in your minion.

41
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,989
Yes.

42
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,491
(speaking in foreign language)

43
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,193
To all travelers.

44
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,830
And to all over ground.

45
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,003
Oliver Ground.

46
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,271
Oliver Ground.

47
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:24,938
Yes.

48
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,839
Oliver Ground.

49
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,674
I drink to.

50
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,841
Truth.

51
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,243
I drink, you drink too.

52
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,378
Okay.

53
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,448
[Grey-haired man] Bravo.

54
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,203
Fuck off!

55
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,205
(speaking in foreign language)

56
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,567
(door knocking)

57
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,807
(car engine revving)

58
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,138
(joyless music)

59
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,324
(speaking in foreign language)

60
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,258
[Will] Eggs.

61
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:05,926
[Voiceover] Hmm.

62
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,560
[Will] Eggs.

63
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,629
(speaking in foreign language)

64
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay.

65
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:19,339
(speaking in foreign language)

66
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,579
Come on.

67
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,882
(speaking in foreign language)

68
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,150
I'm gonna show you.

69
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm gonna point.

70
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,492
(speaking in foreign language)

71
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,163
Do you want anything else?

72
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,899
Coffee, tea, she'll
bring bread and cheese.

73
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,835
Yeah, coffee.

74
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,302
Coffee or tea?

75
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,505
(speaking in foreign language)

76
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,845
Coffee, she understands.

77
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,747
So, you're Armenian?

78
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,418
I grew up in Yerevan.

79
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,998
You know people are going
to think you're a spy

80
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,566
with all of your maps
and photos there.

81
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,536
That's what I am.

82
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,406
You're not discreet.

83
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,917
I make maps.

84
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,523
I work for a satellite
mapping company.

85
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,960
And you're American.

86
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah.

87
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,730
Northern California.

88
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,400
Great.

89
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,278
(exhales and clears throat)

90
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,821
Shit.

91
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,428
It's okay, I can get them.

92
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,498
You don't have to do that.

93
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,879
These are great.

94
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,184
Thanks.

95
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,103
(singing in foreign language)

96
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,149
(energetic foreign music)

97
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,564
You can drop me off just here.

98
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,666
Sure, where you stay?

99
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,800
With my brother.

100
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,237
But I have a new neighbor
who just stopped travelling

101
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,673
and taking pictures.

102
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,641
So you're the spy.

103
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,946
Takes one to know one.

104
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,550
(energetic music)

105
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,182
Thanks for the
ride, it was nice.

106
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,718
You sure you don't
want me to drop you off?

107
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,852
I could take you.

108
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,089
Yeah, I'm sure.

109
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:36,956
I wanna walk.

110
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,024
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,495
You know where you're going?

112
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,265
I do, it's my job.

113
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,634
Yeah, okay, thanks.

114
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,868
Travel safe.

115
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:32,179
(gentle music)

116
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:35,995
[Gadarine] Shit.

117
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,917
(gentle violin music)

118
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,086
Mr. Shepard.

119
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,388
It's great that you come.

120
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,924
We're so glad that you make.

121
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,026
Yeah, well, thanks.

122
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,360
And how goes work?

123
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,997
It's good, it's okay,
it's getting there.

124
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,734
Good, now I like
to make toast.

125
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,338
Our work leads to big project

126
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,940
with Armenia country.

127
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,677
(murmuring)

128
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,613
Come, come here.

129
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:50,016
Will Shepard, this
is Vigram Hacharam.

130
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:50,950
Hi.

131
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,251
Hey, hello.

132
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:02,361
I was just doing toast
to Mr. Shepard project.

133
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,763
Absolutely.

134
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:07,033
May we all profit
from your work here.

135
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,001
It sounds exciting.

136
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,807
I'll drink to the land.

137
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,747
Mr. Awitsyan, Mr. Shepard,

138
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,248
this is Valaria.

139
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,449
Hi.

140
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,551
[Man with red tie]
Mr. and Mrs. Harunisyan.

141
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,820
And was it Karina?

142
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,555
Gadarine (speaks
in foreign language).

143
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,324
Yes, Gadarine is apparently

144
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,460
quite an accomplished
photographer.

145
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,329
Will Shepard.

146
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,431
Nice to meet you.

147
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,402
Mr. Shepard is working
for a company we contract

148
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,839
to make new survey
for Armenia he maps.

149
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,310
We will use for development,
security, many things.

150
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,446
Mr. Shepard also
goes to Nigaragarawa

151
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,816
so we're including it.

152
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,985
First time we do this since war.

153
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,020
Quite courageous.

154
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,521
Well, I'm not gonna
be getting that close

155
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,124
to the Eastern border,
but I hear it's beautiful

156
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,960
and I can't wait to see it.

157
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,863
We will send him
with guide, of course.

158
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,598
No, it's okay, no.

159
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,303
I work alone.

160
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,605
It's more efficient.

161
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,842
Yes, but it is
disputed territory.

162
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,144
At least the
Azerbaijani thinks so.

163
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,913
(laughing)

164
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:27,947
Excuse me.

165
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,151
What's the time (murmuring)?

166
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,556
(chuckling)

167
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,758
Small world.

168
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,929
Big world, small country.

169
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,524
(gentle music)

170
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,863
[Gadarine] It was
a good drive today.

171
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:20,833
[Will] It was.

172
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,453
Amenveres said you'll
be working in Karabakh.

173
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,622
I've been wanting
to shoot there.

174
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,940
[Will] It's pretty.

175
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,740
Yeah.

176
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,778
(gentle music)

177
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,773
[Voiceover] The life
captain travels the land

178
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,542
as points of light.

179
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,013
His voyages possess
the effortless speed

180
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,881
of planetary orbit.

181
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,753
He makes it possible
to strip into darkness

182
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,655
like slamming a door.

183
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,293
His maps are like snapshots,

184
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,729
taken in cruel flashes of light.

185
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,132
There's no room for ambiguity.

186
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:44,203
The world exists
in sharp planes.

187
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:47,339
Mountains cast no shadows.

188
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,277
Trees stand as still
as dead stones.

189
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,587
Sometimes he had with
him his daughter,

190
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,057
who looked only to the sides
and never straight ahead.

191
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,627
She missed the many
slashes of land

192
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,230
her father captured and froze.

193
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,901
At night around the fire,

194
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,904
she drew her own
maps like a tunnel.

195
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,772
Sky at the end.

196
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,741
Land down the sides.

197
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,680
To the captain, these were
mere simpleton drawings.

198
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,485
She may as well have
been screwing clouds

199
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,987
into jars.

200
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,081
[Will] Good morning.

201
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,115
Good morning.

202
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,484
One coffee.

203
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,254
(speaking in foreign language)

204
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:09,821
One, yeah.

205
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,557
(speaking in foreign language)

206
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,960
How much?

207
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,795
Hey.

208
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:50,462
Hey.

209
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,630
So rough.

210
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,831
Here we are.

211
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,400
[Gadarine] Yeah.

212
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,634
Here we are.

213
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,505
[Will] Are you on a timetable?

214
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,606
Not really.

215
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,076
I have a few places I
wanna try to look at

216
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,612
to shoot, but I
can work anywhere.

217
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,149
Well, I have an
itinerary I have to keep.

218
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,085
I have to stop a
lot, hike around,

219
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:16,388
take measurements,
it can be slow.

220
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,656
That's fine.

221
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,584
What are you doing exactly?

222
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:20,952
Huh?

223
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,269
Would you, would
you please leave that?

224
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,851
What I'm doing.

225
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:01,026
What I'm doing is
basically I'm trying

226
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,963
to pin these images

227
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,335
to the right places
on the ground,

228
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,470
over and over again.

229
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:15,807
[Gadarine] Wow.

230
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,247
That's good.

231
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,249
I mean that's the idea anyway.

232
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,129
Pin that one too.

233
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:25,311
(gentle music)

234
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,321
Am I right?

235
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,255
It's this way, Will.

236
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,327
Yeah we're,

237
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,630
we're further along
than I thought.

238
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,500
(gentle music)

239
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,221
The summer time
this was a big spot.

240
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,458
My parent's been here for years.

241
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,326
They moved after I went away.

242
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,332
You can turn here.

243
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,132
Turn here?

244
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,667
[Gadarine] Yeah.

245
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,434
Okay.

246
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:28,474
You know what, I think I
don't wanna do this anymore.

247
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,741
It doesn't feel
like the right time.

248
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:30,876
Oh come on.

249
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,979
Oh shit, stop, Will, stop!

250
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,681
What, what, what, what, what?

251
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,383
[Gadarine] My father.

252
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,618
(chuckling)

253
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:40,919
I'll drive us up.

254
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,521
No, no, no, okay.

255
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,822
No, I'll go alone.

256
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,893
I won't have to explain, okay.

257
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,697
Meet me here again in an hour.

258
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,666
Is that okay?

259
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,036
Say something.

260
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,118
A nice start.

261
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,789
(speaking in foreign language)

262
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,325
Gadarine.

263
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,344
(light guitar music)

264
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:08,560
(light guitar music)

265
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:24,509
(water flowing)

266
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:36,387
(murmuring)

267
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,820
This is gonna blow
your mind, this is us.

268
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,088
That river.

269
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,058
Okay, right there.

270
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:56,728
(murmuring)

271
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:57,796
Watch this.

272
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:59,898
One, two, ah!

273
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:00,932
Okay.

274
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:04,635
(speaking in foreign language)

275
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,374
[White-haired
man] San Francisco.

276
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:12,778
San Francisco,
this is where I live.

277
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:14,345
You know, my home,

278
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,781
you know, my city, my apartment.

279
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,348
[White-haired
man] All of them.

280
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,250
[Will] Yeah, I live
right there sometimes.

281
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,254
(speaking in foreign language)

282
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,291
Armenia.

283
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,125
Armenia.

284
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,161
(laughing)

285
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,432
Yeah.

286
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:39,905
(speaking in foreign language)

287
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:03,728
[Will] Hey, am I late?

288
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,663
No, no, no, I left early.

289
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:07,032
I saw the car.

290
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,901
Was it a good visit?

291
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:15,373
Okay, sit down, sit down.

292
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:19,444
Yeah, no, these
guys (murmuring).

293
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,748
Guys, this is my friend.

294
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,883
Vinnie Dansics.

295
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,151
Gadarine.

296
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:27,718
Could we get her a glass?

297
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,357
Are you Judas?

298
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:35,526
(chuckling)

299
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,497
(speaking in foreign language)

300
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:40,631
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,769
(speaking in foreign language)

302
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:48,106
(laughing)

303
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,942
[Will] I'll drink with her.

304
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:57,682
(speaking in foreign language)

305
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:01,552
(gentle guitar music)

306
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:53,131
Ah, okay, pull
over here, there.

307
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:49,587
Come on.

308
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,366
(sighs)

309
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:06,537
(giggles) Come on.

310
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:07,872
Whoo!

311
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:11,942
(light playful music)

312
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,332
Do you feel the
gas in the water?

313
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,466
The bourbons.

314
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,236
I feel them on my balls.

315
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:41,939
(laughing)

316
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,681
(screaming excitedly)

317
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:54,585
(light playful music)

318
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:04,262
So this is how it
all started for me.

319
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:09,334
Little hidden places like this.

320
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:10,368
Yeah.

321
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,249
(giggling)

322
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,057
Leave it off the map.

323
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,328
If you do that, we're even.

324
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,868
(light playful music)

325
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:33,237
(keyboard clicking)

326
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,745
(foreign music)

327
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,030
(rooster crowing)

328
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,371
[Gadarine] Hope this is it.

329
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:35,920
Sophia.

330
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:44,962
Sophia!

331
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,235
(door knocking)

332
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,673
(door creaking)

333
00:57:55,673 --> 00:58:00,044
(speaking in foreign language)

334
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,389
Can you get him
to get me a beer?

335
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:14,725
(chuckling)

336
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,532
[Sophia] Gadarine.

337
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:23,834
[Gadarine] Hey.

338
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,938
(speaking in foreign language)

339
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,912
(glasses clinking)

340
00:58:57,602 --> 00:59:01,471
(laughing)

341
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:11,616
(speaking in foreign language)

342
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:13,117
[Will] Okay.

343
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:14,585
You have to eat.

344
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:15,720
I have to eat.

345
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:19,023
(scat singing)

346
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,194
Vodka.

347
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,630
Drink.

348
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,764
Vodka.

349
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,773
Watch out of this stuff, okay?

350
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,308
Homemade mulberry vodka.

351
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,410
And it's killed
stronger men than you.

352
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,712
It's a good day to die.

353
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,648
(chuckling) Will!

354
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:44,782
[Man in plaid] Will.

355
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,688
(speaking in foreign language)

356
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:05,035
Will.

357
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,709
To drink, bring

358
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:16,647
and you, Gadarine,

359
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,816
will (murmuring).

360
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,892
[Will] It's okay,
that's good, tell me.

361
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:29,293
You're good.

362
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:27,451
Will.

363
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:32,522
(speaking in foreign language)

364
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,159
(glasses clinking)

365
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:46,570
(speaking in foreign language)

366
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:55,813
She wants me to
translate to you.

367
01:01:57,114 --> 01:02:00,117
She says to us,

368
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,023
to seeing me to you
for being the one

369
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,525
who brought us together
for this visit.

370
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,933
There had to be more.

371
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,734
(laughing)

372
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,969
There had to be more.

373
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,637
Yeah, but it's
hard to translate.

374
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22,106
(Will murmuring)

375
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:26,376
Okay, let's see.

376
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,680
Made the new lines on our maps

377
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,150
bring good things to this world.

378
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,321
[Will] Okay.

379
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:38,255
Will.

380
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,723
(baby crying)

381
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:43,360
(speaking in foreign language)

382
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,401
Will.

383
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:53,737
Drink.

384
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:00,777
Will.

385
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:12,857
(glasses clinking)

386
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:23,333
We.

387
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:27,371
We should have come here sooner.

388
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:33,810
Sooner, we're very happy.

389
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,045
Happy.

390
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,813
[Will] To be here with you.

391
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:45,189
Friend.

392
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:48,792
(speaking in foreign language)

393
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,495
Friend.

394
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,662
Friend.

395
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,264
(glasses clinking)

396
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:12,849
(singing in foreign language)

397
01:04:58,695 --> 01:04:59,763
Drink.

398
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:02,332
(chuckling)

399
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,167
My friend.

400
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:04,201
My friend.

401
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,710
(wind blowing)

402
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,028
Hey, where's that old guy?

403
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,066
You gotta go get that old
guy to come and point again.

404
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:38,002
(chuckling)

405
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:39,269
Go get him.

406
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:43,207
Sophia has good two kids.

407
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,244
I saw them sleeping.

408
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,578
So cute.

409
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:54,151
I mean, she and I play
together every day.

410
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:57,554
Just girls, another life.

411
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,427
So they're,

412
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:04,494
what are they?

413
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,263
They're vineyards here.

414
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,335
Pomegranate-yards.

415
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,303
They're pomegranate-yards here.

416
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,442
No, I grew up on a
pomegranate-yard.

417
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:22,746
A vineyard, a place
where they make grapes.

418
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:25,615
Good grapes made wine.

419
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,654
You didn't tell me that.

420
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,189
I didn't tell you anything.

421
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,798
Hey, wait, the grape farm.

422
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,002
My dad didn't own
it or anything.

423
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,441
He was just like
the lead grape guy.

424
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,180
They're like your
dad is the hotel guy.

425
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:01,451
He's a farmer of grapes.

426
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:07,124
Or a manager of grapes.

427
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:10,960
There are other farmers
that he worked with.

428
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,102
I had a great time
there as a kid.

429
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,071
The land.

430
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,377
I loved that place.

431
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,615
Why didn't he
tell you to stay?

432
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,362
I used to just go.

433
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,971
I wanted to see how far I
could go before getting lost.

434
01:07:56,806 --> 01:08:00,144
Real lost was the goal.

435
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,752
As a kid, I used
to walk for hours.

436
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,324
In later days.

437
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,898
I just start, you
know, pick a direction

438
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:25,202
in the morning before
it was light, just go.

439
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,376
And I used to worry them sick,

440
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,944
but they got used
to it, you know.

441
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,681
You get used to it.

442
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,052
I disappeared.

443
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:13,850
I wanted to find the
edge of the world.

444
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,624
(light beaming music)

445
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:57,227
[Voiceover] The
astronomer carries a veil

446
01:09:57,227 --> 01:10:00,063
of pure darkness.

447
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:03,933
Dawn is a disorienting
agent he says.

448
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:07,103
The stars are
there all the time.

449
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,841
He embroiders maps
on massive blankets

450
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:16,079
threaded with spiderwebs
and cocoon casings.

451
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,782
Gemstones form planets.

452
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:21,718
Satin passels are meteors.

453
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,559
He builds a dome over the turf

454
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,461
to trap the darkness,

455
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,130
marking a circle of horizon.

456
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,267
Then lashing sticks
to form a frame.

457
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,371
Over this, he carefully drapes

458
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:43,840
his heavy black blankets,

459
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,144
painstakingly pierced with
April's constellations.

460
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,517
When it rains, the stars drip

461
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:56,119
into shining puddles
on the earth.

462
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,623
The needle grows slick

463
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:02,158
and dangerous in his hand.

464
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:06,363
(light music)

465
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,116
(giggling)

466
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,671
(playfully exclaiming)

467
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,540
(speaking in foreign language)

468
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,947
[Gadarine] Good morning.

469
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:31,981
Morning.

470
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:38,054
(child blabbering)

471
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,474
[Gadarine] Want to eat?

472
01:12:58,542 --> 01:12:59,876
No.

473
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,846
(child screaming)

474
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,982
We'll just fix it,
will this make it better?

475
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,917
We'll just fix it just to
make everything better.

476
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,118
That doesn't help.

477
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,887
(chuckling)

478
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:23,399
[Gadarine] Are you
going to survive?

479
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,470
Yeah, I'll be fine.

480
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:27,737
(chuckling)

481
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:32,075
Have you ever been there?

482
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:32,976
Iran?

483
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,680
No, it's hard to get a visa.

484
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,281
It takes a long time.

485
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,652
I'd love to see that land.

486
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,789
One border at a time.

487
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,459
Let's get into Karabakh first.

488
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:03,206
(soldiers murmuring)

489
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,974
He wants the passport.

490
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,679
(speaking in foreign language)

491
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,382
Okay, I'll go get this, wait.

492
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,800
[Will] You want me
to get out of the car.

493
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:08,965
Will.

494
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:12,468
Will.

495
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:32,756
I need some money.

496
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:33,790
Now.

497
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:43,032
(Will retching)

498
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,514
(speaking in foreign language)

499
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:31,748
Will, come on.

500
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:36,185
Hey, hey!

501
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,586
Where's my maps?

502
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:45,161
(yelling in foreign language)

503
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,332
Let's go.

504
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,533
(Will murmuring)

505
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:52,335
Remember where you are, okay?

506
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,270
Get in the car and let's go.

507
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,749
(car engine revving)

508
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:53,162
(Will retching)

509
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:10,146
I warned you.

510
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,547
I'll be okay.

511
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,719
You should rest.

512
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:24,060
(gentle music)

513
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,949
(wheels squealing)

514
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:22,085
(water splashing)

515
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:25,154
(murmuring in foreign language)

516
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,034
Are you okay?

517
01:20:41,905 --> 01:20:43,039
We're okay.

518
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:49,345
[Will] Oh, shit.

519
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,713
What?

520
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:56,920
What's that sound?

521
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,315
What happened?

522
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,118
[Gadarine] Sheep.

523
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:23,472
[Will] Damn it.

524
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,678
Okay, they helped
me to find a driver.

525
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:04,680
Some local guy.

526
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,016
I don't think he speaks
English so you will have

527
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:09,352
to show him where you
want to work on the map.

528
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,590
You're gonna be fine
with that anyway.

529
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,161
I could come maybe.

530
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,929
I'll be fine on my own.

531
01:23:31,774 --> 01:23:33,509
Oh, this is probably your guy.

532
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,195
Will.

533
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,696
[Will] I'll be
back six or seven.

534
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,941
(foreign music)

535
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:17,120
[Voiceover] This
are stone crosses

536
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,856
where (murmuring).

537
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:26,495
(speaking in foreign language)

538
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:30,032
[Voiceover] And I will add
that they're very, very old.

539
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:44,680
(singing in foreign language)

540
01:25:57,019 --> 01:26:01,156
(light techno music)

541
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:07,863
(speaking in foreign language)

542
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,464
There's a girl I was with.

543
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,135
(speaking in foreign language)

544
01:27:20,135 --> 01:27:21,236
Could I borrow your pen?

545
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:21,970
Mm-hmm.

546
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,506
Yeah, okay.

547
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,809
Room 23.

548
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,614
I'm staying in room
23 with a girl.

549
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:33,015
Has she been here?

550
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:33,682
Mm-hmm.

551
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:35,651
Yeah, okay.

552
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:39,422
Okay.

553
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:43,158
(light guitar music)

554
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:13,756
(murmuring)

555
01:28:20,563 --> 01:28:22,998
It's not Arizona,
it's California.

556
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:25,233
(murmuring)

557
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:28,971
(glasses clinking)

558
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:33,141
(gentle music)

559
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:15,050
Hey.

560
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,687
Hello.

561
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:20,923
Hello.

562
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,960
Hey, hotel.

563
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,228
Hotel.

564
01:29:31,734 --> 01:29:33,602
Sir, sir.

565
01:29:35,404 --> 01:29:38,273
Excuse me, sir, sir.

566
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:39,307
Yeah.

567
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,711
Are you fucking deaf?

568
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,246
(door banging)

569
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:47,215
Hotel or hotel?

570
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:20,516
Hello.

571
01:30:23,552 --> 01:30:24,520
Hello.

572
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,430
(speaking in foreign language)

573
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,870
Okay, that's great, thanks.

574
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:49,011
Just take what I have.

575
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:56,985
Great bargaining technique.

576
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:14,436
Here.

577
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:15,771
Because on you.

578
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:19,708
Where were you?

579
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:25,881
You know I don't have
time for this shit.

580
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:29,484
Hey, what's wrong with you?

581
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,019
Where the fuck were you?

582
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:37,325
Okay, well, after you left,

583
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:40,028
I took a ride with the
tour group from the hotel.

584
01:31:40,028 --> 01:31:42,798
We ended up to this
amazing monastery.

585
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:47,736
I didn't know it was an
overnight trip, okay.

586
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:49,905
And anyways, it
was good, mostly.

587
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:51,907
And I did some good
pictures of there.

588
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,888
Okay.

589
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:08,223
What'd you want?

590
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:09,592
An apology?

591
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:12,460
I didn't knew I was
uncaring to you.

592
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,096
You blew me off
yesterday morning.

593
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:17,633
You just could of left
a message at the hotel.

594
01:32:17,633 --> 01:32:19,735
I waited.

595
01:32:19,735 --> 01:32:21,536
What the fuck are you?

596
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,805
My father?

597
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:24,306
My brother?

598
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:27,442
I mean, you couldn't handle
one little night on your own?

599
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:34,817
If I had known you
were gonna stand me up.

600
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,788
Did we had a date?

601
01:32:41,423 --> 01:32:43,058
Did you have flowers?

602
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:46,328
Jesus Christ.

603
01:32:46,328 --> 01:32:49,932
Mister I'm so independent,
just me and the land.

604
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:52,635
Did you miss your chaperone?

605
01:32:52,635 --> 01:32:54,169
I don't want a chaperone.

606
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:57,806
Good, because I don't
wanna be one or have one.

607
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:02,878
I have waited hours for you
while you hiked all over

608
01:33:02,878 --> 01:33:05,347
the place doing whatever
you want with your shit.

609
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:07,750
You never ask me permission
to keep me waiting.

610
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,418
Wrecking the car
kept me waiting.

611
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,956
And as far as the hiking
goes, that's my work.

612
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:15,123
I was working.

613
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:17,125
I work and I'm
sorry if it delayed

614
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:19,327
your little backpacking trip.

615
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:29,071
Work, work.

616
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:31,840
Making all your fabulous
measurement, huh.

617
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,876
Mapping this place so
that the politicians

618
01:33:33,876 --> 01:33:36,311
and the mafia can
come and exploit it.

619
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:37,813
Nice work.

620
01:33:37,813 --> 01:33:39,547
That's not why I'm here.

621
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:45,988
And when did you become such
a woman of the people anyway?

622
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:48,056
You don't even live here.

623
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:49,324
You know, you left.

624
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:50,759
None of this is
easy for me, okay.

625
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:53,161
Being here, traveling,
seeing family, old friends.

626
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:56,131
You don't have to
deal with any of that!

627
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:59,634
Yes, you take your
measurement, okay.

628
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,937
You record your
precious details.

629
01:34:01,937 --> 01:34:05,407
But all you ever really
do is skim the surface.

630
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:08,310
Your whole life is just a
fucking big excuse to run away.

631
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,111
[Will] And yours isn't?

632
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:10,779
No!

633
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:12,247
Not anymore.

634
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:18,520
I mean there is a lot about
your being here, your work,

635
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,389
that you never had to deal
with, because I've had to.

636
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,925
And then you disappeared.

637
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:24,426
I didn't disappear.

638
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:26,594
I came back.

639
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:28,163
I came back.

640
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,992
I'm sorry.

641
01:34:56,992 --> 01:35:00,963
(Gadarine breathing heavily)

642
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:12,507
(car engine revving)

643
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:14,863
(phone ringing)

644
01:37:18,366 --> 01:37:19,501
Hello?

645
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:30,672
What's up?

646
01:38:33,942 --> 01:38:35,110
I have to go.

647
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,426
(lips smooching)

648
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:47,615
(light guitar music)

649
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,875
(door knocking)

650
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,746
(rapid guitar music)

651
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:09,757
[Will] That's it?

652
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:11,125
[Woman] Yeah, yes.

653
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:09,884
(keyboard clicking)

654
01:44:02,136 --> 01:44:06,541
(breathing heavily)

655
01:44:34,068 --> 01:44:38,373
(gentle music)

656
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:59,754
(kettle whistling)

657
01:46:12,434 --> 01:46:16,303
(door knocking)

658
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:36,383
(door knocking)

659
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:46,293
Good morning.

660
01:47:48,362 --> 01:47:49,864
Are you Krikor?

661
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,603
(speaking in foreign language)

662
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,837
Take good care of him.

663
01:50:09,837 --> 01:50:11,906
Is he gonna pull through?

664
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:13,540
He's okay now.

665
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,543
There's a doctor
coming for tests.

666
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:20,281
But I think he'll be
back till he's old.

667
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:23,985
(murmurs) If he can
keep away from vodka.

668
01:50:26,688 --> 01:50:27,755
Can he?

669
01:50:36,831 --> 01:50:38,432
Nice that you're here.

670
01:50:41,869 --> 01:50:42,970
Come here.

671
01:51:52,907 --> 01:51:54,742
[Gadarine] So,
you're flying away.

672
01:51:59,513 --> 01:52:00,848
[Will] Maybe I shouldn't.

673
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,351
Tomorrow.

674
01:52:04,351 --> 01:52:08,189
(light violin music)

675
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:12,159
Flying

676
01:52:13,627 --> 01:52:15,362
via London.

677
01:52:16,964 --> 01:52:19,801
Those words don't
even sound like words.

678
01:52:24,138 --> 01:52:27,341
I'm being some place

679
01:52:27,341 --> 01:52:29,877
else there.

680
01:52:31,712 --> 01:52:33,414
I will be here.

681
01:52:42,523 --> 01:52:44,691
Could find a
way to keep going.

682
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:56,570
I know.

683
01:53:00,074 --> 01:53:01,208
But don't now.

684
01:53:05,046 --> 01:53:07,982
Maybe you come back,
you'll get a contract.

685
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:11,318
Find me again.

686
01:53:11,318 --> 01:53:13,320
(Will chuckles)

687
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:16,590
It's not looking likely.

688
01:53:19,861 --> 01:53:21,996
You wanna come to San Francisco?

689
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,481
You have to go.

690
01:53:51,592 --> 01:53:52,593
(lip smooches)

691
01:53:52,593 --> 01:53:55,029
But (lip smooches).

692
01:53:57,064 --> 01:53:59,166
I'm not saying goodbye.

693
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:03,404
(gentle violin music)

694
01:56:21,608 --> 01:56:25,779
(light music)

695
01:57:47,128 --> 01:57:49,296
[Voiceover] One famous month,

696
01:57:49,296 --> 01:57:51,265
the explorers gathered together

697
01:57:51,265 --> 01:57:53,667
to map the same
difficult terrain.

698
01:57:55,936 --> 01:57:59,706
Though utterly dependent
on one another to survive,

699
01:57:59,706 --> 01:58:02,676
they struggled with
the unusual proximity.

700
01:58:04,945 --> 01:58:06,813
Each evening they
made their maps

701
01:58:06,813 --> 01:58:10,151
while sitting on the
ground, backs to the fire,

702
01:58:10,151 --> 01:58:12,853
elbows crooked
over their papers.

703
01:58:14,955 --> 01:58:19,059
The flames shrunk in the
cruel lands they came to,

704
01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:22,263
and the explorers used
to cold hands and faces

705
01:58:22,263 --> 01:58:26,233
now worked with
cold backs as well.

706
01:58:28,669 --> 01:58:30,771
As the journey
eked on, they took

707
01:58:30,771 --> 01:58:33,507
to walking in an
outward facing circle,

708
01:58:33,507 --> 01:58:36,177
taking turns moving forwards,

709
01:58:36,177 --> 01:58:38,479
backwards, and sideways.

710
01:58:40,981 --> 01:58:44,117
The supplies insupportably low.

711
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:47,788
The direction wheel whirled
into a small unnamed town

712
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:50,924
where it finally spun
out and scattered.

713
01:58:52,826 --> 01:58:56,363
The small plot of land
in which they had arrived

714
01:58:56,363 --> 01:58:57,831
was fenced off.

715
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:03,103
It remains blank on every globe.

716
01:59:03,103 --> 01:59:04,771
Every atlas.

717
01:59:06,273 --> 01:59:08,342
In every roaming heart.

718
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:21,855
(wind blowing gently)

719
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:06,667
* Put your sins until it's made

720
02:00:09,403 --> 02:00:13,006
* And kick it to the county line

721
02:00:15,642 --> 02:00:17,611
* Shake your change

722
02:00:17,611 --> 02:00:21,715
* Cold moons

723
02:00:21,715 --> 02:00:25,486
* Nothing's safe in your stars

724
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:31,458
* In and out of sleep

725
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:38,832
* Easier to rise and fall

726
02:01:17,704 --> 02:01:20,941
* I pull the mattress
out the window

727
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:27,648
* Laid out under the smoke ring

728
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:29,983
* And from across

729
02:01:29,983 --> 02:01:32,453
* Shake your song break

730
02:01:32,453 --> 02:01:36,056
* Down

731
02:01:36,056 --> 02:01:39,192
* Sad, sad complication

732
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:45,766
* In and out of sleep

733
02:01:49,603 --> 02:01:52,973
* Even with the rise and fall

734
02:02:01,915 --> 02:02:05,486
* Goes in like a worn out friend

735
02:02:07,721 --> 02:02:11,725
* We've cut our hair
and fake our death *

736
02:04:26,026 --> 02:04:30,396
(light guitar music)
