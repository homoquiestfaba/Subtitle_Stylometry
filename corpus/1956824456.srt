Test.

6
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:47,493
We should record something

7
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,993
and then 10 years we can show our kids.

8
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,753
Uh, that's kind of a stupid idea

9
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:52,843
'cause I don't really like kids

10
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,603
and I don't think we're
ever really gonna have any.

11
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,823
Then they can see how much
in love their parents are

12
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,073
and we can take the tape
and we can put it in a safe

13
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,393
so nobody records over it

14
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,073
and then we can bring
it out and show them.

15
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:05,018
Yeah and show it to the
kids we'll never have.

I don't remember any of that.

186
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,083

- I've never.

187
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:34,916
ROGER: Its officially.

188
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,749
This documentary is going

189
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,673
to get so much more interesting now.

190
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,180
Its like total...

191
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:40,173
Stop.

192
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,268
ROGER: It's proof.

193
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,483
This is gonna be the
best documentary ever.

194
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,435
I'm gonna sell it to Discovery Channel.

195
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:49,910
Look at that.

196
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,843
- By the way...
- It's not funny.

197
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,278
ROGER: Did you take your
seizure medication last night?

198
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:57,153
I think I did.

199
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,495
Didn't I?

200
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,593
You, I don't know, you
used to give them to me.

201
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:03,926
Maybe you forgot, I don't know.

202
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:04,833
ROGER: I bet you did.

203
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,887
So let's say you did and
this is just the demon.

204
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,888
(LAUGHING)

205
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,840

ROGER: All right, we are, uh,

207
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:19,983
keeping a running check on the demons

208
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,503
as the day progresses.

209
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:25,188
The day is nearly over.

210
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,373
Just keeping an inventory
of every room of the house

211
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,643
to make sure the demons are settled

212
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,553
and not bothering us.

213
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,406
One more room to check.

214
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,606
Salad, salad leftovers.

215
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,441
I know.

216
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,219
He's retarded.

217
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,780
I don't even, I don't know...

218
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,818
ROGER: Check out this room here.

219
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,927
Check the...

220
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,518
Get the fuck out of here.

221
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,351
What the hell?

222
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:50,184
ROGER: I didn't know you were in here.

223
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,354
- I was just...
- Are you recording?

224
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,187
- Are you recording?
- No.

225
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:55,133
No, I'm just, I came in
to record the toilet.

226
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,133
Why is the red light on?

227
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,132
- I'm doing...
- Why is the red light

228
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,132
- on the camera?
- I'm doing a room...

229
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,853
- No, the light on.
- I'm not recording anything.

230
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:00,933
Don't fucking lie to me.

231
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,123
Get the fuck out of here.

232
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,014
Get out of here.

233
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,143
ROGER: I didn't know you were in here.

234
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,423
It could be when I'm not in the bathroom

235
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,754
- on the telephone.
- I didn't know you were...

236
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:07,587
Get out of here.

237
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:08,420
Get out.

238
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:09,365
I need to document the toilet

239
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:18,361
STACEY: What the hell?

240
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,999
ROGER: Are those yours?

241
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:21,832
No.

242
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,665
I don't wear...

243
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,498
Those are boy's boots.

244
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,343
Those are your boots.

245
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,122
That is definitely a tripping hazard.

246
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,446
ROGER: Its not my,
those aren't my boots.

247
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:30,208
STACEY: Shut up, those are yours.

248
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,041
ROGER: Who did you have over?

249
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,633
Are there any guys you've been having over

250
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,881
you haven't been telling me about?

251
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,403
Those aren't my boots.

252
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,723
STACEY: Those are your boots.

253
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,063
Then who's boots are they?

254
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:40,896
Are they...

255
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:43,251
ROGER: Maybe they're Satan's boots.

256
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:45,338
I think they're your boots.

257
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,345
Or they're Satan's boots.

258
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,940
When is Satan going to
come and retrieve them?

259
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,683

could well be demons

260
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:57,543
walking all over our house
at any given time here.

261
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,883
I heard about this.

262
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,543
Put some powder down.

263
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,904
Satan comes back for his boots,

264
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:04,413
we're gonna know about it.

265
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,133
The demon comes in.

266
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:07,723
He's probably going all
the way through the house,

267
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:08,593
we don't even know it.

268
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,540
We hear a door slam but
who knows where he goes.

269
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,438
But we're gonna know now.

walk through the baby powder.

okay we already know that
those are Stacey's footprints.

You're going to the bathroom again?

Okay, I don't...

364
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,018
Thank god.

365
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,193
Get the camera off me.

366
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:07,883
ROGER: Hey, we're
documenting this together.

367
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,278
You got to be in this, too.

368
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,328
But, hey.

369
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:17,473
What?

370
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,433
ROGER: What, like if you go up there

371
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,452
should I like wait for him to come out?

372
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:23,016
Do you have like a...

373
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,428
What do I do?

374
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,863
We have someone in there.

375
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,348
I'm not calling the police.

376
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,953
I don't know what to do.

377
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,663
ROGER: This is like
really good footage right

378
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:38,365
and you're just gonna go up there?

379
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,433
Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do.

380
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,285
I don't want to be down here anymore.

381
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,150
ROGER: This, like I feel
like he's gonna come out more

382
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,155
but I kinda want to go up there, too.

383
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,173
I'm like...

384
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,213
I'm shaking right now.

385
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:53,433
Like I want to see who comes out of there

386
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:56,194
but I don't want to be
down here when it happens.

387
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,027
- I don't know.
- I don't want

388
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,013
to know who comes out.

389
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,475
ROGER: The house is
locked and there's some...

390
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,853
I don't know.

391
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,993
Please, can we please,
please I'm begging you.

392
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,068
Please, can we please go to bed?

393
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:15,675
I'm not messing around.

394
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:16,510
I really..

395
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,333
I really just want to go to bed.

396
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:20,338
I'm really scared.

397
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,104
(TOILET FLUSHES)

398
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,356
ROGER: Okay.

399
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:49,546
I just want to go to bed
and forget about all this.

400
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:50,970
ROGER: Here, I'll lock this one here.

401
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:53,681
Just wait till morning.

402
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:54,622
We can't do anything.

403
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,838
These locks from the 40s are solid.

404
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,128
These locks are the best.

405
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,823
Push it and turn.

406
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,375
STACEY: Just shut it, Roger.

407
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,083
ROGER: It's an old house, give it time.

408
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,343
It just needs to latch

409
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,295
and then we're, then we're
free here in a second.

410
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:14,818
Lock it up and we're good.

411
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,193
Push in, turn, and it is locked.

412
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:23,948
Hop in bed, we're safe.

413
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,548
Oh shit.

414
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,239
Time to get up.

415
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,408
(PANTING)

416
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,298
Come on.

417
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,299
(LAUGHS)

418
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,947
Look how scared she is.

419
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,199
(LAUGHING)

420
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:46,173
Oh gosh.

421
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,543
This is what happens when
you witness a demon, folks.

422
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,213
Look at this.

423
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,078
Its not funny.

424
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,163
ROGER: She witnessed a demon last night

425
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,348
and he was peeing.

426
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,208
(LAUGHING)

427
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,343
He was peeing away when we
went down there, didn't he?

428
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:01,695
He was just like (HUMMING).

429
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,028
(LAUGHS)

430
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,688
We're gonna call somebody today.

431
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,472
- We need to call somebody.
- Are you paying for it?

432
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,938
Maybe you should stop being
so scared and clean up.

433
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,388
Why does the bed still smell like tofu?

434
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,758
Well when you get your
diaper changed come on out.

435
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,193
This is Stacey Emerson.

436
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,753
I'm just calling to see if you would want

437
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:40,283
to come to the house because
we've been having some

438
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,293
uh, weird things happen

439
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,173
and I just wanted you to come check it out

440
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:47,393
and let us know if it's
something that happens regularly

441
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,763
or if it's something that
we should be worried about.

442
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:52,553
So give me a call back when you get this.

443
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:53,763
Let me know.

444
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:55,923
My Numbers 555-2416.

445
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,443
ROGER: Who is she calling?

446
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,443
Who are you calling?

447
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,278
The landlord.

448
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,028
ROGER: Why?

449
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:06,013
You really think he's gonna call you back?

450
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,193
Well I don't know but
there's a good chance he will

451
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:10,218
if I keep calling.

452
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,993
ROGER: And what do you,
what do you want him to do?

453
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:15,123
Um, look at the house.

454
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:15,973
Its his house.

455
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,833
Don't you think he should
know what's going on in it?

456
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,243
ROGER: You think he's
actually gonna tell us

457
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,393
if he knows anything?

458
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,388
Um.

459
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,147
I don't know, Roger.

460
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,813
- I'm just saying.
- it doesn't hurt

461
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,723
- to try anything.
- I called him about

462
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,323
- the late rent.
- Email, just anything.

463
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:31,666
Its impossible for you to
take anything seriously.

464
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,503
ROGER: I'm taking
something seriously right now.

465
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,653
Do you see me paging
through this without a clue?

466
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,514
I have no idea what I'm doing
but I'm trying to help you.

467
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,148
I don't know what's wrong with you.

468
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,981
You're not even looking.

469
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,363
You're just flipping through it.

470
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,645
Take it seriously.

471
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,573
- I want this thing.
- I have not,

472
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,723
- any idea.
- Out of the house,

473
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,743
whatever it is.

474
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,546
ROGER: I have no idea to look.

475
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,923
Its like you, its like you
want it here or something.

476
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:51,873
ROGER: I don't want it here.

477
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,084
- Well then try to...
- It's...

478
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,835
Good for you

479
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,059
ROGER: I'm not the
one with any problems.

480
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,203
I don't have problems.

481
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:01,796
ROGER: We get a psychic here or what?

482
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:03,973
I don't know, I guess maybe.

483
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,608
I don't really believe in psychics.

484
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:07,628
I don't know, a priest.

485
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,229
ROGER: I've never done it before.

486
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,233
STACEY: Demonologist.

487
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,985
ROGER: Demonologist sounds good.

488
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,813
If it gives you some peace of mind

489
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,843
so you can sleep, that be cool.

490
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:19,193
You're not bothered by
anything that's happened?

491
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,193
You'd rather just let it?

492
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,722
ROGER: I am.

493
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:22,703
Let it keep.

494
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:25,713
ROGER: Kinda read about
everything a little too much.

495
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:28,048
Yeah, right.

496
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,075
ROGER: It's true.

497
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:36,034
Maybe we'll be putting
an end to everything

498
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,033
that's been going on.

499
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,915
Demonologist is on his way.

500
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,505
Probably gonna cost a ton

501
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:44,029
and it looks like he's here.

502
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:45,333
Roger, put the camera down.

503
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:47,528
The guys is here, its embarrassing.

504
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,572
ROGER: I need to document this.

505
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,143
John C Kavilas.

506
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,547
Nice to meet you.

507
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:53,380
Demonologist.

508
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:54,483
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

509
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,895
You got a camera right there.

510
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,783
- Yes I do.
- Got a documentary.

511
00:21:57,785 --> 00:21:59,860
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

512
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,436
ROGER: Exactly, you
know what I'm doing.

513
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:03,784
You know its uh.

514
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:07,113
So, yeah you guys had an
appointment for me, right?

515
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:08,639
Asking about the site?

516
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:12,073
ROGER: We had some few
weird things going on here.

517
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:13,026
Yeah have a seat.

518
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:14,943
We're just gonna kinda
tell you about everything

519
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:15,778
that's going on.

520
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:21,068
So how long have you been a storm chaser?

521
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:24,587
Oh uh.

522
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:25,506
You know...

523
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,392
Like what do you guys do?

524
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:31,740
ROGER: What do we do?

525
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:32,803
Uh.

526
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:34,123
ROGER: Yeah we don't really.

527
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:34,956
We don't really.

528
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,673
That's just powerful, man.

529
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:38,003
ROGER: We don't really work, you know.

530
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:39,533
We're kinda, kinda.

531
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,303
You like stick it to the man.

532
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:42,683
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

533
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:44,213
ROGER: It gives us time to sit home

534
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:46,223
and record this documentary

535
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,222
that's in progress right now here.

536
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:49,649
Yeah.

537
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:52,096
ROGER: Go to Discovery Channel maybe.

538
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:52,929
Impressive.

539
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:53,762
Discovery Channel?

540
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:57,019
- I uh, I know uh.
- Yeah, uh.

541
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,113
I was going to tell you.

542
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:01,039
We, we think we witnessed
a demon last night

543
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,313
using our downstairs bathroom.

544
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,553
Do you wanna?

545
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:05,650
Can we...

546
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,030
What, what are those?

547
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,879
(MUMBLING)

548
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:09,712
STACEY: I don't drop.

549
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,623
The guy who burned his ear off.

550
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,623
ROGER: We've just been kind of working

551
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,636
on this documentary, you know.

552
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:16,134
Oh you guys are filming.

553
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:17,440
- Correct.
- Right here.

554
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:20,512
You know, documenting this demon.

555
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:22,476
Touche on the camera, man.

556
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:25,123
ROGER: Demon operations going on here.

557
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,793
If we solve it today, you know,

558
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:28,883
you're gonna get some credit
out of this, for sure.

559
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,123
You know, so we're just kind
of documenting everything.

560
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,253
She's been having a rough time with it.

561
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,944
Hopefully something good comes out of it.

562
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,328
Oh, that that, yeah.

563
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,703
- Can we...
- Hopefully we can get like.

564
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,537
- Discovery Channel.
- If it turns out, okay.

565
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,753
You guys are going for the bigwigs.

566
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,586
Yeah.

567
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,698
Well he is.

568
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,531
He's not very good at it.

569
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,522
ROGER: She won't say that
after its on TV, though.

570
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,093
- And.
- Yeah cause...

571
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,683
ROGER: Weird stuff has been happening.

572
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,693
Its interesting stuff, its unique,

573
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:53,262
its raw, its candid, its real.

574
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:55,583
I don't know why no one
would want to watch it.

575
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:56,690
STACEY: Its really scary.

576
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,626
Wow.

577
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:01,793
I just, I can't even imagine what its like

578
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:04,948
to be like your guys shoes right now.

579
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:07,953
ROGER: And I can kind of give you

580
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:10,233
a first hand glimpse if you want.

581
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,066
I got footage over here
we've been collecting.

582
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:15,286
I've been editing it as we get stuff to...

583
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,453
So yeah.

584
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,363
If you just want to check that out there.

585
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:20,543
The file is right on the
desktop, I think, there.

586
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:21,850
Can we get you anything to...

587
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:22,713
(LAUGHING)

588
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:24,293
Yeah, uh.

589
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,126
Water, man.

590
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:26,962
ROGER: We'll grab you some water here.

591
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:27,959
We'll be right back.

592
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:29,178
All right, nice, nice.

593
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:33,105
Okay, let's see here.

594
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:35,728
STACEY VOICEOVER: Roger.

595
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,860
(MOANING)
(WATERBED SLOSHING)

596
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:40,045
Roger.

597
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,471
Wow.

598
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:42,785
This is.

599
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:44,163
STACEY VOICEOVER: This is great.

600
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,673
I'm glad we have waterbed.

601
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:50,675
(MOANING)
(WATERBED SLOSHING)

602
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,313
ROGER VOICEOVER: Yeah
this waterbed really takes

603
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:54,637
the pressure off your back, doesn't it?

604
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,078
STACEY VOICEOVER: It sure does.

605
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,063
Roger.

606
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,065
(MOANS)

607
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:05,554
ROGER: Oh, look at this over here.

608
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,863
(LAUGHS)

609
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:08,715
She's doing exercises.

610
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:09,716
Get out of here.

611
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,883
(LAUGHING)

612
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,809
ROGER: Look how fat she is.

613
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,686
(LAUGHING)

614
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:16,998
That's why she's got to do exercises.

615
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,178
(LAUGHING)

616
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,179
STACEY VOICEOVER: Roger.
(MOANING)

617
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,382
STACEY: Oh my god.

618
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:23,546
- Oh my god.
- Oh.

619
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:25,363
You said you would delete that.

620
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,813
I, I just saw something
that wasn't supposed

621
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:29,703
to be on there and I...

622
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:34,029
You told me you were
gonna record over there

623
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:35,153
and delete that.

624
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:36,283
ROGER: I did record over it.

625
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,979
I just put it in the computer.

626
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,533
- Oh man.
- God damn it, Roger.

627
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,983
ROGER: I forgot it was on there.

628
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:42,075
- Its.
- I'm gonna hurl.

629
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,641
STACEY: Yeah at least get out of it

630
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,474
so you're not just staring at it.

631
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,856
- Yeah, here we go.
- Oh geeze.

632
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:47,283
- Can't believe you did that.
- God, there was so much blood

633
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,983
STACEY: Right when I told you to do it.

634
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:50,563
ROGER: The footage is on there, though,

635
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:52,943
that we do want to look at.

636
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,583
Its just like Lennon said.

637
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,538
Just give peace a chance.

638
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,153
We need to talk later, Roger.

639
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,213
- Okay.
- Um.

640
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:00,463
ROGER: You're the one
who wanted to record it.

641
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:02,228
God I was watching those.

642
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:04,633
Yeah, man.

643
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:09,635
Like, have you ever had
any other encounters, like,

644
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:10,926
I think that's one of the questions

645
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:13,047
that I'm supposed to ask.

646
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,641
Fucking human resources.

647
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:20,568
Of meeting with the demons in the past?

648
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,556
I have, I don't know if he has.

649
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:24,616
- Yeah.
- I definitely have.

650
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:28,490
When I was like 14, I
went to a girl's camp

651
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:33,095
and we were all making bird
houses as one of our crafts

652
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,508
and all of a sudden all the girls left

653
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,283
and started filling up water balloons

654
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,673
and shoving them down their pants.

655
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,623
I don't really know why but
I didn't want to join them.

656
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,043
I just wanted to keep
working on the bird house,

657
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:44,876
I just had to.

658
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:46,239
So I'm nailing it together

659
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:49,013
and I realized there was a bird in it.

660
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:50,727
So then I started painting it and

661
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:51,851
didn't join them.

662
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:54,226
So I just kept working
on the birdhouse, right?

663
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:56,233
What do you fucking know, it flew out

664
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:59,088
and hit me in the nose, right in the nose.

665
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:02,033
You mean it hit you in the face?

666
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,762
Yeah, it hit me in the face.

667
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:04,997
Oh man.

668
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,538
That's just nuts.

669
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:10,133
There's something creepy about that.

670
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:12,653
- Yeah, I definitely.
- You know what I mean?

671
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:13,603
- Oh definite.
- Yeah.

672
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:17,513
Like, I'll be on a roller coaster.

673
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:21,373
So what ended up happening
was the bird broke my nose

674
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:25,033
and I kind of realized that maybe I should

675
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,023
have been putting water
balloons down my pants

676
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:30,083
but you know, there was just
something about that bird house

677
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,920
that was just calling to me
like I just had to do it.

678
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:33,153
I didn't feel like I had

679
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,523
to put water balloons down my pants.

680
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:36,683
I felt like I had to
finish this bird house.

681
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:38,240
It was very important to me.

682
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,653
But how do you explain...

683
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:42,393
Completely honest, that story, man,

684
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:47,395
was completely irrelevant
and just, like unnecessary.

685
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:50,450
- So I'ma take that as a no.
- Oh really?

686
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:53,818
About the demon encounters, you know.

687
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:01,238
Cause you know life,

688
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,083
this is what I see it as.

689
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:06,442
Life is like a water buffalo.

690
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:10,902
You just, you don't know if
its gonna charge you or not.

691
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:16,998
STACEY VOICEOVER: Oh my god.

692
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,143
Did you...

693
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:20,122
ROGER: Well we got
like two cameras but uh,

694
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:24,723
like any given time I just
only use one battery charged.

695
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:25,556
So its rare...

696
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:27,683
I just prefer to put it
in the upstairs bedroom

697
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:29,233
because uh, I don't know,

698
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:31,053
she's been putting her
butt up in the air at night

699
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:33,523
and I think its funny.

700
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:36,963
Yeah, I mean I would do
the same thing, you know.

701
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,833
ROGER: Uh right here, I believe.

702
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:42,608
There's a fucking
camel in that bed, man.

703
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,383
ROGER: That's actually
what I said, exactly.

704
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,573
Yeah.

705
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,153
Joe the cigarette camel.

706
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,463
(LAUGHING)

707
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,895
ROGER: Exactly, didn't I say that?

708
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,993
Up she goes.

709
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:54,148
Oh yeah, that's, oh fuck.

710
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,493
God damn, man.

711
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:00,563
She's got some issues.

712
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,398
Nice.

713
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,449
Shes, let's go.

714
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,013
Let's, I got to rewind that again, man.

715
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:11,740
Okay I'm passed now, man.

716
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:14,783
ROGER: I mean I think its
all demon induced activity

717
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,135
there if I've ever seen it.

718
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:19,808
You're the expert though, like.

719
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:26,078
Seriously some demon induced seizure.

720
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:29,548
You know, I,

721
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,075
its, ah man.

722
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,133
Should we just go upstairs
and just see what we got

723
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,223
to offer here, like the offering,

724
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:41,500
you know with the body of Christ.

725
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:44,426
You know, see what we got.

726
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,551
- Yeah, get your.
- Yeah, definitely.

727
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,618
ROGER: See what you see that we don't.

728
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,903
You know, get to the bottom here.

729
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:53,303
MAN: Hopefully we
can find something here.

730
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,859
These are some beautiful curtains.

731
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,172
I mean, god.

732
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:58,265
Oh.

733
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,079
Who picked these guys out?

734
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:01,911
ROGER: All right.

735
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:05,053
So where do you want to check things out?

736
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:08,030
Oh tensions are high in this room.

737
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:08,873
ROGER: Are they?

738
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:13,095
Yeah, I definitely
feel this in my jugular,

739
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,803
if you want to say.

740
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:15,638
- Yeah?
- I uh,

741
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:19,853
have a strange feeling.

742
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:22,335
I uh, you know.

743
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,485
I want to say like

744
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:33,455
30...

745
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:38,303
Ah, 14 children have died in this room,

746
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,473
believe it or not.

747
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,313
No way.

748
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:42,233
Yeah, its actually kind of nuts.

749
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:45,503
I mean I can, I can just,
I can hear a distant noise

750
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:50,505
in my ear and they're
saying, hey, we died.

751
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:56,893
I don't know I probably,

752
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,901
I'm just probably thinking shit.

753
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:04,874
But you know.

754
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:08,452
Oh man, is this like
the front of the house?

755
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:09,612
ROGER: What about it?

756
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:11,067
(MUMBLING)

757
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,613
Oh god, oh god.

758
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:16,993
Oh man, its just like an old 70s porno.

759
00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:19,073
You know, with the groovy music?

760
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:19,968
Oh god.

761
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:24,318
Oh but for some reason I'm
just getting this feeling.

762
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:28,553
I touched this window I
feel a kinetic energy,

763
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,135
you know like, I feel something.

764
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:34,443
And what I feel that is like,

765
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:39,445
like a school bus full
of kids died in your

766
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:42,532
front of your house, you know.

767
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:48,403
You know, its like when Reagan's like

768
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,563
hey I'm not a crook, you know.

769
00:31:50,565 --> 00:31:52,615
School bus is kind of (MIMICS EXPLOSION).

770
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:58,911
- Exploded in the house.
- Oh my god.

771
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,928
Not in your house but outside.

772
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,860
Yeah, I uh, I'm feeling this window

773
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:08,783
and I, I can just, I feel that

774
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:13,785
I just, I know that a
school bus exploded in,

775
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:19,263
outside your house.

776
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:20,698
How did it explode?

777
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:23,768
You got me, man.

778
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,199
- You got me.
- That's horrible.

779
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,456
You know its like, you did it,

780
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,863
Keanu Reeves driving fast enough

781
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,168
or was he not driving fast enough?

782
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,173
You know, like, with Speed 2,

783
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:38,971
was he in it, did he die?

784
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:40,968
We don't know.

785
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,303
The realtor never told us about that.

786
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:47,128
It was in the 40s.

787
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,773
You know back in the Great Depression.

788
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,998
Hail chief.

789
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,713
- Yeah.
- probably didn't even know

790
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:55,546
about it, then.

791
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:58,123
You had to eat soup back in the day.

792
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,843
God, its aggravating to eat soup.

793
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,693
I like chicken noodle.

794
00:33:02,695 --> 00:33:03,895
I'd go for that any day.

795
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:08,313
Great shower, man.

796
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,663
Just like water.

797
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:13,073
ROGER: Oh hey.

798
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,120
Yeah, uh, this is what
I was gonna point out

799
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:18,113
to you guys earlier, but I forgot about it

800
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:19,483
cause I was thinking...

801
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:21,263
Hitler brothers actually took a shit

802
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,283
in one of these.

803
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:26,095
Its actually not the exact place

804
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:28,167
of where he took a shat

805
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:30,572
but its the same toilet,

806
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,471
if you guys really want to know that.

807
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:36,189
ROGER: I think we were happier
before we knew that but uh

808
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:39,278
Yeah, I uh, light doesn't work in here.

809
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
You know its like, uh...

810
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,322
You gotta, tangle it around.

811
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:51,093
ROGER: Feeling anything or?

812
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,374
Yeah, I feel like I just
had sex with the Blair Witch.

813
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:56,143
Christ.

814
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,043
Just nasty.

815
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,623
Nasty up here, god.

816
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,703
ROGER: That smell
would be her over here.

817
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:03,536
No, no, no.

818
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,446
Its, gotta be this thing, man.

819
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:07,657
I mean, I just, I can't,

820
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,943
I don't know where you get this shit.

821
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:11,675
ROGER: Why do you have that?

822
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:20,561
I guess her wish is to be fat someday.

823
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:21,713
Huh?

824
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:23,295
ROGER: Like what do
you suggest we do now?

825
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:25,503
Anything?

826
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:27,911
Oh yeah, just, uh,

827
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:31,793
you know you might want to
throw a couple Prozac at her,

828
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,293
you know, just cause she's got,

829
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:34,912
she's got some issues, man.

830
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:38,507
Something I can't even,
I can't even handle.

831
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,151
You know its just, its just like...

832
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:42,152
ROGER: I sense it, too.

833
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:43,436
I live with it everyday.

834
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:44,643
Yeah, well you know,

835
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:47,702
- sometimes you wish you...
- Prozac.

836
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:50,053
- Yeah.
- Answer there.

837
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:51,746
Its like that, you know.

838
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:55,975
That's what happens when, uh, uh...

839
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:58,825
When uh...

840
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:04,936
ROGER: Yup.

841
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,563
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:07,743
ROGER: Is like our house haunted?

843
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:08,593
Is she haunted?

844
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:10,065
I don't know.

845
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,063
Is it like...

846
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,875
Nah, you know what man, it could be,

847
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,083
it could be.

848
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:17,070
But you might want to
get the fuck out of here,

849
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,893
you know, just for precaution.

850
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:20,728
ROGER: Okay.

851
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:26,103
I mean, like what about
these demons though?

852
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,363
Should we like communicate
with them at all

853
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,083
or like do we let em be and continue

854
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,877
- to let them visit us?
- You know its a good idea.

855
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,710
- Its a good idea.
- No, its not

856
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:35,713
- a good idea, Roger.
- No, no its not.

857
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:38,060
ROGER: No offense but he's an expert

858
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,622
and you aren't.

859
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:42,443
I mean, so you don't think
we should communicate

860
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:43,842
with it or what?

861
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:45,653
I mean you can.

862
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,556
I mean if you're successful with it,

863
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:50,578
fuck its just gonna screw with
your head and fuck you up.

864
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:55,286
But anyways, well what I did one time,

865
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:58,113
like I left this pizza out for the demon,

866
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,917
of course, and uh, I, uh,

867
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:03,213
wanted to see if it would mess with it

868
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:04,808
- and uh...
- Did it?

869
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:07,158
You know.

870
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:12,395
That night was so insane.

871
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:15,040
ROGER: I think we should
put a pizza out for a demon.

872
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,293
Yeah.

873
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:18,506
Yeah something you
might want to consider.

874
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,573
ROGER: Its something easy to do.

875
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:22,426
I mean its not something we really,

876
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:24,343
you know its gonna take much effort to do.

877
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:26,562
- Like we should.
- Like easy.

878
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:29,636
Roger, we are not putting
a pizza out for the demon

879
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:31,518
or anything else.

880
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:34,019
- Oh.
- Promise me.

881
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:37,006
- Okay.
- She did say promise.

882
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,253
Promise me you're not gonna put a pizza

883
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:41,117
or anything else out like that.

884
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,709
ROGER: Okay, I promise I'm not...

885
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:43,563
Roger.

886
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:44,963
ROGER: I promise I'm not gonna put out

887
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:48,200
any popular carry out
establishment pizza for our demon.

888
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:49,530
- Okay.
- I promise.

889
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:51,559
- All right.
- Yup.

890
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,560
Makes me feel better.

891
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:54,463
Still that's something
you want to take note of.

892
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,353
ROGER: Yup, I'm not
gonna put out a popular

893
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,674
carry out establishment
pizza for our demon.

894
00:36:58,676 --> 00:36:59,633
Now way.

895
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,887
- Yeah.
- Honestly, I think.

896
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,563
(GROANS)

897
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:05,673
Yeah I also was gonna point out, too,

898
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:08,488
man like like, I feel a sensation.

899
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:15,237
Like, intoxicated woman named Lorraine.

900
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:20,563
- Oh.
- Was here, not here,

901
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:22,773
I just have a feeling here.

902
00:37:22,775 --> 00:37:24,573
ROGER: Would be the stairs?

903
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,722
Cause if that's the case, I think you're,

904
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:27,707
I think you're right.

905
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:28,550
Yeah its right here on the stairs, man.

906
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,533
ROGER: She was just
there a few nights ago.

907
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,078
I'm impressed.

908
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:33,896
Really?

909
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,113
- Oh man.
- Stacey, did you hear that?

910
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:35,948
STACEY: What?

911
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:38,087
ROGER: Stacey, you missed that?

912
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,823
What?

913
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:40,933
ROGER: Never paying attention.

914
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,233
I'm not even gonna tell you again.

915
00:37:42,235 --> 00:37:44,283
Its your own fault you missed it.

916
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,905
Well I'm sorry, I was looking up...

917
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,006
- Oh just pointer.
- Yeah?

918
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,448
You may just want to um,

919
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:58,743
leave the house and the girl

920
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:01,023
'cause like, fuck man, its not,

921
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,603
its not worth even staying here.

922
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:03,943
- Like you feel me?
- Okay.

923
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:05,573
No you don't even, you don't even know.

924
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,630
'cause I'm just so.

925
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:07,630
- Appreciate it.
- Oh you know.

926
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:12,413
My uncle does um, he's
the guy kinda started this

927
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,473
whole paranormal shit.

928
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:15,821
I just kind of help.

929
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:19,043
Kinda came along and
helped him out with it

930
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:22,643
but you know he's a pretty cool guy.

931
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:25,013
ROGER: We run into anything
else we'll give him a call.

932
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:26,293
He knows what he's doing.

933
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:28,031
He's a bald guy.

934
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:30,465
ROGER: Like we just
want to get this done.

935
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:33,893
Yeah, just tell him that Jerry sent ya.

936
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,246
ROGER: Jerry?

937
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:37,178
That's not your name, though.

938
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:44,225
That was interesting, huh?

939
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:50,641
Here's his card, man.

940
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:51,708
ROGER: Thank you.

941
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,283
Here, take take take the card.

942
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,763
ROGER: We will give him a call.

943
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:59,098
We will, we will rock you.

944
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,626
He seemed kind of disturbed.

945
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:05,823
ROGER: Yeah so do you

946
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:08,223
but I think, I don't know, his uncle,

947
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,903
his uncle is supposed to be pretty good.

948
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,176
Oh yeah, who's that?

949
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:14,076
Just don't know what to think about the,

950
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:15,568
you know, 14 kids dying.

951
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:20,474
- Like the bus exploding?
- Its just..

952
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:23,620
ROGER: That's, I wouldn't
have guessed in this house.

953
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:27,013
That would explain a lot if its all true.

954
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:29,898
Don't you think somebody
would of told us about that?

955
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,293
ROGER: He said it was in the 40s.

956
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,063
- Maybe they just...
- That's true.

957
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:34,141
- That's true.
- Probably didn't

958
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:35,142
even know about it.

959
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,223
Its just disturbing.

960
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:37,763
ROGER: And he called this, you know,

961
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:40,663
Lorraine on the stairs, that totally is.

962
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,208
Oh my gosh.

963
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,208
ROGER: I don't even...

964
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,523
I really feel like we got something here.

965
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,633
Like this is compelling material.

966
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,667
You think?

967
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:50,268
ROGER: Yeah, yeah I mean like this is,

968
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,033
I don't know, stuff like this sells.

969
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,693
Why do you think that?

970
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,263
ROGER: 'Cause you like,

971
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:59,193
weird stuff is happening,
we're recording it,

972
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,795
and people are interested in it.

973
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,129
Well you, I don't know.

974
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:05,203
- I don't know about this.
- Did you see like

975
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:07,383
what I had together so
far on the computer?

976
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,173
Like I got it all edited together

977
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:10,350
- and its like.
- Yeah, I did.

978
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:11,733
ROGER: Its scary.

979
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:13,453
Its good, people will like it.

980
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,414
- I, I don't know.
- I think its okay.

981
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,392
'cause you're kind of shaky
when you hold the camera and...

982
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,391
ROGER: I'm not a professional.

983
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:20,733
And you can't really focus very well

984
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,032
and your editing...

985
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:23,175
ROGER: You could tell what was going...

986
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:24,008
Your skills are really bad.

987
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,403
ROGER: You were able
to tell what was going

988
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:27,293
on though, that's uh,
like, that's all you need

989
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,393
to do, its a documentary.

990
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:29,540
It can...

991
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,458
I don't know if its clear.

992
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,533
I don't know if its clearly.

993
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,373
ROGER: Its like
candid, though, its like

994
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,543
what actually happened.

995
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:39,167
Its not like staged, so.

996
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:42,411
Yeah but who's gonna care about us and,

997
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:44,307
I don't know, I just, I don't know.

998
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,203
ROGER: I really think
there are demons in this house

999
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:49,553
and they're getting, its
like first, you know?

1000
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,253
We're getting eye witness footage of it

1001
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:53,589
and its, that's what it looks like.

1002
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,587
Take it or leave it.

1003
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:55,763
I think the more that you're videotaping

1004
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,793
the more that you're pissing them off.

1005
00:40:57,795 --> 00:40:58,637
That's what I think.

1006
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,180
- I don't think so.
- And I think that

1007
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:03,149
your poor editing is
probably pissing them off

1008
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,413
'cause it kind of pisses me off.

1009
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:06,070
ROGER: That's good, that's like,

1010
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,023
that's just how it is, though.

1011
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:08,620
- Like I record...
- No but it's...

1012
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:09,643
ROGER: What am I
supposed to do, stage it

1013
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,023
and make it look better?

1014
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:12,453
This is like raw material.

1015
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:13,293
- So its like...
- If you wanted it

1016
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:14,547
- to look good.
- It's raw.

1017
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:15,776
You probably should do that.

1018
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:17,643
ROGER: Have you even
seen a documentary?

1019
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:20,123
Yeah, I've seen plenty of them in my day

1020
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,570
and they were way better

1021
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:22,554
- than what you...
- They look like this.

1022
00:41:22,556 --> 00:41:23,785
This is how they look.

1023
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:24,618
Like you see these?

1024
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,703
I'm not even gonna say it.

1025
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,363
- You just.
- What?

1026
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,196
You're gonna be laughing.

1027
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,819
The Discovery Channel?

1028
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,328
ROGER: Encouragement's
good once in awhile.

1029
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:35,463
Stacey, the neighbors dog is in...

1030
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:37,073
You go back over there.

1031
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,438
I'm gonna eat ya.

1032
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,789
STACEY: Roger, Roger.

1033
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:44,429
- What?
- Stop messing with the camera

1034
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:45,823
Did you, did you hear that?

1035
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,393
ROGER: I'm turning
it on here to get it.

1036
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:49,379
You don't need to turn it on.

1037
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,666
That's the whole point.

1038
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:53,643
You don't need to go down
there and check it out.

1039
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,473
ROGER: Then why'd you wake
me up and tell me about it?

1040
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,382
'cause I'm scared, I'm a girl.

1041
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:02,929
ROGER: If you don't leave
the yard, I'm gonna eat ya.

1042
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:03,762
(BARKING)

1043
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:05,408
Yeah, that's right.

1044
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,410
(YAWNS)

1045
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:12,703
Good morning, flapper.

1046
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:13,538
Morning.

1047
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:18,515
What the hell?

1048
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:20,409
Do you recognize these, Roger?

1049
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:21,673
ROGER: Nope.

1050
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,503
Those must be yours,
'cause they're aren't mine.

1051
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:25,583
No, these are not my keys.

1052
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,773
These weren't here last night either.

1053
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:29,403
ROGER: Not yours, is there.

1054
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,715
- Somebody left them here.
- How did they get

1055
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,566
- in the house then?
- Somebody left them here.

1056
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:32,399
- They're not mine...
- Did you have somebody

1057
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:33,513
here last night?

1058
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:35,273
- Not...
- I'm serious, Roger.

1059
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,693
This is really fucking creepy.

1060
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:39,103
ROGER: 'cause we found some keys here.

1061
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,528
They're probably Lorraine's.

1062
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,187
They're keys that
were not here yesterday.

1063
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:45,143
They got in the house, somehow,

1064
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,844
and now they're laying on our counter.

1065
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:48,830
With all the doors locked.

1066
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,203
ROGER: So you're saying
the demons left them here?

1067
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:52,288
I don't know.

1068
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,363
- I mean, maybe.
- They are keys,

1069
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,753
maybe they're the keys
to the gates of Hell?

1070
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,013
You ever think about that?

1071
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,703
I don't think they'd
have Yellowstone Park

1072
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:00,885
on it, though, you know?

1073
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:01,718
Just, why don't you

1074
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,859
- go back to bed?
- Roger!

1075
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:04,013
- Did you get up too early?
- Seriously.

1076
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:04,925
ROGER: That your problem?

1077
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:05,843
No.

1078
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:06,678
No, look.

1079
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:11,363
You can't take anything seriously.

1080
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:12,910
I'm really, I'm really freaked out

1081
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,350
and you're just making
me feel stupid about it

1082
00:43:14,352 --> 00:43:16,355
and I shouldn't 'cause its
a really fucked up thing.

1083
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:17,688
ROGER: I'll call the other
guy and have him come over

1084
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,523
and check it out.

1085
00:43:47,744 --> 00:43:50,143
I'm just gonna stay down here.

1086
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:52,695
ROGER: Sure, we're gonna
check out the upstairs.

1087
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,045
I'm good down here.

1088
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:58,491
ROGER: Here are the noises
we found about 3:27 AM.

1089
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:00,823
Happens right here.

1090
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,523
We really appreciate you coming over

1091
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:03,898
on such short notice here.

1092
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:11,808
Yeah, he's coming upstairs.

1093
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:14,138
Kinda...

1094
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:18,583
Thinking over every move
here very carefully,

1095
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:22,372
I think he is, just to not
disrupt any of the spirits

1096
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:25,688
that could be up here.

1097
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:27,925
Its kinda, too, uh...

1098
00:44:32,013 --> 00:44:32,846
Oh fuck.

1099
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,108
You guys had sex up here.

1100
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,891
Was it kinky or what?

1101
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:40,243
ROGER: We just kind of, we
just kind of hang out spot.

1102
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,968
So that's how you guys roll.

1103
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:45,863
Fucking psychos, no wonder you're haunted.

1104
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:47,167
- Oh yeah?
- You don't need

1105
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:48,166
to go in here.

1106
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:49,165
Can you explain this?

1107
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,643
ROGER: That's actually Stacey's.

1108
00:44:50,645 --> 00:44:54,881
Questions for you, like we
found some keys and um...

1109
00:44:54,883 --> 00:44:57,293
Don't think, 'cause if you,

1110
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,143
if you haven't used
those before I wouldn't,

1111
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:03,053
like, I've had two years of training...

1112
00:45:03,055 --> 00:45:03,886
Serious...

1113
00:45:03,888 --> 00:45:06,393
Pair of boots that aren't ours

1114
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:09,388
demonic references behind that.

1115
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:12,458
There's nothing here.

1116
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,257
ROGER: And downstairs he goes

1117
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,648
and hopefully out of our house real soon.

1118
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:28,506
You put the pizza out for the demon

1119
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,818
and then, and the demon will see it.

1120
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,453
- Kind of like a welcoming.
- And when the demon sees it

1121
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,866
its gonna mess with you.

1122
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:37,893
- Mess, mess.
- I get it.

1123
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:39,563
Make friends with the demons?

1124
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:43,748
You know, maybe they'll,
they'll just stop haunting us.

1125
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,693
(SNEEZES)

1126
00:45:52,695 --> 00:45:54,503
I promised Stacey I would not go out

1127
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,728
and buy some popular carry
out establishment pizza

1128
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,123
and I won't but I think
that was good advice

1129
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:02,956
that we received.

1130
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,993
How are you gonna really
know what's going on

1131
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:09,640
if you don't, uh, put a little
communication bait out there

1132
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,868
and I think the guy had a point.

1133
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:17,691
But look at this way,
what Stacey doesn't know

1134
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:19,933
isn't going to hurt her.

1135
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:22,783
She takes four hours
in the bathroom anyway,

1136
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:26,383
so she might not ever
even see this go out.

1137
00:46:26,385 --> 00:46:28,258
I like doing documentaries.

1138
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:32,188
There is our key to communication.

1139
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,763
A little bit of a pizza going on here

1140
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,853
for the demon, of course.

1141
00:46:39,855 --> 00:46:40,855
The whole (MUMBLES).

1142
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,216
What the hell?

1143
00:46:48,218 --> 00:46:50,162
What the hell is this, Roger?

1144
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:51,318
- What's up?
- Yeah, what is up?

1145
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,104
This is a frozen pizza here.

1146
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,233
Why?

1147
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:57,163
Any, any problems with that, by chance?

1148
00:46:57,165 --> 00:46:58,461
I have a big problem with that

1149
00:46:58,463 --> 00:47:00,563
because you know what, you
told me that you weren't

1150
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:01,674
gonna put a pizza out.

1151
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:02,507
I don't...

1152
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:04,103
You actually promised
me that you weren't

1153
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:05,023
gonna put a pizza out.

1154
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,503
I really don't recall every saying that.

1155
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,172
However, I do recall saying

1156
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:10,773
that I would not put out

1157
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:13,033

1158
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:14,073
Why don't you ever...

1159
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:14,906
- Come on.
- That's so stupid.

1160
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:16,247
- Hug.
- No, I'm pissed.

1161
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:17,387
- Hug.
- I'm pissed at you.

1162
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:20,723
Because I'm doing what our expert said?

1163
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:23,023
We paid a lot of money
to have him come here

1164
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:24,439
for a couple of hours.

we know we are not alone

and I don't think we are.

00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:45,751
she can just go...

1173
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:59,773
Okay, tonight I have
put a pizza downstairs

1174
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:04,775
as suggested by our storm
chaser expert we had in.

1175
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:07,143
Shut the fuck up.

00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:09,222

What's going on?

00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:29,066
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

1183
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:30,827
I'm gonna see a demon eat pizza.

1200
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,973
- There's...
- There was a whole pizza

1201
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:07,703
before we went to bed, Roger.

1202

Did you eat those two pieces?

I didn't eat those.

Oh my god, Roger.

1206
00:49:17,265 --> 00:49:19,363
You had, you put a camera
down here though, right?

ROGER: Actually this is the camera.

1210
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:27,532
This is the camera because
you didn't charge the packs

1211
00:49:27,534 --> 00:49:28,693
on the other one.

1212
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:29,576
I didn't?

1213
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:31,459

it and I told you to and.

this is like hardcore

- I can't believe this.

1223
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,635
ROGER: Whatever it
is, it left us a note.

1224
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:57,785
Yeah 'cause like, you didn't...

1225
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:01,653
You didn't charge the pack so I don't know

1226
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:02,486
what was down here.

1227
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:04,189
But what I do know is like, there's two...

1228
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:05,022
I don't care, Roger!

1229
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:06,253
ROGER: There's two pieces missing.

1230
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,289
Yeah!

1231
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,016
And now we don't know what took 'em.

1232
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:10,433
ROGER: Look at it this way...

1233
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:12,423
We have no idea what took them.

1234
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,753
ROGER: I put my money on
the upstairs camera tonight

1235
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,393
just because if you put
your butt up in the air

1236
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:17,513
who's gonna record that?

1237
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,143
It's hilarious and I didn't,
honestly I didn't expect

1238
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:21,976
this to happen.

1239
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:25,744
So I didn't, I didn't like
set up anything down here.

1240
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:27,810
Like this is where I would have put it

1241
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:29,193
had you charged the pack.

1242
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,020
You're a fucking asshole, you know that?

1243
00:50:31,022 --> 00:50:32,172
ROGER: You are, too.

1244
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,150
Like oh my god, I cannot believe this.

1245
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:38,529

happened and didn't turn out

Why do you need it?

1604
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:02,986

1607

ROGER: I just, we aren't
sleeping well at night,

1609
01:10:11,645 --> 01:10:13,423
we just need to have some peace of mind

1610
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:15,173
in the form of a hand gun.

1611
01:10:15,175 --> 01:10:16,006
If you know what I mean?

1612
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,723
Well I can understand
the self defense thing

1613
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:20,843

I'm pretty sure you can't

1614
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:21,676

You gonna like blur

they're not gonna know that
you ever even sold it to me.

you put that camera away?

1636

No record.

the camera off here.

- But.
- For the smaller one, though.

We're up for another night
of storm chasing, once again.

1675
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,237
Except we have a little
bit more of a plan tonight

1676
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:15,158
and I'll show you that plan.

Where the fuck did you get that thing?

1679
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:20,869
Got it.

1680
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:23,033
Um, do you have a permit for that?

1681
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:24,285
Would you just shut up?

1682
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:27,640
If it comes in here and tries anything,

1683
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:29,518
he's gonna know what.

1684
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,215
We should just show the
landlord the tapes that we have.

1685
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:33,543
Like he's gonna do anything now.

1686
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:35,738
We gotta kind take this
into our own hands.

1687

if anything happens to us,

I'm sure they'd agree.

1690
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,093
Yeah, I don't think so.

1691
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:45,423
I think we should just show
the landlord the tapes.

1692
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:46,895
We could.

1693
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:49,158
I don't know, the pizza
videos pretty good.

1694
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,333
Could show them that

1695
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:52,013
but I think we're gonna
have a better video

1696
01:12:52,015 --> 01:12:54,671
tonight if everything
goes according to plan.

1697

night something fucking happens.

Its really good evidence.

1776
01:17:21,732 --> 01:17:23,663
We got everything we need here.

1777
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:25,533
We're gonna start doing it you're way here

1778
01:17:25,535 --> 01:17:27,778
cause we're gonna talk to the realtor now.

1779
01:17:28,617 --> 01:17:32,423
I think we got our evidence.

1780
01:17:32,425 --> 01:17:33,528
Everything we need.

1781
01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:37,428
If he wants to come
see it, its in perfect,

1782
01:17:39,215 --> 01:17:42,843
just the way we shot it, untampered.

1783
01:17:42,845 --> 01:17:45,124
I think we can expect a
full refund on everything

1784
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:46,965
and we're just gonna get out of this place

1785
01:17:48,012 --> 01:17:49,303
and I would call the police first

1786
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:50,513
but you know they're gonna come over here

1787
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:53,518
and they're gonna cover it up
like they did with Roswell.

1788
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:58,313
You're taking this as
though its something small

1789
01:17:58,315 --> 01:17:59,973
and minuscule like its
not that big of a deal

1790
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:00,806
but it really is.

1791
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:04,113
There's something dead next to our table,

1792
01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:05,823
in our dining room.

1793
01:18:05,825 --> 01:18:07,083
That's a big deal.

1794
01:18:07,085 --> 01:18:08,553
- Just, don't.
- I just don't want

1795
01:18:08,555 --> 01:18:09,386
any part in this.

1796
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:10,933
I had, none of this was my idea.

1797
01:18:10,935 --> 01:18:12,617
All these stupid ideas were your idea.

1798
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:14,643
You wouldn't listen to anything I said

1799
01:18:14,645 --> 01:18:15,743
even though I'm...

1800
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:17,563
- Well you wanted to...
- Way more mentally stable

1801
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:19,765
than you are, even
though I take more pills.

1802
01:18:20,718 --> 01:18:23,114
ROGER: Alrighty, well.

1803
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:26,223
Is it, which one, which building is his?

1804
01:18:26,225 --> 01:18:27,470
That one there?

1805
01:18:27,472 --> 01:18:28,470
STACEY: Uh, yeah.

1806
01:18:28,472 --> 01:18:29,471
ROGER: All right.

1807
01:18:29,473 --> 01:18:31,246
What we do is we'll,

1808
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,728
we'll just show him some
of this footage and,

1809
01:18:36,221 --> 01:18:40,030
you know, I think it explains itself.

1810
01:18:40,032 --> 01:18:41,169
- Well, not so sure.
- Do you want

1811
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:42,725
to stay in the car or
do you want to come in?

1812
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:44,815
Um, I'd rather stay in the car.

1813
01:18:44,817 --> 01:18:47,402
STACEY VOICEOVER: He was
probably on his way to pee.

1814
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:51,903
ROGER: So yeah, we shot
that video and the demon,

1815
01:18:51,905 --> 01:18:54,573
last night here, like nine hours ago.

1816
01:18:54,575 --> 01:18:56,990
I mean, this guy (MUMBLES)

1817
01:18:56,992 --> 01:18:58,519
he's gonna come to the house and check it.

1818
01:18:58,521 --> 01:18:59,771
He's just like.

1819
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:03,019
ROGER VOICEOVER:
He's not going anywhere.

1820
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,479
STACEY VOICEOVER:
Yeah 'cause he's dead!

1821
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:06,153
ROGER: Kinda, that's pretty much

1822
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:07,613
what's been going on at our house.

1823
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:10,888
It's this kind of like,
I really don't, like.

1824
01:19:13,497 --> 01:19:15,323
It freaked the heck out of her.

1825
01:19:15,325 --> 01:19:18,193
Like I wasn't really that
scared, like I was just like,

1826
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:19,341
oh I'm gonna buy a gun and you know.

1827
01:19:19,343 --> 01:19:21,923
If you want to see the guy,
like we just kinda like

1828
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:23,404
threw a sheet over him because

1829
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:26,243
like we didn't really want to
look at him during breakfast.

1830
01:19:26,245 --> 01:19:28,653
So we like, you know,
just left them there.

1831
01:19:28,655 --> 01:19:29,953
We're not gonna tamper with something.

1832
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:31,293
So its like exactly...

1833
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:32,126
This is the dining room?

1834
01:19:32,128 --> 01:19:33,578
ROGER: That's yeah, from the house.

1835
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,343
The house that you're leasing
us, the haunted one, remember?

1836
01:19:37,345 --> 01:19:39,011
That's Mr. Kingston.

1837
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:42,173
That's your, that's the downstairs tenent.

1838
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:43,185
ROGER: Kingston?

1839
01:19:43,187 --> 01:19:44,681
Like the Kingston trio?

1840
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:47,616
Or some guy named Kingston?

1841
01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:48,773
ROGER VOICEOVER: I
don't have a licensed gun.

1842
01:19:48,775 --> 01:19:52,493
He lives downstairs from
you in the same house.

1843
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:53,378
ROGER: Really?

1844
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,053
Well why didn't you ever tell us that?

1845
01:19:56,055 --> 01:19:57,318
Its in the lease!

1846
01:19:58,805 --> 01:20:00,193
What is wrong with you people?

1847
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,803
ROGER: I think what we
did should be commendable

1848
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:03,793
in some way.

1849
01:20:03,795 --> 01:20:07,430
I think because like, we
had a demon in our house

1850
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:08,263
and we took...

1851
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:09,730
That's not a demon.

1852
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:12,103
ROGER: I mean yeah he
had human form but like.

1853
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,753
That's Mr. Kingston!

1854
01:20:13,755 --> 01:20:15,878
ROGER: 3:27 AM the door slams.

1855
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,393
You tell me that that
is not a demon, dude.

1856
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:20,012
- He works...
- No tenant would do that.

1857
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:21,843
No tenant would come into our house

1858
01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:22,676
and slam the door...

1859
01:20:22,678 --> 01:20:25,673
He works the evening
shift at the factory.

1860
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:27,053
ROGER: Well why would
he come into our house

1861
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:27,886
at 3:27 AM?

1862
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:29,883
Because he lives there.

1863
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:31,572
ROGER VOICEOVER: I'm not happy,

1864
01:20:31,574 --> 01:20:32,513
it will be good in the
morning, you'll see.

1865
01:20:32,515 --> 01:20:33,443
ROGER: And why wouldn't,

1866
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:35,227
why wouldn't you have told us this before?

1867
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:36,453
ROGER VOICEOVER: Stacey.

1868
01:20:36,455 --> 01:20:38,853
Its in the lease!

1869
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:40,783
ROGER: Yeah so I don't
think either of us read it.

1870
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:42,135
- I thought you did.
- No.

1871
01:20:45,356 --> 01:20:48,148
You murdered your housemate.

1872
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,308
I just, I thought you read it.

1873
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:54,359
(ROGER LAUGHS)

1874
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:56,103
ROGER: Oh this is your dog, huh?

1875
01:20:56,105 --> 01:20:57,619
I'm gonna eat ya.

1876
01:20:57,621 --> 01:20:59,239
That's right.

1877
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:00,896
(LAUGHING)

1878
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:04,315
(TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC)

1879
01:21:38,278 --> 01:21:39,393
- That's what you told me.
- You said you

1880
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,226
were gonna read it

1881
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,343
- and like I had...
- Whatever.

1882
01:21:41,345 --> 01:21:43,183
ROGER: I went bowling that
Wednesday that you brought it

1883
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:44,353
I remember you bringing it home.

1884
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:45,863
So I don't think either of us read it.

1885
01:21:45,865 --> 01:21:47,006
- I thought you did.
- No.

1886
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:50,533
Actually that would explain
why we have two kitchens.

1887
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:52,228
What is wrong with you guys?

1888
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:57,746
