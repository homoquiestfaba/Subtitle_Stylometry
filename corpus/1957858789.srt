1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,218
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulu...

2
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,558
Kimi!

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,397
Kimi, don't stop! Keep going!

4
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,526
No more! Please stay away!

5
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,337
Kimi!

6
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,297
Don't you dare touch my daughter!

7
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:39,432
On G'throd ai'ek geb'ey'k!

8
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:45,814
Yyrg-Sorhoth ngah 'ngai' yzhro'k.

9
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:15,134
First it rains, now it's hot as hell.
Damn fools are obsessed, I tell ya.

10
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,221
Good morning, Koba.
Nice to see you, too, Koba.

11
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,557
- Mornin'.
- There you are, Yoshiken.

12
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,852
They're just getting
to the important part.

13
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,524
What is it? Something the matter, Taka?

14
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,404
It's nothing. Just my imagination.

15
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,158
Well, those kids are sure having fun.

16
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,372
They don't hold a candle to our Kimi,
though.

17
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,834
Hey, Koba, why don't you scrounge up some
scrapped AC units and fix 'em up for us?

18
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,713
We could die o' heat stroke at our age.
And poor little Kimi!

19
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,508
You think I can find one for each of us?
Don't be dumb.

20
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,053
Kimi's doing fine, and the rest of us
old fogies know how to grin and bear it.

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:03,265
I say give me iced water or give me death.
That's good enough for me.

22
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,354
What the hell happened?

23
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,315
You gave it death, by the looks of it.

24
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:13,984
Well, that's certainly one way to
escape the heat. Permanently, at that.

25
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,738
Sometimes, Yoshiken, you scare me.

26
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:21,034
What a surprise. Everyone is helping
with the funeral procession

27
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,035
and you lazy coots are taking it easy.

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
Speaking of nut jobs,
look who just showed up.

29
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:30,419
- Momo, Wada, you two are lifesavers.
- Thank you. You're far too kind.

30
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,004
I am exhausted.

31
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,259
The nerve. Day drinking on the morning of
the funeral. Don't you lot have any tact?

32
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:43,639
You got it all wrong. Alcohol plays
a crucial role in funerals everywhere.

33
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,561
The drinking of spirits represents
purification and alms-giving.

34
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:51,230
Is that so? In that case, I'll join you.

35
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,024
What about you, Wada?

36
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,902
No, thank you. You know I don't drink.

37
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:01,949
How much longer can this tradition go on?
How's it still going strong?

38
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,120
Not even the gods they're worshiping
know the answer to that.

39
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,415
It'll probably start dying out
in the coming century.

40
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:13,378
Well, I for one hope it lives on...
that Kurosaki funeral procession.

41
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,757
<i>The origins of thetorii gates</i>
<i>are long forgotten,</i>

42
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,593
and all that's left now
are rituals and songs.

43
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:23,846
It's probably related to the Kurokado
people who once called Kurosaki.

44
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,266
Perhaps those ceremonies
could be the remnants

45
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:29,101
of unheard-of ancient tribal communions.

46
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,853
Another lesson, professor?

47
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,941
Kurosaki's very own
Mr. Know-It-All lives up to his name.

48
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,693
You can joke all you want to
but these traditions

49
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,778
are more important
than any of you realize.

50
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,117
- Kimi, you're here?
- Kimi!

51
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,413
Hi, Taka! And Koba, and Yoshiken,
and Momo, and Wada!

52
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,625
Good morning!

53
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,128
Why's it so hot?

54
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,172
It feels even hotter
than last summer, doesn't it?

55
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,009
Maybe it's that global warming
I keep hearing about.

56
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,678
All right, enough with the chit chat,
you ninnies.

57
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,430
Can't you see our little Kimi is dying
of heat stroke over here?

58
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,433
How about we use the outdoor sink
to cool off, hmm?

59
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:13,020
I tried that. But the water's only hot.

60
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,148
Feels like I'm on fire.

61
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,319
If I don't get out of this heat
I think I'm gonna be sick.

62
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,703
I want to have shaved ice!

63
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,996
- The store room!
- The store room!

64
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:40,423
I always wanted to know what was
down here. I had no idea it was so big.

65
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,760
Long ago, there was a war.

66
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,930
Everyone in town came together
and built this as a safe place.

67
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,808
The last time we were down here
was before Kimi was born.

68
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,977
We were looking for Old Man Kojima.

69
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,896
That's right. Kojima.
After he went missing,

70
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,817
we searched the complex from top to bottom
and eventually found him.

71
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,652
Since it was winter, he was frozen solid.

72
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,571
Wait, you mean something bad happened?

73
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,534
How could you say such a thing
in front of Kimi? You're scaring her.

74
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,871
You're the one who brought it up,
you know.

75
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,163
That's when we found out
what Kojima was up to in here.

76
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,254
He was taking things from all over
Kurosaki and keeping them in this room.

77
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,343
I don't remember digging out
this area one bit.

78
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,845
Maybe the tunnel leads
to a natural cavern.

79
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,306
Something stinks.

80
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,642
If I remember right...

81
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,644
- Hah, I knew it!
- Oh, wow!

82
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,856
It's huge! Just like the ones
they use at the shop!

83
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,236
That's right! With this baby we'll be
cooling off with shaved ice in no time!

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,739
Oh, careful you don't pull something!
You're nearly 80!

85
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,199
This is nothing.

86
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,994
You'll be able to get this
working again, right, Koba?

87
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,205
Of course I can. I've fixed up everything
from appliances to warships.

88
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,624
Perfect. Then let's head back.

89
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,837
You're not going back with them?

90
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,129
Well, aren't you?

91
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,635
- Let's explore!
- Let's explore!

92
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,222
<i>Let's find the treasure!</i>
<i>Let's find the treasure!</i>

93
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,977
The owners of all this stuff may be long
dead, but we ought to tidy up in here.

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,230
There's even more junk in here
than I remembered.

95
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,026
Hey, Taka, look at this!
It's a weird doll!

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,487
<i>That's akokeshi doll,</i>
<i>probably from Tsugaru.</i>

97
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,490
Check out this weird fan! It's got a girl!

98
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,909
Oh, I think that's
from some anime or another.

99
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,498
Look at that! It's some kinda weird...
Hold on. What is that?

100
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,626
Why, this is a zoetrope.
It's older than I am.

101
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,836
Let's see here.

102
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,714
If you spin it like this
and look through here...

103
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,303
Wow, it looks like it's moving!
How'd it do that?

104
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,722
Your mind fills in the
blanks between images,

105
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,058
tricking your eyes into seeing movement.

106
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,768
It's called an optical illusion.

107
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,645
Optical illusion.

108
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,064
When I used your binoculars,

109
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,651
your eyes look super small when I look
through it from the wrong direction.

110
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,653
Was that optical illusion?

111
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,656
In a sense, yes, but not exactly.

112
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,032
This here should explain it better.

113
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,454
The length of these two lines
is exactly the same

114
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,124
but one looks longer than the other. See?

115
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,584
It does! But why?

116
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,753
The human eye is easily deceived.

117
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,383
There are many ways to convince it
that the lies it sees are the truth.

118
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:33,013
- It's an optical illusion.
- Optical illusion. Okay! I won't forget.

119
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,146
<i>That must have been</i>
<i>an optical illusion, too.</i>

120
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,025
I wonder what this thing is? Hmm?

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,365
You okay?

122
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,120
What in the world? A dog?

123
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,039
It still has a collar.

124
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:02,459
Why on Earth would Kojima bring that here?

125
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,881
Is that...

126
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,806
I don't believe it. This is a huge find!

127
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,938
- Ruins?
- Yeah!

128
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:29,444
Kojima's storeroom appears to have been
built in an unexplored ancient cave!

129
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,988
I think this thing I found may
have belonged to the Kurokado.

130
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,326
Just look. Doesn't it look like
an artifact?

131
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,205
Is that supposed to be a star or an eye?

132
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:43,832
If this symbol is part of an unseen
written language,

133
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,710
it'd be the discovery of a lifetime.

134
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:49,589
You know what we should do?
Start a large-scale excavation!

135
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:52,467
Yoshiken, get that idiot to shut his trap!

136
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,009
It's too hot for his bullshit!

137
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,808
He's right. Can't this wait
until after it cools down, Taka?

138
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,894
We can't waste our time waiting.
We also found a dead dog in that place.

139
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,981
Did something happen?

140
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,692
I just saw Kimi
and she was as pale as a ghost.

141
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:15,824
See? This is exactly why we need
to do something about what's down there.

142
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,242
Yeah, you're right.

143
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:20,120
We can't take any chances
when it comes to our little Kimi.

144
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,455
Hey, Koba, why don't
we lock up the storeroom?

145
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,541
At least until we figure out
what to do with it.

146
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,212
Sure, I'll go and put
a padlock or something on it later.

147
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,380
I suppose that will have to do.

148
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,009
By the way, Wada,
what was that call you got earlier about?

149
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,221
I nearly forgot. We've got quite
a few new people moving in.

150
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,557
We're about to have a lot
of new neighbors.

151
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,227
<i>Who would willingly move into</i>
<i>a run down old building?</i>

152
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,395
Remember Tsurie Fisheries?

153
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,524
<i>I heard they hired more people. They need</i>
<i>somewhere to live, so here we are.</i>

154
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,361
<i>Their representative said his name was</i>
<i>Kishide or something like that.</i>

155
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,447
Yes, that's right.

156
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,578
It's as I said before, I found no evidence
that either the local subsidiary

157
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,956
or the language school
had any knowledge of the matter.

158
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:08,459
Yuri, you're missing out on
the scenery. It's gorgeous outside.

159
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,381
Pass. The ocean and some mountains?
No, thank you.

160
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,468
And guess what, Mommy?
It was the creepiest thing!

161
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,015
A dog! A dead dog!
It was all dried up like beef jerky!

162
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,767
And that room was a big surprise already!

163
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,271
I had no idea there was an underground
room down there in the first place!

164
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,356
Finding new stuff like that
is so much fun!

165
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,359
You never know what'll happen next
and everything's a surprise!

166
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:39,240
I seem worried?
That's just an optical illusion, Mommy!

167
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:43,452
Ah, sorry!
I forgot to change the calendar.

168
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,171
See you later, Mommy!

169
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,549
Anyone home?

170
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,262
Uh... hello?

171
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,016
Oh, sorry about that.

172
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,976
I should have known that
so many new faces would startle you.

173
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,939
You must be Mrs. Wada,
the building manager.

174
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,692
My name's Seiichi Koshide.
I'm with Tsurie Fisheries.

175
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,903
These are technical interns.

176
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,988
Basically, my job's to act
as a troubleshooter for them.

177
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,494
Wait a second. Are they all foreigners?

178
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,038
Yes, and they've traveled
all the way to Kurosaki

179
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,583
to study Japan's advanced technologies.

180
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,711
Good afternoon. My name, ma'am, is Rubel.

181
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,839
My friends are still learn the language,
but they are good people.

182
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,632
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

183
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,678
- Hello. It is nice to meet you.
- Hello. It is nice to meet you.

184
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,056
Right, yeah.
Okay, then. Good day.

185
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,642
Sorry, only one more thing.
I have for you the gift.

186
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,269
Here, sweets from homeland. Please enjoy.

187
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,648
Of course. Thank you. Good day.

188
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,026
My wife will drop by later.

189
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,072
Why'd it have to be foreigners?

190
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,658
Yes, your husband told me
you'd be stopping by.

191
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:09,455
Oh, good. I'm Keiko Koshide, and
this is our daughter. Say hello, honey.

192
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,917
I'm Yuri.
It's quite the pleasure to meet you.

193
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,627
My, what wonderful manners you have.

194
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,213
I'm so sorry we've been causing
such a fuss around the complex.

195
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:23,301
My husband connects businesses with
foreign technical interns for a living.

196
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,015
There seems to have been
a miscommunication and, well,

197
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:31,143
if any issues come up, please let us know.
Don't give it a second thought.

198
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,856
I'm sure he'll be fine,
and if you need anything, just ask.

199
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,860
It's nice to see so much youth here after
having only old folks in this building.

200
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,947
Is Hideo your husband?

201
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,284
- Where are your manners?
- No, it's fine. That's my son.

202
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,869
He's going through a rough patch.

203
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,455
And he's become a bit of a shut-in.

204
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,458
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to pry.

205
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:59,213
<i>No worries. He sometimes</i>
<i>goes for walks at night</i>

206
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,842
<i>so if you ever run into him, be sure to</i>
<i>say hello. He means well. He really does.</i>

207
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,473
<i>Those new residents</i>
<i>are causing quite a stir.</i>

208
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:12,226
<i>That's an understatement. The whole</i>
<i>thing's got my wife worked up in a tizzy.</i>

209
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,232
An apartment complex full of elderly folk
who've never left the country

210
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,026
encountering foreigners
for the very first time.

211
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,986
This situation's one big powder keg.

212
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,614
And old lady Wada's primed to set it off.

213
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,074
Only if you don't do it first.
Need a light?

214
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,328
I give it to people
straight up no matter what.

215
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,752
- What's that big fella doin' over there?
- Who knows?

216
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,340
Hey, now.
Attitudes like that are the problem.

217
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:45,343
Friendships start with hello.
All right, then.

218
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,346
I'll go introduce my...

219
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,388
Good morning!

220
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:55,103
Well, good morning, Kimi!
It looks like you're having some fun!

221
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,355
What are you doing? Come down and join us!

222
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,273
But there's too many people!

223
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,693
Wait, something's wrong.

224
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,571
Kimi, stay where you are!

225
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,032
Optical illusion!

226
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,583
Are... are you all right?

227
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,252
You saved me.

228
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:24,923
Kimi, you crazy little girl!
You could have gotten yourself killed!

229
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,261
Now, now, she's fine.
That's all that matters.

230
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,640
Young man, because of you,
Kimi is safe and sound.

231
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,140
Sorry, can you understand me?

232
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,978
Should I speak English?

233
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,938
No, it's okay.

234
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,275
I am strong, you know. It was no problem.

235
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,652
Your name is... Young Man?

236
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:50,323
It's confusing, since "kimi" can also mean
"you". That's her name. Kimi.

237
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,326
- And you? What shall we call you?
- Kanchan.

238
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,580
Can I put you down, Kimi?

239
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,750
Thanks for your help, Kan.

240
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:05,006
I was wrong about you, kid. You're not
so bad. But you still can't have our Kimi.

241
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,799
Don't take that old fart seriously.

242
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,562
More optical illusions!

243
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,026
Sorry if I scared you. Is your name Kimi?

244
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,946
I'm Yuri Koshide. I'm ten.

245
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,656
I moved in here today.

246
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,409
You must be the new girl I heard about!

247
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:35,660
Hi, I'm Kimi! I'm nine!

248
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,412
And you said your name is Yuri?

249
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,666
That's right. I'm just happy to meet
someone here who's around my age range.

250
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,294
Can you and I please be friends?

251
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:46,504
- Of course! Yes, please!
- Then let's mark the occasion!

252
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,677
Oh, wow! Is that a camera?

253
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,806
- So skinny. And you get to have your own?
- Pretty much.

254
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,266
I wonder where we can get
some prints made?

255
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,645
So what do you like to do for fun here?

256
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,397
Nothing much. Go to the beach, I guess?

257
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,110
And school. But everyone here's super
nice so I love living in Kurosaki.

258
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,615
I see.
I hope I can come to like it here, too.

259
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,036
Wait, I know! Wanna see something cool?

260
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,091
There's this real neat spot down here.
You're gonna love it.

261
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,843
You sure? This place is creepy.

262
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:36,222
Stupid thing.

263
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:41,351
Don't just stand there. Come on, let's go!
Go, go!

264
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,107
Hey, Kimi?

265
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,320
Where did she go?

266
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,449
This is bad. Seriously, this isn't funny!

267
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,498
I got you back real good.

268
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,253
Oh, my God. You're such a jerk, Kimi!

269
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,590
What is that thing?

270
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,925
This thing? It's a mummy dog. A real one.

271
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,554
Don't stick stuff like that
in someone's face, you jerk!

272
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,181
I take it back.
I don't wanna be your friend anymore.

273
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,767
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,939
- Kimi!
- That wasn't me. Really, I swear.

275
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,902
Is someone down there?

276
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,455
Kimi, what was that?

277
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,375
I don't know, but it came from down there.

278
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,503
- Let's go look.
- What? No way! Are you kidding me?

279
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,256
But isn't it just as scary
to stay back here?

280
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,342
Fine! In that case, I'm gonna go first!

281
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:01,766
I'm older than you so it's my job to keep
you safe, so stay behind me.

282
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,560
- Got it?
- Yeah. All right.

283
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:18,366
- Is this another room?
- Maybe. Turn your light on?

284
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,584
What are these?

285
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,086
Did that creep from earlier draw these?

286
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,671
They're all monsters! I'm scared!

287
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,014
Coming!

288
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,061
Well, now.
If it isn't Kimi and Yuri, was it?

289
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,562
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

290
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,397
What brings you here? Ah, that's right.

291
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,025
I made a big block of ice
for that shaved ice machine.

292
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,780
I made it in our freezer.
It'll be ready to eat tomorrow.

293
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,366
Wow, really? I can't wait!

294
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:03,076
But that's not why we stopped by.

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,830
We're here because we found this thing.
Here.

296
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:09,874
Oh, wow.
This is from that place I used to own.

297
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,170
I can't believe you remembered that.
Where did you find this?

298
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,172
We found it earlier.
We think Hideo dropped it.

299
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:21,429
We'd like to return it to him personally
Is that okay, Momo?

300
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:27,935
I suppose so, but you'll have to talk
to him. He'll get angry if he sees me.

301
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,857
Hideo? We're sorry, but we saw them.

302
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,527
All of the drawings in that room?

303
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,281
<i>But we won't tell Momo about them.</i>
<i>I mean, you hid them for a reason.</i>

304
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>It was because you didn't want her</i>
<i>to start worrying about you, right?</i>

305
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,413
Those drawings make me think
you're in a lot of pain.

306
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,999
They made me scared
and now I'm really worried,

307
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,043
but just know that I'm on your side.

308
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:59,008
So, my dad gives the interns advice
when they get really sad or really angry.

309
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,471
He knows doctors and stuff
so I think maybe he can help you out.

310
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,349
And also we brought your pen.

311
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,082
AUGUST 18, 2000
Friday

312
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,339
- What the hell happened?
- I haven't the slightest.

313
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,009
We should clean this up, though.

314
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:44,469
If Wada sees this, she'll lose her mind.

315
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,559
Where's that God-awful racket coming from?

316
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:57,774
Yes?

317
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,609
What are you people doing?

318
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,912
Sorry, but miss,
we are have now our morning prayers.

319
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:13,414
- It is very important. Our prayers...
- What prayers?

320
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,168
Who gives a damn?
You people messed up our washing area!

321
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,963
What's with you foreigners?
Is this some kind of cult or something?

322
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,094
- It's just like I said.
- It's time we calm down a bit, Wada.

323
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:27,930
This is your prayer ritual? We're sorry.

324
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,517
Many of those who live here
aren't used to your practices.

325
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:37,647
It's not my fault their prayers sound so
demonic! Don't touch me, wrinkly bastard!

326
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,109
Looks like Wada's extra grumpy today.

327
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,487
I wish she'd just get along

00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,708
