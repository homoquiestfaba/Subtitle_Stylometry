But, uh, merry Christmas.

No, I don't‐‐ I don't want him.

Why are you huddled
in a corner with Riley?

1732
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,959
‐ None of this has anything
to do with Riley.

1733
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,379
This is all happening
because of you, Harper.

1734
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,969
You not telling your parents about us
is a choice that you made.

‐ It is not that simple.
ABBY: Do you know how painful

1736

1741
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:15,539
I mean, love in our house wasn't
something we just got for free.

1742
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,119
It is something that we competed for,

1743
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,540
and if we veered
off their course, we lost it.

1744

1745
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,959

01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,629
But they're my parents,

1747
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,129
and I am scared that if
I tell them who I really am,

1748
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,299
I will lose them.

1749
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,930
And I know, if I don't tell them,
I will lose you.

‐ Can we just talk for a sec?

1773
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:39,369
‐ Oh, what's there to talk about?
You and Abby are in

1774
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,199
a romantic relationship,
and you've been lying

1775

My parents loved Christmas.

1886

We would do all the stuff.

every Christmas movie.

bring myself to acknowledge Christmas.

Hmm.

a huge reminder of...

Everybody's story is different.

But the one thing that
all of those stories have in common

1912
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:27,439
is that moment
right before you say those words,

1913
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,529
when your heart is racing

1914
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,820

That moment's really terrifying.

you can't unsay them.

A chapter has ended,

You can't do it for anyone else.

Just because Harper isn't ready,

it doesn't mean she never will be,

1923
