My label's looking for
a Christmas single for me.

55

Maybe we could team up
and write something?

56

Uh, yeah! I'd love to.
Of course.

over a month now?

I'm sorry, honey.

64
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,374
They never got back to me
about a meeting,

65
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,576
but that's the way
things are in the biz.

66

other opportunities.

send my song out to labels?

is looking for an opener?

69
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:46,466
Abby, I've been trying
to pitch you as an artist

70
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,188
all over town
for almost a year now.

71
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,150
No one's responded yet.

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,353
But, I do have
a ton of offers

73
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,234
for you to write songs
for commercials.

74
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,277
Commercials?
Like advertisements?

75
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,720
It's a booming industry.
Very lucrative.

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,801
You'd be perfect.

77
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,124
What do you say?
- I don't know.

78
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:08,567
Writing commercials
seems a bit soul-killing.

79
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,809

it's no Casey Macey,

81

but um,
it's a good living.

82
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,675

right?

83
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,379

Anyways,
Seventh Heaven paper towels

112
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,889
are the softest
in the market.

113
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,851
We know that.

114
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:37,814
We just need our audience
to know that. So Abby,

115
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,657
if you could be sure to write
some lyrics about softness,

116
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:41,778
maybe some absorbency,

117
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,700
that'd be fantastic.

118
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,341
But focus on the softness,

119
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,904
because people love
soft paper towels.

120
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,987
- (people murmuring agreement)
- Sure, no problem. Softness.

121

Whitney, I am writing
this commercial for you.

139
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,913
Is this your way
of firing me?

140
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,675
Of course not.

141
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,196

than a coworker.

You don't even sing them
for us anymore.

00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:52,806
I mean, when's the last time you
performed in front of anyone?

00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,908
I can't remember.

147
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,173
When I first met you,

148
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,175
you had these big dreams
of being an artist,

149
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,497
of releasing
your first Christmas hit.

150
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:04,538
What happened?

151
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,820
I guess I just haven't been

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,503
in the Christmas spirit lately,
you know?

153
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,104
Well, you haven't been
in the Christmas spirit

154
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:12,826
because you don't have
any Christmas decorations

155
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,708
at your house.
- I have a tree.

156
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:17,130
Well, it's tiny, it's busted,
and your mother sent it to you.

157
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,675
Maybe you should go home
for the holidays.

158
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,557
You're always telling me
how well your hometown

159
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,399
does Christmas.
- No, I can't do that.

160
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,801
I have to turn in
this paper towel song,

161

a frozen yogurt commercial
that's due.

00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,360
And the lighting.

352
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,282
And the costumes.

353
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:51,925
It would really help if we could
fill that co-director position.

354
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,447
Abby,
you'll fill in, right?

355
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,129
What? Mom, you know
I'm super busy.

356
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:57,531
Yeah, no.

357
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,932
I meant fill the position
down the road.

358
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,614
I mean, I can handle it.

359
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,296
Well, I wasn't gonna
mention this,

360
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:04,497
but we just got
some terrible news.

361
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:05,779
What's wrong?

362
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,381
I just found out
that the school board

363
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,743
is thinking about taking our
performing arts funding away.

364
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:13,706
Oh, no!
Why would they do that?

365
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:15,548
They wanna give the money
to sports.

366
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,070
They get most
of the money anyway.

367
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,432
The superintendent
is just one of those people

368
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,514
who doesn't see
the value in arts.

369
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:24,877
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. The problem is,

370
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:28,080
the board takes most
of their voting cues from him.

371
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,523
They're voting right after
the Christmas pageant.

372
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:34,046
Okay. So,
here's what you're gonna do.

373
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:37,449
You have to make this
the best pageant ever.

374
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,571
You have to convince him

375
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:42,414
the students need
these arts programs.

376
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,296
So you'll help, right?
You'll fill in?

377
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,058
Just for now.

378
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,380
I mean, I guess an extra hand
couldn't hurt, right?

379
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,983
Please, honey.
We really need you.

380
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,306
Please,
it's only temporary.

381
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,628
Okay. I'll do it.
I'll help.

382
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,190

Thank you.

383
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,292

I can't believe
I got roped into this.

Whitney on phone:
Yikes.

387
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,764
Sounds like a mess.

388
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,326
So, tell me more
about this guy.

389
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,408
- Abby: What guy?
- The band teacher!

390
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,449
What's he like?

391
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,531
He's whatever.

392
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,053
(scoffing)
He's all over the place.

393
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,814
- Is he cute?
- (woman squealing nearby)

394
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,657
What? No!

395
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:27,938
I don't know.

396
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,622
He's adequate.
- Mmm, he's "adequate".

397
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,183
(glass shattering nearby)

398
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:34,865

Your voice is incredible.

with perfection. Right?

477

Well, the audience
won't notice technique

478

But, proper technique
is important too.

480
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,570
You need to have
a solid understanding

481
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,652

you're gonna be any good at it.

you know,
if you just relax a little

488
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:44,307

in your heart,

489
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:47,109

He is so rude.

by it, honey.

I know, I just thought maybe
I could buy you a coffee

519
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,364

- That's really not necessary.

what you wanted,

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,583
you're off to a good start.

527
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,826
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

528
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,988
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

529
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,910
That's an understatement.

530
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,272
I've just been
really overwhelmed

531
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,073
with this whole
performance thing and um,

532
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:57,375
I took it out on you
and I'm sorry.

533
00:26:58,537 --> 00:26:59,878
Whatever, it's fine.

534
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:01,960
So we can start over?

535
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,562
I'm Travis.

536
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,483
I'm the music teacher
at Bellville High School.

537
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,688
- Seriously?
- Just go with it.

538
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:10,769
Hi, I'm Abby.

539
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,410
Nice to meet you, Abby.

540
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,892
My class has
a very important

541
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,773
Christmas pageant performance
coming up.

542
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:18,096
The whole department's kind of
counting on it going well,

543
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:19,537
and I could really use
your help.

544
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,818
What do you say?

545
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:23,040
Travis, I've already agreed
to help.

546
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:25,743
Fine!

547
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,024
I would be happy to help.

548
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,426
Thank you.

549
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:29,667
And again, I'm, uh...

550
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,890
I'm really sorry
that I insulted you.

551
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:34,832
Apology accepted.

552
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,554
'Cause really, um,

553
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,515
I'm quite impressed by you,
actually.

554
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,718
Really?

555
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:42,800
Yeah, you're chasing
your dreams.

556
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,361
You make a living
off songwriting!

557
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,603
Right.

558
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:47,804
Thanks.

559
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,906
Truce?

560
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:52,129
Truce.

561
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:53,330
So, I'll see you there
on Monday.

562
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,331
I'll be there.

563
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,533
Perfect.

564
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,935
So, your turn.

565
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:01,097
All three.

566
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:05,181
- Is that a part of the truce?
- Yummy.

567
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,764
(band playing)

568
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:19,475
Okay, guys.
I wanna try something

569
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,037
a little different today.

570
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:22,758
Instead of practice
we have free period?

571
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,800
No, Ethan. Not that.

572
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,244
I got some logistical stuff I
gotta do for the performance,

573
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:31,727
so, Abby is gonna take over
teaching today.

574
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:32,728
(kids reacting)

575
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:33,969
What?

576
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:35,090
Yeah, what?

577
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,492
(chuckling)

578
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,133
I think we could use
another perspective.

579
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,896
We do want this performance
to be perfect, right?

580
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,018
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I need to take over.

581
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,300
Yeah, with all due respect,
Mr. Tucker,

582
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,022
we don't have
that many practices left.

583
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:49,424
We can't afford
to just waste time.

584
00:28:49,524 --> 00:28:50,826
Travis:
It'll be great, okay?

585
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:55,230
And I will be right over there,
so all of you...

586
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,432
listen to what she says.

587
00:28:57,532 --> 00:28:59,534
Okay?

588
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,960
Okay. Um...

589
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,445
Well, now that I have
your attention...

590
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,807
Let's see. Uh...

591
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:17,752
Can anyone tell me what the
number one rule in music is?

592
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,055
Come on, anybody.

593
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:23,277
Um, what's the number one rule
in music?

594
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,941
Yes, uh...

595
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:27,982
Travis:
Yeah, Lila.

596
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,303
Tone?

597
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,065
Tone? That's good.

598
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:34,568
Uh, any other ideas?

599
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,273
Yes.
- Pitch?

600
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,556
Pitch, okay.

601
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,837
That's also good.

602
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,939
Anyone else?

603
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,125
Uh, rhythm?

604
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,127
Rhythm, all right.

605
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,768
So, these are all
very important,

606
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:59,892
but the number one rule in music
is there are no rules.

607
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:03,656
What makes a great musician
is listening.

608
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:05,458
Their ability to listen
is everything.

609
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,461
And you need to listen
to what's around you, okay?

610
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,182
You have two ears, one mouth,

611
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:13,626
so you should be listening
twice as much as you're playing,

612
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:16,509
and you should be having fun.

613
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,551
But shouldn't we
practice the song?

614
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,634
Well, you can practice
and have fun.

615
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:23,675
There are many ways
of practicing and improving

616
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,397
at the same time.
And, you know,

617
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:28,440
one great way to practice
and have fun

618
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,542
is to play with
your favourite songs.

619
00:30:32,104 --> 00:30:34,646
But we're not playing our
favourite song for the pageant.

620
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:37,449
Yes, you're right.
You're not.

621
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,211
But still great ear training.

622
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:42,133
And you need to train your ears
so you can trust your ears

623
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,616
and train your ears
to trust your intuition.

624
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:47,859
And that will make
the difference

625
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,261
between a bad performance
and a great performance.

626
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:52,063
That all sounds cool,

627
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,905
but I don't see
how we can do all of that

628
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,467
in time to get the perfect song
for the performance.

629
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:58,790
Well, it doesn't need
to be perfect.

630
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,312
You just need to make
the audience feel something.

631
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,514
Okay?

632
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:04,875
So, let's give it a try.

633
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:09,600

You get paid
for writing songs.

685

It's a lot more
than I've ever done.

686
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:16,661
I used to have a... a dream
of being a composer, but...

687
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,623
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

688
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,864
But I never swung for it.

689
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,066
It always seemed
like too much of a risk.

690
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,068
Well, it is a lot of work,

691
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,170
but it's never too late
to reach for your dreams.

692
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,855
No. No.

693
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:36,040
Well, I'm not exactly pursuing
my real dreams either, you know?

694
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,842
Well, what are
your real dreams?

695
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,363
To be a musical artist.

696
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:43,247
To sing Christmas songs
like the one I just showed you.

697
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,690
Okay, I love that!
Why aren't you doing that?

698
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,213
Well,
my official excuse is work.

699
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:53,217
But, honestly, I just haven't
been really inspired lately.

700
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,699
I only have that one verse.

701
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,801

00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:29,277
I hope I'm not imposing.

876
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:30,678
No way!

877
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:33,040
Of course not.
- Well, I'm not as good as you.

878
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,243
I should probably just leave it
to the professionals.

879
00:43:35,343 --> 00:43:37,445
Don't be silly.

880
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:38,846
I'd love to hear it sometime.

881
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:40,948
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

882
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,551
How 'bout now?

883
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,741
All right, I'm uh...

884
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,585
a little nervous
showing you this,

885
00:43:58,685 --> 00:44:00,867
but uh, I mean, it's probably
gonna be terrible.

886
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:02,969
Play it for me!

887
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,272
All right.

888
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:07,374
Here's the new verse
that I wrote.

889
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:12,539
♪ This December
could last a year ♪

890
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:18,584
♪ I'd be happy and I'd still
be wantin' more ♪

891
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:23,009
♪ With the fire
here before us ♪

892
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:25,251
♪ And winter's quiet hum ♪

893
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:29,675
♪ Still my favourite
Christmas melody is you ♪

894
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,419
That sounds good.

895
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,501
(sighing)
I know it's your song,

896
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:38,184
and I don't wanna edge in
on your creativity, I just...

897
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:39,825
you said you were stuck
and I thought maybe

898
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,927
some additional lyrics
might help to spark something.

899
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,111
Well.

900
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:49,815
"With the fire here before us
and winter's quiet hum."

901
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:52,557
That's poetry.

902
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,520
I love it.
- Really? You like it?

903
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,043
No, I love it.

904
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:01,766
You know, you keep trying to
put yourself in the background

905
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,089
but you really deserve
to be in the spotlight.

906
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:06,951
I could say the same
about you.

907
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,381
I wrote
"Christmas Without You".

908
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,862
I'm sorry?

909
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:20,144
That Casey Macey song?

910
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:22,386
That's why I reacted
the way I did

911
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,868
when we were
decorating the tree.

912
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:26,630
(chuckling)
What do you mean, you wrote...

913
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,833
I mean, that would be amazing.
It's a super big hit.

914
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:31,275
Well, for her it was.

915
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,637
She heard me sing it
at a showcase.

916
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:35,959
She even said she wanted
to collaborate with me

917
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:40,124
and then she decided that she
really didn't need me after all.

918
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:42,326
Are you saying
that she stole it?

919
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:44,448
I couldn't really prove it.

920
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:47,531
My manager
hired a lawyer and...

921
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:48,892
(sighing)

922
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:50,373
...just,
she said there was nothing

923
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:52,055
that we could even do
about it legally

924
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:53,777
because of
the copyright laws.

925
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,879
(sighing)

926
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:00,503
I mean, it's no wonder
you lost your inspiration.

927
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:03,086
That's horrible. I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

928
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:08,031
You know, I've never
told anyone that story before.

929
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,633
Well,
your secret's safe with me.

930
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,915
Thanks.

931
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:16,399
Well, this new song,
it just needs a chorus

932
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:19,402
and I was thinking maybe
you could write it with me.

933
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:20,963
Really?

934
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:22,645
Yeah!

935
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:23,966
I'd love that, yeah!

936
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:25,768

I'm free tomorrow.

00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:15,245
It's called
"A Christmas Melody"

1053
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:17,246
and Abby and I wrote it.

1054
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:18,408
(students' impressed reactions)

1055
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:19,409
You guys wrote this?

1056
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:20,490
- Mm-hm.
- Ethan: Cool.

1057
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,932
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:24,534
So, you can
take one yourselves

1059
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,656
and pass one
to the row behind you.

1060
00:53:26,756 --> 00:53:28,377
Sorry the sheet music
is handwritten

1061
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:32,501
but take it home,
give it a try.

1062
00:53:32,601 --> 00:53:34,263
(school bell ringing)

1063
00:53:34,363 --> 00:53:37,746
Okay. Your homework
is to practice this new piece

1064
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:39,708
and we'll take a look at it
next week, all right?

1065
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:41,590
- Girl: Okay, thank you!
- Boy: Thank you, Sir.

1066
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,692
(chatter)

1067
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:52,000
- So, had an idea.
- What's that?

1068
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,482
Gingerbread houses.

1069
00:53:53,582 --> 00:53:54,843
Mmm.

1070
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:56,645
I found some kits
in my mom's pantry.

1071
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:58,887
I like
where your head's at.

1072
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:00,809
So, this evening?
Uh, my house?

1073
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:02,370
I'll be there.

1074
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,472
Cool.

1075
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:10,598
- Good work, everybody.
- Thank you.

1076
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:13,921
- Boy: Bye.
- Girl: Bye.

1077
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:21,068
Oh, Ethan.
Hold back a sec.

1078
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:23,591
What up, Mr. Tucker?
- Travis: I've been thinkin'.

1079
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:26,754
I think you should apply
to the Powell School of Music.

1080
00:54:26,854 --> 00:54:28,395
The one in New York?

1081
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,797
Isn't that like,
really hard to get into?

1082
00:54:29,897 --> 00:54:31,599
Yeah, but I know
the admissions coordinator.

1083
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,480
I can put in a good word.

1084
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,442
Look, I'm not going to college.
I told you.

1085
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:36,844
I'm taking over
my family's restaurant.

1086
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,446
And that's a very noble plan,
Ethan.

1087
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:41,808
Look, I've been there.
It's delicious.

1088
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:43,370
But is that really
what you want?

1089
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,333
I mean, is playing the piano
even a career?

1090
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:47,734
Absolutely.

1091
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:50,297
I mean, you could play
in an orchestra.

1092
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:51,978
You could score films.

1093
00:54:52,078 --> 00:54:53,540
You could work
as a session musician.

1094
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,663
You could even do commercials
like Miss Walker.

1095
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:58,765
Uh, I don't know.

1096
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:02,268
Ethan,
you are so talented, okay?

1097
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:04,470
You can't waste that
in the back of a kitchen!

1098
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,673
I mean, it would be pretty cool
to play music for a living.

1099
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:10,556
Right?
All I'm asking is you apply.

1100
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:11,998
Okay? You just make
the audition tape

1101
00:55:12,098 --> 00:55:13,759
and you can decide
if you wanna go later.

1102
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,322
If I make a tape,
will you stop bugging me?

1103
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:18,684
Never.

1104
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,646
I will never stop pushing you.

1105
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:22,248
(sighing)
Fine.

1106
00:55:22,348 --> 00:55:23,849
All right! Good. Let's go.

1107
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:25,451
- Right now?
- Yeah!

1108
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:27,553
No time like the present.

1109
00:55:29,515 --> 00:55:31,516
(sighing)

1110
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,462
So, what do you think,
"Deck the Halls"?

1111
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:39,624
I mean,
it's not very original.

1112
00:55:39,724 --> 00:55:40,986
Can I do you
and Mrs. Walker's song-

1113
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:43,088
"A Christmas Melody"?

1114
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:46,531
I'd be honoured.

1115
00:55:51,336 --> 00:55:58,463
♪

1116
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,968
(phone ringing)

1117
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:06,490
Brenda! What did you think
about the song?

1118
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,614
Yeah, Abby, about the song.
What is this?

1119
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:12,296
Did you like it?
I have a new musical partner.

1120
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:13,938
Abby,
it's a Christmas song.

1121
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,820
Christmas is
a very competitive market.

1122
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,342
I know, but the song
is really good,

1123
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,304
so I think it'll stand out.
- Sure.

1124
00:56:20,404 --> 00:56:24,068
I'll send it out, see if
there are any takers. I just...

1125
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,109
I don't know why you're wasting
your time with all this stuff.

1126
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:27,791
It's not a waste of time,
it's...

1127
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,473
How are the commercials
coming along?

1128
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:31,555
I have a ton more corporate gigs
you should be working on.

1129
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:34,478
McKayla, email Abby
the corporate gigs.

1130
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:37,481
You know, I was thinking maybe
I should put a pause on those.

1131
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:40,403
What? Are you crazy?

1132
00:56:40,503 --> 00:56:44,327
I'm feeling really inspired
with my own songs right now.

1133
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:47,010
I may even start
performing again.

1134
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,093
Abby, you're at the top
of your game.

1135
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:53,216
If you quit now, someone will
come in and take up your spot.

1136
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:55,778
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

1137
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:59,782
Okay. All right, just...
don't say I didn't warn you.

1138
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:01,103
Abby: I won't.

1139
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:03,306
Thanks, Brenda!

1140
00:57:03,406 --> 00:57:05,428
I know you just want
what's best for me.

1141
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:07,069
Uh-huh. Sure.

1142
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:09,531
Okay, bye!

1143
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,302
Travis: I feel like I need
more sprinkles.

1144
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,807
Ooh. I'm missing a gumdrop.

1145
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,169
I don't have
any of those left,

1146
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:29,571
but I do have a candy cane
I can spare.

1147
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:31,092
- I'll take that.
- No.

1148
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,855
I need
those jellybeans first.

1149
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:36,738
You drive a hard bargain,
Travis Tucker, but a fair one.

1150
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:38,660
There we go.

1151
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,062
Oh, by the way,
I spoke to Brenda

1152
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:42,263
and she's gonna
send the song out.

1153
00:57:42,363 --> 00:57:44,425
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1154
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:46,107
Things are happening.

1155
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:49,030
And I quit the commercials.
I thought you should know.

1156
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,512
- You did?
- Yeah.

1157
00:57:51,612 --> 00:57:54,755
I wanna focus on singing
more Christmas songs with you.

1158
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:56,717
I personally think
we make a great duo.

1159
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,040
I do too.

1160
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,443
And, since I have
a little time on my hands,

1161
00:58:02,543 --> 00:58:04,285
I was thinking
I could stick around

1162
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,646
for a few more weeks
in Bellville.

1163
00:58:05,746 --> 00:58:07,688
Well, that's great!

1164
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,810
I mean,
we could write another song.

1165
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,331
Maybe we could try
to perform at a coffee shop

1166
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:12,613
or something like that?

1167
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:15,255
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

1168
00:58:15,355 --> 00:58:17,457
(phone ringing)

1169
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:20,300
Um...shoot.

1170
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,742
I should take this.

1171
00:58:21,842 --> 00:58:23,463
Take it in my room.

1172
00:58:23,563 --> 00:58:24,945
I'll make us
some hot toddies.

1173
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,047
Okay, thank you.

1174
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:47,527
Travis through door: The song's
called "A Christmas Melody".

1175
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:48,728
It's amazing, okay?

1176
00:58:48,828 --> 00:58:50,049
You're not gonna
believe your ears.

1177
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:52,351
No, I swear.
(chuckling)

1178
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,215
No, I have it
on my phone right now.

1179
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:58,337
We already submitted it
through more official channels

1180
00:58:58,437 --> 00:59:01,520
but, if you want, I could
send it to you right now.

1181
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,064
Okay.

1182
00:59:05,164 --> 00:59:07,486
Yeah. Just a sec.
(clearing throat)

1183
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:11,530
(composing email)

1184
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,754
Okay, it should be
in your inbox now.

1185
00:59:15,854 --> 00:59:17,996
Thanks. I mean,
this could have a big impact

1186
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,318
and I really appreciate
you giving it a listen.

1187
00:59:20,418 --> 00:59:22,080
Oh, um,

1188
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,483
do me a favor
and just keep this between us.

1189
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:28,406
You know, I don't want anyone
to know that I did this.

1190
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:31,129
Well,
you know how people are.

1191
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:33,851
Especially musicians,
yeah.

1192
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:35,733
(chuckling)
No.

1193
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,835
Hey, thanks again.

1194
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:42,320
(sighing)

1195
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:47,805
(sighing)

1196
00:59:59,256 --> 01:00:00,637
All right,
hot toddy time!

1197
01:00:00,737 --> 01:00:02,779
I think you should leave.

1198
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:06,403
I thought we were doing
gingerbread houses.

1199
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:09,025
Mine's finished.
Goodbye, Travis.

1200
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:14,631
Are... are you for real?

1201
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:22,959
Okay. If that's what you want,
I guess I'll see you in school.

1202
01:00:32,488 --> 01:00:34,710
I can't believe
this is happening again!

1203
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:38,554
This is exactly the reason
why I left the business.

1204
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:41,197
People are just so ruthless
when it comes to getting ahead.

1205
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:43,159
Even people in Bellville,
I guess.

1206
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:45,241
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry he did that to you.

1207
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,762
What a jerk.

1208
01:00:46,862 --> 01:00:48,964
Who woulda thought?
- I wanna come back to New York.

1209
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:51,326
But what about your mom?

1210
01:00:51,426 --> 01:00:53,428
Isn't this performance
important for her?

1211
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,571
Yeah.

1212
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:57,933
Her school arts funding
depends on it.

1213
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,696
- Then you can't leave, right?
- No.

1214
01:01:00,796 --> 01:01:03,378
Ugh! I'm just so mad!

1215
01:01:03,478 --> 01:01:06,902
Okay. You are gonna
get it out tonight.

1216
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:08,904
Channel it into a song
and tomorrow,

1217
01:01:09,004 --> 01:01:10,585
you are gonna
pull yourself together

1218
01:01:10,685 --> 01:01:13,028
and you are gonna move on.

1219
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,129
You got this, babe.

1220
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:18,593
I know.
Thanks, Whitney.

1221
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:21,396
You sure
you're gonna be okay?

1222
01:01:21,496 --> 01:01:23,358
Yeah.

1223
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:26,000
I just really liked him,
that's all.

1224
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,883
Whitney:
I know you did. Goodnight, babe.

1225
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:31,185
Thanks again. Bye.

Abby, is everything okay?

1235
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:12,485
I just wanna check in.

1236
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:13,846
I... I'm fine, Mom.

1237
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:16,489
I just had a private call,
that's all.

1238
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:18,251
Hmm.

1239
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,052
I'm gonna ask again.

1241
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:24,897
It's fine.
Just work stuff.

1242
01:02:24,997 --> 01:02:28,421
Okay, well, I'm making Christmas
fudge for the pageant

1243
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:30,983
if you wanna help?
Might make you feel better.

1244
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:34,827
Uh, I think I'm gonna pass
if that's okay?

1245
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:37,509
I'm just not really in
the Christmas fudge mood.

1246

Abby, where have you been?

1253
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:13,744
I've been calling you nonstop.

1254
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:16,307
Well, I only came here
to drop this off.

1255
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:19,110
You left it at my place.

1256
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,271
Wait,
what's going on with you?

1257
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:21,672
Hey, Miss Walker.

1258
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:23,834
Uh, we didn't see you
at practice today.

1259
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,156
Everyone missed you.

1260
01:03:25,256 --> 01:03:26,917
I'm sorry, Ethan.
Something came up.

1261
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:28,559
But don't worry,

1262
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:30,601
I'll be there tomorrow
at the tree lighting ceremony.

1263
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:33,524
I wouldn't miss your big debut
for the world.

1264
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:35,285
Do you have any tips
about stage fright?

1265
01:03:35,385 --> 01:03:36,647
I didn't think
I'd get this nervous.

1266
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,208
Oh, you'll do great!

1267
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:40,250
But if you do get a little
nervous, just, you know,

1268
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,894
close your eyes like I said
and get lost in the music.

1269
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:45,495
It always works for me.

1270
01:03:45,595 --> 01:03:47,537
Okay, thanks.
I'll try it.

1271
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:50,140
See you later, Miss Walker.
- See you soon!

1272
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,242
Okay, wait. Abby!

1273
01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:58,528
(phone ringing)

1274
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:02,672
Brenda! Uh, did someone
respond to the song?

1275
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:06,035
Actually,
it's me, McKayla.

1276
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:08,598
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

1277
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:10,680
Abby:
Oh, hey, McKayla. What's up?

1278
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,921
Abby,
I just thought you should...

1279
01:04:12,021 --> 01:04:13,763
Is that Abby?

1280
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:15,324
Abby,
I'm so glad you called.

1281
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:16,966
Uh, you called me.

1282
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,488
So, I sent your song out

1283
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,570
and usually we hear back
within a day,

1284
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,013
but no one's interested
so far.

1285
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:26,255
I'm so sorry, Abby.
- Oh.

1286
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:29,658
But the corporate gigs are still
available if you're interested.

1287
01:04:29,758 --> 01:04:31,620
They really want you back,
Abby.

1288
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,582
They said
they'll double your pay.

1289
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:35,063
Great.

1290
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,265
So, what do you say?
Back in with the ads?

1291
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:41,149
(sighing)
Sure. Why not?

1292
01:04:41,249 --> 01:04:43,952
Guess sometimes you just have to
accept the things you're good at

1293
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:45,233
and the things you're not.

1294
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,036
Thattagirl.
You won't regret this.

1295
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:49,998
I'll have McKayla send over
the paperwork straight away.

1296
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:53,201
So, we need to set up meetings
as soon as possible.

1297
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:56,564
Can you come back tomorrow?
- Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1298
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:59,247
I have a tree lighting
ceremony performance.

1299
01:04:59,347 --> 01:05:00,768
Okay,
what about the next day?

1300
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:02,210
Christmas Day?

1301
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,252
No, sorry, that's right.

1302
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:06,133
Offices are closed. Um...

1303
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,896
So, let's do the 26th.
First thing in the morning?

1304
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:11,378
I guess I can be back then.

1305
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:14,782
I just have to leave to go back
to New York on Christmas Day.

1306
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:17,845
Ah, perfect.
You won't regret this, Abby.

1307
01:05:19,446 --> 01:05:20,988
You know, you can't take
opportunities like this

1308
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,269
for granted.

1309
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:25,512
It's very lucrative,
for all of us.

1310
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:27,834
Yeah. Right.

1311
01:05:27,934 --> 01:05:29,356
Thanks, Brenda.

1312
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:31,458
You're welcome, honey.

1313
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:50,636

1314
01:05:52,758 --> 01:05:53,740
Abby.

1315
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,461
Ugh. Again?

1316
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:57,703
Are you following me?

1317
01:05:57,803 --> 01:06:00,066
It's the only cafe in town.

1318
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,507
- I don't have time for this.
- Whoa, Abby.

1319
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:02,788
Can you talk to me?
What's going on?

1320
01:06:02,888 --> 01:06:04,590
Is this about the song?

1321
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,031
What do you think it is,
Travis?

1322
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:09,275
Oh, by the way,
everyone rejected it.

1323
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:11,236
Oh, I'm sorry, that's...

1324
01:06:11,336 --> 01:06:12,958
that's disappointing.

1325
01:06:13,058 --> 01:06:14,920
Yeah, well, maybe you'll have
better luck as a solo act.

1326
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,683
Huh?

1327
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:20,525
Look, I'll be at the ceremony
tonight but I'm leaving tomorrow

1328
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,287
so you don't have to deal
with me anymore.

1329
01:06:22,387 --> 01:06:24,249
What, you're leaving like
you're going back to New York?

1330
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:25,851
Yeah.

1331
01:06:25,951 --> 01:06:27,532
But I thought you were staying
through New Year's.

1332
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:29,634

Ethan's missing. I may have
spooked him out a little.

Nothing! Nothing.

performing perfectly tonight

1363

Okay, everybody.
We gotta split up.

1369
01:08:15,417 --> 01:08:16,718
Some of you go check
the classrooms,

some of you
sweep the hallways.

1371
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:19,881

What about our performance?
We're next.

1373

Well, we're not going on
without our piano player.

Lila, you stay here

1375
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:27,609

I mean,
where could he be?

No more baseless accusations?

I didn't do anything.

I would do that?

1391
01:09:18,638 --> 01:09:20,620
(chatter)
- Man: Isn't that great?

1392
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,722
(mic feedback)

1393
01:09:23,403 --> 01:09:27,146
And now for our final
performance of the evening,

1394
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,348
please welcome
the Bellville High School Band.

1395
01:09:29,448 --> 01:09:31,450
- (applause)
- Woo!

1396
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,222
(soft crowd chatter)

1397
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:49,128
What do you mean,
he's missing?

1398
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,729
Can't Abby play the piano?

1399
01:09:50,829 --> 01:09:52,851
Well, they're all gone now.
So...

1400
01:09:52,951 --> 01:09:54,092
This is bad.

1401
01:09:54,192 --> 01:09:57,676
- Yeah.
- This is very, very bad.

1402
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,581
Travis: Ethan!
He's gotta be in here.

1403
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:05,243
- Abby: Ethan!
- There he is.

1404
01:10:09,768 --> 01:10:11,189
Ethan, are you okay?

1405
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:13,952
What happened?

1406
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:15,513
I'm sorry, Mr. Tucker.

1407
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:17,795
I don't wanna let you down
but I can't do it.

1408
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:20,678
Of course you can do it.
You were born for this.

1409
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:23,161
What if I mess up,
lose the school's funding?

1410
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,722
It's just
too much pressure.

1411
01:10:24,822 --> 01:10:25,883
You're not gonna mess up.

1412
01:10:25,983 --> 01:10:28,185
But I could.
How do you know?

1413
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:37,334
We'll all take
a two minute break, folks.

1414
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,056
(crowd reactions
of disappointment)

1415
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,238
Just a perfect time to refill
those gingerbread lattes.

1416
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:47,584
I... I...

1417
01:10:47,684 --> 01:10:49,506
What on Earth's going on,
Cynthia? They're all waiting!

1418
01:10:49,606 --> 01:10:51,028
We hit a slight
technical hiccup

1419
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:52,389
but we'll be ready
any minute now.

1420
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:53,830
Any minute!
- Well, I'm telling you,

1421
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,472
I am not impressed by this.

1422
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:57,354
Not impressed by this at all.
- I'm sorry, we hit...

1423
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,516
If these kids can't take
their music program seriously,

1424
01:10:59,616 --> 01:11:01,077
then why should
the school board?

1425
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:03,680
This whole debacle's proven
my instincts were right.

1426
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,222
Our funds could be put
to a much better use elsewhere.

1427
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:15,491
Ethan, look.
No matter how you perform,

1428
01:11:15,591 --> 01:11:18,094
you'd still be showing
that you are more impressive

1429
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:19,735
than 99%
of the people out there

1430
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:23,419
that don't even have the guts
to follow their dreams.

1431
01:11:23,519 --> 01:11:26,662
Remember what I said-
trust your intuition.

1432
01:11:26,762 --> 01:11:28,964
You've got this.

1433
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:32,748
And... and you don't
have to be perfect.

1434
01:11:32,848 --> 01:11:35,330
You just have to make
the audience feel something.

1435
01:11:40,455 --> 01:11:42,457
(phone notification beeping)

1436
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,843
- Uh, guys?
- What's up?

1437
01:11:47,943 --> 01:11:50,325
I just got an email
from the Powell School of Music.

1438
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:52,888
They said they loved the song
and the performance.

1439
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:55,210
They wanna see me
for a final in-person audition!

1440
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,891
Oh my God.

1441
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:58,993
That's incredible,
congratulations!

1442
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,857
Wow, I didn't even know
you applied!

1443
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:04,058
Nice work.

1444
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:05,700
Yeah, that audition tape
we sent in,

1445
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,061
I knew it was gonna
blow their minds.

1446
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:08,783
I didn't even think
it was that good.

1447
01:12:08,883 --> 01:12:10,545
We made it
in like two minutes.

1448
01:12:10,645 --> 01:12:11,906
Audition tape?

1449
01:12:12,006 --> 01:12:13,908
Yeah, he performed
"A Christmas Melody"

1450
01:12:14,008 --> 01:12:15,790
and we sent it
to the admissions coordinator.

1451
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:18,032
That's what you sent?

1452
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,494
Yeah.
What do you think I sent?

1453
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,961
Wait... did you think
that I sent our song out

1454
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:29,062
without your permission?

1455
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,525
Just what you were saying
on the phone.

1456
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,208
It sounded like you...

1457
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,170
Abby, I would never
betray you like that.

1458
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,853
I'm so sorry
I jumped to conclusions.

1459
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:42,976
No, it's okay. I'm sorry
you thought that of me.

1460
01:12:43,076 --> 01:12:45,138
You have nothing
to apologise for.

1461
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:49,863
I let my experience with Casey
Macey cloud my judgment and...

1462
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:51,985
Uh, guys?

1463
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:54,087
Don't we have a song
to perform?

1464
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:56,910
- Yes. We do.
- Uh, yeah.

1465
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,153
Come on, let's get ready.
Let me help you.

1466
01:13:00,253 --> 01:13:02,255
Thanks.

1467
01:13:03,976 --> 01:13:06,659
Put that on.
All right, let's go.

1468
01:13:08,381 --> 01:13:10,423
Abby:
Let's go find the others.

1469
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:15,367
All right, that's enough.
I'm telling them it's over.

1470
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:18,250
Please wait just one more
minute. They worked so hard.

1471
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,352
I'm sorry, Cynthia.

1472
01:13:22,594 --> 01:13:24,817
Boy: Ethan, hurry up!
We're next!

1473
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:26,098
Girl:
We're next! Hurry up!

1474
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:28,340
(sighing)

1475
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,542
- They're here!
- Oh, thank goodness!

1476
01:13:30,642 --> 01:13:32,644
Finally.

1477
01:13:36,248 --> 01:13:37,709
Okay. Okay.

1478
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:39,811
(excited chatter)

1479
01:13:41,893 --> 01:13:43,274
(sighing)
Okay, guys.

1480
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:44,916
I think we gotta stick
with "Deck the Halls".

1481
01:13:45,016 --> 01:13:47,158
It's the song we practiced,
it's the song we know.

1482
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:48,920
It'll be great.
- No.

1483
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,763
We can't end the entire ceremony
on a repeat song.

1484
01:13:51,863 --> 01:13:54,085
We need to wow
Superintendent Davis.

1485
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:56,968
We need to do
"A Christmas Melody".

1486
01:13:57,068 --> 01:13:59,490
Well, we've only practiced
that song in class once.

1487
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:01,492
We don't even have
the sheet music with us.

1488
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:03,494
Yeah, but we've all
practiced it at home, right?

1489
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:04,735
You guys remember it.

1490
01:14:04,835 --> 01:14:06,777
No one's ever heard
the song before,

1491
01:14:06,877 --> 01:14:08,299
so do you really think
it'll make an impact?

1492
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:10,541
You'll sing it for us.

1493
01:14:10,641 --> 01:14:11,582
What?!

1494
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:13,023
No, she's right.

1495
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:14,385
Your voice is incredible.

1496
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:16,387
With you singing
and Ethan's piano playing,

1497
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:18,589
it could save the program!

1498
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:20,811
- Please!
- Please, Miss Walker?

1499
01:14:27,657 --> 01:14:30,060
(impatient crowd chatter)

1500
01:14:32,862 --> 01:14:34,985
Man in audience:
Must be something, right?

1501
01:14:37,627 --> 01:14:39,489
This is the last...
- Woman: Oh.

1502
01:14:39,589 --> 01:14:42,352
- Man: Okay. They're here.
- (applause)

1503
01:14:44,474 --> 01:14:46,916
Man:
Just a little delay.

1504
01:14:58,848 --> 01:15:01,791
And now,
may I present to you

1505
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:05,174
the Bellville High School Band's
performance of...

1506
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,803
.."A Christmas Melody",

1507
01:15:14,903 --> 01:15:18,727
an original song written by
Abby Walker and Travis Tucker.

1508
01:15:18,827 --> 01:15:21,590
(crowd cheering)

1509
01:15:35,203 --> 01:15:37,205
(coughing in audience)

1510
01:15:40,888 --> 01:15:43,311
(playing in soft bell voice)

1511
01:15:43,411 --> 01:15:44,352
(hitting discordant note)

1512
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:47,515
(crowd reactions)

1513
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:49,397
(quietly) You okay?

1514
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:50,918
It's okay.

Thank you,
Bellville High Band

1583

for a truly spectacular
performance!

1584
01:19:53,453 --> 01:19:55,956
I know that our arts program
is in question of funding

1585
01:19:56,056 --> 01:19:57,197
for next year,

1586
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,120
and I for one
have been prepared

1587
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,122
to vote to cut it.

01:20:02,222 --> 01:20:04,684

1589
01:20:04,784 --> 01:20:08,688

an amazing example

of music and talent,

1591
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,653
but community,
educational excellence,

1592
01:20:13,753 --> 01:20:15,975
and Christmas spirit.

1593
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:19,418
And I am happy to say
that I will not be voting

1594
01:20:19,518 --> 01:20:21,300
to cut the funding for
the arts program next year.

1595
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,142
- Ooh!
- Yay!

1596

- Mom, this is amazing!

1600

You all did such a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

1601

You did such a great job

Hello?

1610
01:21:08,806 --> 01:21:12,230
Abby, hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you on Christmas Eve.

1611
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:14,071
I was working late,
I wanted to call you

1612
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:15,713
before leaving
for the holidays.

1613
01:21:15,813 --> 01:21:17,595
Oh, it's not a bother at all.
What's up, McKayla?

1614
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:21,559
I thought you should know,
Brenda never sent your song out.

1615
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:23,080
What?

1616
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,842
McKayla: She's never sent
any of your songs out.

1617
01:21:24,942 --> 01:21:27,644
I only found out a few days ago.
I tried to tell you earlier.

1618
01:21:27,744 --> 01:21:30,687
But why would she not
send my songs out?

1619
01:21:30,787 --> 01:21:32,049
She gets a huge cut

1620
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:33,570
of your corporate
commercial commissions-

1621
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:34,811
more than you know.

1622
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:36,053
She doesn't want you
to quit those.

1623
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:37,494
They're lucrative for her.

1624
01:21:37,594 --> 01:21:40,217
After all these years
she's been lying to me?

1625
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:41,618
McKayla:
Here's the thing.

1626
01:21:41,718 --> 01:21:44,581
I sent your song
to an executive at a label.

1627
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:45,942
She loved it!

1628
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:48,825
She wants to sign you.
- Are you serious?

1629
01:21:48,925 --> 01:21:51,347
I could be your agent.
I'll negotiate a deal.

1630
01:21:51,447 --> 01:21:53,710
That would be amazing!

1631
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,151
Thank you!

1632
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,253
Thank you.

1633
01:21:57,854 --> 01:22:00,356
But make sure that they know
that I have a partner.

1634
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:01,477
We come as a duo.

1635
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:03,639
You got it.

1636
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:06,162
Thanks again, McKayla.
I gotta go.

1637
01:22:06,262 --> 01:22:08,464
Okay. All right, bye.

1638
01:22:13,349 --> 01:22:15,471

1640
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:21,697
Shh. Everybody,

1641
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:24,019
we're about to do
the tree lighting.

1642
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,181
(applause)

1643
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:29,424
It is now with great pleasure
that I light our trees-

1644
01:22:29,524 --> 01:22:32,347
a tradition
that I hope lasts forever,

1645
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,529
along with our arts
Christmas pageant.

1646
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,155
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

1647
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,497
(crowd reactions of awe)

1648
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:51,686
Wow, so beautiful.

1649
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:53,788
Aw, the big one didn't light.

1650
01:22:54,989 --> 01:22:57,351
(indistinct chatter)

1651
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:01,415
Still beautiful.

1652
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:03,537
So, I was thinking,
what do you think

1653
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:05,539
about me sticking around
Bellville for a little bit?

1654
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:08,142
I don't know.
I mean, I'm pretty busy.

1655
01:23:08,242 --> 01:23:10,584
Got a lot goin' on.

1656
01:23:10,684 --> 01:23:12,826
(chuckling)
I'm just kidding.

1657
01:23:12,926 --> 01:23:14,388
Of course I would love
for you to stay.

1658
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:16,870
Well, it'd make it
much easier for us

1659
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:20,153
to keep working together,
making music.

1660
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:23,837
Especially since we're about
to have a record deal!

1661
01:23:23,937 --> 01:23:25,799
Are you... are you serious?

1662
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:27,280
I am!

1663

1664
01:23:29,623 --> 01:23:33,006
- That's... that's incredible!
- Yeah.

1665
01:23:33,106 --> 01:23:34,848
But you know, even if we didn't
have a record deal,

1666
01:23:34,948 --> 01:23:36,449
I'd still wanna sing
with you.

1667
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:40,153
I never wanna stop making music
with you, Travis Tucker.
