1
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,653
Tate, don't leave town.

2
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,599
Will do, Sheriff.

3
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,142
I'll just be in the cafe
getting something to eat.

4
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:30,283
Just don't leave town till I say so.

5
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,063
Some of you carry him over to
the jail cell to bleed out.

6
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,149
We have beef stew or
chicken and noodles.

7
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,859
Beef and biscuits?

8
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,693
Coffee?

9
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:12,693
Yeah.

10
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,699
Hey, I know who you are.

11
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,359
You're the one who just killed The Kid.

12
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,733
Killing didn't seem to
ruin your appetite none.

13
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,283
I guess you do a lot of
that, don't you, Tate Butler?

14
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,194
Don't bother my customers, Wilson.

15
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:32,049
You might scare him off.

16
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,049
Gunfighters don't get
scared off by nothing,

17
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,879
do they, Tate Butler?

18
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,703
Yeah, yeah, you're a tough guy.

19
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,720
You don't have to talk to him

20
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,171
if you don't want to, mister.

21
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,128
He's just a nosy old gossip.

22
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,929
Now, that's not a nice thing to say

23
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,730
about one of your regular customers.

24
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,876
That's all
right, miss. Thank you.

25
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,779
You got nice manners.

26
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,569
You from back East?

27
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,117
Indiana.

28
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,749
They don't got
no gunfighters in Indiana.

29
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,749
Is that why you out here.

30
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,549
I'm out here for the same
reason everybody else is.

31
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
Gold?

32
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Adventure.

33
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,109
Adventure? Well, you got
lots of that, didn't you?

34
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,332
It's a real adventure when
everybody's trying to kill ya.

35
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,903
Katherine, I saw you out there earlier.

36
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,889
You can't protect him
from behind a barrel.

37
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,593
And even if you could this time,

38
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,069
there's always gonna be another gunfighter

39
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,289
trying to kill him.

40
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,789
So?

41
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,129
Stay away from Tate.

42
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,658
He's no good.

43
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,403
I'm a grown woman and
I'll do what I want.

44
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,049
I can't just stand by and
watch you make a mistake.

45
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,059
How could a father just let
his only daughter get hurt

46
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,189
without saying something?

47
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,713
Well, you said
your piece now leave.

48
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,419
You lost the right to be
my father a long time ago

49
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,943
when you left my mother.

50
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:26,949
You won't be Tate Butler's wife.

51
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,950
You'll be his widow.

52
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,519
I hate to admit it, Katie dear,

53
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,813
but he might be right.

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,299
Coffee, Sheriff?

55
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,377
That would be lovely, darlin'.

56
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,149
Pie?

57
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,069
That does look good.

58
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,170
You talked me into it.

59
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,129
He shot first.

60
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,619
I know. You're safe.

61
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,239
The Kid had a $200 bounty
on his head, dead or alive

62
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,459
so you'll be collecting some money.

63
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,349
Oh, that's lucky.

64
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,199
I'll sell his horse, his saddle,

65
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,009
and his personal items
to pay the undertaker

66
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,649
but then you need to get out of town.

67
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,069
I can't be having gunfights
in the middle of Main Street.

68
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,729
And he may have family coming after you.

69
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,179
Yeah, it wouldn't be the
first time. I understand.

70
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,479
You're getting slow. He beat ya.

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,803
But his aim was bad.

72
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Well, you won't last long

73
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,299
now that you're slowing down.

74
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,529
You just got lucky this time.

75
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,959
Why don't you go home?

76
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,499
Wherever that is.

77
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,925
Family'll hide ya.

78
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:51,163
Dad died,
Mom remarried, and I left.

79
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:55,146
Well, why don't you find religion?

80
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,063
Me?

81
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,629
Religion? That's a good one.

82
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,869
Hey, there's a church over in Riverton.

83
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,699
It's got a new pastor.

84
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,163
Says he wants to tame the West.

85
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,920
Brice Smith is the new pastor's name

86
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,913
and he's let it be known

87
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,343
that he wants to help people like you.

88
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,729
Seems to me that may be
just what you're looking for.

89
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,663
Yeah. Why don't you go find religion?

90
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,843
Or Mexico?

91
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,349
I don't care which one.

92
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,350
Fine.

93
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll have your reward
money tomorrow afternoon

94
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,288
but then you need to leave town

95
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,573
and leave Katherine alone.

96
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,570
Thanks.

97
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,709
Hey.

98
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,543
Hmm?

99
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:59,259
You want something else?

100
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,539
No. What I want I can't have.

101
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
What?

102
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,023
No, not that. Oh God.

103
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:15,024
Oh.

104
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:40,779
God all I've got is beans.

105
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Ah.

106
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,659
You can eat that or I'll
take you down to the river

107
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,579
and we can get you some of that
new green grass if you want.

108
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,002
It's up to you.

109
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:54,173
All I know is that if I want
Katie, I've gotta fix this.

110
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,623
She deserves better.

111
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,289
Say that guy, Wilson,

112
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,779
he was talking about a preacher,

113
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,513
same name as my baby brother,
helping guys like me.

114
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,709
You think my baby
brother might've followed me

115
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,893
all the way out here?

116
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,563
No, I don't think I'm worth
following out here either.

117
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,683
No, I don't think I talk too much.

118
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,059
All I know is that you and I regardless

119
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,660
are gonna have to go to
Riverton if I want the girl.

120
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,890
Say, I wonder...

121
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,803
I wonder if my baby brother
would even remember anything.

122
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,112
I hope so because his father
was a miserable old bastard.

123
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:42,013
You talking to yourself again, Tate?

124
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,399
I have to, nobody else
listens to me anymore,

125
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,289
not even Dusty.

126
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,069
That was a close one today.

127
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,759
Yeah, I'm getting too
old for this nonsense.

128
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,013
You and me both.

129
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,693
I worry about you?

130
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:07,249
So when can we stop this sneaking around?

131
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,419
Oh, well, probably just as soon

132
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,929
as I'm done killing 'em all.

133
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,669
No, seriously.

134
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
I don't know.

135
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:17,063
We could run away to California.

136
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,339
Hmm.

137
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,379
Yeah, we could, but somebody
there would probably

138
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,769
recognize me and it would
just start all over again.

139
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,963
Speaking of starting all over again.

140
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,889
Ouch!

141
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,579
I wish you didn't have to
wear that gun all the time.

142
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,349
Yeah. You and me both.

143
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,040
How 'bout I take it off for you?

144
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,730
You awake?

145
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,910
Oh.

146
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,783
Well, I am now.

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,403
Couldn't really sleep.

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,779
I kept wishing that things were different.

149
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,447
Well, they're not.

150
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,256
Couldn't you just stay
out here for a little while?

151
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:05,309
And come back into town
like nothing happened.

152
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,049
Maybe even get a job.

153
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,057
All those gunfighters will
have to leave eventually.

154
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:11,589
I was asked to leave.

155
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,736
He didn't mean it.

156
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,123
Oh, yes he did.

157
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,459
And I can't blame him.

158
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,689
That was the third gunfight
on Main Street this month.

159
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,483
Then what are we gonna do?

160
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,163
Well, I could go to Riverton,

161
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,139
wait my time out there,

162
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,788
and wait until I hear all
the gunfighters have left.

163
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,849
Then...

164
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,850
Then what?

165
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,129
Well, there's a preacher in Riverton,

166
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,773
same name as my baby brother.

167
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,419
So I've gotta check that out.

168
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
Preacher?

169
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,209
You're related to a preacher?

170
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,379
It's possible.

171
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,149
You know, my mother was
a God-fearing woman.

172
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,249
Maybe she brought up my
brother in the faith.

173
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,199
Why didn't none of
that ever rub off on you?

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,529
Oh, I tried it.

175
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,799
I prayed every night that my
stepfather'd stop beating me.

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,633
When it didn't work,

177
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,763
I gave up on praying and I left.

178
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,159
Mm.

179
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,806
Say, when can I see you again?

180
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:20,069
I'll try and sneak away from the store.

181
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,549
Mama gets real tired nowadays.

182
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,936
It's hard for me to leave her.

183
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,119
Can I buy ya lunch at the cafe

184
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,540
once you get all cleaned up?

185
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,166
Not with Wilson
hanging out there all the time.

186
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,551
Hm. Maybe I'll just
have to shoot him too.

187
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:40,280
No, I'm just kidding.

188
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,479
Living a Christian life
is harder than it looks.

189
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,979
All around us are temptations

190
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,929
that can keep us from our goals.

191
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,239
Directly after today's service

192
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,069
we're going to have a
celebration of baptism

193
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,869
down at the river where our new members

194
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,489
will receive their shield of protection

195
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,393
and all are welcome to attend.

196
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,119
The good book tells us
how God wants us to live.

197
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,689
It's not a suggestion

198
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,819
but a guide to find eternal salvation

199
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,039
which is the only way to
achieve true happiness.

200
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,759
The 10 Commandments keep it simple for us.

201
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,369
Love they neighbor.

202
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,189
Don't cheat on your wife.

203
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,509
Don't kill.

204
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,959
Love God.

205
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,329
Could it be any clearer than that?

206
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,509
We strive to follow

207
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,633
but God provides forgiveness
for those who fall short.

208
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,449
God loves us because we are his children

209
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,589
and parents love their
children unconditionally

210
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,290
even when they do something wrong.

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,960
That is the good news for today.

212
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,939
Now, let us stand and sing
our praises to the Lord.

213
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,459
Lucy, what hymn are we going sing today?

214
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,239
Well, since we don't have any hymnals

215
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,079
how about "Shall We Gather by the River"?

216
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,039
Everyone knows that.

217
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,490
Now let's follow me down
to the river as we sing.

218
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:17,259
♪ Shall we gather at the river ♪

219
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:22,788
♪ Where bright angel's feet have trod ♪

220
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:28,127
♪ With its crystal tide forever ♪

221
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:32,204
♪ Flowing by the throne of God ♪

222
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,613
This must be the place.

223
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,269
Wonder if I should wait
until the music stops

224
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,669
or if I should just go in.

225
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,203
I'm looking for a sign, Dusty.

226
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,149
Oh, well, there's my sign.

227
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,233
Spelled the correct way and...

228
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
Why hello.

229
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,729
Hello.

230
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,130
Would you like to join us?

231
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,669
I guess.

232
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,239
Everyone's out back by the river.

233
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,899
There's a baptism today.

234
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,139
Come with me.

235
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
All right.

236
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,495
Come on, Dusty.

237
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,343
I think you're too big to baptize.

238
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:20,586
In the name of the father

239
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,853
and the son, and the holy ghost.

240
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,113
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

241
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:36,119
Hallelujah!

242
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,999
Tate.

243
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,706
Long time, little brother.

244
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,499
12 years.

245
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,309
Honey, would you like a towel?

246
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,379
No that's why God created
hot, dry breezes.

247
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,180
I need to go finish the Lord's work.

248
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,483
So you're Tate.

249
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:55,004
That was quite an entrance you caused.

250
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,009
I was trying to sneak in unnoticed.

251
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,629
It didn't work.

252
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,529
I'm your sister-in-law Lucy.

253
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,623
Oh. Oh pleasure to meet you.

254
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,660
When Mama was ill,

255
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,966
I took care of her

256
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,923
and she made me promise I'd find you.

257
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,510
You broke her heart when you left.

258
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,046
You sold the place?

259
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:18,970
I had to.

260
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,578
I couldn't take care of it all by myself.

261
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,618
Yeah, of course.

262
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,199
I didn't get much for it.

263
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,659
And I used the money to go to college.

264
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,033
There's no inheritance for you.

265
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:30,489
I didn't expect any.

266
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,259
I'm just, I'm glad you got some
decent schooling out of it.

267
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,029
I was worried you'd be mad.

268
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,183
It was originally your father's place.

269
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,206
When I saw your name in one of those

270
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:45,520
"Guides to Gunfighters
of the Wild West" books,

271
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,129
I knew it had to be you

272
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,189
and I could keep my promise to Mama.

273
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,449
Well, I'm glad you did.

274
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,259
I always wondered what
happened after I left.

275
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,760
I wasn't surprised you
went down the wrong path.

276
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,843
Yeah. About that.

277
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,599
Those books are just crap.

278
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,419
I'm not a gunfighter.

279
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,679
I don't go looking for gunfights.

280
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,229
They come looking for me.

281
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,569
Call themselves shootists,

282
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,543
or, you know, Caballeros, whatever.

283
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,709
They're all just morons and murderers,

284
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,360
just trying to kill me to
make a name for themselves.

285
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,049
They don't know you're here.

286
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,759
Everyone thinks you're my brother.

287
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,047
Yeah, just give it
some time. It'll happen.

288
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:34,259
Morning, Reverend.

289
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,119
Marshall, this is my brother Tate.

290
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Tate this our sheriff.

291
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,019
He used to be a federal marshal

292
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,585
before he moved to our town.

293
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,369
Yeah, I heard your brother was in town.

294
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,370
That's why I'm here.

295
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,760
I know who you are, Tate Butler.

296
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,229
I'm just here to visit my brother.

297
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,230
That's good.

298
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,329
I don't want any trouble in my town.

299
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,999
And Mr. Butler, trouble
follows you wherever you go.

300
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,150
I'll be leaving soon.

301
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,119
Good.

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,489
We got enough of your
kind around here already.

303
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,759
I don't like you
trying to run my brother

304
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,610
out of town, Marshall.

305
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,468
He's done nothing.

306
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,749
Not yet,

307
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,170
but he attracts gunfighters

308
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,689
and I don't need that kind in my town.

309
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,670
You've got too many of 'em

310
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:20,079
rehabilitating around here as it is.

311
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,699
As Christians, we must do God's bidding

312
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,529
and help those unable to help themselves.

313
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,883
What would Jesus do?

314
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,330
That's got a good ring to it.

315
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Marshall.

316
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,139
Dinner's ready.

317
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,290
We'll be right there.

318
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,093
That's not very neighborly, Marshall.

319
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,599
Well, my job's to protect the town

320
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,650
not to be neighborly.

321
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,890
You know, Brice,

322
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,439
I'd like to help your brother if I could

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,940
but I can't and protect
the town at the same time.

324
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:00,924
Marshall.

325
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,259
So does Dusty like it here?

326
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,129
Oh, I suppose so.

327
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,607
We do a lotta camping, so,

328
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,529
well, that's a nice change of pace.

329
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,830
Tate's been running
from the young guns too.

330
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,339
That's terrible.

331
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,719
Brice's converts have the same problem.

332
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,049
It's like you just can't
give up gun fighting.

333
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,979
Yeah, I'd like to settle
down and find a place

334
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,453
but they'd just find me again.

335
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,889
Well, no one knows you're here.

336
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,033
Well, the marshal recognized him

337
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,633
and that's why he was here earlier.

338
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,119
We need to tell everyone he's
Tate Smith, your brother.

339
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,199
Yeah, it might be a
little late for that.

340
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,689
Well, it's never too late for prayer.

341
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,690
Uh...

342
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,623
I'd like something a
little bit more tangible.

343
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,369
Tate could buy a place
here, settle down near us.

344
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,030
I'd like to

345
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,299
but your Marshall Pearson
just asked me to leave.

346
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,229
He asked Tate Butler to leave.

347
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,899
Tate Butler lives in Hayward.

348
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,089
Tate Smith lives here in Riverton.

349
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,990
I am not going to lie for him, Lucy.

350
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,079
You could buy the Jensen's place

351
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,959
on the outskirts of town
under the name Tate Smith.

352
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,860
They wanna move back East
and you can get it for cheap.

353
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:32,949
How cheap?

354
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,133
150 or less.

355
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,223
Huh.

356
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,170
You go back to Hayward

357
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,979
and make everyone think you live there

358
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,413
and I'll get you that ranch.

359
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:20,466
Yah!

360
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:25,074
Yah!

361
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,030
So I was thinking about what Lucy is doing

362
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,409
and I'm thinking it just might work.

363
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,852
Does he ever answer you?

364
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:49,869
Dusty is not a big talker.

365
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,199
He's more of a listener.

366
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,309
I'm so glad you're back.

367
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,549
So what happened?

368
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,892
I found my baby brother.

369
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,639
- Really?
- Yeah.

370
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,029
He looks like Mama and he's married.

371
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,589
Well, what's she like?

372
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,169
Oh, she's a strong girl.

373
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,269
Perfect for him.

374
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,159
I am a little worried
that they're not prepared

375
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,279
for how hard life is out here,

376
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,199
but she is helping me buy a ranch.

377
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,399
Well, that's great.

378
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Yeah.

379
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,339
So I was thinking we could
settle down out here.

380
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,839
I could call myself Tate Smith

381
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,309
and we could run some
cattle and grow a garden.

382
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,633
- We?
- Mm-hm, I'm asking, Katie.

383
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,869
Father would never let
me marry a gunfighter.

384
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,079
Well, Tate Smith is a rancher.

385
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,045
You can't fool Father.

386
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,163
I'm gonna change that.

387
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I know.

388
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,429
You know, I never asked for this life.

389
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,109
That book turned me
into something I ain't.

390
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,709
I've just been defending myself.

391
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,543
I know.

392
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:52,009
And sometimes, well,
sometimes I've thought to myself

393
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,669
the only way I was gonna get it to stop

394
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,869
was when I got killed.

395
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,387
No, not like that!

396
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:02,683
I like the name change,
but it might not be enough.

397
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,933
I could grow a beard.

398
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:09,419
Hm. Come by the store
tomorrow.

399
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,569
We'll talk more about it.

400
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,349
All right, I won't
have much time though.

401
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,978
Got some nice brown bread in.

402
00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:15,812
Ooh.

403
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,199
Woman in town makes it for me.

404
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,019
It'll go good with all those
beans you eat.

405
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,959
Besides Mother said she wanted
to start taking long naps

406
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,789
in the afternoons from now on.

407
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,162
Well, okay.

408
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,803
Don't worry about Father.

409
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,329
He's only doing what he thinks he has to

410
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,599
to make up for all those
years he hurt Mama.

411
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,410
Yeah, we're all trying
to make up for something.

412
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,239
I brought you some soap.

413
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
Take a bath in the river for me?

414
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,559
What makes you think
I have time for this?

415
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,319
Don't you love me the way I am?

416
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,046
I like the clean version better.

417
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,073
Bath first.

418
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,683
Oh.

419
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:28,773
Hey!

420
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:32,469
Hey, Butler.

421
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,913
Hey, I'm faster than you, old man.

422
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,373
Hey! You hearing me?

423
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:40,753
Said I'm faster than you.

424
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,939
I got no problem with you, stranger.

425
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,020
Faster than you, old man.

426
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,158
Uh huh.

427
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,170
Hey!

428
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,090
Stop right there.

429
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,203
Nothing good

430
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,819
can come from this, buddy.

431
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,332
I ain't your buddy.

432
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,093
I'm just saying I'm faster than you.

433
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,509
Yeah, you probably are.

434
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,769
Let's not fight about it, huh?

435
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,329
You're yellow.

436
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,769
I'm gonna show to everyone
here that I'm faster than you.

437
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,857
Who cares who's faster.

438
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:32,858
I don't.

439
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,969
I do.

440
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,970
We all care.

441
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,708
Not so fast, ladies.

442
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,993
Everyone clear outta here

443
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:49,970
'cause there's gonna be a fight

444
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,408
and you better get ready now.

445
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,472
Oh, now be careful, huh?

446
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:55,903
Want a countdown?

447
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:56,959
Do I want a countdown?

448
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,919
I don't wanna do this.

449
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,435
One.

450
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:01,436
Two.

451
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,879
Three.

452
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,459
Lucky again, Tate.

453
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,729
Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.

454
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,889
Well, I couldn't risk it.

455
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,069
Katherine would never forgive me

456
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,785
if I let anything happen to you.

457
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:23,242
Father.

458
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,459
Got these two for you.

459
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,733
What did they do?

460
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,733
Well, Sheriff.

461
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,315
Oh, the Slim Gang.

462
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,316
Yeah.

463
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,109
You two, take 'em to jail.

464
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,223
Come on, move!

465
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,379
That was too close.

466
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,559
Well, the only thing that matters

467
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,563
is making it out alive.

468
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,359
Slim here was wanted

469
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,439
so you'll be collecting another bounty.

470
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,173
Ha! You shot her.

471
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,229
But it's my job.

472
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,239
I can't collect the bounty.

473
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,016
We'll just call it a, an
early wedding present.

474
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,019
What?

475
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,610
Besides once someone's dead

476
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,479
what difference does it make

477
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,559
what direction the bullet came from?

478
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Thank you.

479
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,283
Well, it looks like I won't
need to call the undertaker.

480
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,533
If her aim was better, I'd
be burying the two of ya.

481
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,203
Need to be careful, Tate.

482
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,659
Oh, and when you kill someone,

483
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,829
you take their soul some say.

484
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,239
Now you've gotta battle their demons too.

485
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,073
But you're
the one who killed her.

486
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,770
I know.

487
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,510
Get out of here.

488
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,349
Can I buy you a meal?

489
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,619
I wish I could.

490
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,970
I gotta get back to Mother.

491
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,973
Not here.

492
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,153
Looks like you got lucky once again.

493
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,286
You're gonna live to see another day

494
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,710
thanks to your friend.

495
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,570
I don't know why they wrote
all them books about you.

496
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,199
You don't seem all that fast to me.

497
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,993
When I was in my prime,
I was faster than you.

498
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,713
You were never a fast draw, Wilson.

499
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:24,103
And you never had a prime.

500
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,279
So shut up and stop
bothering my customers.

501
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,979
I'm just speaking my mind, missy.

502
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,723
Ain't a man allowed to do that?

503
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,403
This may come as a rude awakening,

504
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,963
but I'm not a gunfighter.

505
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,669
All those stories in
that book are made up.

506
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,819
The author made them up to sell books

507
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,259
and he used my name because
he liked the way it sounded.

508
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,336
Well, just how much did they pay you

509
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:59,341
for all them made up stories about you?

510
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:01,157
Nothin'.

511
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,359
Nothin'?

512
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,599
Well, you sound to me like you got took.

513
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,824
Drink to that.

514
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:13,019
Whoa!

515
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,573
I see the water was cold.

516
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,919
Ain't it rude to sneak up on a man

517
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,919
when his ammo is wet?

518
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,143
Throw me that towel.

519
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,099
Thanks.

520
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,589
I just got back from Riverton.

521
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,809
You remember that preacher
Wilson was going on about?

522
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,959
Turns out he's my baby brother.

523
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,613
So I'm planning on
buying a place down there

524
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,114
and settling down.

525
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,089
Well, that's good.

526
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,790
I suppose you're gonna try
and take Katherine with ya.

527
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,983
I'm gonna ask.

528
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,369
Well, I'm not one to give advice

529
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,853
on marriage since I
botched it with her mother,

530
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,809
but I hope for Katherine's sake,

531
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,853
she's strong enough to turn you down.

532
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Here's your money.

533
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,829
Put it in the saddlebag.

534
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,380
Throw me those pants, would ya?

535
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,379
I know too much about your kind of life

536
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,633
to want that for her.

537
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,433
She'd be better off a spinster.

538
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:24,753
I am not a gunfighter.

539
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,899
I know you're not a gunfighter.

540
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,699
You're too slow to be a gunfighter.

541
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,149
We saved your butt this time

542
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,739
but you may not be so lucky next time.

543
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,279
And who asks someone to marry into that?

544
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,680
Women don't wanna think
you might not come home.

545
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,293
Katherine's mother asked me to quit once.

546
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,450
When I didn't,

547
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,549
well, you know the rest.

548
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,053
I do. I've heard all about it.

549
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,893
And I am done with that.

550
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,853
Throw me that shirt.

551
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,740
But are the other
gunfighters done with you?

552
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,059
They won't be done with you, son,

553
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,983
till you're dead and six feet under.

554
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,253
So you better watch your back.

555
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,619
Here, Mother, let me help you with that.

556
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,329
I don't need no help.

557
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,329
I can still handle things
around here myself.

558
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,979
I might be old, but I'm
not dead yet, Katie dear.

559
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,619
Mother, I don't like to
hear you talk like that.

560
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,759
Well, it's the truth.

561
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,199
Most people, my age are already dead.

562
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,179
But do we have to talk
about it all the time?

563
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,108
Well, we do so that
you'll know what to do.

564
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:46,039
But when it happens, I'll
call the undertaker, all right?

565
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,063
But do you know what dress
I want to be buried in?

566
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,589
I've got the plot next to your grandmother

567
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,189
reserved for me.

568
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,739
There's one there for you too

569
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,769
and a husband, if you ever get one.

570
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,409
And I hope to God it's
not that Tate Butler.

571
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,989
Oh mother!

572
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,549
You need to know these things.

573
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,529
Well, now I do.

574
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,379
And you need to know
how to order merchandise

575
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,699
for the store.

576
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,893
Fine, okay.

577
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,609
This is how the store is run.

578
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,610
I'll learn it.

579
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,269
You wouldn't have to do it all alone

580
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,039
if you had a man in your life.

581
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,363
Like I said, I can learn it.

582
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,189
You don't need that
bad boy in your life.

583
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,423
You need someone who will help you.

584
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,243
Don't you go making
that same mistake I did.

585
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,919
You think we oughta
risk going to see Katie

586
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
one more time?

587
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,573
I never really properly proposed to her.

588
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,710
I should do that,

589
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:57,059
you know, with a gold ring
and get down on one knee

590
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
and all that.

591
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,663
I mean a proper proposal.

592
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,083
That's, that's the way to do it.

593
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:10,107
Oh, man.

594
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,572
You think I can pull this off?

595
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,143
Course with that reward money,

596
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:21,013
could buy a real nice ring
with that, couldn't I?

597
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,679
Do I go get the ring
or do I go see my girl?

598
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,699
Thanks. That helps a lot.

599
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,610
So I was wondering

600
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,049
if you would help me pick
out a ring for Katherine.

601
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,189
I would love to help.

602
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, thank you.

603
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,468
I need a ring, right,
for a proper proposal?

604
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:48,663
I mean, did Brice have a ring for you?

605
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,658
I have your mother's ring.

606
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,393
My, my mother had a ring?

607
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,149
Apparently yes.

608
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,419
It must be from Brice's father.

609
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,663
My father never had anything
but debt to his name.

610
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,469
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,249
I know you didn't like
your stepfather much.

612
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,159
Yah, it's ancient history

613
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,239
'cause I'm about to
own my own home, right?

614
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,073
That's right.

615
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:16,289
I registered the deed yesterday
under the name Tate Smith.

616
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,159
You registered the deed?

617
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,309
I can move in?

618
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,310
Today if you like.

619
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,230
Dusty!

620
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,019
Dusty, we've got our own home.

621
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,609
Oh, that's wonderful.

622
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,393
Now Katie and I can start a family.

623
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,160
It'll be real nice having
a family around here.

624
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,056
We wanna have a baby too.

625
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:40,009
I just hope Katie says yes.

626
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,900
You're a good man.

627
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:42,769
Of course she'll say yes.

628
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,719
Besides there's not much else
to choose from around here.

629
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,232
Wait, so I get the girl
because the options are bad?

630
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,399
Brother. It's good to see you.

631
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,979
I'm preparing a special sermon on Sunday

632
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,179
and you should be there.

633
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,189
I thought I would address
loving thy neighbor

634
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,499
even though we're all different, you know,

635
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,759
God's lost sheep and all that.

636
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,849
I'm preparing the congregation
for when you move in.

637
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,069
So I should wait a few weeks

638
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,119
until you prepared 'em for me.

639
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,479
No, you should be at
the church every Sunday

640
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,899
showing God your commitment

641
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,199
by putting your butt on the bench.

642
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,359
Yeah, I don't know how to
break this to you, brother,

643
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,159
but I'm not much of a churchgoer.

644
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,169
Well, now you are.

645
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,749
Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has.

646
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,869
God is the one who
makes all things possible

647
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,279
and you must show him your devotion.

648
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,329
Without him in your life,

649
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,559
your life is worthless.

650
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,719
Uh-

651
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,709
- Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has-

652
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,459
- Tate must ask for
forgiveness for his sins.

653
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,593
If he repents, our loving
merciful God will grant it.

654
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,919
If you believe and are
baptized, then you are saved.

655
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,249
And that is your good news, brother.

656
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,569
Yeah.

657
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,009
Even though you've
taken the lives of others,

658
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,919
God will forgive you.

659
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,269
You know, I really wasn't
worried too much about that.

660
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,699
It was self-defense.

661
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,869
Turn all your worries over to Christ.

662
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,169
Yeah, I'm gonna.

663
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,389
I'm gonna go ahead and go
take a look in the new place.

664
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,649
Thank you for all you've done

665
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,399
and I might see on Sunday, Pastor.

666
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,159
It's God's will.

667
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,109
Yeah, till Sunday.

668
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,379
You plan on staying for supper?

669
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
Thanks.

670
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,119
What was all that God forgiveness stuff

671
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,569
you were giving Tate?

672
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,129
Well, he's killed many men

673
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,039
and he has to make himself
right with the Lord.

674
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,873
I'm with him.

675
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:41,429
I think the Lord understands self-defense.

676
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,897
Well, yes, but-

677
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:46,289
- But you're his brother.

678
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,999
He wants to start a new
life with his girlfriend.

679
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,959
That's wonderful but-

680
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,143
- But, you need to be his
brother and not his pastor.

681
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,869
You may have found religion

682
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,613
but you have not found compassion.

683
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,763
God, if you're listening,

684
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,800
please let me have a baby before them.

685
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:33,424
Ladies.

686
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:35,635
Guess not.

687
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,003
There it is.

688
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,313
That's home for now.

689
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,550
Hopefully forever, huh?

690
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,170
Let's go take a look. Yeah.

691
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,426
Boy, does it have promise, huh?

692
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,259
All right.

693
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,045
Well.

694
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:04,045
Yeah.

695
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,133
Well, this is it, Dusty.

696
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,663
This is great!

697
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,143
Let's go check out that barn.

698
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,823
Well, I promised you a barn, Dusty.

699
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
This is home.

700
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,619
What's the matter with you people?

701
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,249
Why can't you accept that we've repented

702
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,543
and changed our ways?

703
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,349
God has forgiven us.

704
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,689
Why can't you?

705
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,109
Come and set with me?

706
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,570
Come and set with me now.

707
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:52,043
Move over.

708
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,723
Rejoice for the day that
the Lord has given us today.

709
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,257
Lucy, "Amazing Grace".

710
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:12,396
♪ Amazing grace ♪

711
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:15,984
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

712
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,658
You had this whole section to yourself.

713
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,899
Yeah well, I guess I look
like I've got something

714
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,174
they might catch.

715
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:27,159
Yeah, well, they'll come around

716
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,495
once their ivory towers start to crumble.

717
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,063
Yeah. I don't mind.

718
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,870
Don't worry about it.

719
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,020
Did you get the ring?

720
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,669
There's one over at the general store.

721
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,009
It's got an emerald and two diamonds.

722
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,459
I told the owner you'd be over
to take a look at it for me.

723
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,719
I'll go tomorrow.

724
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,209
I see you
didn't take my warning.

725
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,949
Marshall. How's Linda?

726
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,783
She's good.

727
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,519
She just left to go home and start supper.

728
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,129
If you hurry, you can catch up to her.

729
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,909
Yeah, I think I'll stick around here

730
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,539
and listen to you try to run
my brother-in-law outta town.

731
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,379
No. I think it more like
a little friendly advice.

732
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,329
It's too late for that.

733
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,730
I've bought a place and
I plan on settling down.

734
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:14,669
You know, you're putting
the town's folk in danger.

735
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,899
They're in no danger from me.

736
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,476
Good.

737
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:21,129
And when your friends come
around looking to kill you,

738
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,780
I'll send them out to your ranch.

739
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,033
Nice of you to put my life in danger.

740
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,969
Just doing my job.

741
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,120
Can't you find a way
to protect Tate too?

742
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,333
You know, if I could
protect him, I would.

743
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,403
That's all right. I'll handle it.

744
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,669
Yeah, but can Katherine?

745
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,070
Have you seen her shotgun?

746
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:05,883
I love you too, Tate.

747
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,429
Good morning, Mrs. Cleveland.

748
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,430
Good morning.

749
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,383
How can I help you?

750
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,049
I wanted to make a Sunday
dress for my daughter.

751
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,050
Oh, well we've got a nice
selection of gingham right here.

752
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,969
Your mother's not here today?

753
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,729
She has trouble sleeping.

754
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,769
Takes her a while to get
going in the mornings.

755
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,770
She'll be in soon.

756
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,283
All old people have those problems.

757
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,239
She was going to order
some pink bolts for me.

758
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,563
Have they come in yet?

759
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:45,849
There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

760
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,779
Let me check the ledger
to see what was ordered

761
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
and what came in.

762
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,463
There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

763
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,949
Well, this one's not bad.

764
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,759
It could work.

765
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,049
How long before more bolts come in?

766
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,423
Could be a month or more.

767
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,343
Well, this will have to do.

768
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,679
Can you put it on our account?

769
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,513
Of course.

770
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,019
And send it to our house?

771
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Absolutely.

772
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,799
Mother, did you order any pink fabric

773
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,593
for Mrs. Cleveland recently?

774
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:43,423
Maybe I did.

775
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe I did.

776
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,049
Or maybe I forgot.

777
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,749
Mother, you don't look well.

778
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,919
Should I go get the doctor?

779
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,749
Doctors are for sick people.

780
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,743
I'm just a little
confused about our stock.

781
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:06,516
Mother!

782
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:53,960
How did you know?

783
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,033
You know how word gets around.

784
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,853
I'm so glad you're here.

785
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:02,814
I don't know what I should do.

786
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,399
Marry me.

787
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
What?

788
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,563
Let me take care of you.

789
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,679
Well, if it's too soon,

790
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,639
I can wait.

791
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,249
I don't know what I should
do about anything anymore

792
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,183
and I'm scared.

793
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,869
Father said he'd help
me out with the store

794
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,423
until I can sort things out.

795
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:45,129
Where are the candied apricots?

796
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,963
Uh, right here

797
00:46:45,964 --> 00:46:47,006
on the middle shelf.

798
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:49,579
- Oh, need to order more.
- That's it for these.

799
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,450
Okay. Thanks.

800
00:46:50,451 --> 00:46:52,011
That'll be two bits please.

801
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,000
It's good for breakfast.

802
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,286
Thank you, ma'am.

803
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:57,162
Oh and I need a pound
of six penny nails.

804
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:58,813
You've got it, Katie.

805
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,369
Pardon me, miss.

806
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,429
I'll be right with you.

807
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,529
Take your time. I'm in no rush.

808
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,530
Tate!

809
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:14,689
Could you take these things
to their wagon for them, Pops?

810
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,690
Sure.

811
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,274
Thanks, Pops.

812
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,833
Looks like you fellas

813
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:28,869
are gonna be doing some whooping.

814
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,789
- We are.
- Yes, we are.

815
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,659
Thank you kindly.

816
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,969
What is going on in here?

817
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,429
Pops is helping me stock the shelves.

818
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,936
I never thought I'd see the day.

819
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,729
How long can you stay?

820
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,949
As long as you need me to stay.

821
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,979
It's not good for you

822
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,779
to be hanging out here, Tate Butler.

823
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
Keep moving.

824
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,919
You still the sheriff?

825
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,429
My deputy's handling
the day-to-day duties

826
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,099
but it's still my jurisdiction.

827
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,259
Hmm.

828
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,569
Well, the apron's a good look.

829
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,689
We need a nanny, I'll
well, I'll send for you.

830
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,034
You should be leaving now, Tate.

831
00:48:06,035 --> 00:48:08,423
You know anyone who
wants to buy a store?

832
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,529
So you decided to leave now, just now?

833
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,769
If Tate can't stay, why should I?

834
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,809
Well, this town depends on the store

835
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,249
and you're the only one
that knows how to run it.

836
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,329
Pops is not the best shopkeeper.

837
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,849
He's more of the run folks
out of town type person.

838
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,069
Yeah, I noticed.

839
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,679
Now, Katie, you know all I
want is what's best for you.

840
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,560
I just wanna help.

841
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:34,360
Well, then get that order
on the counter ready for me.

842
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,973
Give me that ring, Tate Butler.

843
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,705
Oh, don't worry, I'll clean it up.

844
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:59,628
Uh, no, that's all right.

845
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:00,629
I'll get it.

846
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,399
Sorry it took me so long to decide.

847
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,692
That's okay. You're worth waiting for.

848
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:13,249
Working with my father
really helped me decide.

849
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,259
I noticed you two are
getting along better.

850
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,493
Yeah. He's not so bad.

851
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,879
He just wants what's best for me

852
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,573
but he doesn't know how or what that is.

853
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,010
I wish I could get
along with him better too.

854
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,413
- Oops.
- That's okay, Father.

855
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:36,140
Oh no.

856
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,069
I'm just no good at this line of work.

857
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,070
It's all right.

858
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,409
So what happens if
you don't find a buyer?

859
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,299
You still gonna run away with Tate?

860
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,919
I'll hire someone to run the store.

861
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,239
Well, I can help out here
and watch the place for you.

862
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,919
I appreciate that but
maybe I can find someone

863
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,199
a little more experienced.

864
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,319
Don't you think you
should get to know him

865
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,200
a little better?

866
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:01,519
No.

867
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,899
Wouldn't you like a wedding?

868
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,069
Nah, signing some papers with
the judge is enough for me.

869
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,919
Did I show you the ring he gave me?

870
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,666
Oh, that's real nice, Katie.

871
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,499
Oh!

872
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,819
Well, it's just me.

873
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,329
I just snuck in the back
way to avoid being seen

874
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,266
by the guys at the saloon.

875
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:23,267
Huh. Yeah.

876
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,692
What are you looking for?

877
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,253
Just watching people coming and going.

878
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,223
Any gunfighters?

879
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:37,219
Well, some cowboy just
came out of the saloon.

880
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,573
Looks little suspicious.

881
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,850
I think he works at the Bishop's
ranch, but I'm not sure.

882
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:48,789
Ah, he's a hired hand.

883
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,139
Not a gunfighter?

884
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,040
Nah, he wears his gun belt too high.

885
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,719
Can't spend the
afternoon looking out the window

886
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,569
watching for gunfighters anyway.

887
00:50:58,570 --> 00:50:59,403
Why not?

888
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:00,403
It's a waste of time.

889
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,889
Eventually one'll ride in,
come in here, and call me out.

890
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,609
There's nothing we can do.

891
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,260
If a gunfighter's looking for me,

892
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,713
they'll just come in here.

893
00:51:11,714 --> 00:51:12,889
I'm not that hard to find.

894
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,393
I'll tell 'em you moved to Riverton.

895
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:17,843
Tell 'em I'm dead.

896
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,582
Tell 'em you're dead.

897
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:33,039
I could put an empty grave

898
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,178
near mother's in the cemetery
with your name on it.

899
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,083
Yeah, that'd be a neat trick.

900
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,249
What does love thy neighbor really mean?

901
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,700
Is it literal and just
means the house next door?

902
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,559
It means mankind.

903
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,209
It means treating others the
way you want them to treat you.

904
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,559
Do you have to be kind to someone

905
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,299
who doesn't go to your church
or someone you're pretty sure

906
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,300
is not a Christian?

907
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,109
What about the nice man
who's killed another?

908
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,283
Is it really killing if
he's done it during war?

909
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,139
It means love mankind.

910
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,439
Give others the pleasure of your company

911
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,943
and be kind to others.

912
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,360
Have a blessed week.

913
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,719
Thanks, Reverend, good speech.

914
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,219
- God bless you.
- Where have you been?

915
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,189
Katherine's mother died
and I went to be with her.

916
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,609
Oh, so sad.

917
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,429
Thank you, but things being as they are,

918
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:33,829
she wants to sell the store

919
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,830
and move here with me.

920
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:37,649
So do you know anybody
who wants to buy a store?

921
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,483
Hmm, let me think on it.

922
00:52:38,484 --> 00:52:42,389
All right, in other news
she wants to marry me.

923
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,539
Oh, that's wonderful.

924
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,959
Yeah, but the store
is the last obstacle.

925
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,322
Don't worry. It will happen.

926
00:52:48,323 --> 00:52:49,323
All right.

927
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,253
Why are all you lawman
such sneaky bastards?

928
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,099
'Cause it's what we're good at.

929
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,350
Well, what brings you
all the way out here?

930
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,829
Well, I heard that you
were back from the funeral.

931
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:10,929
I got back Sunday
just in time for church.

932
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,880
And here I was thinking

933
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:13,691
that you'd stay there with your woman.

934
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:14,525
Huh!

935
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:16,169
I hate to disappoint you

936
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,379
but I'm not wanted in that town either.

937
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,499
That's why I bought this place

938
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,803
and I plan to settle down.

939
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:23,210
Well, if that were possible,

940
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,313
I'd be happy for you.

941
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,169
I seen some stuff in town this week

942
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,333
and because of Lucy, I sent 'em away.

943
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
Thank you.

944
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:36,809
I don't want any trouble.

945
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,379
Well, as soon as my wife
can sell her store in Hayward,

946
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,280
I'm planning on bringing her out here.

947
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,329
Yeah. Lucy told me.

948
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,503
I sent the Robinsons down to talk to her.

949
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,579
They're good people the Robinsons.

950
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,839
They're poor but they're honest.

951
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,899
Hmm.

952
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,809
Well thank you again.

953
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,679
That's unexpected.

954
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,149
Like I said, I want peace, Mr. Butler,

955
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,763
and I'll get it any way I can.

956
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,573
All I want is peace too.

957
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,023
Well good.

958
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:12,763
Then we got something in common.

959
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Hmm.

960
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,079
Howdy, darlin'.

961
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,412
Oh my God, you came back!

962
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:24,825
I told you I'd be back.

963
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,799
It's been such a long time.

964
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,633
A week.

965
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,319
Yeah, that's a long time.

966
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,979
Say, Marshall Pearson said

967
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,639
that he sent some people to talk to you.

968
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,749
The Robinsons?

969
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,849
Yeah, they came in yesterday.

970
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,279
Been trying to work with
them but they have no money.

971
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,321
I could give give them a
loan, but I'm not a bank.

972
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,013
Maybe I should-
You're wearing my ring.

973
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,006
Did you listen to a word I just said.

974
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,007
Hm.

975
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,376
Be careful of that.

976
00:54:55,377 --> 00:54:58,059
It has my mom's dishes in it.

977
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,279
Why don't you go back inside

978
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,459
and make sure we've got everything, honey?

979
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,973
Is there anything I can do?

980
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,622
Can I help?

981
00:55:05,623 --> 00:55:06,500
Oh, why don't you come over here

982
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:08,349
and help me tie down a few things, Horace.

983
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,350
Sure.

984
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,500
Hey Sheriff, come give me a hand.

985
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,499
Katherine wants a few
of her mother's things.

986
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,529
We'll be back for the hutch.

987
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,562
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it

988
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:25,529
until you can come back
and get it for your home.

989
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,530
Thank you.

990
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,479
Oh, why does everything she want

991
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,613
have to be so heavy?

992
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,379
Things just aren't gonna
be the same around here

993
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,749
with Katie gone.

994
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,319
Ah, don't worry.

995
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,963
We'll be back from time to
time to check on things.

996
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:46,993
Well, I'll keep an eye
on things here for her.

997
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,950
Thank you.

998
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,419
Robinsons know where you are?

999
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,270
Yeah, but they're sworn to secrecy.

1000
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,089
But can they be trusted?

1001
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,009
Well, if they wanna keep
running the general store,

1002
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,659
they'll keep to themselves.

1003
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,609
I think I've got everything for now.

1004
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,329
Well, don't worry, Mrs. Butler,

1005
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,280
we'll take care of things here for you.

1006
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,853
Oh, I mean Mrs. Smith.

1007
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,279
It was just an honest mistake.

1008
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,819
He didn't mean anything by it.

1009
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,509
It won't happen again.

1010
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,359
A mistake like that could
get my husband killed!

1011
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,749
Yeah, it's just sort of really important

1012
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,459
that you remember from now on

1013
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,419
we're the Smiths.

1014
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,999
Yes, sir. Smiths.

1015
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,849
Yes, sir, Smiths from now on.

1016
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,399
That's right?'

1017
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,150
- The Smiths.
- Smiths.

1018
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:44,809
All right, Katherine,
we gotta get going.

1019
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,841
We got a long way to go.

1020
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:52,267
Whoa.

1021
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,650
Remember we've got that one last stop.

1022
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,713
Take a seat anywhere, mister.

1023
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,196
That ain't no mister.

1024
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:10,643
That's Tate Butler.

1025
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,199
Mornin', Wilson.

1026
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,619
I see you're headed out of town.

1027
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,009
I'm headed to Riverton.

1028
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,807
I'm giving up running for a livin'.

1029
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:22,245
You're leaving?

1030
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:27,989
Uh, I wonder, if before you leave,

1031
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,723
could you sign my book for me?

1032
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:34,874
Only for you would I
sign that vile thing.

1033
00:57:35,796 --> 00:57:38,039
Well, I'm here to stop you from moving.

1034
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,359
I don't want you in my town.

1035
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,233
I've already bought a place

1036
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:43,299
and the wagon's packed.

1037
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,739
And I owe it to the fine
peaceful loving citizens

1038
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,239
of Riverton to keep you
from moving to my town.

1039
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,859
Well, if that's what they pay you to do,

1040
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,949
then I guess you're just
gonna have to do it.

1041
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,429
Get in that wagon.

1042
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,939
Get outta town.

1043
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,349
You can't prevent me
from moving to Riverton.

1044
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,600
I don't wanna have to
kill you, Mr. Butler.

1045
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:07,753
But if you intend to head to Riverton,

1046
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,829
I'll do just that.

1047
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,649
You're not gonna prevent me

1048
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,473
from taking my wife to Riverton.

1049
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,770
Then I'm gonna have to challenge you.

1050
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,790
I don't wanna have to shoot you, Marshall.

1051
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,249
There'll be no killing in my place.

1052
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,593
Outside. Now.

1053
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,222
This is gonna be good.

1054
00:58:37,112 --> 00:58:38,762
I don't wanna do this, Sheriff.

1055
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:42,759
Well, get up in your wagon
and head the other way.

1056
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,489
You're not wanted in Riverton.

1057
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,570
I can't do that!

1058
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,270
One.

1059
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,250
Two.

1060
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,985
Three.

1061
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:54,003
Tate!

1062
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,214
I seen it myself.

1063
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:10,420
I seen it with my own eyes.

1064
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,320
Tate Butler, he's dead.

1065
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:22,669
Go on, folks. There's
nothing to see here.

1066
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,683
Someone get me the undertaker.

1067
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:27,380
Did you have to do this?

1068
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,203
I'm just doing my job.

1069
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,270
Someone get this trash outta here.

1070
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,823
Everyone deserves a
second chance, Mr. Smith.

1071
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,739
Good job, Marshall.

1072
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,890
Thanks for aiming high.

1073
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,889
Thanks to the chicken blood
and the sausage casing

1074
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,033
that really worked.

1075
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,449
What made you think of that anyway?

1076
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,795
Oh, I got the idea from
when Pops broke that jar

1077
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:15,629
in the store.

1078
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,129
Thank God the marshal could aim high.

1079
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:20,889
Yes. Thank God Lucy
got him to play along.

1080
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,309
You think the town really believed it?

1081
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,399
Oh, I know Wilson did.

1082
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,350
He'll remember that till his dying day.

1083
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,379
How many hours is it to the ranch?

1084
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,130
All day and into tomorrow.

1085
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,879
This is not what I thought
shopkeeping would be like.

1086
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,166
What did you think it would be like?

1087
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:42,159
More talking to people,
learning about the town.

1088
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,509
Oh, gossiping.

1089
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,916
No. You know I'm not like that.

1090
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:49,249
Whatever you say, dear.

1091
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,519
Well, people in this
town are so standoffish

1092
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,889
compared to Riverton.

1093
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,679
No, they're not.

1094
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,609
This is just a smaller place

1095
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,759
and people have to work
harder to make a living.

1096
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,363
They don't have time to hang
around town talking to you.

1097
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,594
Well, she didn't have
to be so nasty to us

1098
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,959
about running the store for her.

1099
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,669
We're doing her a favor.

1100
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,899
Now now there. She gave us a job.

1101
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,009
She's trusting us

1102
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,523
with this business when
no one else would help.

1103
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,077
Well, she still treats us like dirt.

1104
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,439
I thought you said the
people you bought it from

1105
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,069
left a lot of furniture.

1106
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,609
There's a table and chairs.

1107
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,579
No one can sit in those chairs.

1108
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,423
There's a bed.

1109
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:45,239
I am not sleeping on that.

1110
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,979
It looks like mice are living in there.

1111
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,780
No, I'll put some new straw on it.

1112
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,269
Fine, I'll get you a new bed.

1113
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,149
No, I'll get it.

1114
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,239
Well, I'll go out to the field

1115
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,939
and I'll cut some new straw.

1116
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,773
Thank you.

1117
01:01:57,773 --> 01:01:58,773
Anything else?

1118
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,043
Yeah.

1119
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:05,379
Get me some clean water.

1120
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,403
Yes, dear.

1121
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:23,513
Hey, Tate.

1122
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:24,790
Coming.

1123
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,099
Could you get me some more water please?

1124
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,223
Yes, dear.

1125
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:29,891
Thank you, my man.

1126
01:02:55,837 --> 01:02:57,233
Ah, no smoking in here.

1127
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,023
Two cans of beans and
two pounds of coffee.

1128
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,443
You need me to grind
that coffee for you?

1129
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:26,299
I usually just use a rock.

1130
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,753
Ah, you been on the trail long?

1131
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,669
Well, seems like all my life.

1132
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,249
Oh, what's your name, stranger,

1133
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,500
and where are you headed?

1134
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:42,370
John Scott.

1135
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,723
Just an old man passing through.

1136
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:47,850
Well, you look like you've got

1137
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:50,049
a hoot and holler left in ya.

1138
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,759
Where are you from?

1139
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,023
Original, Indiana.

1140
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,063
But I left there years
ago after my parents died.

1141
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,280
Indians?

1142
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,130
No.

1143
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,620
Fever.

1144
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,993
That's a terrible way to go.

1145
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:12,869
I don't wanna talk about it.

1146
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,083
Horace lost his first wife to the fever.

1147
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,429
I said I don't wanna talk about it.

1148
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,263
He hasn't been

1149
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:20,250
- the same since.
- What is with-

1150
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,180
- That's right.

1151
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:24,159
Anyway, looking for a friend of mine.

1152
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,289
I thought he lived here,
but he might've moved.

1153
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,869
Well, we just moved here ourselves

1154
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,979
so I doubt we're gonna be much help.

1155
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,879
I guess you don't know
where I'd find my friend.

1156
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,293
His name's Tate Butler.

1157
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,249
Tate Butler?

1158
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,166
His name is Smith now
and he moved to Riverton.

1159
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,579
No, it's not!

1160
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,143
Tate Butler got killed in that gunfight.

1161
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:51,379
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1162
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,270
That's right.

1163
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:54,339
Tate Butler's buried in the cemetery.

1164
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,969
You need me
to get you anything else?

1165
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,050
Cemetery, huh?

1166
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:04,336
No, got everything I need.

1167
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,669
What's wrong with you, woman?

1168
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,329
He wasn't no gunfighter.

1169
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:14,549
Then why was he asking about Tate?

1170
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,621
Oh, John Scott.

1171
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,889
What if that
was Deadshot John Scott?

1172
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,059
It doesn't matter who he is.

1173
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,523
You better hope he
doesn't go to Riverton.

1174
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,269
Hm. I didn't mean anything.

1175
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:32,359
Well, just keep it quiet.

1176
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,979
We don't know how it got out.

1177
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,097
I don't know nothing.

1178
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,297
Huh.

1179
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,649
It's good to see both of you.

1180
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,640
How do you feel?

1181
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,308
Terrible.

1182
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,319
I just can't get comfortable.

1183
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,519
Will it be soon?

1184
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,232
I'm supposed to have another month.

1185
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:26,589
I just want it to be over.

1186
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,709
I can't live another month like this.

1187
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,249
All I do was lie in bed and get fatter.

1188
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,669
I would change places
with you in a minute.

1189
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,989
And I don't look forward
to that bumpy wagon ride

1190
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,299
all the way home either.

1191
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,363
Coming, I thought I had
to pee the whole time.

1192
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,719
Get back here!

1193
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,823
What do you want?

1194
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:49,039
Maybe the trip home will induce labor.

1195
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,519
I just can't wait for this baby to arrive.

1196
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,389
Tate, do you know what to
do when she goes into labor?

1197
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:57,390
Well...

1198
01:06:58,318 --> 01:06:59,963
Well, Doc told me a few things.

1199
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,143
I'm gonna go talk to Brice.

1200
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,329
Oh.

1201
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,163
Good morning.

1202
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:07,357
Okay.

1203
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:09,696
Honey, don't let your baby grow up

1204
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:11,323
to be gunfighters.

1205
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,139
God works in mysterious
ways and sometimes

1206
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,743
it's not what we asked for.

1207
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,639
Not all of us are meant to be farmers

1208
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,193
or ranchers or parents.

1209
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,319
God knows what our true purpose is.

1210
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,007
And you must not question him.

1211
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,490
See you next Sunday.

1212
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,189
How's it going, old man?

1213
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,329
How's married life treating you?

1214
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,779
Oh, it agrees with me.

1215
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,030
Maybe a little bit too
much if you ask Dusty.

1216
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,629
So, you know Lucy

1217
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:07,163
would really love to have a baby.

1218
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,379
We've been trying.

1219
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,309
Well, she doesn't need you telling her

1220
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,999
she can't have a baby

1221
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,749
in front of the entire congregation

1222
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,519
in your sermon this morning.

1223
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,409
That's not what I meant.

1224
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,919
Jesus Christ.

1225
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,386
I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry.

1226
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:24,379
But you're a slower draw than I am.

1227
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,853
It came off as mean.

1228
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,638
Maybe you could be a
little bit more sensitive

1229
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:31,089
about her, you know, feelings.

1230
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,699
Advice from my newly
married big brother?

1231
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,813
She was crying.

1232
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:38,370
I didn't see that.

1233
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:39,513
I know you didn't.

1234
01:08:41,487 --> 01:08:43,129
And I know 'cause you're up here,

1235
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,050
you're busy preaching,

1236
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:45,129
you're busy with the Lord,

1237
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,619
and well, I knew that if you knew

1238
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,818
you wouldn't wanna hurt her.

1239
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,710
Thanks.

1240
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,542
You guys have taught me that family

1241
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:53,919
have gotta look out for each other.

1242
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,620
I've got your back, little brother

1243
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:00,665
Someday, I hope to have yours too.

1244
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,515
Well, let's hope you don't have to.

1245
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,410
Lucy.

1246
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,450
You were right.

1247
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,479
I found God and was in such
a hurry to find my brother

1248
01:09:18,618 --> 01:09:20,093
that I lost my compassion.

1249
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
I'm sorry.

1250
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,170
Can I help you?

1251
01:09:39,777 --> 01:09:41,879
I'm looking for Tate Smith.

1252
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,630
What do you want with Tate Smith?

1253
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,179
We have business together.

1254
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,180
Well, that's funny

1255
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,309
'cause I know Tate Smith real well

1256
01:09:52,276 --> 01:09:53,362
and I don't know you.

1257
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,580
What are you his daddy?

1258
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,683
Not exactly.

1259
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,500
I'd appreciate some cooperation.

1260
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,289
You know where I can find Tate Smith?

1261
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,663
What if I was to tell
you I was Tate Smith?

1262
01:10:13,612 --> 01:10:16,319
I'd say you're a liar.

1263
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,287
See, Tate Butler,

1264
01:10:17,288 --> 01:10:19,163
who now calls himself Smith,

1265
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:21,130
is a lot younger

1266
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:23,702
and way better looking than you.

1267
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,993
Oh, aren't you a rude ray of sunshine.

1268
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:29,510
Who sent you?

1269
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,833
Nobody sends me anywhere.

1270
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,570
I'm here to call him out.

1271
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,183
You're a gunfighter.

1272
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,909
Well, keep riding 'cause nobody here

1273
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,503
wants to play your game.

1274
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:47,240
Boy, you're dumber than you look.

1275
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:51,728
You look...

1276
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,993
The years have not been
kind to you, my friend.

1277
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:17,887
Strap it on, Tate Butler.

1278
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:22,422
Now!

1279
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:31,506
Katherine!

1280
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:32,507
Tate!

1281
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:35,600
I think I'm in labor.

1282
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:38,138
I'll be right there.

1283
01:11:38,139 --> 01:11:39,956
Good shot, honey.

1284
01:11:39,957 --> 01:11:40,957
Oh.

1285
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,710
I still look like this.

1286
01:11:55,955 --> 01:12:00,038
But you don't look like
that anymore, Deadshot.

1287
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:02,496
Tate!

1288
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:03,609
I'm coming.

1289
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:04,758
He's dead.

1290
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,430
I know he's dead.

1291
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,616
Can't you see I'm having a baby?

1292
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:11,093
All right, hang on.

1293
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,209
Hurry up.

1294
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,833
Hold your horses.
