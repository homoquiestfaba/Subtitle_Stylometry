You think so?

You're extremely clever.

00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,920
I admire that in a woman.

793
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:19,790
You still don't get it,
do you?

794
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,235
I'm getting close.

to elizabeth?

I told you.

852
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,426
Tell me again.

853
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:13,363
Tell me again because
i don't believe you.

854
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,266
She left you, john.

855
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:21,105
Self-indulgence is the last refuge of the bored.

856
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,673
Have you told him?

857
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,276
Don't.

858
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,111
Then i shall.

859
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:30,380
It was
a sublime funeral.

860
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:33,550
Hundreds
of white irises.

861
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:36,153
Nothing but
white irises.

862
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:39,789
Elizabeth would have
loved it.

863
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,244
Oh, no.

864
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:35,672
Tell me why, lea?

865
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:38,775
I can't help you,
john.

866
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,345
Well, you should have
thought about that

867
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,880
before you started
lying.

868
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,688
You're gonna tell me
how she died.

869
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:58,362
I didn't have
the heart to tell you.

870
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,768
I thought it would
be best you didn't know.

871
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:06,336
Ah, that's nice.

872
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:11,975
I'm not interested in your, uh,
little excuses.

873
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:19,883
Now, i want you
to tell me.

874
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,554
You want to know
everything, john?

875
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:27,491
I'll show you.

876
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:35,899
I first met
elizabeth at a party

877
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:39,703
for an art exhibition
she was involved in.

878
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:44,474
We liked each other
immediately.

879
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:48,878
One night about 2:00 in the morning,
my phone rang.

880
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,916
I heard a woman crying.

881
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:56,820
It took me a while to realize that it was elizabeth.

882
01:10:56,853 --> 01:11:00,590
She asked me
to come get her.

883
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:03,660
She was strung out
on bad drugs.

884
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,930
Those dealers knew her
by her first name.

885
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:09,766
I hated them.

886
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,302
She'd be fine for months
at a time,

887
01:11:12,336 --> 01:11:14,638
and then she'd
disappear for weeks.

888
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:21,411
And i'd find her
in this hole.

889
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,280
Dead end.

890
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,652
The police found her
in some cheap hotel,

891
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:33,590
but i know it was
this place that killed her.

892
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,741
[Screaming]

893
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,877
man: where's your
pretty blonde sister?

894
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:29,713
Why don't she come
along here no more?

895
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:34,117
We'll just have to make do with your sexy ass.

896
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,919
Aah!

897
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,654
What is this?

898
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,022
You boys like
to play games?

899
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:41,525
Va te faire enculer, toi.
Casse-toi.

900
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:44,561
Il est calibre?

901
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:45,862
Un calibre.

902
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,897
Come on.

903
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,435
Come on.

904
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,571
Fuck you.

905
01:12:57,841 --> 01:12:59,909
Yeah.

906
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,452
Scared?

907
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:14,691
No... not of these
bastards.

908
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,465
Where are you going?

909
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,769
Home.

910
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,110
You know, i never felt
good enough for her.

911
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:38,047
I realized that
the day she left.

912
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:43,086
I was stupid. I had to wait
till she closed the door

913
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,890
till i was able to tell her
how much i loved her.

914
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:54,864
I don't want to be alone.

915
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:57,567
Not now.

916
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:18,822
* Tell me, what did
you dream about? *

917
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:26,996
* Did you run in the sun having fun,
and was i with you? *

918
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:35,639
* And when you dream,
do you dream about me? *

919
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:43,947
* When you speak,
do you talk about me? *

920
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,187
Ah, bonjour, lea.

921
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,221
Madeleine.

922
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:53,122
Ca va?

923
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,023
Ca va bien.

924
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:55,559
Oui.
John gray.

925
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:56,926
Hello.

926
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,963
Oh, it's so nice
to be back.

927
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:09,272
John: you know,
i used to hate coming out to places like this.

928
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:15,912
It's so quiet,
so still.

929
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,047
I kinda like it today.

930
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:21,985
You know the eiffel tower-- the glass ball?

931
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,887
Yeah.

932
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:25,354
It was me.

933
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:28,858
Now, look. I'm gonna
make you a deal.

934
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:29,793
Ok?

935
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:30,894
Mm-hmm.

936
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:34,931
This weekend--
just me and you.

937
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,967
Nobody else.

938
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:40,236
Ok?

939
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,810
Feels good.

940
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:29,152
So you glad
you met me?

941
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:37,627
Why do you feel that you have to ask me that?

942
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:47,136
You need me,
john gray.

943
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:08,264
Sometimes i'd imagine what it
would be like to be with you.

944
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:11,200
How you'd...

945
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:15,338
shut off
the rest of the world

946
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,674
and never let it...

947
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,409
intrude on our pleasure.

948
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:24,547
How you'd
plan everything.

949
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,984
Never hurry a moment.

950
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:30,686
Never neglect a detail.

951
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,224
Well, not this time,
lea.

952
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:48,104
You know, where i came from,
it took me about 16 years

953
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:55,311
to realize that the world that i saw
on my television set every day

954
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:58,314
was really out there.

955
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:03,286
Then it took me another
2 years to work up the courage

956
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:06,289
to find that world.

957
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:12,495
You know, we're a lot alike,
you and i.

958
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,199
We had to invent ourselves.

959
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:26,175
What's the matter?

960
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:31,714
Nothing.

961
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:36,685
Don't treat me like that.

962
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,356
I--i--i'm just
a little confused.

963
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:43,092
No, you're not.

964
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:45,628
Look at me.

965
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:55,071
Ok, picture this.

966
01:22:56,405 --> 01:23:00,443
We're in a whorehouse
in chicago.

967
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,445
It's 1952.

968
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:07,250
And i'm a man
with a problem.

969
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:10,486
We made a deal.

970
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:15,424
We're in a whorehouse in chicago.
It's 1952.

971
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:19,728
Sound familiar?
And i'm a man with a problem.

972
01:23:19,762 --> 01:23:26,535
I can't get excited unless i see
you crawl across the floor.

973
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:36,412
Don't push me, lea.

974
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,683
But i can.

975
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:49,024
I can come to you
if you want.

976
01:23:55,398 --> 01:24:00,136
Come on, john, we both
know what you want.

977
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:42,611
You can't stop me.

978
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:44,480
[Horn honks]

979
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:31,694
you just don't get it,
do you?

980
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:34,397
What?

981
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,791
[Knock on door]

982
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,593
who is it?

983
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,596
Vittorio.

984
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,433
Merde.

985
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:13,636
[Knock on door]

986
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:19,608
sorry, vittorio.
I haven't come to the office

987
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:22,678
but i have
so many things to do.

988
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:23,546
It's not important.

989
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:26,282
When the cat's away,
the mice will play.

990
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:28,751
Wonder where the cat
is tonight? Hmm?

991
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:32,521
Probably screwing on the roof with her tomcat.

992
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:35,558
Or should i say,
her john cat?

993
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:36,525
Do you mind?

994
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:39,695
I don't mind,
and i don't care. I'm fed up.

995
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:43,532
I'm going back
to my little life.

996
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:46,602
Everything--
i gave her everything.

997
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,970
Before she met me,
she was nothing.

998
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,872
She was a vacant, blank,
empty canvas.

999
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:54,743
Stupidity oozed from every pore of
that luscious and delicious body.

1000
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:58,747
I gave her education, taste, sophistication, intelligence.

1001
01:26:58,781 --> 01:27:02,618
I even took her
to the bloody theater.

1002
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,991
I just feel so...

1003
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:10,926
bloody... empty.

1004
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,828
I'm sorry, but...

1005
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:13,896
[knock on door]

1006
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:14,763
i don't
understand you.

1007

Lea? Lea, it's me charlie.
Open the door.

1008
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:22,338
Lea, come on, baby,
it's me. It's charlie.

1009

1011

Claire, where have you been?
What have you been doing?

1012
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:33,716
Why haven't you called me since before the show?

1013
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,584
Claire: i've been busy.

1014
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:37,320

What's he doing here?
Huh?

1018
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:49,698
C'est mon boss, d'accord.

1019
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:50,566
Yes, i know
he's your boss

1020
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,335
but i asked you
what he was doing here.

1021
01:27:52,368 --> 01:27:54,603
Have you been
fucking him?

1025
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:27,803
I just wanted to say

1026
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:31,840
i didn't know anything
about elizabeth.

1027
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:37,346
I know that.

1028
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:44,052
And what happened to you?
Who did this to you?

1029
01:28:44,086 --> 01:28:46,088
Charlie.

1030
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:47,790
Charlie did this
to you?

1031
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:48,591
Yeah.

1032
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:53,496
I was not as grown up
as i thought.

1033
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:58,501
Hey, you're as grown up as you should be.

1034

for me, john,

for you?
