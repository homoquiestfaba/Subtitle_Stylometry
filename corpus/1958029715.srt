In continuing our chapter
on playing in the post,

2
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,791
this next move is called the slam dunk.

3
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,333
When the player is in close range,

4
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,458
he jumps and throws the ball directly
into the hoop using a dunking motion.

5
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,458
We have Billy here to demonstrate.

6
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,583
Why don't you show us
how it's done, Billy?

7
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,750
Sure, Coach.

Well done. How did that feel?

Really good, Coach.

11
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,625
I'll bet.

12
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:26,875
It may look simple, but the slam dunk
is rarely used because of its difficulty.

13
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:30,708
But when it does happen,
it can sure be exciting.

I know volunteering at a hospital is,
like, a good look for colleges,

63

but most of the other kids
at school have jobs and money.

00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,625
Uh, no, you couldn't.

339
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,791
I mean... Hey, guys,
I-I just have a question.

340
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,500
Just curious,
who here thinks Chang can dunk?

[partygoers laughing, booing]

342
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,625
I-I could if I tried.

343
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,208
- No, you couldn't.
- Yes, I could.

344
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,833
Come on.

345
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:32,041
I mean, you could try as hard as you like
but, uh, yeah, you are never dunking.

346
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,125
Okay, says who?

347
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,000
- Uh, says everyone, like…

- [Matt] Ooh. We got a Chang overboard.

351
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,791
- [partygoers laughing]
- Yeah!

352
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,166
- You wanna see a dunk?
- [partygoer 1] Yeah.

353
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,615
- [partygoer 2] That's it.
- [partygoer 3] Here he comes.

That's what I'm talking about.

Thank you, Mrs. O'Neil.

358
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,583
Not at all. Good seeing you.

359
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,791
It's been so long since you've come by
the house and hung out with Matt.

Hey, Susan.

363
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,916
Uh, I-I'm so sorry to worry you like this.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,125
Matt had some friends over
after the game. They lost track of time.

365
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,166
You're wet.

366
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,290
[Mrs. O'Neil laughs] Yeah.
They were horsing around,

367
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,000

Matt invited me to his big game,

380
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,708
Yeah, because you won't let me get a job.

382
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,208
No. Why would you even say that?

[marching band playing
"The Ecstasy of Gold"]

504
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:12,333
Sup, nerd? How do you feel? Better?

505
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:17,875
No. Yo, is this what being old feels like?
'Cause it sucks.

506
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,125
What's that?

507
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,000
Deer jerky.

508
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,833
They're, like,
the super athlete's animals.

509
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,276
Ninety percent fast-twitch muscle.

510
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,166
- Want some?
- Duh. Gimme.

511
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,666
[sighs] Yeah, I barely added an inch.

512
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,392
- It's been, like, one week.
- I know. When is it gonna start working?

513
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,833
Dunking yet?

514
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,666
Uh…

515
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,875
No. But, you know,
it's a process, and I trust it.

516
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,958
[laughing] Okay.

517
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,000
Well, if you're not busy, um…

518
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,833
Need a new pair of sticks.
You said you know a place, right?

519
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,333
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,458
Cool. Did you wanna…

521
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,791
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, I'll meet you over there.

522
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,166
- Yeah, absolutely. Okay.
- Okay. Cool. Yep.

523
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,708
- [grunts]
- [groans]

524
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,666
Dude.

525
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,375
[Lenny] Defense wins championships.

526
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:14,166
In three years, they're gonna be
in the championship. Guaranteed.

527
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,666
I'm telling you.
I can feel it in my bones.

528
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,666
- I'm telling you. I can feel it.
- [door opens]

529
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,375
- Chang.
- [Chang] Hey, guys.

530
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,625
[Lenny] You must be Kristy.

531
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,791
Hi.

532
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,208
[Lenny] Go on. Have fun.

533
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,500
Thanks, Lenny.

534
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,208
Yeah, I just told them
I was gonna bring some people.

535
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,291
- Right.
- Oh. [Laughs]

536
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,291
[Kristy laughs]

537
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,750
Hey.

538
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Wow.

539
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:48,875
[Chang] Sick, right?

540
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,791
Tama's one of my dad's faves.

541
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,416
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

542
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,166
- Is he a drummer?
- Oh, yeah.

543
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,375
He was in two bands growing up.

544
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,625
He was nice.

545
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,958
Did he teach you how to play?

546
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,750
Not at first.

547
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,666
Believe it or not,
I, uh… learned by playing <i>Rock Band</i>.

548
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,958
- [chuckles] The video game?
- Yeah.

549
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,958
He saw me spending so much time on it,

550
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:15,750
and I guess he just thought I needed
to learn how to play in real life.

551
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,916
Sounds like a cool dad.

552
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,166
He was.

553
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,083
He, um, passed.

554
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,208
Cancer.

555
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,583
Oh, uh… I'm sorry.

556
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,125
Don't be. It happens.

557
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,791
Well, I bet he'd be really proud of you.

558
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,541
'Cause you're really, really good.

559
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,291
Thanks.

560
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,333
What about you?
Your dad teach you anything cool?

561
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:52,791
Uh, basketball, I guess.
Yeah, he's a huge basketball fan.

562
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,041
Mm-hmm. So that's why you wanna dunk.

563
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,791
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, he'd probably think it's pretty cool.

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,125
But I actually don't get
to see him that much.

565
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,208
My parents are kinda separated.

566
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,458
Oh.

567
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,875
It happens.

568
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,916
I'm pretty sure they'll get bored
and get back together eventually.

569
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,250
And in the meantime,
I still got basketball.

570
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,083
So, are you gonna try out
for the team then?

571
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,708
Uh, nah.

572
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,041
I mean, everyone already knows
who's gonna make the team.

573
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,166
And I'd just ride the bench.

574
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,666
I just wanna be a baller.

575
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,041
But you'd still be you.

576
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,500
I... Yep.

577
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,125
[imitating Chang]
"Every obstacle is an opportunity."

578
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,708
- I knew you were gonna say that.
- [Kristy laughs]

579
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,291
Do you wanna hear something
my dad taught me?

580
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:50,958
Hell yeah.

581
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,000
- Boom.
- It is a great multivitamin.

582
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,291
[shivers]

583
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,291

606
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,791
[Bo] Dude, who edited this?
This is amateur.

607
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,595
[Chang] Yo,
who cares about the film making?

608
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,017
- He's hooping in cosplay.
- [scoffs]

609
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,500
And he lives two towns over.

610
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,463
Well, he's got less than
a thousand subscribers.

611
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,833
- Couldn't you ask someone more legit?
- I did, all right? They all ignored me.

612
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,041
Apparently, he played overseas.
He's a two-time Estonian League MVP.

613
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,166
Okay, I guess. So, what's the plan?

614
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,708
I'm meeting him at the Galleria today.

615
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,375
When? Better be after our shift.

616
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,041
- Uh…
- [Bo] Dude! [Scoffs]

617
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,750
Come on.

618
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,750
You're gonna get
into all the good colleges.

619
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,750
Uh-huh, yeah, as well as be a good person
who likes to help other people.

620
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,416
- Hmm.
- [Bo moans]

621
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,208
How are you gonna get there?
The Galleria's far.

622
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,666
[Chang] My mom's giving me a ride.

623
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,083
I still need to get my phone, so
I told her all the best deals are there.

624
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,458
[chuckles] All right.

625
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,791
Good luck, buddy.

626
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,875
- [Bo, mockingly] "Good luck, buddy."
- [chuckles]

627
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,291
Well, can't you go
during your lunch break?

628
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,017
- [Chen] No.
- You haven't started your rounds.

629
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,041
I know that.

630
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,625
You can go. Great.
We'll figure it out. Just…

631
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,083
- [Chen] Tomorrow I'll come in early.
- Go, Chen. Thank you.

632
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,166
- [Chen] Sorry.
- Am I wrong? No?

633
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,166
Is everything okay?

634
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,583
Why did we have to come this far?

635
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,875
I told you, there are better deals
at the store here.

636
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,083
Your phone's still expensive.

637
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,166
[sighs]

638
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,458

{\an8}[in Mandarin]

640
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,666
[in English] It was an accident.

641
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,375
It's okay. It's nothing.

642
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,583
I can take the bus home.

643
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,791
You can just drop me off. If that helps.

644
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,666

645
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,958

I thought about what you said.

646
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,833
I'm going to start sticking with things.

647
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I promise.

649
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,291
[in English] Okay.

650
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,875
Ah. My mans right here got good taste.

651
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,875
I wish, man. I can't afford this.

652
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:54,083
Oh. My brother, that's a easy wish.

653
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,125
Yeah, get yourself a solid job
with some good commission,

654
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,958
and you'll be sending honeys 8K selfies
with a Leica lens in no time.

655
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,333
No time at all.

656
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,500
Coincidentally,
we're hiring if you want an app.

657
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,458
Deandre?

658
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,291
Oh, shoot. Do we know each other?
I owe you money or something?

I DMed you.
We were supposed to meet at 2:00?

660
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,438
Oh, right. Yeah, you're the kid
who wants to learn how to dunk.

661
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,980
You said you were a basketball coach.

662
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,541
I am. You said you were 6'0".

663
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,125
- [laughs]
- This is dumb.

664
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,500
Yo, yo. Come on, man. I'm sorry, okay?

665
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,250
We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's try this again.

666
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,208
[clears throat] I'm Deandre Cooke.

Yeah.

669

Yeah, okay. Nice to meet you.

670
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,208
So, how much height do we need?

671
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,666
Just raise it back up when you're done.

672
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,500
Oops. Ah. Too far.

673
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,916
Now this guy here's a county legend.

674
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,791
Buckets Cooke.

675
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,625
You listen to him.

676
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,083
[Deandre] Thanks, Mr. J.

677
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,208
Yikes. Okay.

678
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:17,541
Well, first of all,
your jump mechanics need work.

679
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:21,000
Right? You're not really generating
much power from here or here.

680
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,923
Also, you're only bringing
the ball halfway up,

681
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,291
so why are you cheating yourself?

682
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,833
Full extension, okay? Let's try it.

683
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:32,333
[Chang grunts]

684
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,625
- Oh, oh, oh! Holy crap!
- [Chang] Oh! That was, like, six inches!

685
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,291
So, do you think I could dunk?

686
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,142
- You probably still growing, right?
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,966
So, if you stay consistent
with your workouts,

688
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,750
in about a half a year to a year,
I don't see why not.

689
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,833
Uh, I need to do it in ten weeks.

690
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,291
- Say what now?
- Yeah.

691
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,250
It's a long story, but if Chang can't dunk
by our last football game,

692
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,976
he's gonna have to move to another school.

693
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,833
I'll do anything you ask me to do.
Please. Just help me out.

694
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,250
- Ten weeks?
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,750
Okay. So, let's see.

696
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,041
In ten weeks, we're definitely gonna
have to do some one-on-ones.

697
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:05,125
Uh, some weight training.
No doubt. Uh, plyo.

698
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,833
- Uh, technique for sure.
- Yeah.

699
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,083
- How much you paying?
- What?

700
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,625
[stammers] How much...

701
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,875
- What?
- Uh…

702
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:17,916
My man, if you're trying to dunk a ball
in ten weeks, we gotta do it right. Okay?

703
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That means mornings, evenings,
Saturdays and Sundays.

704
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,267
- I can't do all that for free.
- I don't have any money.

705
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,434
What are you talking about?
I just sold you a top-shelf phone.

706
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,958
Yeah, that costed all my savings.

707
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,083
I'll return it, all right?
But that's all I got, all right?

708
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,708
- How about that?
- Look, I'm sorry, bro. Okay?

709
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,375
I really am, but I-I just can't.

710
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,958
It's not gonna cut it. Okay?

711
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,250
Good luck with your new school.

712
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,625
[Bo] What do you shoot on?

713
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,916
- I'm sorry?
- For your videos. What do you shoot on?

714
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,041
- My phone.
- Your phone? Yeah.

715
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,166
And then you just edit everything
on what? Let me guess, iMovie?

716
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:54,750
Mm-hmm. Okay, so, if I were you, I'd be
investing in a gimbal at least, right?

717
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,393
'Cause you've got a basketball channel.

718
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,267
You're shooting everything locked down
from 30 feet back like it's 1920.

719
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,291
Okay? Get us in on the action.

720
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,625
All right? Don't get me started
on that fake slow-motion.

721
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,083
You have to get that in-camera
with a high frame rate.

722
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,750
Come on, man. Where's the mise-en-scène?

723
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,875
Look here, little man.
I work hard on my videos, okay?

724
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,541
Yes, I bet you do.

725
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,416
I bet you do, and I also bet you're
only achieving about 50% of your vision.

726
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,833
So, what are you proposing?

727
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,708
You get Chang dunking like...

728
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,458
- Who's, uh…
- Vince Carter.

729
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,392
- You get Chang dunking like Vince Carter…
- Mmm.

730
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,541
…I'll get your channel
looking like Scorsese.

731
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,666
Michael Bay.

732
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,916
Michael Bay?

733
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,250
Yes, Michael Bay.

734
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,208
Mm-hmm.

735
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,541
And he's gotta be in the videos.

736
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,833
What, me? Why?

737
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:47,958
Because if I can get you,
and I mean all of you, to dunk…

738
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,958
[laughs]
…everybody's gonna be hittin' me up.

739
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,875
So, we got a deal?

740
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,375
[sighs]

741
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,500
You want Michael Bay?

742
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,625
I'll get you Michael Benjamin Bay.

743
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,076
[Deandre] Y'all ain't never shake
nobody's hand before?

744
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,416
[Bo] Now walk off, walk off, walk off.

745
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,041
How'd that look? Good?

746
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:29,625
So when I say I'm filming in slow-motion,
you don't also have to move in slow-mo.

747
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,041
Oh.

748
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,375
Wait. You sure it don't look better?

749
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,666
No.

750
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,750
Okay.

751
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,000
Wow! Good morning, sunshine.

752
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,708
Look who decided to join us.
Get him. Get him on camera.

753
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,625
{\an8}Day one, and my dude's already late.

754
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,666
Look, I was up all night brainstorming.
We're gonna do a whole series on you.

755
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,416
<i>Can Chang Dunk?</i>

756
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,375
- Uh, no, no.
- That's gonna be A-plus content.

757
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,958
All you gotta do is look… Look.
You gonna look in the camera,

758
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,708
tell the people who you are
and why we're all out here.

759
00:37:58,791 --> 00:37:59,916
Cool.

760
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:01,916
Action.

761
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,875
Uh, I'm Chang. I'm 16, 5'8", and I'm…

762
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:11,166
Uh, I'm trying
to dunk a basketball, hopefully?

763
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,750
Cut! What? [Scoffs] Come on, man!

764
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,233
- [Chang] What?
- Where's your swag?

765
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,333
- What?
- Your swag.

766
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,856
How you gonna dunk without any swag?

767
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,708
Dunking is, like, 80% swag.

768
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,934
Matt and his friends are gonna clown me
if they see this.

769
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,416
So? They already clown you.

770
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,916
Yeah, and making YouTube videos
is supposed to help?

771
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,750
Okay, you're not making YouTube videos.

772
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,166
He and I are.

773
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,708
You're trying to dunk.

774
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,916
And if you wanna do that,
you gotta do what I'm telling you to do.

775
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,916
And right now, what I'm telling you to do,

776
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,250
is worry about being better
than you were yesterday.

777
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,000
And the only way we'll know
if you're better than you were yesterday…

778
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,958
Okay. Hey, just give us a minute, Bo.

779
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,500
Let me holler at you, Chang.

780
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,333
Do you know what swag really is?

781
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:06,750
Swag is believing you can and will
do something you can't yet do.

782
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,458
Okay?

783
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,958
So, when I ask you,

784
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:16,083
"Are you or are you not gonna yam it
on Matt's stupid head?"

785
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
You say?

786
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:20,916
I am.

787
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,125
Yeah, you are.

788
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,291
Can you or can you not dunk?

789
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,083
I can dunk. I can dunk.

790
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,041
- Can you or can you not dunk?
- Yeah, I can dunk.

791
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,208
- Okay. Can you or can you not dunk?
- I can dunk.

792
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,851
- Can you or can you not dunk?
- I can dunk.

793
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,416
Okay, then. Look in the camera and tell
the people what the move is. Let's go!

794
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:45,000
Yo. I'm Chang, and I'm gonna dunk it
on all my haters. Yeah!

- Oh, you were serious. I didn't know.

797
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,375
- I'm sorry, bro! Come on.
- No, no, no!

798
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,166
- We're gonna work on that.
- [Bo] Damn.

799
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,916
- Hey, Chang! Come back!
- [Bo] Come back!

800
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,166
[Deandre] That wasn't awful.

801
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,892

I don't know. Probably not.

I'm just asking simple questions.

1041

Yeah, but it just sounds like
you're implying something.

1042

You know, like,
whatever I'm doing is a waste of my time.

Why are you getting angry?
I'm just asking simple questions.

1046
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,083
Because everything you say
feels like a judgment.

1047
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,208
[scoffs] Maybe there's something
you don't want to tell me.

1492
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:31,434
- [laughs]
- [Owen] No, he can't!

1493
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:34,351
This explains why you were acting weird
the next day and why I kept missing.

1494
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,375
I'm never that off.

1495
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,750
That proves nothing except
that you're a sore loser.

1496
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,833
Hmm, does it?

1497
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:41,541
All right.

1498
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,916
- Do it again then.
- No.

1499
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,750
- [students] Whoa.
- I already did.

1500
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,125
No, you didn't, you cheater.

1501
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,166
Yo, what's your problem, Matt?

1502
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,517
- Why can't you accept that I can dunk?
- Because you can't.

1503
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,458
- Why not?
- Because you can't, dude.

1504
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:57,250
- Like, what do you...
- Stop avoiding the question, Matt.

1505
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,625
- Why don't you think I can dunk?
- Because you can't.

1506
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:01,125
But how can you be so sure?

1507
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:04,625
What? 'Cause I'm not as tall as you?
'Cause I'm not as cool as you?

1508
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,750
'Cause I'm Asian?

1509
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,583
- [students gasp]
- [Syd] Oh!

1510
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,666
Dude, what are you even talking about?

1511
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,708
Why can't you just let me win for once?

1512
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,041
Because you're a cheater.

1513
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:17,666
No.

1514
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:23,125
It's because you hate that someone like me
can actually be cooler than you.

1515
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:27,083
You hate that I have more followers
than you ever did.

1516
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,875
You think you're all that?
You're not even that good at basketball.

1517
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,250
- You're barely ranked.
- Whoa.

1518
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:34,166
You think you're gonna play DI?
That's a pipe dream, man.

1519
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,541
Yo, the minute you graduate,
it's over for you.

1520
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,583
All right? You peaked. But me?

1521
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,291
I'm moving on to bigger and better things.

1522
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:46,083
And you still can't dunk.

1523
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,791
[students] Ooh. [Laughing]

1524
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:51,625
I mean, you wanted everybody
to like you so bad and in the end, what?

1525
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,875
You just tricked 'em?

1526
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:55,666
You wish you were me.

1527
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,458
You're nothing more than a lying poser.

1528
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,458
- [Chang screams]
- [student] Whoa!

1529
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:05,333
[students cheering, clamoring]

1530
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:11,476
- [Mrs. O'Neil] …ganged up on him…
- [Mr. O'Neil] What kind of security system

1531
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,726
- do you have that somebody can break in…
- [Mrs. O'Neil] …pummeled him with a razor.

1532
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,791
[Mr. O'Neil] …I think that we need to...

1533
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,458
- [Chen] Hello.
- Mrs. Chang, hi.

1534
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,166
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1535
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:27,666
{\an8}[in Mandarin]

1536
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,892
- [in English] What did I do?
- [Principal Elliot] Okay.

1537
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:33,458
So, your son got into a fight
with Matt today.

1538
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:37,916
Apparently, it was about the social media,
which is unfortunately very common.

1539
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,250
[Mrs. O'Neil] Common?

1540
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:42,083
My son had his head shaved
in front of the whole school.

1541
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:43,166
And there's video.

1542
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:48,125
It's all over the Internet.
Millions of views. From every angle.

1543
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:50,458
- I know you're upset, but...
- [Mrs. O'Neil] Upset?

1544
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:54,791
Our family therapist said that he could
have PTSD for the rest of his life.

1545
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:56,166
- Mom, that's a bit...
- Just...

1546
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,375
- Look at this. Look at this.
- No one asked you.

1547
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,041
[students chanting] <i>Shave his head!</i>
<i>Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>

1548
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,250
<i>Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>

1549
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,208
- <i>Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>
- [clippers buzzing]

1550
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,458
[students cheering]

1551
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,500
[shouts]

1552
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,416
{\an8}[in Mandarin]

1553
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,666
{\an8}Huh?

1554
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:38,916
[in English] Please. I'm begging you.
This is all my fault.

1555
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,083
I didn't raise my son properly.

1556
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:43,750
- Oh, my God.
- We'll do whatever you want.

1557
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,083
Mrs. Chang. Look.

1558
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:48,875
We already discussed a solution, okay?

1559
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:52,458
Matt and Chang are going
to be suspended for a week each.

1560
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:55,000
Chang has to return Matt's Kobe jersey.

1561
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,125
- Can't believe you bet a family treasure.
- [Mrs. O'Neil clears throat]

1562
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:02,291
In addition, Matt has asked that Chang
make an apology video on his vlog

1563
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,916
admitting that he cheated.

1564
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,375
Now, if all of that happens,
we can end this right here, okay?

1565
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,166
Cheating? Vlog?

1566
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,958
Yes. About the dunking.

1567
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:18,458
He broke into the school at night
and adjusted one of the rims to do it.

1568
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:21,583
Now, that is criminal trespass
and vandalism,

1569
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:24,541
but if we put this behind us,

1570
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,208
I don't think we need to involve
the police on this one.

1571
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,625
What? Police?

1572
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,958

[Chen speaking Mandarin]

1575
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:38,791
[Chang in English] Why do you not care
that he hit me? Huh? Why do you...

1576
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,583
I thought Matt is your friend.

1577
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,041
- Why you fight him?
- We're not friends.

1578
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,416
We haven't been friends
since elementary school.

1579
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,041
- [sighs]
- Why?

1580
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,416
What happened?

1581
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,041
You wouldn't understand.

1582
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,041
Why do you treat me like this?

1583
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,375
You waste time with a stranger
from YouTube.

1584
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:18,333
You don't even want to talk
to your own mother.

1585
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,708
Is your mother so useless?

1586
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:23,000
At least Deandre listens to me.

1587
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,541
He doesn't put me down like you do.

1588
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,458
He cares about me.

1589
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,083
[laughs]

1590
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,583
He cares about you?

1591
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:34,291
He uses you.

1592
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,125
Make you make a fool out of yourself.

1593
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,625
{\an8}[in Mandarin]

1594
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:57,458
[in English] Stop guilt-tripping me!

1595
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,000
You're always upset about something.

1596
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,375
I can't tell you anything,

1597
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,708
'cause I don't know if you'll snap at me,
or you'll tell me it's stupid.

1598
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,666
I wanna tell you things!
I wanna ask you stuff!

1599
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:09,541
But I can't!

1600
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,375
Why?

1601
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:14,458
Because I'm scared of you.

1602
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,500
[Chen] You're scared of me?

1603
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,208
You're scared of me?

1604
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:23,583
I work so hard
to give you everything I can.

1605
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,333
[Chen inhales sharply]

1606
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,333
I spoil you.

1607
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,916
You want another mother? You can't!

1608
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,708
I am your mother.

1609
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,208
I get it now.

1610
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,833
I finally see it.

1611
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,791
Why you can't support anything I do.

1612
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,166
Why you're always putting me down.

1613
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:47,916
It's because you're miserable.

1614
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,416
You're so unhappy,
you need everyone else to be unhappy too.

1615
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:54,583
Well, I don't want to be like you!

1616
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,333
I don't want to always be alone!

This is gonna be my last vlog.

1645
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:12,375
As a lot of you know,
someone accused me of cheating on my dunk.

1646
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,000
And I'm here to say that…

1647
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,500
It's true.

1648
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:26,583
<i>I trained really, really hard.</i>

1649
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:31,500
<i>I gave it my all,
but I was still coming up short.</i>

1650
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,916
I should've just been proud
of how far I've come

1651
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:39,958
and tried to dunk it fair and square…

1652
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,500
But I guess I was too afraid
I was gonna fail.

1653
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:49,458
<i>I think maybe this whole time,</i>

1654
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:54,250
<i>I didn't really care about
whether or not I could dunk.</i>

1655
01:26:55,625 --> 01:27:00,375
<i>Maybe what I really wanted was just
for other people to think that I could.</i>

1656
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:05,666
I'm sorry to Matt for cheating on the bet.

1657
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:14,916
And I'm especially sorry
to my coach, Deandre…

I-I didn't know how you took it,

1665
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:05,208
so I just brought a...
A whole plethora of options.

1667
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:13,416

1669
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,750
You're a basketball coach?

1670
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:21,583
Yes.

1671
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,916
Then why do you work in a Verizon store?

1672
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,291
You know,
your son had that same exact thought.

1673
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,958
You're not really a coach.

1674
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:34,791
But you tell my son you are,
and you use him to do your YouTube.

1675
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:36,458
Wait, that's not totally fair.

1676
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:40,625
My son never caused trouble before.
Then he meet you.

1677
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:43,583
Now he's fighting at school.
He don't even want to talk to me, and he...

1678
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:45,916
Ma'am, I don't know
why your son took to me either.

1679
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,708
We really just talked about basketball.
Really, just dunking.

1680
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,666
Why dunking?

1681
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,416
What can you do with this dunking thing?

1682
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,958
I don't know.
But that's what he wanted to do.

1683
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,916
Chang really, really wanted to dunk.

1684
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:04,833
We were waking up at 5:00 a.m.

1685

[chuckles] Doing sprints.
I mean, pushing my car five blocks.

1686
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,833
You made my son push your car?

1687
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,666
Yes. It's great for dunking.

What I'm trying to say is,
when we got started,

1691
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:24,166
I thought he'd quit after a week or two.

1692
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:28,291
Maybe we'd get one or two videos, max.

1693
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:33,375
But he didn't. He kept going.

1694
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:37,125
I mean, he surprised the hell outta me.

1695

And I-I know he got in trouble
and all of that.

1703
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,916
But if I'm being honest,
I'm proud as hell of him.

No. No. No, it's not your fault.
This is nobody's fault.
