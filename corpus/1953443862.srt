1
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,170
I could fall asleep...

2
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42,241
With the warmth of you near me.

3
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:46,378
The sound of your heart sings.

4
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,783
Sings what?

5
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,452
Together...

6
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,387
Together.

7
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>[ phone ringing ]</i>

8
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,604
Tomassini residence?

9
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,805
She's not available
at this moment,

10
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:58,544
Can I take a message?

11
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:02,414
Thank you.

12
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,834
It's really coming down.

13
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:12,010
I'm Paolo.

14
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,546
Djuna.

15
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,686
So do you live here?

16
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,021
No.

17
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,490
My friend is doing
a play in the city,

18
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:30,362
So I'm staying in her house.

19
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,440
What about you?

20
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,842
I'm here writing a script.

21
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,911
They got me a house, to write.

22
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:50,649
You know, no distractions.

23
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,497
You're, what?

24
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,367
Artist?

25
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,035
No.

26
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,970
I translate poetry
and literature into

27
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,105
Different languages.

28
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:20,112
That sounds like a
pretty serious job.

29
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,914
It's practical.

30
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:28,820
I have a...Skin
condition...Where I can't be

31
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:35,494
Exposed to sunlight.

32
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,963
I' m sorry.

33
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,712
This place is huge.

34
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,849
No, go!

35
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,516
This was a mistake.

36
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,117
I'm sorry.

37
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,985
It's not a mistake.

38
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,862
I want you to leave.

39
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,864
I'm gonna leave, but I'm
gonna call you tomorrow.

40
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:49,000
No, don't call.

41
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,503
Go.

42
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,504
Please go.

43
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,254
<i>Through phone:</i>
<i>Hey Paolo, it's donna.</i>

44
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,924
I've been thinking a lot, and I
don't know why I said I needed

45
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,060
<i>I was really happy</i>
<i>with the way things were.</i>

46
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,796
<i>It was stupid.</i>

47
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,267
<i>And I think that's</i>
<i>great, I really do.</i>

48
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,072
Tomassini residence.

49
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,874
Madame is indisposed
until this evening.

50
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,877
May I take a message?

51
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,147
Paolo.

52
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,015
Very well, I'll let her know.

53
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,061
You should try some
of our other scotches.

54
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,730
We've got some great scotch.

55
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,333
You interested?

56
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,803
Yeah, sure.

57
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:46,351
Here you go.

58
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,020
Thanks.

59
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,958
What are you doing here?

60
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,826
Will you let me in?

61
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,895
I can't.

62
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,163
Is this about your illness?

63
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,899
Yes.

64
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,069
Look, whatever it is you
have, I will deal with it.

65
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,004
Just let me in.

66
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,872
No.

67
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,078
Let me in.

68
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,214
No.

69
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,680
Djuna?

70
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,016
Get out!

71
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,225
Hey ben.

72
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,494
Hey, how's it comin'?

73
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,762
You love your house?

74
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,098
Alright, don't say I
don't take care of you.

75
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,433
I don't.

76
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,035
How's it coming, p?

77
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,037
I just started.

78
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,439
Of course it's gonna be great,
you're gonna knock this

79
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:25,977
I know you're not into violence,
but don't be afraid of it here.

80
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,178
It's the right thing.

81
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,048
I won't.

82
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,116
Feelin' good?

83
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,851
Yeah.

84
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,188
Paolo?

85
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,057
Hello?

86
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,993
Paolo, where are you?

87
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,162
Paolo?

88
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,029
Paolo?

89
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,298
Hey, Paolo!

90
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,834
Hey.

91
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,838
Sorry.

92
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,131
Paolo .

93
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:20,999
I'm comin' over.

94
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,467
Answer the door.

95
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,408
Come over here.

96
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,120
Feel my heart.

97
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:21,059
Find my heartbeat.

98
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,864
It's not there, Paolo.

99
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,206
I can't go in sunlight.

100
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,610
I drink the blood
of animals to live.

101
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,012
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

102
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:46,918
You're telling me
you're a vampire?

103
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,587
Are you kidding me?

104
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,589
What do think
happened last night?

105
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,936
There's no such thing
as vampires, djuna.

106
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,405
No?

107
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,208
Alright.

108
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,076
I'll show you.

109
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:29,193
I'm not feeling
good about doing this.

110
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:29,627
There's nothing to worry about.

111
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,329
You're safe.

112
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,932
I can't hurt you this way.

113
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,077
Paolo!

114
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,147
It's happening!

115
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,015
Come here!

116
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:27,352
Come here!

117
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,493
Holy shit!

118
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,697
Keep your hands
away from my mouth!

119
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,703
Djuna?

120
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,374
Oh god.

121
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,153
Do you believe me now?

122
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,490
Look at me.

123
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,717
No!

124
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,642
No.

125
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,244
No.

126
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,261
Let's make love.

127
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,546
Are you scared?

128
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,216
No.

129
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:25,590
This is what had to happen.

130
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:31,262
I would have done anything to
be with you...However insane.

131
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,263
I know.

132
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,666
It's all insane.

133
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:40,871
And I know in my heart, it would
have been wrong to let you go.

134
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:45,876
For both of us.

135
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,413
My world belongs to you now.

136
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:54,285
I will teach you
everything I know.

137
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,259
Very closely knit.

138
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:05,930
Xenia, the actress who owns
this house, for example...

139
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,332
She designed it
for needs like ours.

140
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,802
Little things,
but very important.

141
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,474
And irene, the housekeeper...

142
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,542
She's got a rare blood
disorder, so she's not a

143
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,478
Temptation for us.

144
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,616
Her mother had it too, so
she's very highly valued.

145
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,618
Extremely loyal.

146
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,553
She looks after the house.

147
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,957
Keeps watch during the day.

148
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,825
You'll start to feel a
pressure in your lower back...

149
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,829
And that will turn
into a hunger...

150
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:44,068
And that hunger will
grow until you feed it.

151
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,937
And if you don't feed, that
hunger will turn into pain.

152
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:53,811
You can't let it get to that,
or you'll be out of control.

153
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,882
Will we live forever?

154
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,484
Chances are, we will.

155
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,087
But there are ways to die.

156
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:03,754
Sunlight.

157
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,957
Fire.

158
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:11,095
But we won't get older,
and we won't get sick.

159
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:15,499
And if we get hurt, we
heal almost right away.

160
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,703
It's a different reality.

161
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:21,038
But I know we can
have a normal life.

162
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
You and me.

163
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,909
Forever.

164
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Not here.

165
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,688
Not yet.

166
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,825
Come.

167
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,894
Let's go home.

168
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,377
So you can write those
screenplays you're

169
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,513
So crazy about.

170
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,582
Are you trying to
tell me something?

171
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:08,953
No, I'm trying to tell you
that maybe it's time to get your

172
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,821
Things and move in.

173
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,454
You got it all?

174
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,722
Yeah.

175
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm happy.

176
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:34,839
I'm really happy, Paolo.

177
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,507
I made you coq au vin.

178
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,109
It smells incredible.

179
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,512
It turned out perfectly.

180
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,252
Can I say something?

181
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,854
Of course.

182
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,122
I just want to get it over with.

183
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,930
Ok.

184
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,002
It feels weird that
it was so natural.

185
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,873
That it didn't bother me more.

186
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,877
I was surprised that
I knew what to do.

187
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:24,882
And feel how I've changed.

188
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:25,816
Even my vision.

189
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,886
What I see.

190
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:33,190
I can't believe how
much I was missing before.

191
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:39,129
Everything just feels so...

192
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:49,173
Heightened.

193
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:59,617
Heightened.

194
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,951
What are you doing here?

195
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,286
Nice to see you, too, djuna.

196
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:08,092
I'm staying here for a week
while my new place gets set up.

197
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,828
Well, call her if you want.

198
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,030
Hi, I'm mimi.

199
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,932
Djuna's sister.

200
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:20,738
It's really not a good
idea for you to stay here.

201
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,805
Where am I supposed
to go, djuna?

202
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:27,011
To a hotel?

203
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,345
I'm only going to
be here a week.

204
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,147
It's not like I'm going
to hang around you anyway.

205
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,285
Don't worry.

206
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,754
You look great.

207
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:37,354
What's your secret?

208
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,889
Dog blood?

209
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,426
I take it the two of
you don't get along.

210
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,762
No she's...

211
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,030
What?

212
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:49,099
She's a disturbed creature.

213
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,674
Where are you coming from?

214
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,142
Amsterdam.

215
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,076
Amsterdam?

216
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,145
It was horrible.

217
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,746
The group I was
living with was crazy.

218
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,282
I couldn't take it anymore.

219
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,218
You couldn't take it, or
they couldn't take it?

220
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,289
How long were you there?

221
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,758
Five years.

222
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,827
It was fun at first.

223
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:20,030
It's a great city, but my
roommates ruined it for me.

224
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,833
People were catching on to us.

225
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,703
I started to be
afraid to go to bed.

226
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,705
I thought I was going to
be torched by a church

227
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,707
Group or something.

228
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,241
So?

229
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,111
What's in phoenix?

230
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,245
Where will you live there?

231
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,847
On a ranch.

232
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,949
It's like a commune.

233
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,417
You make night
blooming gardens, pottery.

234
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,219
You study latin literature.

235
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,023
Basically, it's rehab.

236
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,024
Xenia thinks that's
what I need to do,

237
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,827
So I'm gonna try it.

238
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:56,767
I guess I don't really
have a choice, do I?

239
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:01,238
Cheers.

240
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,181
That wasn't so bad.

241
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,917
She's a crazy freak, you'll see.

242
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,252
She didn't sound crazy.

243
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,988
She seemed pretty cohesive.

244
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,424
Crazy's not the word.

245
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,160
She's not out of
touch with reality.

246
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,428
She's sick.

247
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,963
It's only a week.

248
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,031
The clock is already ticking.

249
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,099
She'll be gone soon.

250
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,997
I had a nightmare.

251
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,366
We were at the ballet school.

252
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:06,970
We were hiding in the closet
and she was trying to find us.

253
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,107
I wonder if she's
still teaching.

254
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,310
Maybe someone got her.

255
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,447
Damn vampire solidarity.

256
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,184
I'm sure they moved her...

257
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,585
Somewhere.

258
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:25,522
I had a dream, too, about mom.

259
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,924
I can't remember
her face anymore.

260
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,193
Can you?

261
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,528
Not really.

262
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,264
It's gone.

263
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,465
Nothing's left.

264
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,467
Wow!

265
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,468
Look at them.

266
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,271
That looks so fun, doesn't it?

267
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,046
It's interesting to
see you with a man.

268
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,849
It's been a long time since...

269
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,050
What was his name?

270
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,586
Henry?

271
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,453
What was that?

272
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,390
Sixty, seventy years ago?

273
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,128
A long time ago.

274
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,063
I forget.

275
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,332
Did you turn him or not?

276
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,333
You know I didn't.

277
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,934
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:15,606
You wouldn't do that to someone.

279
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:18,942
Well, what made
you turn this one?

280
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:22,012
The loneliness got to you?

281
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,146
I've been alone a long time.

282
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:26,049
It wasn't that.

283
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,385
It was just going
to happen with him.

284
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,253
What does that mean?

285
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:32,456
It means I love him.

286
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:38,061
Love him?

287
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,129
I just want to say,
for the last century,

288
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,000
You've judged me so harshly.

289
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:45,469
And it's just strange that
now you turn someone you

290
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,471
Claim to love.

291
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,072
At least I've never done that.

292
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,275
I've never bit
someone I love, djuna!

293
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,211
I wouldn't do that.

294
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,680
You're not capable of loving.

295
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,415
You wouldn't know.

296
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,685
I just know it's not an option.

297
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:05,088
I'm not the sick one.

298
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,992
Don't romanticize stupid humans,
and watch them through goggles

299
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:12,596
No, you just leave a trail of
shit wherever you go and get

300
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,131
Off on it!

301
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:19,937
Speaking of getting off,
maybe you finally have...

302
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:23,140
Because suddenly, you
don't mind sentencing

303
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:27,277
To the shit we
have to deal with.

304
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,680
You know what you did was wrong.

305
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:33,083
Admit it!

306
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,686
Don't fucking judge me anymore!

307
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,096
Hi, xenia, it's djuna.

308
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,332
How is everything at the house?

309
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,600
Well, it's not good.

310
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,602
It's about mimi.

311
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,603
You know she's here?

312
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,205
Yes, she needed a place to stay.

313
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,275
I've arranged a safe
house for her in phoenix,

314
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,344
But it won't be
ready for a week.

315
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,013
Well, I'm worried.

316
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,282
She's not stable,
you know she's not.

317
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,684
Darling, she wants
to change her life,

318
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:10,354
And I can't turn
my back on that.

319
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,422
She's a monster.

320
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,024
You're sisters.

321
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:18,295
And the fact that she's
crowding in on this love

322
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,229
Affair you're having...

323
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,769
I was going to
tell you about him.

324
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,704
Paolo.

325
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,007
Darling, I trust
your judgment...

326
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,744
But if you can just
bear with mimi for a week.

327
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,746
Of course.

328
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,294
Thank you.

329
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,430
Thank you.

330
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,233
So, I want to
tell you something.

331
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,836
I have some money and...

332
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,373
I'd like to get us a house.

333
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:41,378
I was thinking we'd go
somewhere out of the country.

334
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,449
Someplace new, where
we could start again.

335
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,583
Yeah?

336
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,453
Yeah.

337
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,231
Just give me a minute.

338
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,367
I'll take care of everything.

339
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:12,109
I've never lived
with anyone before.

340
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,311
Good.

341
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:16,573
♪  <i>I think I'm afraid.</i> ♪

342
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,376
♪  <i>I feel so exposed.</i> ♪

343
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:22,779
♪  <i>I can hear myself.</i> ♪

344
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,875
Hey!

345
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,678
Hey, wait.

346
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,250
I was gonna offer
to buy you a drink.

347
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,852
Thirsty?

348
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,322
Come here.

349
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:08,458
Sure you don't want
to come back inside?

350
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,996
I'd rather be here.

351
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,800
Ok, well...

352
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,469
Let me know if you change
your mind about that drink.

353
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,605
Come here and kiss me.

354
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,993
Adam!

355
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,262
Yo!

356
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,882
Come on.

357
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,360
Taking forever...

358
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,785
You know you don't have
to do that, don't you?

359
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,721
Djuna is completely neurotic.

360
00:40:58,723 --> 00:40:59,856
The possum was dead.

361
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:05,795
Everyone knows
that about animals.

362
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,832
If it makes her feel
better, it's fine by me.

363
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,716
So, tell me Paolo.

364
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,185
There are really guys
like you out there...

365
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,921
Who want to have the
life sucked out of them?

366
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:35,191
Go fuck yourself!

367
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:39,128
Do you think those
guys have problems?

368
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,599
Maybe aren't mentally healthy?

369
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:43,933
I would say, wouldn't you?

370
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,870
Why the fuck are
you so interested?

371
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,705
I don't know.

372
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:51,040
Maybe I'd like a
guy like that for me.

373
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,643
Good-looking.

374
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:56,913
Destructive.

375
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:57,914
Oh yeah.

376
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,250
But you're not destructive.

377
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:04,988
This is all about love.

378
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,259
Tough guy, huh?

379
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,069
Djuna?

380
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,939
Come over.

381
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:58,007
Beautiful.

382
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,943
Ciao.

383
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,212
It's going to be fun.

384
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,014
Everyone there will be like us.

385
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,016
It'll be good for
you to meet them.

386
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,152
It's important.

387
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,057
Djuna!

388
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:22,665
Paolo.

389
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,933
It is so nice to meet you.

390
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,070
Djuna's told me
wonderful things about you.

391
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,671
I've heard so many wonderful
things about you as well.

392
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:31,140
You have a beautiful
apartment, and a beautiful

393
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,076
Home, of course.

394
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,144
Thank you for
letting me stay there.

395
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:38,081
It is my absolute
pleasure, Paolo.

396
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,618
I've seen some of your films.

397
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
No, you are!

398
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,355
You're a very talented writer.

399
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:47,357
One day you have to
write a part for me.

400
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,224
Anytime.

401
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:51,828
It would be my honor.

402
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,198
Omar, come meet my
very dear friends.

403
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,334
Djuna and Paolo.

404
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:58,935
How nice to meet you.

405
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,203
Hello.

406
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:02,005
Lydia and omar came
from rome for my opening.

407
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,873
You should see their place.

408
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,676
They may have the most
exquisite taste I've ever seen.

409
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:07,944
We were just talking
about going to rome.

410
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,812
Maybe even moving there.

411
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,280
Oh, you should.

412
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,282
It's one of the
best cities for us.

413
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,885
Large community.

414
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,221
Perfect for lovers.

415
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,891
Are you new?

416
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,028
No, not at all.

417
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,964
Both of you are beautiful.

418
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,967
The first 100 years
are insufferable,

419
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,035
But they do get easier.

420
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:32,902
The previews start Saturday...

421
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,673
Night, of course.

422
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,274
Obviously, I don't do matinees.

423
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,409
And why should you?

424
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:40,677
Good to meet you!

425
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,811
Nice to meet you as well.

426
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,814
So, they tell me
that you're new.

427
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:47,884
Yes, I'm sure there's
still quite a bit to learn.

428
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:50,019
Ah, there is, there is indeed.

429
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,155
You're in excellent hands.

430
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,424
Djuna's a treasure.

431
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,159
So you're staying up at
Xenia's place in connecticut?

432
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:57,293
We are.

433
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,829
I love that place.

434
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,964
A little amuse-bouche, everyone?

435
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Oh, don't worry, it's not human.

436
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:14,844
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it's kosher.

437
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:15,945
Xenia doesn't mess around.

438
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,414
Whatever this is, it
is the beluga of

439
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:23,152
Politically-correct plasma.

440
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,754
Bottoms up!

441
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:29,826
Yeah.

442
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:33,296
He's extraordinary.

443
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:37,100
He would make a great actor
because he's so full of pain.

444
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:37,834
Pain?

445
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,169
Not the bad kind.

446
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,104
No, not pain.

447
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:44,974
Let' say, awareness.

448
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:49,112
Soul.

449
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:49,979
He's extraordinary.

450
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,094
My darling!

451
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,098
So happy to see you!

452
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,373
Cheers.

453
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,451
I have a few cases of this
synthetic blood for each of you.

454
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,987
Try not to go
through it too quickly.

455
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,256
I don't know how long this
army connection will last.

456
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,925
Or how long we'll have access.

457
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:39,295
The fda hasn't approved it.

458
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,898
Even if the fda approves...

459
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,034
It's not that we'll be able to
get it any more consistently.

460
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,904
It's not like we can
exactly lobby for why...

461
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:51,908
Prescriptions for us would be a
good idea for the mainstream.

462
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,043
Of course not.

463
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:58,514
And if they knew we did,
I highly highly doubt...

464
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:01,384
That they'd deal with it by
selling us synthetic blood.

465
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:03,319
It makes me so mad!

466
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,922
The way we're forced to live.

467
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:09,525
I mean this isn't their
world, it's our world!

468
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,928
They're just passing through.

469
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,130
It's not our world.

470
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:15,865
We may never die,
but collectively,

471
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:18,534
Well, we're the
ones forced to hide.

472
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,838
We are the monsters.

473
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,175
I can't abide any more
of this self-loathing.

474
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,044
We know what the situation is.

475
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,513
We discuss it all the time.

476
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,582
We're at the beginning of
creating a civilization

477
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:34,984
For ourselves.

478
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:38,054
Just like they did when
they realized that...

479
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,923
Killing and raping on a regular
basis was not a fulfilling

480
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,059
Way to live.

481
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,597
I don't want to hear
the term "monsters."

482
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,199
We're all monsters.

483
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,269
Potentially, you
know, potentially not.

484
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:58,140
Yes, but one has
to ask oneself...

485
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:02,445
Does the existence of dr.
Jekyll make mr. Hyde any less

486
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:05,047
Of a monster?

487
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,384
I think that the point we
all have come to realize,

488
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:15,524
Hans...Is that what civilization
is is a set of moral laws....

489
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:20,930
And if those laws are broken,
there will be punishment.

490
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:21,664
Humans still break them...

491
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,467
But for the most part...

492
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:31,340
These laws have forced
them to value humanity...

493
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,210
To develop sensitivity...

494
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:39,081
Which is just as real in
them as their baser impulses.

495
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,084
I mean, those laws...

496
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:46,923
Have freed them to
experience their little lives...

497
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:51,594
The way we haven't been able to.

498
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,996
I don't like them.

499
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:59,068
I don't find them touching,
the way you seem to.

500
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,138
I don't find you touching.

501
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,074
They are the best
audiences, I can tell you that.

502
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:11,414
Vampires are notorious
for "golf applause".

503
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,083
Xenia, jesus.

504
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:16,085
The ultimate barometer
for superior race,

505
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:19,155
According to xenia...

506
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,290
How adoring is the audience?

507
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,559
Yes.

508
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:27,163
Where did mimi go?

509
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,168
She's home.

510
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:50,413
What the fuck is she doing?

511
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:54,617
What is she listening to?

512
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,486
I kind of like it.

513
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,228
Excuse me.

514
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,096
I'm sorry to interrupt.

515
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:09,632
You must leave!

516
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,500
Who the hell do
you think you are?

517
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,368
Who is she?

518
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,571
I'm Mimi's sister.

519
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,373
You should know that mimi has
a serious medical condition..

520
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,709
And should not be engaging in
any irresponsible encounters.

521
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:24,647
I do not have a
medical condition.

522
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,182
She most certainly does.

523
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:29,118
Please wait outside.

524
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,686
I'll call you a taxi, and
leave you money to get home.

525
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,488
Please go!

526
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,289
Oh my god!

527
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:37,426
It's alright.

528
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,562
Oh my god!

529
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:40,763
Oh my god!

530
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:45,101
What did we almost
get ourselves into?

531
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:45,768
Do you think we're gonna be ok?

532
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,769
Yeah, we're ok.

533
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,838
I want to get out of here, ok?

534
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,308
What's going on?

535
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,647
Your girlfriend thinks
she's the lady of the house.

536
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:02,184
She thinks she can just come
in here and kick my guests out.

537
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:05,321
She thinks she can
have friends here,

538
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,789
But I can't.

539
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,258
Friends?

540
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,427
Really?

541
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:14,230
It's not going to go
anywhere like this.

542
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,702
Did it turn you on?

543
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:20,769
What?

544
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,508
What?

545
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:44,927
How long has it been?

546
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,929
I don't know.

547
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:48,464
Not that long.

548
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:51,867
This is such a
fucking nightmare.

549
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,236
I can't wait to be
back in our apartment.

550
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,438
We're not kids anymore,
this was so stupid of us.

551
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,375
The only thing that we did
that was stupid was get

552
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,476
In someone's car...

553
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,178
And drive 1
outside the city.

554
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,182
Other than that, we
didn't do anything wrong.

555
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,317
I don't know.

556
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,186
I can't help but think we
brought this on ourselves,

557
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,521
You know?

558
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,722
Please!

559
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:16,592
Who are you right now?

560
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:19,195
I love you, jack.

561
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,864
I never said that you didn't.

562
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:25,801
I love you too, now just
stop acting like a child.

563
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:26,869
What's that?

564
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,206
Did you hear that noise?

565
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,341
Just an animal.

566
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,742
Just stay here.

567
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:34,510
No jack, don't go over there!

568
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,979
Jack, don't.

569
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,581
Don't go over there!

570
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,517
Please!

571
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,990
Jack, don't!

572
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:50,392
Shit!

573
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,261
Jack!

574
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:20,816
You call for a cab?

575
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,759
Where are they?

576
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,896
Probably at the
clinic, getting tests.

577
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:35,898
I told you, you don't listen!

578
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,667
You keep coming
back into my life,

579
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,935
Over and over again.

580
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,003
Destroying everything!

581
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,738
Why can't I be free of you?

582
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,808
Why?

583
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,833
Xenia would ex-communicate
you, if she knew.

584
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,035
Stay away from me!

585
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,972
Don't interfere with my life!

586
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,842
You'll be away soon enough!

587
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,163
Let me over, prick!

588
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:44,099
Hey, Paolo, what's going on?

589
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,702
What are you doing man?

590
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,638
You haven't returned any
of my texts or anything.

591
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,574
I'm on my way up to
the house, 'cause...

592
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,175
I'm a little concerned, man.

593
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,177
It's not like you.

594
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:56,845
It's like you
dropped off the planet.

595
00:56:56,847 --> 00:57:00,849
Anyway, I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.

596
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:01,817
That's it.

597
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:02,751
I'll see you soon.

598
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,886
Alright, buddy?

599
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:04,953
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

600
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:14,897
Well then don't fucking
put your fucking blinker on!

601
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,633
Good, what can I get for you?

602
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:21,637
Can I get a vodka-soda, please.

603
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,572
Hey...

604
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,641
Have you seen a new
guy hanging around here?

605
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,576
Dark-haired, good-looking guy?

606
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:28,644
Drinks scotch?

607
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,846
Yeah, I've seen
him in here, why?

608
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,781
I'm his agent.

609
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,515
I'm ben rider.

610
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,851
I've been trying to
get ahold of him...

611
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:39,988
I went by the house I
put him up in and...

612
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,657
Nothing, looks like no
one's living there.

613
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,026
Yeah well, I heard he's been
staying out with a girl

614
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:47,095
On hansen road.

615
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,165
I wouldn't be too
worried about him though.

616
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,502
He's having quite the affair.

617
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,102
Is that right?

618
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,237
Yeah.

619
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,772
So what's your deal?

620
00:57:56,774 --> 00:58:00,042
You an actress?

621
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:10,719
You like the way it
feels to hunt, no?

622
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:11,920
I like a lot of things.

623
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,989
I don't need that.

624
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,991
Me neither.

625
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,931
Son of a bitch!

626
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,973
Paolo!

627
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:31,974
Paolo?

628
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:34,643
Oh, it's my fucking agent.

629
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:38,914
Ben.

630
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:39,648
Hey.

631
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,050
Jesus, it's hard to
find you up here.

632
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,652
How are you?

633
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:44,119
I'm good.

634
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,854
Good to see you.

635
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,656
It's good to see you too.

636
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,591
Djuna, this is my
agent, ben rider.

637
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,125
Hi.

638
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:53,595
So you're the one who
stole my client away from me?

639
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,730
Look at you, you're gorgeous.

640
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:55,664
Are you an actress?

641
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,666
Well you should be.

642
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:00,135
Come on in.

643
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,139
Oh, my goodness,
this is fucking crazy!

644
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:06,308
You haven't been
writing shit, have you?

645
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,643
I have.

646
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,111
Oh, you're full of shit.

647
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,712
I have.

648
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:11,847
I just printed out some stuff.

649
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:14,249
I'll show you.

650
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,251
Dude, if you could parlay what
you're doing here out there,

651
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,253
You're going to be huge.

652
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:21,123
Read it and then
we'll have dinner.

653
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,190
This is all new stuff?

654
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,598
Djuna, this is incredible.

655
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,668
I took a chance on coming
out here and I got

656
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,670
The royal treatment.

657
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:37,339
And this house is ridiculous.

658
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:40,609
I mean this is
crazy time up here.

659
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,144
You gotta remember to send
me that information on

660
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:43,345
Your friend's play.

661
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,748
I wanna see that, so you
gotta e-mail me the information.

662
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,850
I know it's not broadway, but
I really want to check it out.

663
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:49,785
I will.

664
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,920
I'm really happy to be here.

665
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,190
Hey pal, I gotta tell you, I
can't stop thinking about those

666
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:56,592
Pages I read.

667
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,593
They're great, man.

668
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,327
Do you feel good about that?

669
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,061
Yeah.

670
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,996
Do you?

671
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:04,066
Oh come on, man, the action
sequences are unbelievable.

672
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,068
It's the best stuff
you've ever written.

673
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,936
The studio's going to go crazy.

674
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:13,141
Do you know this guy used to
be impossible to deal with?

675
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,010
He would write all this
artsy-fartsy crap that I

676
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:16,278
Couldn't get any investors for?

677
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,082
Used to think he was
better than everyone else.

678
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:22,884
I didn't think I was
better than everyone else.

679
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:26,622
I just didn't understand why
people didn't expect more

680
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:27,956
Out of life.

681
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,859
Yeah, well we thought
the same about you.

682
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,996
He used to drive this artsy
car, that didn't even drive.

683
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,330
It wasn't arty,
it was a peugeot.

684
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,332
Fucking peugeot!

685
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,267
A peugeot!

686
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,069
He used to think he
was jean-luc truffaut,

687
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,404
With this silly hat...

688
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,873
Smoking cigarettes
and dirty fingernails.

689
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,275
Look p...

690
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:50,946
You've joined the human race,
and we're glad to have you.

691
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,814
It's a good thing.

692
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,150
You look good.

693
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,084
It's nice to meet you.

694
01:00:56,086 --> 01:01:00,088
I didn't realize
you had teeth before.

695
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,023
Hey...

696
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:02,758
To embracing life.

697
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,159
Cheers.

698
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,894
And all its flaws.

699
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,697
And all its warts, alright?

700
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,869
I'm gonna go use the bathroom.

701
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:14,803
Woah!

702
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,938
Are you alright?

703
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,810
Yeah, I had a drinks
meeting before I...

704
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:23,412
You want some coffee?

705
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:27,749
Excuse me.

706
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:30,886
Do you think I could
just crash here tonight...

707
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,821
Instead of
driving into the city?

708
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:33,955
'cause I...

709
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:37,693
We...

710
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:40,095
We work all night, ben,
and we sleep pretty late.

711
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,030
No, I'll be up
early in the morning.

712
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,100
I have a breakfast meeting.

713
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:46,101
No, of course.

714
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,102
Of course you can stay.

715
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:53,141
You shouldn't drive like this.

716
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:56,878
Sometimes you get
speedy, you know?

717
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,180
Paolo?

718
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:57,372
Get the fuck away from me!

719
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,312
Xenia, do you have a minute?

720
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:12,981
I have to tell you, bad
things are happening.

721
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:13,915
It's about mimi.

722
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,918
She's completely out of control.

723
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,519
She's endangering all of us.

724
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,189
She's been out every
night hunting humans,

725
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,991
Leaving them to resurrect.

726
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:23,925
How do you know this?

727
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:25,193
I just know.

728
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,328
You just know?

729
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,330
She swears to me
she's not, djuna.

730
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:31,533
Unless you have proof, I have
no reason not to believe her.

731
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,869
Now xenia, she's
bringing it into the house.

732
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,605
The other night she
brought a couple over here.

733
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,540
If I hadn't come...

734
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,242
What was happening?

735
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:42,644
The three of them were
in a sexual situation.

736
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:44,312
They were starting -

737
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:48,383
Djuna, don't be so puritanical.

738
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,454
When I first gave
up my old life,

739
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:55,056
No one believed I was clean.

740
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,526
Whatever I did was proof to
others that I was still sick.

741
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,528
I know it's hard to
have faith in her...

742
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:03,331
But I know where
she's coming from.

743
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,067
I've been there.

744
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,671
Darling, my play is
opening tomorrow night.

745
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,140
Please, put your
differences aside.

746
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,942
In a few days, she'll be gone.

747
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,077
Djuna.

748
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,345
What do you think?

749
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,146
I loved it tonight.

750
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,214
It was beyond words.

751
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:54,950
Neither of us can hardly speak.

752
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,084
You were magnificent.

753
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:57,686
Your performance,
djuna is right,

754
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,220
Was beyond words.

755
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:00,088
Give me more.

756
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,423
I must have words.

757
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:03,124
I mean, many words,
after you digest

758
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:07,529
Ms. Tomassini, prof. Ching
would like a word with you.

759
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,130
You're coming to dinner?

760
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,066
Yeah, of course.

761
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:11,666
Please do.

762
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:14,002
I love you.

763
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,004
Hello.

764
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,287
How are you?

765
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:42,163
Wasn't that amazing?

766
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:55,010
I need to get some air.

767
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,212
Excuse me.

768
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,282
Always so naughty.

769
01:07:01,284 --> 01:07:03,018
Sorry to make you leave.

770
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,219
Don't worry.

771
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:05,754
Check out this loon.

772
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:08,490
My god!

773
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,304
Xenia!

774
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:26,741
Xenia!

775
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,277
Folks, I told you
twenty times, no autographs.

776
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:32,080
I need everyone to the side!

777
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,819
You're a fan of ms. Tomassini?

778
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,554
What?

779
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,824
You should meet her some time.

780
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,826
I'm sure she'd like to meet
a fan as devoted as you

781
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,828
Seem to be.

782
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,829
Meet her?

783
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:50,698
Give me your number.

784
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,699
Mimi!

785
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,101
Andiamo, for Christ's sake!

786
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:54,836
How old are you?

787
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:57,839
Seventeen.

788
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,107
Hmm.

789
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,177
Lovely age.

790
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,293
What are you doing?

791
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:20,361
She's not leaving.

792
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:22,630
So then we'll leave sooner.

793
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:27,368
Either way, you've got to
stop doing this to yourself.

794
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:32,107
Why don't we get out of
the house for a while?

795
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:36,444
Huh?

796
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,581
Go down the hill, take a drive.

797
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,382
Clear your head.

798
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,864
If a part of you didn't want
me, I could have never

799
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:21,869
Made this work.

800
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,487
Pack.

801
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:15,690
We're leaving
tomorrow night, early.

802
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:17,091
We're gonna go to Italy.

803
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:17,825
Stay with the couple from
Cenia's party till our

804
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:20,161
House is ready.

805
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,764
Xenia arranged for
a private plane.

806
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,432
Everything.

807
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:26,434
It's all happening.

808
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:27,969
Pack.

809
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:29,837
She's expecting us, right?

810
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,640
She's expecting me.

811
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:36,844
I told her I was in the
neighborhood and I'd drop by.

812
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,913
She doesn't know
you've brought me?

813
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,849
Do you think she'll be upset?

814
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,688
She'll be delighted.

815
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,424
Hello xenia....

816
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,025
I've brought someone.

817
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,961
Her name is ann...

818
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:54,962
Hello, ann.

819
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:59,767
Hello, ms. Tomassini.

820
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,904
May we come in?

821
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,506
Please.

822
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,850
May I offer you
something to drink?

823
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:17,718
A glass of champagne, thank you.

824
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:31,232
So, how do you two
know each other?

825
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:33,634
Ann is your biggest fan.

826
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,904
So our paths crossed.

827
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,913
How have the shows been going?

828
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:46,781
Wonderful.

829
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:48,182
It's...

830
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,585
A wonderful situation.

831
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:53,120
It's a wonderful play.

832
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:56,057
It's beyond wonderful.

833
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,898
Mimi, may I talk to
you for a moment?

834
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,034
Yes, of course.

835
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,579
You can't bring a
virgin into my home.

836
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,915
A virgin!

837
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,250
You're around all sorts
of people all the time.

838
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:23,918
I really didn't think twice.

839
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,587
I thought you'd be fine with it.

840
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:29,790
Not to have alone in my home.

841
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,926
With the windows closed!

842
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:37,865
In my drawing room staring
at me like some sacrifice!

843
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,801
You've got to get her out!

844
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:44,305
I'm sorry, xenia,
I didn't think.

845
01:15:44,307 --> 01:15:46,107
I haven't tasted
human blood for 40 years.

846
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:51,312
It's almost a hundred years
I haven't tasted a virgin!

847
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:53,848
It's harder.

848
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,317
You have to prepare
for these things...

849
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,788
To know your limits,
what you can bear and...

850
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,256
What you can't.

851
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:06,661
This is not acceptable!

852
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,062
I understand.

853
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,998
Finish your glass of champagne
and say you have to go.

854
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,002
May I please have
a glass of water?

855
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,204
Of course.

856
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:21,809
I'll get it.

857
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:32,186
You're so beautiful.

858
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:36,657
Even more beautiful
without make-up.

859
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:38,793
Oh, well, thank you darling.

860
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:41,062
That's very sweet.

861
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,073
And what do you do?

862
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:53,674
I'm a student.

863
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,943
Of course.

864
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,813
Of course, you are.

865
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,017
I first saw you in medea.

866
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:08,255
It changed my life.

867
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,725
I don't mean to be strange...

868
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:15,930
But I have always felt that
we were destined to meet.

869
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,932
When mimi picked me out of
the crowd the other night...

870
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:20,401
And asked me if I'd
want to meet you...

871
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:23,671
I was surprised,
of course I was.

872
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:28,342
But part of me wasn't.

873
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,413
Drink your water, ann.

874
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:36,283
We have to be going soon.

875
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,295
Oh no!

876
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:51,132
Did you cut your
lip on the glass?

877
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:53,067
There must have been a chip.

878
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:56,937
Crystal chips so easily.

879
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,008
Are you alright?

880
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:01,742
Yeah.

881
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:03,277
It's fine.

882
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,080
I have another appointment.

883
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:08,416
Don't leave yet.

884
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:13,287
You can't leave,
bleeding like that.

885
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:14,955
Perhaps ann can stay
until her bleeding stops.

886
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:17,892
Yes.

887
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:20,027
But I have to go myself.

888
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,096
Stay until it stops.

889
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:25,366
It is destiny.

890
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:29,170
Good-bye, xenia.

891
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,408
Are you sure you don't
want me to take her?

892
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,077
No...

893
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:43,150
We'll have a glass of
champagne and a nice talk.

894
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:46,821
Bye-bye.

895
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:49,890
Bye-bye.

896
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:00,494
No one knows and
no one has to know.

897
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:04,832
I know how it is.

898
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,902
I can help you
take care of this.

899
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:11,438
If you have a saw, I
can do it in the bathtub.

900
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,909
I'm happy to help.

901
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:20,915
But there is something
we need to talk about.

902
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:22,049
I can't go to phoenix, xenia.

903
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:30,991
I'm all packed.

904
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:34,395
Before you get on
that plane with me,

905
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:36,430
And we do this...

906
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:39,366
There's something I
need to tell you.

907
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:42,236
What is it?

908
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:45,973
I could stay in
the estate for now.

909
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:50,311
But what I'd really like to
do is have a place here

910
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,179
In the city.

911
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,981
Do you think you could
arrange that for me, xenia?

912
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,459
You're the best.

913
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:39,059
There's something I
need to tell you as well.

914
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,933
Yeah?

915
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:52,606
Your agent...

916
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,048
She did?
