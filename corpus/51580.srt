1
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:11,166
- What did you say your name was again?
- Sean.

2
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,640
Sean, yeah. I did business
with a guy named Sean once.

3
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,577
- Fucked me over real good.
- Well, you can trust me, sir.

4
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:22,582
This woman wants her car delivered
by Tuesday. That's five days from now.

5
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,347
- Okay, I can do it. I worked out...
- I don't give a shit how you do it...

6
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,219
so long as it gets there by Tuesday
and in one piece.

7
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,281
And if it doesn't,
that bitch is gonna ream my ass.

8
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,691
If that happens,
I'm gonna come looking for yours.

9
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,093
- Yes, sir.
- What the hell are you eating?

10
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,758
- None of your goddamn business.
- What did the doctor say?

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,926
Oh, fuck the doctor.
You got them papers yet?

12
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,493
- I'm getting there.
- Been getting there for the last hour.

13
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,597
I'm getting there, Ned,
and I'm still getting there.

14
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:48,801
These are your papers
and your registration.

15
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,969
They'll explain everything
if the cops pull you over.

16
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,240
- But that ain't gonna happen.
- No, sir.

17
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:55,578
This one's our contract.
You get half your fee up front.

18
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,141
And the other half
when you deliver the car.

19
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,278
Here. Sign here.

20
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:03,784
What about insurance?

21
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,655
Don't worry. I'm covered.

22
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,287
If you get into an accident
and it's the other guy's fault...

23
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,626
just call me.

24
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:12,563
What if it's my fault?

25
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,796
Well, then you'd better hope to hell
I never catch your ass.

26
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,076
Now remember.
This ain't no sightseeing trip.

27
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,773
If you fuck around,
you're not gonna make Miami by Tuesday.

28
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,409
And no goddamn hitchhikers.

29
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:33,249
I don't care what kind of hard-luck
story they give. Don't pick them up.

30
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:37,018
It's just asking for trouble.
Woman's a real ball-buster.

31
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,083
Her husband ran off
with some Florida State cheerleader...

32
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,425
and she got this beauty
in the divorce settlement.

33
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:46,365
- And she doesn't want a scratch on it.
- Sure this thing will make it to Miami?

34
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,232
Not that old piece of shit.
This one.

35
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,022
- You should have seen this guy.
- A $50,000 car.

36
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,460
Absolutely primo.
The husband restored everything...

37
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,055
right down to the nuts and bolts.

38
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,033
Well, when are you splitting?

39
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,127
As soon as I tell Decker.

40
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:27,967
He's never gonna let you go,
not in a million years.

41
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,806
The geek wants to see you
in his office, Sean.

42
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,753
Saw the car, dude. It's dope.

43
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,587
- He's gonna get fired.
- Decker wouldn't dare. Sean rules.

44
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,320
- I'll bet you ten bucks he gets canned.
- You're on.

45
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,827
- You wanted to see me?
- What's this about taking the week off?

46
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,569
My sister's getting married. I thought
I couldn't go. I didn't have the bucks...

47
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,836
- What's Teen Zombie's release date?
- September 1 5.

48
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,367
- I got to deliver a trailer by August.
- I can mix and deliver in time.

49
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:08,244
- I got a week's vacation coming.
- You don't see me taking a vacation.

50
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:11,774
If I went around all the time,
this place would go to shit.

51
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:17,022
All right. You want to fire me,
fine, but I'm going.

52
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:21,551
One week. That's it. And if that trailer
isn't on time, your ass is out of here.

53
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,460
- Thanks.
- Fuck you.

54
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,166
So?

55
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,274
I'll see you guys in a week.

56
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,261
- Hey, where you headed, cowboy?
- Miami.

57
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,496
We're going to Big Bob Dune Races.

58
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,538
It's on your way.
You should check it out.

59
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,268
- I can't.
- Aw, why not?

60
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:43,333
I got kind of a tight schedule.

61
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:47,177
You know, it's too bad 'cause
you don't know what you're missing.

62
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,977
Holy shit!

63
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:36,528
Fuck!

64
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,371
Ain't not damage except to the rim,
as far as I can tell.

65
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:53,078
I could pound it out for you
to make it look as good as new.

66
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:56,082
It would take me till tomorrow
to get that size of tire.

67
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,777
What about using the spare?

68
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,253
The highway's shut down up ahead
for the next 30 miles.

69
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,986
You gotta take some back roads.

70
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,927
I wouldn't want to get caught
out in the badlands without a spare.

71
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:14,567
Yeah, this is great. I lost my wallet.
I can't believe this.

72
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:19,595
- You gonna be able to pay for this?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

73
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,039
I was saving this
for my sister's wedding present.

74
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,278
Yeah. Yeah,
I can pay for the tire.

75
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:30,374
Hey, this motel down here...
is it clean?

76
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,885
Huh?

77
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,429
Fourteen. How was it?

78
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,038
Now what good is all that?

79
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,635
You know, he's only
gonna come back with the others.

80
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,675
- And you'll get shot.
- We're gonna get you out so fast...

81
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,685
you won't touch ground.

82
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,857
Wait a minute. I helped you out
this far. Now I'm finished.

83
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,193
- You're what?
- I said I'm finished.

84
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,664
I come into town on business.

85
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,894
Look, my cattle's dying.
I gotta take care of them.

86
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:25,530
- Dan, you're the best shot we've got.
- Well, that's not my job.

87
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,319
Thanks.

88
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:18,272
Nice ride. Where you headed?

89
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:22,981
Florida.

90
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,848
- You going through Houston?
- Yeah.

91
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,015
Well, I'm pointed that way.

92
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,855
What are the chances
of you giving me a lift?

93
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,696
Come on, man.
It's a long, lonely ride by yourself.

94
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:39,926
You could use some company, huh?

95
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,935
Look, man, I'm sorry.
It's not my car, all right?

96
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm driving it for the owner.
Part of the deal is no hitchhikers.

97
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:48,434
The sun's killing me.

98
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,636
The local dick...
he's already stopped me twice.

99
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,238
- Asked me to get my ass out of town.
- You'll get a ride.

100
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,146
What if I don't?

101
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,179
What if you pick up the newspaper
tomorrow and you read about...

102
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:03,485
some slacker road kill with a picture
of my face staring back at you, huh?

103
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:06,617
Could you live with that?

104
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,821
I'll pay for gas!

105
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,876
All the gas until Houston?

106
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,878
Name's Nick.

107
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,971
Sean.

108
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,982
You made the right decision, Sean.

109
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,461
My sister kept everything together
after my mom died.

110
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,396
Went to work out of high school.
Put herself through college.

111
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,627
Put me through film school.

112
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,635
I really wanna be there
for her wedding.

113
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,637
You make a lot of money
in the movie biz?

114
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,435
Not yet.
Right now I'm just cutting trailers.

115
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,069
- What are trailers?
- You know, coming attractions.

116
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,376
I cut the video trailers
for Death Ball and Sorority Killers.

117
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,746
Really?

118
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,217
Well, can't say I saw those.

119
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:08,982
Movies are at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain for me.

120
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,787
No, I wanna cut features.
That is where the real money is.

121
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,055
Maybe direct someday.

122
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,324
My dad was the second assistant on E. T.

123
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,333
Now I saw that one.

124
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,495
Me and my friend scored some killer bud
one night, and we rented it.

125
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,480
What are you doing?

126
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,414
Drinking a beer.
Only one left, and it's warm.

127
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,919
- If you say please, I'll share it.
- Not while I'm driving.

128
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,789
That's cool.

129
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,359
I mean both of us.

130
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:52,090
- I'm not driving.
- I don't wanna chance getting busted.

131
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,834
Who the hell is gonna bust us out here?
I haven't even seen any road kill.

132
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,873
That's not the point. Besides,
I don't want you spilling it in the car.

133
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,500
- I'm not a fucking geek!
- Listen, get rid of it.

134
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:31,303
You said get rid of it.

135
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,416
- Still pissed? You don't have to pay.
- You ever hear of a warrant?

136
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,426
You don't even live in this state.

137
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,190
I mean, unless you're worried
about being extradited for littering.

138
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:58,629
He didn't even bust you
for the open container.

139
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,167
Hey, don't push it, all right?

140
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,700
Hey, man, you gotta lighten up.

141
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,613
How you boys doing this evening?

142
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,584
Fine. You?

143
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:23,020
Son of a bitch died on us just
as we pulled in here to take a piss.

144
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,186
- Think the battery's gone dead.
- We need a jump.

145
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,896
- I don't have any cables.
- That's okay. We got some.

146
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,229
So, what do you say?

147
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,036
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

148
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:41,233
You want to pop the hood?

149
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,674
Get in and turn it over
when I tell you.

150
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,140
We really appreciate your help.

151
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,778
Thank you.
I'd sure hate to get stuck out here...

152
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,913
in this shit-hole.

153
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:59,356
Hey, how much you pay
for a ride like that?

154
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,918
- I don't know. It's not mine.
- Well, whose is it?

155
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:06,261
Shut up, Pen.
Kick it over, Teddy.

156
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:08,794
Fuck.

157
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:15,140
Again.

158
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,479
Fuckin' A. Ready?

159
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:26,081
You might want to keep that running
for a while. Let it charge up.

160
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:27,586
We'll do that.

161
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:38,788
Can I ask you guys,
were you in Tonopah last night?

162
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,128
We were in Kingman last night.

163
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,936
I thought I saw your car
in the motel there.

164
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,670
No, must have been another one
just like it.

165
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:53,508
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

166
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,925
You got any money you could spare?

167
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,496
- Not really.
- You sure?

168
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,794
Don't be a bitch. You heard him.

169
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,402
No harm in asking, right?

170
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,276
- The one riding shotgun's a hunter.
- I know.

171
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,616
Then why did you let him go?

172
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,883
How many times
do I have to tell you?

173
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:40,017
There's a time and a place...

174
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,526
for everything.

175
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:01,004
How's that steak?

176
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,605
It's good. Want some?

177
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,981
- You sure?
- Yeah.

178
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:07,145
If that was any rarer,
it'd still be grazing somewhere.

179
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:12,450
Do you eat like that
'cause you're tapped out?

180
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,155
Yeah, I'm tapped out. Lost my wallet,
credit cards, everything.

181
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,663
Got barely enough money
to get to my sister's wedding and back.

182
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,165
Fucking ordered cheese.

183
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,669
So what's your deal, man?
What do you do?

184
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,333
As little as possible.

185
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,435
Yeah, but you gotta make money.
You work?

186
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,773
I cruise.
I find something to do when I need to.

187
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,976
Kind of like a day-to-day thing.

188
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,985
What about the future?

189
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,955
I mean, what do you want to be doing,
say, I don't know, ten years from now?

190
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:47,225
I don't give a shit.
I could be dead tomorrow.

191
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:50,861
If everybody had your attitude,
we'd really be fucked.

192
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,890
We are fucked. Take a look
at the world we inherited.

193
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:58,495
We're a bunch of fast-food munching
MTV freaks humping the American dream.

194
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,698
You gonna finish that pie?

195
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:06,006
No. No, I guess I'm not.

196
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,571
The generation before us sold their
innocence for 200 satellite stations...

197
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,583
and it's been downhill ever since.

198
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:15,485
They had Mickey Mouse,
Easy Rider and the Beatles.

199
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:18,683
All right? We got South Park,
the Blair bitch and Ricky Martin.

200
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,990
They had, "Be here now."
We got, "Shit happens."

201
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:25,088
If that doesn't put things into
perspective, I don't know what does.

202
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,225
We're just Microsoft Neanderthals
addicted to surfing Net land...

203
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:30,235
still shitting in our own nest.

204
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:33,170
And every time I think about giving
a rat's ass, I just picture Monica...

205
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,504
making millions
from sucking Bill's little red rooster.

206
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:38,840
And that just rockets me
right back into reality.

207
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,579
You are really depressing.
You know that, right?

208
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,742
Yes.

209
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,651
Here. My treat.

210
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:50,212
You pay. I'm gonna piss.

211
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,400
Look, miss.
This is a private tour bus.

212
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,369
I don't know what's wrong with you,
but if you wanna go somewhere...

213
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:49,415
you gotta get inside and buy yourself
a ticket for the regular bus.

214
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:00,852
You owe me for the coffee, honey.

215
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,623
- What's wrong with you?
- What's going on?

216
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,126
- I don't know.
- What is wrong with her?

217
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,794
I think she's stoned
and flat-ass broke too.

218
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,805
That's great.
Who's gonna pay me for this?

219
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,504
I will.

220
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:18,938
- I'll pay.
- If she's a friend...

221
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:21,810
you better get her some help
before the sheriff sees her around here.

222
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,548
It's okay.

223
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,851
I know what's wrong with you,
and I wanna help you.

224
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:32,687
- Easy, Nick. You're scaring her.
- I know what I'm doing, Sean.

225
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,853
- I'm serious. Take it easy.
- I said I know what I'm doing.

226
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,864
Hey, look at her. She's shaking.

227
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,992
- Get the car.
- Look, I can't get involved in this.

228
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,695
Get the fucking car!

229
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,203
Fuck!

230
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:57,944
Well, I can let you have number six.

231
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,543
It's 45 bucks.

232
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,555
- Yeah, that's fine.
- In advance.

233
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:07,559
I'm tired of you dune racers
fucking the place up...

234
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:11,085
so no funny business
or I'll boot your ass out.

235
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:13,564
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:19,004
She was trying to get on that bus. Maybe
wherever it's going is where she's from.

237
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:22,906
Get my bags from the car
and as much ice as you can, all right?

238
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,672
What is the deal here, Nick? What do you
mean, you know what's wrong with her?

239
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,683
Just get my stuff,
and I'll tell you everything.

240
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,838
This is all the ice I could...
What the fuck are you doing?

241
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:37,314
Her blood's burning up.
I gotta cool her down.

242
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:41,480
- Maybe we should get her a doctor.
- I'm gonna be needing a lot more ice.

243
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,284
Get back to that restaurant
and get as much as they'll give you.

244
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,848
I'm not getting shit until you tell me
what the hell is going on.

245
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,490
- She's infected.
- What do you mean? Infected how?

246
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:59,262
Jesus. What the hell is all that shit?

247
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,332
I swear to God, man,
I will drop you a clue. I promise you.

248
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,344
But I need the fucking ice.

249
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,321
Yeah, come on, baby! Yeah!

250
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,502
Goddamn it, Merk, you asshole.

251
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,772
Put that fucking thing away
before you kill somebody.

252
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:43,878
Shut that shit out!

253
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,884
I blast that motherfucker clean!

254
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,546
Hey, Prize, man!

255
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:52,079
Put the goddamn gun away before I come
up there and kick your skinny ass.

256
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:56,652
Oh, I am scared shitless!
I'm shaking all over the place, man.

257
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,527
Better watch out. You're gonna
shoot your dick off with that thing.

258
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,363
Wouldn't take much.

259
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,426
Very funny, bitch.

260
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:06,564
Hey.

261
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:14,742
We saw the lights. Wondered
if you guys could spare a few beers.

262
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:17,442
- "We"?
- My friends and me.

263
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,547
Oh, God.

264
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:27,286
So, you got any beers or what?

265
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,761
- This is a private party.
- Sorry.

266
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,627
We didn't know that.

267
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,260
Well, now you do.

268
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:40,796
Why don't you motivate your ass on out
of here before you piss somebody off...

269
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:43,468
and end up with my boot
in your ass?

270
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:47,774
Just one beer?

271
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,644
Hey, why don't you toss me a cold one?

272
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,621
You got it, bro.

273
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,041
How's that for you?

274
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:20,335
How about another for my friend?

275
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,646
Una mas coming up.

276
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:43,701
Oh, shit!

277
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:03,187
Yeah, run, baby!

278
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,597
Shit! Get in!

279
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,969
Hey, you gotta calm down!
Calm down!

280
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,977
Calm down!

281
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,674
No, wait! Stop! Calm down!

282
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,274
Shh! You are safe!
You're safe!

283
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:36,584
Shut up! Shh! Quiet. Shh.

284
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:39,682
What's happening to her?

285
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,923
Come here! Help me hold her!
She's gonna hurt herself! She's gonna...

286
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:46,295
Drop the fucking box and help me!

287
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:51,731
- Shh! Shh!
- Give me her arm!

288
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:53,465
Shit!

289
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,473
What's going on in there?

290
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,377
What the hell
are you freaks doing in there?

291
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:05,281
- Nothing. My sister had a bad nightmare.
- Bullshit.

292
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:09,447
- Shh!
- There's something funny going on.

293
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:12,514
Nothing's going on in here.
I swear. My sister had a bad dream.

294
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:15,425
I want you out of here come morning.
Understood?

295
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:16,928
That's not a problem.

296
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,803
You gotta hold her tight.

297
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,874
- What is that? What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I've done this before.

298
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:45,213
- She's got a blood disorder.
- How do you know that?

299
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,918
Trust me. I know.

300
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,724
- What kind of disorder?
- She's got a virus.

301
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:53,265
It can be slowly controlled by drugs,
but only for a little while.

302
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:58,761
The only real cure is to find
the original source of infection...

303
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,271
and kill it.

304
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,838
Now I'm about to lay
some heavy shit on you, my man.

305
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:10,371
And you're probably gonna bail,
but I am totally played out...

306
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,384
and I need your help.

307
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,819
What happened to your hand?

308
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:22,660
She must have...

309
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:26,861
She must have bit me.

310
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:15,314
What the hell do you kids want?

311
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,580
I had the weirdest dreams.

312
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:28,149
There was all this blood.

313
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:32,456
I was hanging with these...

314
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:38,988
That was way back in time.
Some weird shit.

315
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,659
How do you feel?

316
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:47,899
Wiped out.
It's like I was 'shrooming or something.

317
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:53,678
- You were bit by a vampire.
- Yeah, right.

318
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:01,410
You know, I was thinking maybe...

319
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:05,248
maybe I should drop
the two of you off in San Antonio.

320
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:10,385
Come on.
I gotta show you something.

321
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:21,172
Is that who I think it is?

322
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,318
What the fuck is he doing?

323
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:47,994
What are you doing?

324
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,167
Wake up, fuckface.

325
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,467
Jesus Christ,
you fucking killed him.

326
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:55,473
I doubt it.

327
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:04,112
- Open the trunk.
- Why?

328
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:06,083
Just open the trunk.
You'll find out.

329
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,719
- What am I supposed to be looking for?
- There's nothing in there?

330
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:17,763
- No, there's nothing but an old tarp.
- What?

331
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,062
Get her off of me!

332
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:32,877
Bitch.

333
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:45,815
Shit!

334
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:57,168
Now do you believe me?

335
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,591
Oh, shit!

336
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,900
Shit! Fuck!

337
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,134
Oh, you gotta be shitting me!

338
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,149
- What?
- We got a problem.

339
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:49,187
That motherfucker overslept again!

340
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:07,464
We gotta get out of here.

341
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,708
What you wanna do about her?

342
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:15,812
Okeydokey.
But it sure seems like a waste.

343
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:09,593
- Oh, God!
- You okay?

344
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:13,126
- Fuck no, I'm not okay!
- Take the drugs to slow the virus.

345
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:15,537
- If you don't, you're gonna turn.
- No drugs.

346
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,337
You're not listening to me.

347
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,776
If you turn before we kill the source
of the infection, you are fucked!

348
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:23,144
Who the hell are you, man?
How do you know this shit?

349
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:25,274
That's not important.
What's important is that you...

350
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:28,320
- Fuck you, it's not important!
- Hey, you gotta trust me, all right?

351
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,787
You got me into this shit!
Who the fuck are you?

352
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,824
You wanna know who I am?
Take a look at that!

353
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:37,560
I was bitten
a little over a year ago.

354
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,097
Some bitch at a party.

355
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,395
For two days,
I was sick as a dog just like you...

356
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,833
so I took myself to the hospital.

357
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:47,066
Lucky for me,
one of the interns had been bitten...

358
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,266
and he knew about the drugs.

359
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:54,005
I think the vamp that bit this girl is
the one I traced my infection back to.

360
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,604
- I tracked him down here.
- So which one is it?

361
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,912
Is it the poser or is it the retard?

362
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:03,580
It's the poser. The retard's not a vamp.
He's their day driver.

363
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,853
You know the Penthouse pet from hell?
She's a full-blown feeder.

364
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:08,860
But nearly turned.
You can see it in her eyes.

365
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,419
So why didn't we kill the fucker
when we had the chance?

366
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,591
Because you can only kill the Forsaken
on hallowed ground.

367
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,795
What the hell's the Forsaken?

368
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,964
What do you mean, "hallowed ground"?
What do you mean, like, a church?

369
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,840
Tell that bitch to shut the fuck up!

370
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:30,848
I can't hear what you're saying!

371
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:36,580
Fucking A.
They barbecued her fucking ass.

372
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:40,682
And tell your girl I was right. You
should have whacked that hunter before.

373
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:48,058
All right. Calm down.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

374
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,504
Shit.

375
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,042
I said, shit, we got company.

376
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,685
I can handle it. No sweat.

377
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:18,129
Can I see your license
and registration?

378
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,128
Do you know you were going
95 miles an hour back there?

379
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:28,537
No, sure didn't.
Kind of just got away from me.

380
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,541
Eighty-five is getting away from you.

381
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,601
Ninety-five is a felony speeding
here in Texas, my friend.

382
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,670
It says here
your license is expired.

383
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,339
No shit.

384
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:42,482
Why don't you just sit here for a second
while I run this.

385
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,955
- He's gonna run my license.
- What'd you say?

386
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,959
Nothing. No, I didn't say nothing.

387
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:52,521
Yes, you did. It sounded
like you were talking to someone else.

388
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,691
No. Just talking to myself.

389
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,036
You been drinking, sir?

390
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:02,232
I haven't had a drink in years.

391
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:05,072
Do you mind stepping out
of the vehicle, please?

392
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,042
- Of course not.
- And open up the trunk for me.

393
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,574
Ain't nothing in the trunk.

394
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:15,779
- I'd like to see, just the same.
- Okeydokey.

395
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,491
But I think
you're gonna be disappointed.

396
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:31,670
Told you!

397
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:41,880
What you want me to do with him?

398
00:40:44,283 --> 00:40:47,081
Yeah, he's still alive.

399
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:48,585
Okeydokey.

400
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:02,389
There's one in here
like they always carry.

401
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:29,793
Of course I am.
I ain't an idiot.

402
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,227
Fucking bitch.

403
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:53,647
- What are these?
- Antigens, aminos, proteins.

404
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,678
Back in the late '80s when they were
getting into drug cocktails for HIV...

405
00:41:57,756 --> 00:42:01,590
some doctor that had been bitten
mixed one that slowed the virus.

406
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,323
Now, everybody's different, but usually
it takes about a week to turn.

407
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,195
If you get on the cocktail,
you'll buy yourself some time.

408
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:09,894
How long do the drugs work?

409
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:14,101
They can hold off the onset
for a couple of years.

410
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:16,240
But not forever?

411
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:19,610
No. Not forever.

412
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,008
Is that what you gave her?

413
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,781
No, I'm just keeping her snowed
with morphine.

414
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,481
Why?

415
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:32,615
If her friend back there didn't know
we were hunting before...

416
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,215
he sure as shit does now.

417
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:36,227
He's gonna come after us,
and that's exactly what I want.

418
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:40,188
She acts as a homing device.
The virus is telegenetic.

419
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:44,065
He can track us as long as I keep
letting the virus in her grow stronger.

420
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,866
Yeah, well, who gave you the right
to play God with her life?

421
00:42:47,906 --> 00:42:50,841
Hey, this is all about survival
of the fittest.

422
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,877
You don't learn that,
and you are gonna die.

423
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:58,149
Or worse.

424
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:48,526
Fuck me. I feel incredible.
My whole body just tingles.

425
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,765
Yeah, it's seductive. But just remember
what came out of that trunk.

426
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,272
Yeah.

427
00:43:57,976 --> 00:44:01,639
You never answered me from before.
Why do you call them the Forsaken?

428
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:05,706
- How much do you know about vampires?
- I saw Coppola's Dracula.

429
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:07,877
No, that whole Vlad the Impaler story's
horse shit.

430
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,521
The real deal started at the siege
of Antioch during the Great Crusade.

431
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,683
The first battle was a bloodbath.

432
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:15,693
The Turks kicked ass...

433
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,628
leaving 200 French knights dead
or dying in a raging blizzard.

434
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,757
By nightfall, there was only
nine of them still alive.

435
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,324
That's when Banta appeared before them.

436
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,667
- Who's that?
- The angel from the bottomless pit.

437
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,970
In medieval legend,
he appeared after battles...

438
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,773
all dressed in black armor,
looking for souls to steal.

439
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:45,451
And the story goes
that eight of these French knights...

440
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:48,425
made a pact with the demon
for eternal life.

441
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:52,259
To seal the deal, they killed and drank
the blood of the ninth one who refused.

442
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:55,027
But when the sun came up, they were
so ashamed of what they had done...

443
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,125
they couldn't stand the sight
of each other.

444
00:44:57,202 --> 00:44:59,762
So they went and hid in caves
until nightfall.

445
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:01,772
They then went their separate ways...

446
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,774
spread out all across the world alone...

447
00:45:03,842 --> 00:45:06,675
forever cursed with the desire
for human blood...

448
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,509
and unable ever again
to walk in daylight.

449
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,913
The curse gradually became known
as a disease.

450
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:15,112
And as it spread, people started
calling them the Forsaken.

451
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,912
The eight. Are they still kicking?

452
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:20,959
About 300 years later,
the first one...

453
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:23,221
was hunted down and killed
in the Spanish Inquisition.

454
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:27,288
But before they whacked him,
he spilled the whole story.

455
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:29,994
The others?

456
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:34,528
Over the past 500 years, three more
have been hunted down and killed.

457
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,801
And we got four left.

458
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:40,038
One's in Africa,
one in Eastern Europe...

459
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,411
and we know about two right here
in the United States of America...

460
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:47,509
our boy being one of them.

461
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:52,046
I don't get it. If we waste this guy,
how does that cure us?

462
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,149
I told you.
The virus is telegenetic.

463
00:45:54,226 --> 00:45:57,718
The strains are linked
to the original.

464
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,356
The last one was killed
in Paris, 1 967.

465
00:46:00,432 --> 00:46:02,662
He had two feeders with him
who hadn't turned yet.

466
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:06,500
Both of them recovered with no signs
of the virus in their blood.

467
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:09,836
We kill the source of origin,
and we kill the strain.

468
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,006
What if you do turn?

469
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:15,308
The virus mutates into something
that can't be killed...

470
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,405
except by decapitation or sunlight.

471
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:19,473
In other words, a vampire.

472
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:23,009
There's an old Spanish mission
about 60 miles up the road.

473
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:25,488
I say we go there,
and we wait.

474
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:27,684
How do we get his ass to the mission?

475
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:30,023
Oh, he'll find us.

476
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:35,464
What if she turns before he does?

477
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:37,365
Then we kill her.

478
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:39,700
Yeah, that's right. I forgot.
We really kill her.

479
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:41,796
Well, what do you want to do, Sean?

480
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:45,434
Wanna get to know her better?
Catch a movie with her?

481
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,070
Just make sure you keep her away
from any major arteries.

482
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:51,638
- That's not funny.
- Exactly.

483
00:46:57,222 --> 00:46:58,519
It just doesn't seem fair.

484
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:01,791
What's that?

485
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:07,293
I wanna put her on the pills.
Let me become the decoy.

486
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,837
She was bitten way before me. That means
I've got longer before I turn.

487
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:15,065
- I don't care. I said no.
- Why?

488
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,473
Because when the time comes,
I'm gonna need all the muscle I can get.

489
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:23,174
What is going on with this guy?

490
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,746
Jesus.

491
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:31,884
There's another lane, asshole! Fuck.

492
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,226
This guy's seriously psycho.

493
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:46,766
- Fuck, it's them!
- What? Oh, great.

494
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:48,829
What do we do now?

495
00:47:53,612 --> 00:47:57,241
- Control her!
- I'm trying to!

496
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:01,244
- Can you go faster?
- Yeah, I can drive faster.

497
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,719
Then do it! Drive faster!
Let's get the hell out of here!

498
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,385
- You ain't going fast!
- I can't!

499
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:12,892
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

500
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,528
He shot the son of a bitch's car!

501
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:28,403
Get in the back seat!

502
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,950
You bite me, I'll kill you!

503
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,380
- Hang on.
- What are you doing?

504
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,426
- I got an idea.
- Is it a good one?

505
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:44,121
I don't know.
I'm about to find out.

506
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:09,614
Shit!

507
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,288
- Fucking skank! Look at the car!
- Who cares? Get in the car!

508
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:18,295
We don't have time for this!

509
00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:21,525
Don't let her get away!

510
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,100
Come here! Stop it!

511
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,162
- Stop it!
- Hold her.

512
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,367
- No. They already know where we are!
- Come on!

513
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:33,934
Listen to me. Either she gets
on the cocktail, or I stop taking it.

514
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,276
And no more morphine,
or she'll never talk.

515
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:39,750
Shit! What the fuck
did you do that for?

516
00:49:39,818 --> 00:49:42,218
No more time for these games!
We gotta get to the mission!

517
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:45,188
Come on!

518
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:46,815
Let's go! Come on!

519
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:07,976
Get down!

520
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:12,412
- Go!
- Shit!

521
00:50:13,285 --> 00:50:16,413
You gotta be fucking kidding me!
Fuck!

522
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,752
Son of a bitch died on us again!

523
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:20,757
Why the fuck can't you keep
this car running?

524
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:23,487
You shut your fucking face!
It's not my fault!

525
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,092
Why aren't they following us, Nick?

526
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:34,104
I don't know.

527
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,669
Shit.

528
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:46,239
It's not my fault they don't put
any money in the damn car.

529
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,878
Keep wasting it on that bitch.

530
00:50:48,954 --> 00:50:52,253
Maybe if you put some money
in the car...

531
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:54,258
we wouldn't be here, would we?

532
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,476
Fucking whore.

533
00:51:18,984 --> 00:51:20,918
Oh, boy.

534
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,417
Hey, we got one.

535
00:51:31,196 --> 00:51:34,893
- You want some of this shit?
- Yeah. Right here.

536
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,527
- Geez, look. Check her out, man. Look.
- Ah, man!

537
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:40,628
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man.

538
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:42,730
- Pussy!
- Pussy!

539
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:57,816
- What's up, sugar?
- Car died. I don't know what happened.

540
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:01,825
This retard here can't seem
to keep the goddamn thing going.

541
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:02,985
Shut up.

542
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,027
So, what do you think?

543
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,396
Can you help us out?

544
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:15,863
We could take a look.

545
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,500
Great. We're lucky you came along.

546
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:20,567
Most people wouldn't stop out here
at night.

547
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:25,582
Yeah. We really appreciate your help.

548
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,851
- I'll get the tools.
- All right, then.

549
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,764
Give her more pills.

550
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,768
- If I give her any more, she'll O.D.
- Why is she still fucked up?

551
00:52:44,836 --> 00:52:47,737
The cocktail works slower
when you're closer to turning, Sean.

552
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,807
- What's the matter?
- We're running out of gas.

553
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:55,642
- How can we be running out of gas?
- Because they hit the tank.

554
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,581
- How much we got left?
- I don't know. Ten or fifteen miles.

555
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:02,711
- What do I look like, a mechanic?
- That's excellent.

556
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:07,121
I'm gonna check out this shed.
You stay with her, all right?

557
00:53:55,907 --> 00:53:57,841
- Hey.
- Jesus!

558
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:02,810
- Is that what I think it is?
- I told you to stay in the car.

559
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:04,815
I heard a noise. I got worried.

560
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,048
That's the car.

561
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,816
- Hurry up. We gotta stop her! The car!
- I'm moving!

562
00:54:14,893 --> 00:54:17,020
Run! Stop!

563
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:20,496
Wait! Stop the car!

564
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:24,365
I got all my shit in there!
Come on!

565
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:28,771
Damn!

566
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,813
Yeah, by the looks of it,
you're probably gonna need...

567
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:20,756
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Let's take a walk.

568
00:55:20,825 --> 00:55:23,794
- What's going on?
- Time to die, cowboy.

569
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:33,460
I got 40 bucks on me.
That's all I got.

570
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,472
But I got credit cards.
I can give you the PI N number.

571
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,974
This is far enough.

572
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:40,977
- Kneel down.
- Just take the wallet, please.

573
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:42,569
Kneel down.

574
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:56,583
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

575
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:59,858
And we're thinking about getting married
after we graduate.

576
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:03,890
And her dad is so rich.
And I could call him.

577
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:06,698
And he's got so much money...

578
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:10,273
Please, God, don't do this to me.

579
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:22,013
Got your whole life planned out,
do you?

580
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:45,775
What you want me to do
with their car?

581
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:47,674
We're taking it.

582
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:59,352
You know how long
I've been tracking this guy for?

583
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,091
Nine months.

584
00:57:03,861 --> 00:57:05,954
It's not easy.
They hide their killing.

585
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,590
Make it look like a gang fight.

586
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,931
Robberies. A guy riding a freight train
killing old women.

587
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:14,198
All kinds of shit.
Almost all serial killers.

588
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,205
Here. Let me get this.

589
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:22,678
It's weird.

590
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:28,679
Three days ago, I had a phat job
and not a worry in the world.

591
00:57:28,753 --> 00:57:31,313
And now I'm gonna turn
into a vampire...

592
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:35,189
if I don't whack
some freaked-out psycho.

593
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:39,362
On top of all that,
I'm gonna lose my job.

594
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:46,702
How'd you get into the movie biz
anyways? Your old man?

595
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,099
My old man doesn't know I exist.

596
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,373
Yeah. He walked out on my mom
when she was pregnant with me.

597
00:58:00,785 --> 00:58:03,845
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah.

598
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:08,187
I guess it just must be
in the blood then, huh?

599
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:09,920
Like father, like son.

600
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:13,187
Shit, I hope not.

601
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:15,664
My mom told me my dad was
a cross-dressing Marine drill sergeant.

602
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,880
Where did you get this?

603
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:37,478
I found it along the road
while I was hitching.

604
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,489
You gotta be pretty pissed, huh?

605
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,787
You had my fucking wallet
the whole time?

606
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:43,451
Yeah.

607
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:47,589
- And you didn't tell me?
- No.

608
00:58:51,102 --> 00:58:53,662
That's fucked up.

609
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,174
There it is.

610
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:10,345
This car's trashed, man.

611
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:14,357
Do you know how much a new transmission
in a car like this is gonna cost?

612
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,518
Would you stop worrying about the car?

613
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,289
Is that her?

614
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,079
Let me handle this.

615
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,386
It's okay. Come on.
Now listen to me.

616
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,854
We are the only ones
who can get you out of this alive.

617
00:59:45,923 --> 00:59:47,322
We got a car coming.

618
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:48,722
- It's all right.
- Let's go.

619
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,351
Shit!

620
00:59:50,428 --> 00:59:51,918
Come on.

621
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:54,829
Let's go. Hurry!

622
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,703
Put her in the back.

623
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,897
All right, get in, lie low.

624
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,839
- Hey, Sean, it's them.
- It could be anybody.

625
01:00:14,352 --> 01:00:16,582
Yeah, but if it's them,
we can't make a stand here.

626
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,588
We gotta get to the mission.

627
01:00:24,762 --> 01:00:26,195
- Shit.
- It's them.

628
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:28,357
They've seen us.

629
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,093
Start the car.

630
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:38,141
- Come on! Not now!
- What's going on?

631
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:41,235
- It's not going into gear.
- Man, we gotta get out.

632
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:43,644
- Come on!
- They're coming. Go!

633
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:46,308
Yank it! Come on!

634
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:48,443
Go! Come on!

635
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:51,215
Go, go, go!

636
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:56,926
Sean, come on! Let's go!

637
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:59,326
Take a fucking left!
Let's go!

638
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:03,464
No! Left!

639
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:15,610
- What the hell is he doing?
- Whoo! Go! Go!

640
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:20,212
- Sean, what are you doing?
- Playing a little chicken.

641
01:01:21,419 --> 01:01:22,943
Come on, you pussies!

642
01:01:32,363 --> 01:01:34,331
Want to play chicken
with me, boy?

643
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:38,658
Come on.

644
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:42,030
Don't turn that wheel.

645
01:01:42,106 --> 01:01:43,698
Rock and roll!

646
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:55,876
Damn it!

647
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:01,322
Motherfucker.

648
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:11,731
- They're still on us.
- These guys don't give up.

649
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:18,739
We gotta make it to the mission.

650
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:49,061
What the hell is this?

651
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:54,335
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

652
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,954
You gotta make a decision.

653
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:08,387
We're going for it.

654
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:38,578
How the hell did you know
you were gonna get through there?

655
01:03:38,656 --> 01:03:40,089
I didn't.

656
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:44,653
Let's get the fuck out of here.

657
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:14,983
- How much farther is it to the mission?
- About ten miles.

658
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,153
We don't have enough gas
to make it there.

659
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:22,493
Looks deserted, man.

660
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,738
- It's all locked up.
- Shit.

661
01:04:34,445 --> 01:04:36,310
We gotta get her inside.

662
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,611
The pills are working on her,
but she can barely walk.

663
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:42,846
Once she gets some sleep,
she'll be okay.

664
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:46,622
Nothing?

665
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,923
Damn it!

666
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,565
Buster.

667
01:04:59,637 --> 01:05:02,367
Get your butts outta here!

668
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,567
Believe me, ma'am,
we would love to.

669
01:05:04,642 --> 01:05:07,076
But we're almost out of gas.

670
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:09,840
We're not looking for a handout,
all right? We'll buy it.

671
01:05:09,914 --> 01:05:13,145
- Ain't got any to sell.
- Could we use your phone?

672
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:15,151
Ain't got one.

673
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,584
Jesus!

674
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,691
Listen to me.
We are in a lot of trouble.

675
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,422
This girl here is really sick.

676
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:26,929
Please.

677
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:35,904
You better get her on in here.

678
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:40,834
- Why would they go this way?
- Just drive.

679
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:43,903
What the fuck are we doing, anyway?
Let'em go. We got bigger problems.

680
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,882
Who's gonna day drive for us?

681
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:28,916
You're gonna turn.

682
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:32,929
You gotta take drugs
to slow the virus.

683
01:06:51,248 --> 01:06:54,183
Do you want something
to eat, my man?

684
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:58,920
- What's wrong?
- I don't feel so good.

685
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,649
I feel like I did before.

686
01:07:02,726 --> 01:07:08,028
- I need some more of those drugs.
- The cocktail doesn't always work.

687
01:07:12,736 --> 01:07:14,670
She's resting now.

688
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,809
Seems to be okay.

689
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,475
Doesn't say much, does she?

690
01:07:25,549 --> 01:07:27,540
There's gotta be someplace
we can get her some help.

691
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:31,714
Fort Stockton's the closest,
and it's over a hundred miles.

692
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,382
Fuck.

693
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:38,656
What's wrong with that little gal
that you're traveling with?

694
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:41,789
- We don't know.
- She was hitchhiking.

695
01:07:41,865 --> 01:07:43,389
She was like that
when we picked her up.

696
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,662
She didn't say who she was?

697
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:48,330
She hasn't said a damned word
since we gave her a ride.

698
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:50,896
I think maybe...

699
01:07:52,776 --> 01:07:56,212
you should take a look at this.

700
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:53,236
You've lost the connection,
haven't you?

701
01:08:57,808 --> 01:09:01,107
I don't know why
we keep chasing that little bitch.

702
01:09:02,713 --> 01:09:04,738
It's unfinished business.

703
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,248
Kill her.

704
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:26,393
He left her to kill me.
I don't know why she didn't.

705
01:09:30,174 --> 01:09:35,111
When she pointed the gun at me,
I couldn't breathe.

706
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:39,476
I couldn't even move.

707
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:42,710
But I think she was scared...

708
01:09:42,786 --> 01:09:46,449
because she just stood there.

709
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:50,721
She had the strangest look
in her eyes.

710
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:55,527
After that,
I don't remember much at all.

711
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:02,533
What's with the dog?

712
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:07,070
Just stay put.
Probably just a coyote.

713
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:16,818
Buster.

714
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:32,927
What was it?

715
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,001
I don't know.
Buster ran off.

716
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:45,308
Everybody down!
Get under the table!

717
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:47,543
Hurry up!
Go, go! Get down!

718
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:38,659
Where's your shotgun?

719
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:43,104
It's by the side door. There's
extra shells in the refrigerator.

720
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:35,758
- What's with those tombstones?
- It's an old Spanish graveyard.

721
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:37,953
That's why the highway
wasn't put through here.

722
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:39,962
They couldn't dig it up.

723
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,828
Your house is actually built
on a graveyard?

724
01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:47,300
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

725
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,805
This place is blessed, baby.

726
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:53,235
Sean, watch out!

727
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:01,414
- Come on!
- Stop!

728
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:22,433
Let's go upstairs.

729
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:48,231
Let's get this over with.

730
01:14:37,914 --> 01:14:40,747
Come to Daddy, boys!

731
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,216
Are you in there, piggies?

732
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:23,386
Yum, yum, yum.
Eat'em up.

733
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:18,142
Now that's a bitch!

734
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:33,796
I got the motherfucker!

735
01:16:35,432 --> 01:16:37,730
Make sure and take his head off.

736
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:52,843
Nick, I don't see...

737
01:17:06,596 --> 01:17:10,259
Make your stand, punk.
Let's see what you got.

738
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:52,472
Not much left, huh?

739
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:55,602
Kill me.

740
01:18:03,253 --> 01:18:06,882
Kill you?
Who said anything about killing?

741
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:09,289
You're gonna be my new day driver.

742
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,227
At least until you turn, and then
I don't give a shit what you do.

743
01:18:15,432 --> 01:18:18,731
Get the car
and bring it around.

744
01:18:31,615 --> 01:18:34,846
And if you fuck with me,
I'll kill your little blonde friend...

745
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,512
in the blink of an eye.

746
01:18:47,364 --> 01:18:50,959
It's just the beast under your bed

747
01:18:51,034 --> 01:18:54,162
In your closet, in your head

748
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:57,102
Exit light

749
01:18:57,173 --> 01:19:00,233
Enter night

750
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:05,276
You're off to never-never land.

751
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:17,549
Got an opening for a new girlfriend.
What do you say?

752
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:21,586
- Fuck you!
- Ooh, attitude.

753
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:26,125
I like that in a girl.
Now move away from the old witch.

754
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:33,541
Look, darling, I'm gonna waste her
sure as the sun shines.

755
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:35,874
You could stay with her and die...

756
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:40,245
or you can come with me
and I'll let you live.

757
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:58,594
It's time to make your stand, punk.

758
01:19:59,736 --> 01:20:01,727
Let's see what you've got.

759
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:38,005
No! Come on!

760
01:20:38,074 --> 01:20:40,668
Out of gas, are we?

761
01:20:49,252 --> 01:20:54,952
Didn't I fucking tell you
to do something?

762
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:15,338
You know what?

763
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,904
Why don't you drive
your own fucking car!

764
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:53,802
- How do you feel?
- Good. You?

765
01:22:53,877 --> 01:22:56,107
Going home today.

766
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:59,615
Actually, not home.
My aunt and uncle's place in Phoenix.

767
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:04,846
Well, they said I could probably
go home tomorrow.

768
01:23:04,921 --> 01:23:07,151
Might still make
my sister's wedding.

769
01:23:07,223 --> 01:23:10,021
I saw Ina this morning.

770
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,194
She's okay, but
she doesn't remember what happened.

771
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,925
Yeah. Nobody suspects a thing.

772
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:20,128
Just a couple of bad guys
burned up in a fire.

773
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:24,037
- Probably better that way, huh?
- Yeah.

774
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:28,203
- No one would believe it.
- Yeah, probably not.

775
01:23:31,848 --> 01:23:34,783
Well, I gotta go.

776
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:39,018
I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

777
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,020
Yeah.

778
01:24:12,488 --> 01:24:14,854
What's up?
Where's the guy that was here?

779
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:17,552
He checked out, I guess.

780
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,322
He left this for you.

781
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,668
By the time you read this,
I'll be on the road again.

782
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:34,107
Yours and Megan's fight is over, :
mine ain't.

783
01:24:34,177 --> 01:24:36,145
It turns out
he wasn't the one I was looking for.

784
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:38,407
Mine's still out there somewhere.

785
01:24:41,918 --> 01:24:45,479
But the way I figure it,
if I can find one, I can find another.

786
01:24:45,555 --> 01:24:49,184
They might be bad motherfuckers,
but we're not talking brain surgeons.

787
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:52,386
So, anyways, thanks.
It was cool hanging with you.

788
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,022
Maybe I'll see you again sometime.

789
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:29,862
- Nice ride, man.
- Had you going for a minute, didn't I?

790
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:32,992
- I took it from an old friend.
- Yeah, right.

791
01:25:45,048 --> 01:25:47,380
How in the hell did you find me?

792
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,883
Well...

793
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:53,654
I drove just about
every damned road...

794
01:25:53,723 --> 01:25:56,988
from Nevada to Kansas,
from Mexico to Montana...

795
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,221
for about three months.

796
01:25:59,295 --> 01:26:02,093
Then I wised up
and started doing what you do.

797
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:04,895
I checked the news,
read the papers.

798
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:08,334
You're right.
They do hide the killings.

799
01:26:08,404 --> 01:26:11,134
But if you look hard enough,
you can find them.

800
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,401
Thanks.

801
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:17,576
He's been a bad boy, Nick.

802
01:26:17,647 --> 01:26:20,946
And busy.
Busier than the last one.

803
01:26:22,151 --> 01:26:24,085
The way I figure it,
he's going to Denver.

804
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,178
This guy moves fast,
so he's not gonna stay there long.

805
01:26:26,255 --> 01:26:29,349
You don't have to do this.
You know that.

806
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:31,120
Yeah, I do.

807
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:46,631
So tell me, was that woman
really pissed about her Mercedes?

808
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:48,142
Oh, yeah.
