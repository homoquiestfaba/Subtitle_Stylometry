2
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Come on, Ben!

4
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Vincent!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,900
Hurry up!

6
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,800
Vincent, what are you doing?

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,700
Vincent!

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay, Ben.

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,700
You won!

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Vincent?

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Admit it.
You're looking forward to this.

12
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,100
I got the weekend crowd.
They're not even going to notice.

13
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,200
Give me a break, Ben.

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
You're the one that wants to go.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Vincent!

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Vincent!

17
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,500
Ben! You little jerk!

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,900
Did you get in
and the lid shut on you?

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
-We go now?
-Yeah, right. We go now.

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,600
You'll probably play pool with Joey
after you close the restaurant.

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,600
If you're dumb enough to take three
kids to your class reunion...

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm smart enough
to have a good time.

23
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,000
-Hey, party!
-Party hearty!

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Ben!

25
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
-I'm underwater!
-That's great news.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Where's your brother?

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't know.

28
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Will you go find Vincent, please?

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,900
Did you remember the sandwiches?

30
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,700
Of course not.

31
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,300
Bethie, if your head wasn't
screwed on...

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,900
You'd find it sitting by the microwave.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Then I'd have to call you in Chicago.

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,800
Who needs a head
at a high-school reunion?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,300
I want to stay with Dad
and go to the restaurant.

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm not going to Chicago!

37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,300
You're going!

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,800
I hate Ben, I hate Kerry...

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,300
and I hate....

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,600
Let me finish out the roll.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,700
Pat, now?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,900
Just two shots!

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,000
By the lilacs.
It'll take just a second.

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,500
All right, look at Daddy.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,400
I know, the photographer hates
having her picture taken.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,100
Everybody say...

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
meatball!

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Benbo...

49
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,400
bologna is for eating...

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
not washing windows.

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Your seat belt's loose.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Mom, sing me...

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,300
that bunny song.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,200
I wish I was still home with Dad.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,100
Sing me,
lf a bunny catch a bunny

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,600
If a bunny catch a bunny

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,500
-Coming through the rye
-I hate this song!

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,700
If a bunny...

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,300
kiss a bunny

60
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
And made a bunny cry

61
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,600
You're here.

62
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm here!

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,700
Just a second, let me get Kerry.

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,200
No, no. Let me get her.

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,400
Look at her!

66
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,900
Watch your head, Benbo.

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm your godmama, Kerry.

68
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
Remember me?

69
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,400
God love her! Look at her.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,500
My God!

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Is that Ben?

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Ben! You're a grown-up.

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,300
Vincent, can you swim?

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
Martha's inside, waiting for you.

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,900
Come on, sweetie.

76
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,200
I have a surprise!

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,300
Where's your tooth?

78
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,100
I lost it.

79
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Speak of the devil!

80
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Beth, you remember Martha,
the babysitter from God.

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Great! Can you help with Kerry?

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,700
Sure thing, Mrs. Cappadora.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Mrs. Cappadora.

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
Good Christ!

85
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Is there some kind of
registration table?

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,900
You're set.
I stuck it on my card.

87
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
Ellen, you can't do that!

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
It's 70 bucks. Who cares?

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,000
Donna Trump, I care.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Besides, I can write it off.

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,700
I've got a fashion shoot on Sunday.

92
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Boutique on Oak Street.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,400
You'll have to go up in
that mess and rearrange it, then.

94
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh, Jesus!

95
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Is that Michelle Pulliam?

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Did she ever marry that guy?

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
They broke up.
Then she went out with...

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
-Elizabeth Kerry and her merry band!
-Jimmy!

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
How're my big guys?

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,100
Wow! Vincent!

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
You have gotten so huge!

102
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,000
They'd hug any man with a badge,
and so would I.

103
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,800
What would you do if you
found out I made detective?

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
Congratulations!

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Guess who I just saw?

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Cecil Lockhart.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You mean Cecilia Lockhart?

108
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Star of stage, screen
and mouthwash commercials.

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
My God! There she is.

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,900
Remember when she first got laid?

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
When she was 15, and she told us:

112
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,000
"I can't imagine
going a month without it".

113
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
She was talking about pizza, guys.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey, Beth!

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
My God! How are you?

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,400
-Look at you! How are you?
-Good, good.

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Is this your new one?

118
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,500
Where's little Vincent?

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not little.

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
No, you're not.

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
-Sandy! Bye...
-Mom, I want to go.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,300
I want pizza!

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,700
You stay with your brother.

124
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Martha, would you take care of the car?

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,700
-I'll handle it.
-I'll pay the thing.

126
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Vincent?

127
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,300
Listen. I want you to hold
Ben's hand real tight.

128
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,900
And you guys can play
on this really cool cart, okay?

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
Mom, my neck's hot.

130
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,500
My neck's killing me.

131
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Vincent, listen.

132
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
This'll only take a second.

133
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,000
Stay here with Ben while I
pay the lady.

134
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,400
When Martha comes,
she'll take you swimming, okay?

135
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,800
Thanks.

136
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,800
-Sorry it took so long.
-That's okay.

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Where's Ben?

138
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,400
He wouldn't let me hold him.
Would you look at my neck?

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,800
I've got a heat rash or something.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,500
Hold on, sweetie.

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,300
Ben?

142
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,600
Ellen?

143
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,200
Ben took off. Would you...?

144
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,300
I'll find him.
See you later.

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,800
You stay here. Don't move.

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,500
Ben?

147
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,600
Have you seen a little boy?

148
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,400
He's got a red baseball cap,
3 years old.

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,400
No, sorry.

150
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Thanks.

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,700
Ben?

152
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Excuse me.

153
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,300
Vincent...

154
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,700
think hard.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Which way did Ben go?

156
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
I don't know.

157
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,300
Didn't you watch?

158
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,900
I couldn't see him.

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
He wasn't over there.

160
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
We should get the manager.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,500
I don't know.

162
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,500
Maybe if we just wait....

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop!

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Everybody please just
listen up for a second.

165
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,200
We need to look for
Beth Kerry's little boy.

166
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,900
His name is Ben.

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,300
He's 3, he was wearing
a red baseball cap.

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,100
He was just here a second ago.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,500
So if you'd look around
where you are.

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Wait. Hold on, folks.

171
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,700
We'll find him.
It's going to be fine.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,900
I'm going to divide the room
down the middle.

173
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,000
I want you to stay
in your half and look around you.

174
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,300
If you see Ben...

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
pick him up and call out
to me, all right?

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Pat will be here soon, right?

177
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,400
I didn't call him.

178
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,100
I thought we'd find Ben right away.

179
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Let's make that call now, right?

180
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,700
Here you go.

181
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,800
Go ahead, Beth.

182
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
-Hello?
-Patty!

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Magill, talk to the female.

184
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,500
Coleman, come with me.

185
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,400
Mrs. Cappadora?

186
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm Officer Magill.

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,700
You brought a lot of officers.

188
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
We take the disappearance of a
child very seriously.

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
You're worried, then?

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,900
We'll find him.

191
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,400
Lost kids,
we always find them.

192
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,400
And they're okay.

193
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
-They're not hurt.
-Good.

194
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,500
If it gets to five hours,
we usually consider it....

195
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,200
Anyway, we'll find him before then.

196
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,700
So your friend Elaine was with you?

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Ellen.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
She met me out front.
She was waiting for me.

199
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,700
Besides Ellen, who was
the first person you talked to?

200
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,500
The cheerleaders.

201
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Would another family member...

202
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,000
on your side have any reason
to pick up the boy?

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
My folks are dead.

204
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,600
There's nobody.

205
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,800
Has he ever been fingerprinted?

206
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,300
No.

207
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Yes!

208
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,400
The school district had a program.

209
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
It's been four hours.

210
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
We've got everybody on it, okay?

211
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,100
This is my boss,
Detective Supervisor Bliss.

212
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,800
-Bliss?
-Candy Bliss.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,300
It sounds like a stripper's name.

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
The things parents do to kids!

215
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
I can't believe I said that.

216
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,200
We'll do everything we can
to find your boy.

217
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,300
Description out?

218
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
They're checking the database now.

219
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,100
Great.

220
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,500
First, I want to tell you this is
nobody's fault.

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Kids disappear all the time,
and somebody always finds them.

222
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
That's right.

223
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
We're set up over here.

224
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Where is he?

225
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,000
My son! Where is he?

226
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,600
We haven't found him yet...

227
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Where's Ben?

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Where's Bethie?

229
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Bethie?

230
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Pat!

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
How did this happen?

232
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Okay, all right, okay.

233
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,500
It'll be okay.

234
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,400
Where is it nobody's searched?

235
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
The basement?

236
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,700
It's just food storage.
All the doors are kept locked.

237
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
But you have freezers, cabinets?

238
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,800
Ben loves hiding places.
Take me down there.

239
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,200
You okay?

240
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,500
You sure?

241
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,300
I'm going downstairs a minute.
You stay here with Mommy, okay?

242
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,200
Let's go.

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Mom!

244
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Patty!

245
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
Are you all right?

246
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,600
My God in heaven!
How long has he been missing?

247
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,700
About five hours.

248
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,900
They'll remember.
They'll make one more call.

249
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,700
I'll take you to the command center.

250
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
Kerry and Vincent will come...

251
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
to the house. It's better, right?

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,200
-Where's Kerry?
-Upstairs.

253
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,500
You'll come with Grandma, honey.

254
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
You go with Grandma, Vincent, okay?

255
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,700
Will you tell me when
Ben gets back, Mom?

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
She'll tell us.

257
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,800
Sit down, sweetheart.

258
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,100
Do you have any other pictures of Ben?

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
I lost my purse.

261
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
No, no, no.
I have it, honey.

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Ben!

263
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,900
Bethie, honey, it's okay.

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
Set her down!

265
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
I want Ben!

266
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
Grab her wrist and hold her down.
Medic!

267
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
It's okay. It's all right.

268
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Give her something!

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
Quick!

270
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,700
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

271
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
I know, Bethie. I know.

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
You don't know.

273
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,600
I don't even know.

274
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,700
How long are you
staying with your parents?

275
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
Do the police have leads?

276
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Have the kidnappers
tried to contact you?

277
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
How long were you gone before you
noticed your son was missing?

278
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,000
-Who'd want to do this?
-How long will you be in Chicago?

279
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
He's 3 years old...

280
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
but he's big for his age.

281
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,100
And people always think he's older.

282
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,700
He's very verbal.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
He babbles to himself.

284
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,100
Sometimes you can barely hear him...

285
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,400
but he says his words very clearly.

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,500
He has blond hair and blue eyes.

287
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
And he was wearing...

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
a red baseball cap.

289
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,200
And he loves pizza.

290
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
He's very afraid of the water.

291
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
He loves...

292
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
to sing songs.

293
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,800
Sometimes he'll sing the same song
over and over again.

294
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
He was wearing...

295
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,000
red shoes.

296
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,500
High-top sneakers with
green parrots on the side.

297
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,000
And white socks.

298
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,400
And a red T-shirt...

299
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,500
 with yellow sleeves...

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
and little blue shorts.
Blue plaid shorts.

301
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,100
Call you when we get home.

302
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,900
Unbelievable, right?

303
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,400
Diane Lundgren's on her way over...

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
and Cecil Lockhart signed up.

305
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,800
But her mother got sick.

306
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,900
You know who else called?

307
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
Lizzy De Nunzio.

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,900
-Where is she now, Switzerland?
-I think she moved there.

309
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,600
-How'd she even find out about it?
-Who knows?

310
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,100
But she just sounds sick about it.

311
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
-Everyone is, Bethie.
-I know.

312
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,100
I know.

313
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
Laurie!

314
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I can't believe you're here.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,300
What was I supposed to do?
Stay in Madison? Watch CNN?

316
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,300
Hey, Tommy.

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Have you seen Candy?

318
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,300
-She's with McGuire.
-Thanks, Ricky.

319
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Then go to Minneapolis.
How far can it be?

320
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,100
We've been getting
bogus leads...

321
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,600
every day for six weeks now.
This kid is dead and you know it.

322
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,300
Don't tell me I know it!
I don't know it.

323
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
This is interstate.
I have to call the FBI.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,100
Come on, Candy, the FBI?

325
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
Give me a break.

326
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,600
Hey, Bethie.

327
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,500
So you heard that?

328
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,300
I heard something about the FBI.

329
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
Come into my office.

330
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,700
Have a seat.

331
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Listen, Beth.

332
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
Just because volunteers
are going home...

333
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,300
doesn't mean the case is closed.

334
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,200
Some of them got lives.

335
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
I don't.

336
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,000
So I'm here.

337
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
And I'm not giving up.

338
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm sorry, I didn't...

339
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm a jerk.

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,900
There's nothing wrong
with what you just did.

341
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm just an oversensitive jerk.

342
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
You're too involved. You can't...

343
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm black.

344
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm a woman.
I'm a detective supervisor.

345
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,800
And I'm gay.
Did you know that?

346
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
I always feel like the eyes
of Texas are on me.

347
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,100
Every time I hug Katie
from Crime Stoppers...

348
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
I think she thinks
I'm coming on to her.

349
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,300
I wasn't...

350
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
No, I know that.

351
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,100
I just wanted you to know
I'm a little jerkish today.

352
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,500
So that calls for a Gummi Bear.

353
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,600
Tough guys chew Gummi Bears.

354
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,900
Beth, you laughed.

355
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
You only laughed.

356
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,000
It doesn't mean our side loses points.

357
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,700
It doesn't mean you'll
kill your son because you laughed.

358
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,700
You have got to survive.

359
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,200
That's just it.

360
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
I don't want to survive Ben.

361
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,500
I don't want to face it.

362
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,300
Then I guess you can just...

363
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,300
move into a corner in my office,
and I'll use you as a coat rack.

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,900
You got to do whatever you got to do.

365
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,300
But you got two great kids, which I
would give my right arm for.

366
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,900
Though you think
you're a terrible mother...

367
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,500
you're the only mother they have.

368
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,600
I should go home.

369
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Jill's been great with Kerry.

370
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Really great.

371
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,800
But I think Vincent's
going to need a little time.

372
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,500
He'll be fine.
He's been back, what, six weeks?

373
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm sure he'll be fine.

374
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Coming?

375
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Jill, we're back!

376
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,600
Baby, you scared me.

377
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
How's my big guy?

378
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,500
Are you good?

379
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Mom, guess what?

380
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,600
On Thursday, I made
six baskets in a row!

381
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,600
Look how long your legs are.

382
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,800
How is she?
Has she been in bed all day?

383
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Pretty much.

384
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,400
How'd Vincent get home?
Did you pick him up?

385
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah, I didn't have class today.

386
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Okay, thanks.

387
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,000
Did she say
she was coming down?

388
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,100
No, she didn't.

389
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,200
So some girl walks in, chewing gum...

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,900
and talking through her nose...

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
has legs up to her neck.

392
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
Paolo just says,
"Great, you're hired!"

393
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
The new kids we got...

394
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,000
don't know spaghetti from scampi.

395
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,200
They think the cash register
is their personal savings account.

396
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
I'll tell you what...

397
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,500
when I open my own place...

398
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
this is exactly what you won't see.

399
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,600
Guess what happened.

400
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I thought today was Sunday.

401
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,100
Isn't that funny?

402
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,900
Can we just please go?

403
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm going to work, honey.

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
Beth, you downstairs?

405
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,700
Honey, what are you doing?

406
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,400
Ever been in a doctor's office
without a People magazine?

407
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,000
One day, Ben will go to a doctor's
office with whoever took him.

408
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,600
-And some other patient...
-Laurie, stop! Okay?

409
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,700
I know you mean well, but just...

410
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,100
stop.

411
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,800
-That's real leather?
-You bet!

412
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
-Thanks, Uncle Joey.
-You're welcome.

413
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,000
Check this out, buddy.

414
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,900
Could be more presents.

415
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,400
Merry Christmas!

416
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,300
Joey, it's cold.
Shut the door.

417
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,500
-Where's the tree?
-Pat went to get it.

418
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,200
Where's my presents?

419
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Merry Christmas, Beth!

420
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Mom, look, Uncle Joey gave me
my stocking present early...

421
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,300
because it's too big
to fit in the stocking.

422
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,700
-See?
-Yeah, that's great!

423
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,400
Merry Christmas, Beth.

424
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,900
-Merry Christmas, Theresa.
-How you feeling, honey?

425
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,100
I almost didn't make it.
I started having Braxton-Hicks.

426
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,300
-You should breathe in a bag.
-I'll try that.

427
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
-May be a Christmas baby.
-I hope not.

428
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,100
She's carrying like it's a boy.
That's what everybody says.

429
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
The gang's all here!

430
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
-My God, sis, look how big you are!
-Don't rub it in.

431
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,400
Patty, it's beautiful!

432
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,900
-Who do you think these are for?
-Me?

433
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,100
One is from me,
and one's from Grandpa Angelo.

434
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,700
-Help me wrap.
-Look at the cards.

435
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,500
Did you buy out
the whole store?

436
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,100
Who's counting?
It's Christmas.

437
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
Now, these are very special.

438
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,900
Look, Mom, they're for Ben
from Grandma and Grandpa.

439
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,300
Rosie, what are these?

440
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
Presents for Ben.

441
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,700
Why did you bring presents for Ben?

442
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,300
I believe that Ben will be found.

443
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,400
When he is found, I want him to
know his family didn't forget him.

444
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Do you have the impression
we've forgotten Ben?

445
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,400
Of course not.

446
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
-We didn't get Ben any gifts.
-I understand that.

447
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,300
I didn't even want to go through...

448
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,800
this whole, big holiday act.

449
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,600
You know what I wanted to do?
I wanted to sleep through it.

450
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
When you do this, like he's just...

451
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,700
out of town on some business trip
and he'll be back anytime...

452
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
-Beth, take it easy.
-Take it easy!

453
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,300
How can I take it easy
when nobody except me...

454
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
seems to want to accept
the fact that it's over?

455
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,900
It's over!

456
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,800
We're all going to go on
eating and sleeping...

457
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,900
You have to snap out of this.
No one can talk to you.

458
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,000
I can't.

459
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
-Pat can't.
-Butt out!

460
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,200
If you don't have hope
Ben will come back...

461
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,800
Come back?
He's not even 4 yet.

462
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,700
What's he going to do?
Get an Amtrak schedule?

463
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,800
We didn't mean anything by it.

464
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,900
-Don't you think we're all grieving?
-I mean it!

465
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,300
-Shut up!
-No, Pat!

466
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,800
You're all scared to say this,
but I'm not.

467
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,500
We try and call.
She doesn't want to talk.

468
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
We write. She doesn't answer.

469
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,200
Mom, Ben will be back tomorrow.

470
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,600
What?

471
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
Because it's Christmas.
For my present...

472
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,000
I asked Santa to bring Ben home.

473
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,400
I think he'll do it.

474
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,300
-Where is she?
-She's upstairs.

475
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,300
She still won't speak to me, will she?

476
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,100
I think she will.

477
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,000
Everybody's been calling.

478
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,400
After your talk with People,
we reprinted the poster five times.

479
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,200
I think she hates my guts.

480
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
What are you doing?

481
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Ending world hunger.

482
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I just got off the phone with the U.N.

483
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,000
That's good.

484
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,500
Look, will you just forgive me...

485
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,300
and get this over with?

486
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,300
I'd never give them anything unless
it was the right thing to do.

487
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,700
I would never do a thing to hurt you.

488
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
How long have we been friends?

489
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,100
One thousand years.

490
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,200
-I know.
-Then good, okay?

491
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,000
I have something I want you to do.

492
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,800
I don't believe you.

493
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,200
-I want you to take a picture.
-I don't do that anymore.

494
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,500
I took early retirement.

495
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
You could use the money.

496
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,100
This is good money.

497
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,500
Good for what?

498
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
I want her to take a portrait
of a Chinese family.

499
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,000
We are kind of tapped out,
just keeping Vincent in sneakers.

500
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,000
You could do this.

501
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,600
You wouldn't even have to go out.

502
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,300
I threw away all my paper and stuff.

503
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,000
I'll go get you more paper and stuff.

504
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Please.

505
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,800
Please, just this once.

506
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,400
Let me get rid of my guilt
by doing you this one good turn.

507
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,900
This is not a good turn.
This is a setup.

508
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,200
These are really beautiful.

509
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,600
I have to print.
I have four phone calls to make.

510
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,400
I have to get Vincent
ready for Little League.

511
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Thought any more about Chicago?

512
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,200
What about it?

513
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,600
Could be great.

514
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,400
Kids'll love it there.

515
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,400
-I'll have my own restaurant.
-I have to get Kerry up.

516
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,400
-There's plenty of time for that.
-Okay, fine.

517
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,900
You go upstairs, get my diaphragm,
fill it up with gunk and...

518
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,200
we'll have eight minutes
before I have to feed Vincent.

519
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,700
We can have a lot
of fun in eight minutes.

520
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,700
Fine. You want to do it right here?

521
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
I can make toast at the same time.

522
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,600
It's not like I'm on top of you
all the time.

523
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,300
We make love as often
as we pay the water bill.

524
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,300
I don't see why you need
a diaphragm every time.

525
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,900
I don't want to
get pregnant every time.

526
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,900
We had three kids and we always
wanted more. I miss that.

527
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
I miss this house being full of noise.

528
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,200
I used to want to
run up the walk to lunch.

529
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,700
It's not going to change anything.

530
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,600
Another kid.
It'd be like a replacement part.

531
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,900
Like you get a new gravy boat
so you don't spoil the set.

532
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,200
That's a lousy fucking thing to say.

533
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,200
I agree. So I'll stop saying
fucking lousy things.

534
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,300
I'm not having a baby,
and I'm not moving to Chicago...

535
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,200
so you can start
a restaurant with your dad.

536
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
You want a new baby and restaurant?
You need a new wife.

537
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,100
All I want is for us
to be a family again.

538
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,000
Nothing's wrong with that.

539
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,100
That's healthy!

540
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,300
You want to know what it's like?

541
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,800
It's like I'm standing
under this giant...

542
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
snowbank.

543
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
If I move one inch
in any direction...

544
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
it's going to come crashing down...

545
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,400
and bury me.

546
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,500
Do you know...

547
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,400
I don't dare think of him
for a full minute?

548
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,100
One inch...

549
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
and the whole thing's
going to come down.

550
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You will have to raise
these kids by yourself.

551
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm doing that now.

552
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,600
That's right.

553
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,600
Pat's always been the rock.

554
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,800
Isn't that what it said
in People?

555
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,800
There was Pat holding together
that poor, crazy woman...

556
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,700
and those sweet little kids.
You're such a hero.

557
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,100
All right, stop this.

558
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,600
You would never have let
Ben get lost.

559
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,700
I mean it. Stop it.

560
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,500
You wouldn't have been such a
shitty parent...

561
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
who can't remember the sandwiches...

562
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,200
who can't get
Kerry's bottle together!

563
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
That's right, I wouldn't!

564
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,800
If you'd just pay attention
to somebody besides yourself!

565
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,200
None of this would have
happened, right?

566
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,100
Scream!

567
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,600
Come on, Kerry.
Scream!

568
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,300
I was there to pick up after you!

569
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

570
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm not self-righteous! I'm right!

571
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,400
Kids don't just vanish up in smoke.

572
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
Kids don't just get lost.

573
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,000
People lose them!

574
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,200
Vincent, what happened?

575
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,000
What happened, honey?

576
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
Why was she screaming?

577
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Is she all right?

578
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,400
Yeah, she's fine.

579
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Where are we going?

580
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Just thought I'd take a drive.

581
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,900
She just misses him, Daddy.

582
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,400
That's right, Vincent.

583
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,600
That's right.

584
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
This is the bar and the waiting area.

585
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,200
That's the wine rack.
Dad's personal design.

586
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
People sit here while they
wait for tables.

587
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,100
That's the kitchen back there...

588
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,600
and this is it.

589
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,300
The murals are done.

590
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,100
Tables will be through here...

591
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,500
and they'll carry back
over to there.

592
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,600
This is the dance floor.

593
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,800
There'll be a live band over here...

594
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,400
Thursday through Sunday.

595
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,400
Theresa, is that a town in Italy?

596
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,400
You like it, honey?

597
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,800
It's La Boheme.

598
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,300
You're Mimi and I'm Rodolfo.

599
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,500
-Except she lives in the end.
-Well, good.

600
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,600
-It's gorgeous. It really is.
-Can you believe this place?

601
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,300
I don't.

602
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,800
I can't wait.

603
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,100
That's a good one.
We got to get in that.

604
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,300
Alex, come on, listen.

605
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,300
So what's Mr. Tough Guy up to?

606
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
Apart from needing a haircut.

607
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't know.

608
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,300
He's making friends, I guess.

609
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
He's been on the phone a lot lately.

610
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,300
If you're using that phone
for your bookie operation...

611
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,100
it'll be a part of your anatomy.
-I'm not, Dad. Jesus!

612
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
I got to go.

613
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,900
Well, this is really nice.

614
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,500
It is, isn't it?

615
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,200
New house, new restaurant.

616
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,500
You're doing a really good
imitation of having a life.

617
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,600
You have the biggest snarl right here.

618
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,200
No, wait, Kerry. Just one more.

619
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,800
Are you in sixth?

620
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeah. You're in third.

621
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,700
You were the soybean, right?

622
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,900
Actually, I was the feed corn.

623
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,100
Who do you have?

624
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,200
-Cook.
-Yeah, I had Cook.

625
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,000
She's pretty decent.

626
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Mommy?

627
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Are you okay?

628
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

629
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,900
I was leaving my number in case
you needed your lawn mowed.

630
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,200
But I'll come back later.

631
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,200
I really do need my lawn mowed.

632
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,800
Could you do it today?

633
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,800
Yeah. Sure.

634
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,700
I'll get my stuff.
I live two blocks down there.

635
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,600
You don't need a mower!
We have a mower.

636
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,500
My brother's supposed to do it.

637
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,000
He's in high school. He's lazy!

638
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,700
Do you know that boy?

639
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,700
It's not talking to strangers
if you're in your own house.

640
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,100
I know.

641
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,600
That's true.
Do you know his name?

642
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,600
It's Jason. He's on patrol.

643
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,400
No, wait, I'm wrong.

644
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,300
Jason wears the beanie hat.
He got reported.

645
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,300
You don't know his name?

646
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,700
It's Sam Kero.

647
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,600
Kero something.

648
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,100
Mom, where are you going?

649
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,700
Are you going to work?

650
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,100
You know what?

651
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
I have to take some leaf pictures.

652
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,300
It's okay if you go across
the street and play with Blythe.

653
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,200
I'm taking pictures of leaves.

654
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,700
That's my job. I take pictures.

655
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Shit!

656
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,300
Lord God, Lamb of God,
Son of the Father who takes away sin.

657
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,900
Have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us.

658
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,600
I want you to go downstairs
and order a pizza.

659
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,300
Do that, then go to Blythe's...

660
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,500
get Kerry and put on
a video for her.

661
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,100
Get the money from my purse.

662
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,100
I have to work in the darkroom.

663
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,300
It's very important and it can't wait.

664
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,300
I want you to give Kerry pizza.
Will you do that?

665
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,800
Don't I always? Jesus!

666
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,000
It is, isn't it?

667
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Is this possible?

668
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:51,800
Here's the aging projection they did
around the time he was 8.

669
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,300
Who is he?

670
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,400
He came to the door to mow lawns.
I let him mow the lawn.

671
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,500
He's coming back tomorrow.
He ran out of gas.

672
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,100
Where does he live?

673
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
Two blocks.

674
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,800
Two blocks from here?

675
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,200
Did he just move here?

676
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,100
I don't know how long...

677
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,300
Kerry knows him from school,
and she's been at Sandburg...

678
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,700
for what, two years?
Good Christ!

679
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,100
He's probably just some kid
who looks like Ben.

680
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,900
-His hair is darker.
-No, you're right.

681
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,700
Let's call Candy.
Then we're going to that house.

682
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,300
It's late at night.
He's sleeping.

683
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,100
We don't even know his last name.

684
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,300
Two blocks from here. I mean...

685
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,100
-When he saw you, did he...
-Nothing.

686
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,700
He had no idea. But he was 3,
and he doesn't know this house.

687
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
I'm going to call Pop.

688
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,500
Don't tell him.
Not until we know.

689
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,100
No, I just....

690
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,500
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

691
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,200
What were you doing on the porch?

692
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,400
I was watching the sun come up.

693
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,600
-You got a ride?
-Kenny's dad is picking me up.

694
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Finish up.

695
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,800
-I'm riding my bike.
-No, you're not.

696
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,400
I'm 9 now. I'm older than
the other 18 kids in my class.

697
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,900
People who live in walking distance
don't ride bikes.

698
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,900
Besides, you don't have a bike lock.

699
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,900
Could you get me one?

700
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,100
Yes, I'll get you a
bike lock today. I promise.

701
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,200
You can ride your bike
to school tomorrow.

702
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,800
Come on, let's go.

703
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,200
Bye, Mom.

704
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,300
Vincent, wait.

705
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,500
I love you.

706
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,600
-I want you to know I love you.
-Thank you, Mom.

707
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,600
I know it sounds insane.

708
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,800
I don't know if it's him for sure.

709
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,600
I don't know what I know.

710
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
It can't be Ben...

711
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,700
but it's Ben.

712
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Isn't it?

713
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
I say we go in.

714
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,300
He's in protective custody.

715
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,500
We got an unmarked in front
of the suspect's house.

716
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,400
We snatched the kid from school.

717
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,600
The principal probably
called the father.

718
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,000
What are we waiting for?

719
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,700
There's a process involved here.

720
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,600
It's not like you're
bringing him home today.

721
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,600
He'll have to go to foster care.
He'll need counseling.

722
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
There'll be a period of transition.

723
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,500
Anyway, we want to make sure
we L.D. the boy 100%.

724
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,000
Look at the picture!

725
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,700
It's the same kid.
It's Sam Karras!

726
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,400
Don't go off half-cocked on me.
This is a big case.

727
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,100
It wouldn't hurt to get a warrant.

728
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,700
I got the warrant.

729
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,100
I talked to the D.A.

730
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,700
Bliss.

731
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
Thank you.

732
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,600
The fingerprints match.

733
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,000
You folks ready for this?

734
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,700
You don't get to be ready for this.

735
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,700
They're busting you for
hot-wiring Jamie's car.

736
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,400
I don't think so.
I'm going to call you later, okay?

737
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,300
Shit!

738
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,500
Come in here, will you please?

739
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,300
This is Chief Bastokovich.

740
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Kerry's got Girl Scouts, right?

741
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,600
I think...

742
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
She won't be home till after five?

743
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,900
Right.

744
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,200
You saw that picture this morning.

745
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,800
That's why the police are here.

746
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,500
I thought it was a fire drill.
Can I just go upstairs?

747
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,100
Listen to me.

748
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,300
We think the boy in
that picture is Ben.

749
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,000
The kid in that house on Maple, right?

750
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,700
You saw him?

751
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,100
You saw Ben?

752
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,100
I didn't know it was Ben.
I'd see this kid goofing around.

753
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,700
I mean, he looked..

754
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,700
I never really thought
about it much.

755
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,700
Why didn't you tell me?

756
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,200
Why didn't you tell me
or your father?

757
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,000
Tell you what?

758
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,300
I found my long-lost brother?

759
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,000
Would you have listened to me?

760
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,800
Would you have even heard me?

761
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,400
When did you first see him?

762
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,800
How long have we lived here?

763
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,300
It doesn't matter now.

764
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,100
I'll tell you when...

765
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,800
-I'll tell you.
-Fine. Do that.

766
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,400
Hi, Pop.

767
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,800
They're about to move on him.

768
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,100
Ready.

769
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,800
You stay here.

770
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,300
We'll call you in 15 minutes.

771
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm coming in.

772
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,400
I'm coming in.

773
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,200
You don't say anything.
Just listen.

774
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,300
George Karras?

775
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,900
-What's wrong?
-I'm Detective Candy Bliss.

776
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,500
Do you have a 12-year-old boy
named Sam living in this house?

777
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,900
Yes, I do.

778
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,900
My God, my son. Is he hurt?

779
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,400
No, he's fine.

780
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,100
He's in the custody
of Protective Services.

781
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,100
What are you talking about?
He's at school.

782
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,500
You're under arrest for kidnapping...

783
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,700
in connection with the abduction...

784
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
June 3rd, 1988, of Benjamin Cappadora.

785
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,700
You have the right to remain silent.

786
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,600
What you say can and will be
used against you....

787
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
You've got the wrong house.

788
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,400
The people that lost their boy
live around the corner.

789
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,700
Over on Drummond.

790
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,100
No, no.

791
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,300
My neighbour knows the family.
This is a big mistake.

792
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,400
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them?

793
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,500
Of course I do.

794
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,100
Can we come in?

795
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,400
Sure.

796
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,500
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

797
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,800
-Can you step over here?
-This is a mistake.

798
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,700
-You don't have any guns?
-No, I don't.

799
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,900
You won't mind if the officers
search here?

800
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,800
I didn't do anything. This is my house.
I was just doing the books.

801
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,600
I don't even know why
you people are here.

802
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,500
That's Cecil.

803
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,500
That's Cecil Lockhart.

804
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,100
You know her from television?

805
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,200
Why do you have a picture
of Cecil Lockhart?

806
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,700
She was my wife.

807
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,400
Cecil gave birth in 1985...

808
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,900
which is the same year Ben was born.

809
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,900
Apparently, the baby had
complications and died.

810
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,300
She had a nervous breakdown.
They had to put her away.

811
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,400
She got out three years after that,
just in time...

812
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,900
to make it to the reunion,
where she saw Ben and snatched him.

813
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,800
She disappeared into Minneapolis...

814
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,900
where she met George and married him.

815
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,800
He adopted Ben...

816
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,500
and then they moved here.

817
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,200
About five years ago,
she committed suicide.

818
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,500
I got to tell you, I feel...

819
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,700
totally responsible...

820
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,900
for a lot of what's happened.

821
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,300
We interviewed this woman.

822
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,900
I sat in this woman's house.
I had tea with her.

823
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
And somewhere in there was Ben...

824
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,100
and I missed him.

825
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,500
George Karras wasn't at all
suspicious, and he adopted Ben.

826
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,500
So she lied to her husband.

827
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,200
She lied to me.

828
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,500
I'm supposed to know when people
are lying because I'm a supercop.

829
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,900
I didn't find him.
You guys did.

830
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,400
No one found him.

831
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,200
He found us.

832
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,300
Are you heading to
the foster home now?

833
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,400
What will you say to him?

834
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,400
How's it feel to get your son back?

835
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,400
Did you contact him at all
in the last two weeks?

836
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,600
Will you call him Ben or Sam?

837
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,000
Do you have any statement to make?

838
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,700
How are you?

839
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,100
I'm good.

840
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,700
Dad?

841
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,400
-Yes?
-Yeah, Sam?

842
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
Stop fidgeting.

843
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,500
You're not hungry?

844
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm eating.

845
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,600
I'm not an industrial vacuum,
like some people.

846
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,100
Could I have some milk?

847
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,700
You do milk with pizza?

848
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
I like milk with pizza.

849
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,700
-Good night, Kerry.
-Good night, Mom.

850
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,300
Do you want the light on?

851
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,200
No, I don't sleep with a light.

852
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,900
Do you want an extra
blanket or anything?

853
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,400
I'm okay.

854
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,700
The Bulls are home tomorrow.
Do you want to go?

855
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,500
Good night.

856
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,600
I'll put an extra blanket there,
just in case.

857
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,500
If he needs one,
he'll ask for it.

858
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,100
He doesn't know how cold
this house gets.

859
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,200
Please relax, honey. Okay?

860
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,500
-Relax. He's home.
-Oh, God.

861
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,100
I just want to go in and look at him.

862
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,100
Here, just wear these.

863
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,500
I hate those.

864
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,800
You loved those socks three days ago.

865
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,000
It's not for church. I want tights.

866
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,500
Pick out whatever you want, but hurry.
I have to get dressed.

867
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,900
Why doesn't he like us?

868
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,000
-Who?
-Ben.

869
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,500
Sam.

870
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,600
He does.

871
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,200
It's just, he's...

872
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,400
Even though he's your brother...

873
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,400
this is all very new for him.

874
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,500
He just needs time to..

875
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,900
He just needs time
to get used to us.

876
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,900
And we have to help him, okay?

877
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Hurry.

878
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,800
Today, we celebrate
the presence among us...

879
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,500
in their wholeness...

880
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,900
of the Cappadora family.

881
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,100
As you all know, their son Ben
was taken from them...

882
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,300
and, by what can only be called...

883
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,600
a modern-day miracle,
returned to them just weeks ago...

884
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,200
not maimed, not torn...

885
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,700
but healthy and whole.

886
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,300
I ask you to join with them today...

887
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,100
in their gratitude and their faith.

888
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,500
I'm also asked to remind you...

889
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,200
of the celebration
at Cappadora's Restaurant...

890
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,800
immediately following the mass.

891
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,700
Are you okay?

892
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,400
Yeah, Dad.

893
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,300
-I'm so happy for you!
-Thank you, Susan.

894
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,000
Congratulations!

895
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,300
That's the big brother.

896
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,200
I want us all to walk in together.

897
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,000
Yes, Mom.
The perfect family.

898
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,800
Welcome home.

899
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,400
Thank you.

900
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,200
The table's here.

901
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,700
Loosen up, man.

902
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,100
I'll show you something.

903
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,600
This is called the tarantella.

904
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,000
It's an Italian dance.
You want to learn it?

905
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,600
You can learn it.

906
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,700
I don't know this dance.
I only know the Hasapiko.

907
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,700
-You'll have to say it again.
-Hasapiko.

908
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,900
Hey, guys, can you hold it?

909
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,000
My son doesn't know the tarantella...

910
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,900
but he knows the Hasapiko.
You know it?

911
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,300
-Of course.
-Great!

912
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,700
I better go up there.

913
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,100
Put your arm out.

914
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,300
Come over here.

915
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Ready?

916
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,100
Right, back...

917
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,600
right, together.

918
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,500
Left, together.

919
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,600
Right, back, right, together.

920
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,700
Yes, Mr. Karras?

921
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,100
I came to bring you Sam's records.

922
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,400
Photos.

923
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,600
This is his...

924
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,400
medical chart.

925
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,900
This is his dental.

926
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,900
One cavity in his permanent teeth
when he was 10.

927
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,400
Report cards...

928
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,100
You'll see.

929
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,100
A little trouble in math.

930
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,000
You know, this...

931
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,800
This was my wife...

932
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,400
and my son.

933
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,100
This wasn't some lunatic
and the boy she kidnapped.

934
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,700
Not to me.

935
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,100
Good night.

936
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,300
What did he want?

937
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,100
We missed a lot of years.

938
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,500
Where you been playing?

939
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,500
City League.

940
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,800
Travelling squad.

941
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
First string.

942
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,500
Travelling squad?

943
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,700
My goodness!

944
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,000
Hey, I'm in sixth.

945
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,000
Most of the other guys are in ninth.

946
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,200
It's all about height.

947
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:28,900
Yeah, sure.

948
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,700
Play Horse?

949
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,700
-That was pretty.
-Not bad.

950
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,200
You on varsity?

951
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,200
I will be.

952
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,700
Coach is such an asshole, though.

953
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,700
Okay, free throw.

954
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,700
-Right here?
-Wherever.

955
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,100
That's an "H".
Get ready for this one.

956
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,300
That's an "O".

957
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,900
I thought this was Horse.

958
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,100
Okay, buddy.

959
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,500
Ready to go downtown?

960
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,200
Wait a second. It's not your shot.

961
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,900
This ain't the city rec, Ben.

962
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,400
It's not "Ben".

963
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,600
Okay...

964
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,800
Ben.

965
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,300
What are we playing to now?

966
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,500
Just play.

967
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,600
Ever seen that
in the city rec, Sammy?

968
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,500
In girls'.

969
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,300
Oh, shit!

970
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,600
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

971
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,600
-What's wrong with you?
-Jesus Christ, Dad!

972
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,900
Are you okay? Sure?

973
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,800
Can you go one day without
making some kind of trouble?

974
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,500
What happened to him?

975
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,100
What do you care?

976
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,800
We were just playing ball.

977
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,100
Really. We were just having fun.

978
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,500
And that's Vincent's.

979
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,300
See?

980
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,700
It's his christening gown.

981
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,100
This is what we brought him home
from the hospital in.

982
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,800
Do you want to see yours?

983
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,800
They're so little.

984
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,200
They look like doll clothes.

985
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,100
-What's that smell?
-It's cedar.

986
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,100
It's from the chest.

987
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,600
It's supposed to keep moths away.

988
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,700
Haven't you ever smelled it before?

989
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,300
Maybe my grandmother
had a chest like this.

990
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,700
What?

991
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,700
Are you remembering something?

992
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,400
Beth, can I see my dad today?

993
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,200
I really want to see him.

994
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,200
Sure.

995
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,000
I already told you. That's why
I want to go to my grandma's.

996
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,100
It's what I do for Thanksgiving
every year of my life.

997
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,900
It's a very special day for us.

998
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,200
It's a very special day for us too.

999
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,600
My cousins come, my grandma cooks...

1000
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,300
the whole week before.

1001
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,900
After turkey,
we go outside and play football.

1002
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,700
When we come in,
we have pie...

1003
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,400
and watch TV with my dad.

1004
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,100
The whole family is coming.

1005
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,200
Grandma Rosie, Grandpa Angelo..

1006
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,400
No! I'm not staying here.

1007
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,300
Why do I have to care about them?

1008
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,300
You never even met my grandma.

1009
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,700
You don't like my dad.

1010
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,300
You don't care about what he thinks.

1011
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,400
Of course we like George, Sam.

1012
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,700
Then let me spend
Thanksgiving with him.

1013
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,300
The fact is, you're our son.

1014
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,300
Not George's. This is one thing
we're doing as a family.

1015
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,300
-And it's not negotiable.
-You just want to show me off.

1016
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

1017
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,700
I didn't mean that.

1018
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,800
Life magazine!
I can't believe...

1019
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,900
the work you're getting.

1020
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,000
You know why I'm getting the work.

1021
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,800
Because you're the best, kiddo.

1022
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,900
Yeah, right.

1023
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,000
Same reason Pat's
restaurant's always full...

1024
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,400
and Vincent's
got a lot of new friends.

1025
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,800
Are you saying it's the celebrity?

1026
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,300
I think the word is "notoriety".

1027
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,300
Where are we eating?
And more to the point, drinking?

1028
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,500
Do you like clams?

1029
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,900
Go this way.

1030
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,900
How's it going with Vincent and Sam?

1031
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,700
Vincent's so busy getting ready for
the basketball tryouts...

1032
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,700
he's ignoring everyone.

1033
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,200
Sam probably thinks....

1034
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,400
I don't know what Sam thinks.
He's still so...

1035
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,000
uncomfortable...

1036
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,700
all the time now.
His grades are falling apart.

1037
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,800
I don't know.

1038
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,900
Well, what's Pat say?

1039
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,800
You know Pat.
He thinks Sam's going to be fine.

1040
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,600
He thinks everything's
going to be fine.

1041
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,400
And what do you think?

1042
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,800
I don't know.

1043
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,900
It's just going to take some time.

1044
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:03,000
Do you know what the
great Chicago fire of 1871 is?

1045
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,600
Peshtigo, there was
an even worse fire...

1046
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,600
in the same year on the same day.

1047
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,600
Every single building
in the town burned.

1048
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,700
Hundreds of people died.

1049
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,500
But Chicago was a big city...

1050
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,100
so that's the fire
everybody paid attention to.

1051
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,800
There's a beautiful graveyard.
I want to get some shots.

1052
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,200
Basically...

1053
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,300
it's the story of what happened.
What we talked about in the car.

1054
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,100
Look at this, Sam.
He was only 14 years old.

1055
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,100
That must've been so sad.

1056
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,700
But look, 1869.

1057
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,100
He died two years before the fire.

1058
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,900
Maybe he killed himself,
like my mom.

1059
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,100
I mean, Cecilia.

1060
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,100
Why do you think that?

1061
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,000
Here, look through here.

1062
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,700
Like, for Cecilia,
I think she was just too sad.

1063
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,900
So maybe this guy was...

1064
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,000
too sad too, you know?

1065
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,400
What do you mean?

1066
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,200
There could be worse things
than being dead.

1067
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:33,900
Like what?

1068
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,200
You know how much we love you.

1069
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,800
Yeah, I know you do...

1070
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,400
and Pat and Kerry.

1071
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,100
And Vincent too.

1072
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,200
Yeah, right.

1073
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,000
Really, he's like that with all of us.

1074
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,300
He's had a hard time.

1075
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,100
What about me?

1076
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,300
I love my dad.

1077
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,700
And I loved my mom too.

1078
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,800
She didn't mean to be sick.

1079
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,100
Why do I have to be punished
when it wasn't my fault?

1080
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,400
Do you know how much
I've missed holding you...

1081
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,500
all these years?

1082
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,300
And how many years
you didn't have me to hug you?

1083
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,500
They hugged me.

1084
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,200
They hugged me all the time.

1085
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,800
Sam, what do you wish?

1086
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,100
You can say.

1087
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,900
That everything was
like it was before.

1088
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,600
But that would hurt you and Pat,
and I couldn't stand that either.

1089
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,600
I don't know.

1090
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,900
-Sam's gone.
-What do you mean?

1091
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,500
He's not in his room.
I can't find him.

1092
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,700
-Did you look downstairs?
-He's not there. I can't find him.

1093
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,200
-Did you talk to Vincent?
-He's asleep. His door's locked.

1094
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,800
-What about Kerry?
-She's asleep too.

1095
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I'm sorry.
He did it again.

1096
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,300
What'd he do?

1097
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,100
He's been sneaking out
and coming to my house.

1098
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,700
He crawls into his old bed
and sleeps.

1099
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,700
Vincent told me he knew all about it.

1100
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,400
-You knew?
-I brought him back, didn't I?

1101
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,400
How long has this been going on?

1102
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,000
Not that long.

1103
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,200
I had a feeling something
was wrong, so this time...

1104
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,600
I brought him back myself.

1105
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,900
You knew and didn't tell me?

1106
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,700
He's home, okay?

1107
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,200
This time, anyhow.

1108
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,000
-Go up to your room.
-Why?

1109
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,600
-What did I do?
-You ran away!

1110
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,700
You scared the hell
out of your mom and me!

1111
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,200
That's not going to happen.
You understand me?

1112
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,200
No, I don't understand.
I'm sick of this whole thing!

1113
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:51,300
I don't see why I have to live
two blocks from my own house.

1114
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,400
I've been trying for three months.

1115
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,200
Three months!

1116
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,900
You want me to come home,
Dad, right?

1117
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,400
Come on, tell them.

1118
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,900
He's been asking me
why can't he live with me.

1119
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,900
I told him what
his mother did was very wrong.

1120
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,800
She didn't know what she was doing.

1121
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,700
She was sick.

1122
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,900
We know how hard
this has been for you.

1123
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,100
We know how much you miss George.

1124
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,100
But this is your home.

1125
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,600
Sam, go upstairs now.

1126
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,900
I hate you.

1127
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,300
I hate all of you!

1128
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,100
You too, Dad,
and I'm never coming back!

1129
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,600
Jesus, I want to do right by him.

1130
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,800
I want him to be happy.

1131
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,900
If you can give him
the family he deserves...

1132
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,900
goddamn it, you give him that!

1133
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,200
But I've never seen him
like this before.

1134
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,300
He's never been sad more than
a day in his life.

1135
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,600
Right now, he's the saddest boy
in the world.

1136
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,300
You know, what happened last night,
that's just the tip of it.

1137
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,700
I'm going to say this just once.

1138
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,900
I love you.

1139
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,800
I've been in love with you
your whole life.

1140
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,300
But you know what
I've seen about you?

1141
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,500
You've made a career
out of being unhappy.

1142
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,700
-That is not fair.
-But I'm not like that.

1143
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,100
If I have a chance to be happy,
I'm going to be happy.

1144
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,200
Can't you just try
and let us all be happy?

1145
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,800
What about Sam?

1146
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,900
Just keep being a mother to him.

1147
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,500
Help him get through this.

1148
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,700
He doesn't know who we are.

1149
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,500
He doesn't remember us.

1150
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,100
We are holding him against his will.

1151
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,800
Where are you going with this?

1152
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,000
If you think I'm going to
lose my kid again..

1153
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,400
I can't ignore that
because you finally...

1154
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,800
have your life the way you want it.

1155
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,200
It's like we are the kidnappers now.

1156
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,700
We're not the kidnappers!

1157
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,100
Sam will be fine.
He'll get through this.

1158
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,400
It's you!

1159
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,200
Losing your kid once
wasn't enough, was it?

1160
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,600
You know something?

1161
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You're right.

1162
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,600
I wasn't there.
I let it happen.

1163
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,200
It only took a minute,
and we've paid for it.

1164
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,000
I have and you have...

1165
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,400
and Vincent has,
but I don't think that means...

1166
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,400
that Sam has to pay for it too.
Does it?

1167
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,700
We are where we are.

1168
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,900
How we got here doesn't matter.
What matters is...

1169
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,300
what do we do now?

1170
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,800
Don't push me on this, Beth.

1171
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,700
I want to give him back.

1172
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,400
I can't do that.

1173
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,100
Then I want you to let me do
what I have to do.

1174
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,600
Can you get your bags okay?

1175
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,400
I'll try Jay again,
but if we can't get him out...

1176
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,100
for the weekend,
I won't have a problem.

1177
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,100
Don't you think
he's been through enough?

1178
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,800
Something's got to
get his attention.

1179
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,300
Maybe he's doing this to get
your attention.

1180
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,200
Candy, he's always had my attention.

1181
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,800
He is so angry with me.

1182
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,900
Things are really bad.

1183
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,600
I know.
But I think he's right about Vincent.

1184
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,100
I can't win with Vincent.
He hates me.

1185
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,100
He doesn't hate you. What are you
talking about? He loves you.

1186
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,000
Have you never seen the way
that he looks at you?

1187
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,400
All he wants you to do
is to forgive him.

1188
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,000
Forgive him?

1189
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:33,100
For all the shit he's pulled and
the shit you don't know he's pulled.

1190
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:37,000
He's so much like you.
He takes everything onto himself.

1191
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:40,800
How do you think he's
feeling now that Sam is gone?

1192
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,300
You okay?

1193
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,300
I'm fine.

1194
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,900
Do you need anything?

1195
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,600
I think you'll have to
stay here another day or so.

1196
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,900
It's the weekend.

1197
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,300
I'm fine.

1198
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,800
Headache. It's no big deal.

1199
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,000
Do you know how lucky you were?

1200
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,800
Mr. Teeter's car was totalled.

1201
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,600
-You could've been..
-I don't need this right now.

1202
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,500
What are you doing here?

1203
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,800
I've been doing fine without you.

1204
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,500
I don't think you have been.

1205
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,600
I'm sorry.

1206
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,200
We're going to get you out of here.

1207
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,200
Dad's working on it.

1208
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,100
Pat? Jay just called.

1209
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,300
He says we can pick Vincent up
in the morning.

1210
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,400
All right. Thank you.

1211
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,300
Can't we get past this?

1212
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,800
This isn't just about losing Sam.

1213
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,000
What is it about?

1214
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,000
Listen to me.

1215
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,300
The Sam that's in your head...

1216
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,100
he doesn't exist.

1217
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,000
The family that's in your head...

1218
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,600
doesn't exist either.

1219
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,700
This family is not in my head.

1220
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,600
It's very real.

1221
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,100
It's you and me...

1222
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,400
and Kerry and Vincent.

1223
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,100
After what he pulled,
I pray I find a way...

1224
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,700
to get him through high school
in one piece...

1225
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,200
and get him to believe he can
get through life without fouling up!

1226
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,700
You are right.

1227
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:59,000
You're right about Vincent,
but you're wrong about Sam.

1228
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,300
You don't know him.
You don't want to know him.

1229
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,100
And you don't know me anymore either.

1230
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,600
I have known you..

1231
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,000
Part of you liked it
when I was falling apart...

1232
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,300
and you were holding
this family together...

1233
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,200
making the decisions.
But now...

1234
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,700
I don't need you
to pull me out of bed...

1235
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,200
and make me pay attention
to the kids.

1236
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,800
I have to go to work.

1237
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,800
But I do need you.

1238
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,500
Why?

1239
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,300
Tell me what for.

1240
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,300
I need you to love me.

1241
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,800
You got a visitor.

1242
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,200
Everyone I've ever met
in my life has already been here.

1243
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,500
Name's Sam Karras.

1244
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,700
You gonna see him or not?

1245
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,200
So...

1246
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,000
you okay?

1247
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,000
They gave me 5 to 10.
But I'm reasonably okay.

1248
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,700
I'm kidding.

1249
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,100
Were you drunk?

1250
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,600
I was over-served.

1251
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,100
Yeah, Sam, I was drunk.

1252
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,300
So what do you want?

1253
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,300
I just thought....

1254
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,600
I thought we could be friends.

1255
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,300
Friends?

1256
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,100
Tell me how we can be friends.

1257
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,600
You come back. You leave.

1258
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,200
You go in and out our window.

1259
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,700
I don't know you, Ben.

1260
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,200
Sam! Whatever your name is.

1261
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,700
You're a concept. You follow me?

1262
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,800
-That's not my fault.
-"Not my fault!"

1263
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,400
You always whine about
whose fault it is. Who cares?

1264
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,200
Look, I got my own life now.

1265
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:07,600
It's pretty un-fun at the moment.
Tell me what you want.

1266
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,900
You're my brother.

1267
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,900
I missed you.

1268
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,000
Sometimes, I even thought
I shouldn't have.

1269
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,000
Whatever, you're my brother.

1270
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,400
You should go now, Sam.

1271
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,800
I'm sorry. You're a good kid.

1272
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,500
You're fine, but I'm..

1273
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:35,800
-Maybe I'll visit you when I'm out..
-Wait!

1274
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,700
I gotta tell you something.

1275
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,000
I remembered something.

1276
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,600
What do you mean?

1277
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,500
Well, when I was at your house...

1278
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,800
Beth showed me this old trunk.

1279
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:50,800
It was full of old baby clothes.

1280
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,800
I didn't remember anything.

1281
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,500
Yeah. So?

1282
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,400
But I remembered the smell.

1283
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,700
From being inside the trunk.

1284
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,500
Hide-and-seek.

1285
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,800
Did that really happen?

1286
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,100
Yeah.

1287
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,700
You let the lid shut and it caught.

1288
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,300
I knew it.

1289
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,100
I knew it!

1290
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,500
Finally, you came
and opened the top.

1291
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,300
You were just there.

1292
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,600
Not scared or anything.

1293
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,700
See? That's what I remember.

1294
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,900
What?

1295
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,800
That I wasn't scared.

1296
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,300
Because I knew you'd come
and find me.

1297
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,500
What the hell are you doing?

1298
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,800
Nothing.

1299
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,300
Want to play?

1300
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,300
It's midnight and it's cold,
in case you haven't noticed.

1301
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Yeah. So?

1302
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,400
Jesus, Sam!
Does George know you're here?

1303
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,900
Yeah.

1304
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,100
Come on down.

1305
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,300
You just want to get me
arrested again, don't you?

1306
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,500
Ever heard of disturbing the peace?

1307
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,300
We could play quiet.

1308
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,600
What's the matter? Come on!

1309
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,600
All right.

1310
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:57,100
What are you waiting for?

1311
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,100
-Easy, Sam.
-All right.

1312
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,800
Losers out to 11, win by 2?

1313
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,000
What's the matter?
You asleep or something?

1314
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,200
This way?

1315
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,700
Which way?

1316
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,400
Quit fouling me!

1317
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,700
You got to say, "beat".
You are beat, right?

1318
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,800
I let you.

1319
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,600
Sure.

1320
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,400
Let's call it a night.

1321
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,200
Come back tomorrow for a rematch.

1322
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,100
Well, the thing is, I'm not going back.

1323
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,900
What do you mean?

1324
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,500
What are you doing?

1325
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,900
George knows.

1326
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,800
We talked about it
a lot last week.

1327
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,100
He knows why
I came here so late.

1328
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,600
Which is why?

1329
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:17,600
I didn't want to have this
whole big thing with you...

1330
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,900
and Beth and Pat.

1331
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,200
Sam?

1332
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Is this permanent?

1333
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,400
I don't know.

1334
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,800
I mean, maybe.

1335
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,100
If I can.

1336
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,200
Jesus, what is this,
your cinder block collection?

1337
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,900
I was the one.

1338
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,300
I let go of your hand.

1339
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,500
This thing is heavy.

1340
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:05,900
My dad..

1341
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,800
-George helped me carry it.
-Did you hear what I said?

1342
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,200
Yeah. So what?

1343
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,900
I let go of your hand, Sam.

1344
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,300
I told you to get lost.
That's what I said.

1345
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,100
-I said, "Get lost!"
-Big deal.

1346
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:24,500
Everybody says stuff like that.
"Get lost!"

1347
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,500
Here's the deal.
Make it-take it to 11.

1348
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,400
Gotta win by two.

1349
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,500
Loser carries it up alone.

1350
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,000
Come on, man!

1351
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,900
Are you too tired to play?

1352
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:41,900
Come on, let's go.

1353
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,500
They'll wake up the neighbourhood.

1354
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,300
Let them play.

1355
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,900
I just..

1356
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,100
Let's get some sleep.

1357
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,600
Right there!

1358
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,500
I'm just warming up.
