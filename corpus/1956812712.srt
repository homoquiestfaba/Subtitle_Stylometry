1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,046
Authorities worldwide

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,673
expressed shock
at these allegations.

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,967
Most daring
thefts of modern times.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,528
Fowl is said
to be hiding ancient relics

5
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,654
worth hundreds of millions of...

6
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,720
Time and again,

7
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,390
these museums
were robbed of untold riches.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,575
Some say the true amount stolen

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,642
may never be known.

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,644
Where I am amidst
what can only be described

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,229
as a media frenzy.

12
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,249
He couldn't dismiss the fact
that when he was arrested...

13
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,315
The collection contains

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,459
the rarest evidence
of ancient worlds.

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,528
Most expressed horror at his
alleged criminal activity,

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,614
while others hinted at a more
widespread conspiracy.

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,824
Many similarities

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,702
to numerous daring thefts
shrouded in mystery.

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,078
A crowd has gathered...

20
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,162
It's him! It's him!

21
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,706
Breaking news.
There is the car.

22
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,249
Yes, the car has come down.

23
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,018
And it looks like
young Artemis Fowl is here.

24
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,421
Authorities
have now made connections

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,505
to one man.

26
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,340
Artemis Fowl.

27
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,633
Breaking news now

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
and a suspected accomplice
of Artemis Fowl

29
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,220
is today arrested
near Fowl Manor.

30
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,305
Help me.

31
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,807
Is this
unidentified individual a link

32
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,560
to Artemis Fowl
and the multiple thefts?

33
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,813
We have reports

34
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,332
that British intelligence
authorities

35
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,692
are expected to question
the subject immediately.

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,027
Is it true?

37
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,634
Do you have anything to say,
Artemis?

38
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,946
How does it feel

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,630
to have a criminal
for a father, Artemis?

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,968
Your name?

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,471
Mulch Diggums.

42
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,182
Exactly what were you doing
near Fowl Manor?

43
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,266
So now it's illegal

44
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,392
to go for a hike?

45
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,685
This was no hike.

46
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,647
Unless you tell us exactly
what happened at Fowl Manor,

47
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,690
you will be
permanently imprisoned.

48
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,400
Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,985
You don't want me.

50
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,905
No. No, I'm just
a talented tunneler.

51
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,658
You want the brains
of the operation.

52
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,619
The one who stole the Aculos.

53
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,038
What, precisely, is the Aculos?

54
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,082
The Aculos.

55
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,210
A weapon
so powerful and mysterious,

56
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,711
it can barely be imagined.

57
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,046
You're lying.

58
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,607
Look, I know
you don't believe my story,

59
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,632
but I can prove it.

60
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,093
Mr. Diggums,
I highly doubt that.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,554
You will see.

62
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,721
All I see is

63
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,825
that there was some highly
unusual seismic activity

64
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,350
around Fowl Manor

65
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,019
and reports from a crazed
fisherman of fairies.

66
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,107
Well, maybe the fisherman saw
something he wasn't meant to.

67
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,275
It's fantasy.

68
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,277
What's reality is that
you are a common thief

69
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,029
who is somehow in league
with a quite uncommon thief.

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,907
We want to know everything
about the man you work for.

71
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,242
The man?

72
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,244
No.

73
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,621
This isn't about the father.

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,207
This is about the son.

75
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,959
The son?

76
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,045
Do not underestimate the kid.

77
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,799
Let me show you

78
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,345
the infinite possibilities
of magic.

79
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,515
Let me tell you

80
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,186
the story of Artemis Fowl.

81
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,945
A story that begins where
every great story begins,

82
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,949
in a place where magic
and wonder still exist.

83
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,452
The most magical place on Earth.

84
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,245
Ireland.

85
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,207
Home of Artemis Fowl.

86
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,961
Artemis loved Ireland.

87
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,718
The sea and the land.

88
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,137
Not so much the school.

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,894
You see, he just didn't need it.

90
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,062
When he was seven,

91
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,481
he beat European
chess champion Evan Rashoggi

92
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,066
in five moves.

93
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,569
When he was nine, he won
the architectural competition

94
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,529
to design
the Dublin Opera House.

95
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,030
When he was ten,

96
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,157
he cloned a goat
and named it Bruce.

97
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,909
Weird choice,
but he's an unusual kid.

98
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,994
Good.

99
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,164
And you know
when you're that unusual,

100
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,000
you're going to stick out.

101
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,424
Well, Artemis,
let's talk, shall we?

102
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,592
Certainly, sir.

103
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,597
I can see
you're admiring my chair.

104
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,224
It's a family heirloom.

105
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,352
Grandfather acquired it
from Sotheby's.

106
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,354
William and Mary period,

107
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,774
1689 to 1702,
as I'm sure you know.

108
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,401
Impressive.

109
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,487
Once in use at the palace,
Buckingham Palace.

110
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,406
Queen's favorite chair,
apparently.

111
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,492
Now, Artemis,
there is a problem.

112
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,828
The problem is that
I know the textbook reply

113
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,788
to any question
you may choose to ask.

114
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,416
The problem is that you don't
respect anyone enough

115
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,126
to treat them as an equal.

116
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,853
That's ridiculous.
I hold several people

117
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,962
in the very highest esteem.

118
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,632
Really? Who, for example?

119
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,008
Albert Einstein.

120
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,968
His theories
were usually correct.

121
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,972
How about someone
you actually know?

122
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,393
You seem to have
all the answers, Doctor.

123
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,561
Why don't you tell me?

124
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,938
Well,

125
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,648
where shall we start?

126
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,526
That's my biography, I presume?

127
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,445
It is.
It explains quite a lot.

128
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,947
Such as?

129
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,615
Well, firstly,

130
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,117
there's your dear mother,
of course.

131
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,996
Who was a wonderful woman,
in my opinion,

132
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,041
and taken from us far too soon,

133
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,796
but who sadly had absolutely
no control over your behavior.

134
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,592
Then, of course,
there's your father

135
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,096
and his mysterious absences
from home.

136
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,432
This is a sensitive area,
Doctor.

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,395
But do you think
that's why you are as you are?

138
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,397
No.

139
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,666
And by the way, I didn't know

140
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,358
they allowed fakes
at the palace.

141
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,693
- Fake?
- It's clever,

142
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,777
I'll give you that.

143
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,362
But look at these
furniture tacks.

144
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,030
Crisscross pattern on the head.

145
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,115
Machine-tooled.

146
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,285
Makes it 1890s at the earliest.

147
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,786
Your grandfather was duped.

148
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,705
Artemis,
you're lashing out at me,

149
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,790
but I think I know
what this is really about.

150
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,711
Is it because of the burden
of your father's name?

151
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,838
No.

152
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,048
It's because
I'm forced to endure

153
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,717
this ridiculous therapy.

154
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,218
Artemis?

155
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,846
Look! Just who do you think
you are?

156
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,269
But, of course,
Artemis wasn't on his own,

157
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,814
even if it may have seemed
that way sometimes.

158
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,367
For if there was one thing
Artemis liked

159
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,369
more than his own company,

160
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,373
it was being at home
with his dad.

161
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,503
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

162
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,672
a dealer
of antiques and rarities

163
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,175
and just about
every Irish fairy tale

164
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,177
you might care to imagine.

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,621
They're trained in the art of...

166
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,564
Except that
you didn't have to imagine,

167
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,192
for Artemis Sr.
Taught Artemis Jr.

168
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,395
Everything there was to know

169
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,779
about the leprechauns
and the banshees

170
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,407
and the sprites and the goblins.

171
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,618
So much so that you might
even have thought

172
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,411
that Artemis Sr. believed

173
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,289
in the legends
of the little people.

174
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,583
He certainly shared
his passion with his son

175
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,709
on the rare occasions

176
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,962
when he wasn't away from home.

177
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,505
But while he was there,

178
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,508
he was absolutely determined
to have Artemis know

179
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,344
all that could be known
about the fairies.

180
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,849
To prepare the boy for a day
that would come much sooner

181
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
than anyone expected.

182
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,121
Did I ever tell you
how all those fairy stones

183
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,185
got to come to Fowl Manor?

184
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:25,816
Thousands of years ago,

185
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,484
this is where
the peace was made.

186
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,611
After the war
between the human world

187
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,863
and the Tuatha De Danaan,

188
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,739
a human and a fairy met...

189
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,033
Just tell me
when you're leaving.

190
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,497
The helicopter's

191
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,683
being prepared
for me right now, son.

192
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,142
I'm sorry.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

193
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,519
That's what you said
the last time,

194
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,794
and the time before.

195
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,172
I know, Arty.

196
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,466
There's just one very
important thing I have to do.

197
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,843
And I know it's been hard,

198
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,304
but, look,
my work is coming to an end.

199
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,847
And like the stories, you know,

200
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,682
they all have an ending
that just...

201
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,019
Well, it makes you smile.

202
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,480
And this one
will be no different.

203
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,400
And when it ends,
a new story will begin.

204
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,277
And maybe,

205
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,820
just maybe,

206
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,655
it'll be yours.

207
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,990
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

208
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,744
Well, you used to
believe in magic.

209
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,078
You believed in the goblins,

210
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,496
and you believed in the trolls.

211
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,849
You believed in everything
I told you

212
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,124
about the Hill of Tara.

213
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,210
All I really want

214
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,629
is to believe in you.

215
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,801
Okay.

216
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:39,932
Come here, son.

217
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,356
I love you, son.

218
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,983
More than you could ever know.

219
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,279
Then take me with you.

220
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,534
You're all I have now, Arty.

221
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,620
Let me keep you safe
for a little longer.

222
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,794
Come on.

223
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,331
And remember,
until I see you again,

224
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,375
may the road rise up
to meet you.

225
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,378
May the wind
be always at your back.

226
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,882
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

227
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,135
May the rain fall soft
upon your fields.

228
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,262
And until we meet again,

229
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,473
may a friend be always near.

230
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,934
Good night, son.

231
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,436
Good night, Dad.

232
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,916
What are you talking about?

233
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,295
Yes, he took off yesterday,
as planned.

234
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,551
What do you mean,
he never arrived?

235
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,053
The boat was empty.

236
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,096
Have you checked the manifest?

237
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,434
How long
before the media have it?

238
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,229
I don't know. You'd better
make some inquiries.

239
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,817
Domovoi Butler.

240
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,819
Friend, mentor, bodyguard.

241
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,072
Ten years of martial arts
training in Kyoto,

242
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,907
seven years of
weapons training in Moscow,

243
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,259
six years of strength training

244
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,160
at Gold's Gym in Venice,
California.

245
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,870
And under no circumstances

246
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,789
were you to ever call him
"The Butler"

247
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,458
even though his last name
was in fact "Butler."

248
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,086
You could call him "Dom,"
or "Domovoi,"

249
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,171
or "Very large man in a suit,"

250
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,800
but call him "The Butler,"
and he'd snap you in half.

251
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,802
Not always sunny, though.

252
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,262
There will be some cloud

253
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,389
that'll bring a few drizzles
now and again,

254
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,058
especially along the western
and northern coast.

255
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,852
Now back to our main story.

256
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,272
Authorities today launched

257
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,275
a worldwide manhunt
for Artemis Fowl.

258
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,609
A reclusive businessman,

259
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,736
but now
a controversial public figure

260
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,530
whose superyacht, the Owl Star,

261
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,323
was found abandoned last night

262
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,992
in the South China seas.

263
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,495
Fowl is a known collector
and antiquities dealer,

264
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,080
but in dramatic new revelations,

265
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,416
he is also suspected
to have been behind

266
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,586
some of the biggest robberies
of the past 10 years,

267
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,714
including the disappearance
of the priceless Rosetta Stone

268
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,299
from the British Museum,

269
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,719
the irreplaceable 14th century
Boru's harp,

270
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,763
and the iconic Book of Kells
from Trinity College, Dublin.

271
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,892
No sign of struggle was found
aboard the Owl Star

272
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,477
and her owner's fate
is entirely unknown.

273
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,688
Investigations are ongoing,

274
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,607
but until further news
of his whereabouts

275
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,567
can be established,
doubts will remain.

276
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,194
My dad.

277
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,573
- Artemis.
- Where is he, Dom?

278
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,283
We don't know.
I have people on the way

279
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
to the wreck as we speak.

280
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,703
And the remaining question...

281
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,455
Artemis Fowl,

282
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,292
antiquities dealer
or criminal mastermind?

283
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,835
How dare they!

284
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,254
He's not a criminal!
He's my dad!

285
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,131
He's my dad!

286
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,010
Dad!

287
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,517
Artemis, don't answer the phone!

288
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,603
- Artemis!
- Dad!

289
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,108
Hello? Dad?

290
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,528
Hello?

291
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,615
Artemis Jr., I presume.

292
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,617
I have your father.

293
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,953
What? Who is this?

294
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,120
Is this a hoax?

295
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,914
If you have my father,
I want proof.

296
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,124
Then you shall have some.

297
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,751
Dad? Dad?

298
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:18,836
Artemis.

299
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:20,879
Artemis.

300
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,798
You listen to me, son,
you stay out of this.

301
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,007
Okay? Do you hear me?

302
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,235
There's no way you can help me.

303
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,260
It's too big.

304
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,306
Everything I've told you
is true. It's all true!

305
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,681
Your father stole something
from me and hid it.

306
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,809
My enemies have prevented me
from retrieving it myself.

307
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,143
You will do so on my behalf.

308
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,063
Find the Aculos, or you will
never see him again.

309
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:39,857
Artemis!

310
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,316
What's the Aculos?

311
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,943
You're a clever boy.

312
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,486
You'll work it out.

313
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,780
You have three days.

314
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,323
Artemis, what did they say?

315
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,491
Word for word.

316
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,077
Whoever it was...

317
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
- Man? Woman?
- I couldn't tell.

318
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,348
But they were asking for
something called the Aculos.

319
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,373
What is it?

320
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,253
Artemis, get dressed
and come with me.

321
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,094
You weren't supposed
to see this yet.

322
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,532
Your father would kill me
if he knew we were here.

323
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,285
I'm showing you
because I have no choice.

324
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,745
What is all this?

325
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,871
This is where your father

326
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,664
kept his entire life's work.

327
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,584
And his father,
and his father before him.

328
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,879
It's not what it looks like,
Artemis.

329
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,446
Everything in this room
was acquired

330
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,924
for a specific reason.

331
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,593
Sometimes to protect
its secrets,

332
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,596
sometimes to keep it from
falling into the wrong hands.

333
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,098
These are relics
from another world.

334
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,017
I don't understand.

335
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,352
I was never meant to share

336
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,835
the details
of your family business.

337
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,772
These relics
have been passed down

338
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,106
through the generations.

339
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,459
They're secrets that your father

340
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,943
had intended to share with you

341
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,402
when the time was right.

342
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,904
But the fairies are a myth.

343
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,271
None of this is actually true.

344
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,282
Look around you, Arty.

345
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,994
Maybe those stories
can help us find him.

346
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,831
But where to begin?

347
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,417
I don't see anything
about an Aculos, do you?

348
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,585
No.

349
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,337
I helped him catalogue
much of this,

350
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,820
but he never mentioned
such a thing.

351
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,341
And he always shared
his discoveries with me.

352
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,718
The only thing he kept private
was his journal.

353
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,387
Then that's what
we have to find.

354
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,556
I wouldn't know
where to begin to look.

355
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,891
Could your father
have ever given you a clue

356
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,643
as to where to start?

357
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,979
He never told me how to start,

358
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,648
but he may have told me
how to end.

359
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,569
- End?
- Yeah.

360
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,779
He read the same poem to me
every night before bed

361
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,739
and every time he left.

362
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,909
"May the road rise up
to meet you.

363
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,953
"May the wind
be always at your back.

364
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,039
"May the sun shine
warm upon your face."

365
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,962
"May the rains fall soft
upon your fields."

366
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,924
Who wrote this poem, Arty?

367
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:12,968
Nobody knows.

368
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,970
That's just it.

369
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,054
Then how do you find it?

370
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,308
It's known
as "The Irish Blessing."

371
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:23,937
It's a journal.

372
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,731
It's Dad's journal.

373
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,441
Go to the last entry.

374
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,658
"She's hunting me now
and would kill me to find it.

375
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:37,868
"She knows the truth of

376
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,471
"what Beechwood gave me
before he died.

377
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,622
"They know
we have the Aculos."

378
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,082
The voice on the phone
told you to find it.

379
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,919
"The Aculos cannot fall
into the wrong hands.

380
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,420
"It had to be protected,

381
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,631
"even from
the fairies themselves.

382
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,925
"Time to believe."

383
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,052
Time to believe in fairies?

384
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,221
But they're not real.

385
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,265
Are they?

386
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,521
But as Artemis
would soon find out,

387
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,022
they are very real

388
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,982
and they've been living
right under your feet

389
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,943
for 1,000 years.

390
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,239
And their cities
at the center of the Earth

391
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,658
are not something
out of a storybook.

392
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,577
No.

393
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,830
They are just as real as you.

394
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,043
Diverse and strange
and beautiful.

395
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,670
Ladies and gentlemen,

396
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,548
welcome to the wondrous,
thriving metropolis

397
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,925
that is Haven City,

398
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,846
home of the fairies.

399
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,149
You have now arrived

400
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,401
at Haven City Central,

401
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,319
this transporter's terminus.

402
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,697
Please make sure you take
all your belongings with you

403
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,282
before leaving the transporter.

404
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,575
Officer Holly Short,

405
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,243
two minutes
to security briefing.

406
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,080
Do it with Koboi.

407
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,623
Shuttles to the surface...

408
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,208
We bring you
a community leader...

409
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,252
Our main story this morning.

410
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,795
As a second week passes,

411
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,089
there is still no sign
of the Aculos.

412
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,008
Fears are rising.

413
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,926
However, authorities assure us

414
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,928
the crisis
will be swiftly handled.

415
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,139
Even so, doubts are mounting.

416
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah. Thank you.

417
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,924
See, this is my favorite part.

418
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,343
Mainly because I'm in it.

419
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,804
Keep an eye out, brothers.

420
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,681
We dwarves gotta watch
each other's backs,

421
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:05,766
am I right?

422
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,684
Lay low,
I'll get us out of here.

423
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,852
You're not a dwarf.

424
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,146
- No, I am, I'm a dwarf.
- No, you're not.

425
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:12,940
I am a giant dwarf.

426
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,776
You've got a big mouth
for a dwarf.

427
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,655
You won't talk so much
at Howler's Peak.

428
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,282
That's where we goblins
do the talking.

429
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,786
And what we say goes.

430
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,080
Next!

431
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:30,999
Hi there, gents.

432
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,252
Mulch Diggums.

433
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,462
Two G's in Diggums.

434
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,548
Tunneling and entering.

435
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,716
Repeat offender. 400 years.

436
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,385
Yeah, that sounds about right.

437
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,221
Hey, hey, hey.
Knock it off. Knock it off.

438
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,974
Knock it off!

439
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,854
Next! Move!

440
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,063
Officer Short.

441
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,606
Good to see you.

442
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,525
What are you in
for this time, Mulch?

443
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,901
Tunneling and entering.

444
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,087
Put in a good word for me,
will you?

445
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,153
You know I'm an artist.

446
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,530
Yeah. A con artist.

447
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,740
Art is art. Great artists
are never understood.

448
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,660
Hey, you and I would make
a great team, you know?

449
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,079
Me cracking safes,
tunneling into banks,

450
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,372
you watching my back

451
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,135
with your tiny
but effective fairy weapons.

452
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,292
That's your plan?

453
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,727
Less of a plan,
more of a lifestyle choice.

454
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,128
By the way, this your wallet?

455
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:18,255
Stop picking my pockets!

456
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,174
Think of my children, Holly.

457
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,780
- You don't have children.
- Not yet.

458
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,510
Prisoner for processing.

459
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,929
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, don't go yet.

460
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,306
We're the same, you know?

461
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,726
Your last name is Short.
My whole body is short.

462
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,102
You're not short.

463
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,687
I keep telling you that.

464
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,106
That's just discriminatory.

465
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,610
I'll write it off as ignorance
because I love you!

466
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,028
And thanks for the music.

467
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,571
Move it now.

468
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,239
I am very much a dwarf.

469
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,909
Over here!

470
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,930
Briar Cudgeon.

471
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,973
Is this about my appeal?

472
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,809
Yes, you will be
a commander again.

473
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,020
All charges dropped.

474
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,522
I've convinced the executors

475
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,441
to grant a pardon
after your court-martial.

476
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,445
Commander Root
was powerless to stop it.

477
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,489
Who are you?

478
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,741
My fairy godmother?

479
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:32,329
Yes, only now you work for me.

480
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,914
The Fowl boy is in play,

481
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,397
and I want nothing
that prevents him

482
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,209
from bringing me the Aculos.

483
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,921
You will infiltrate
Fairy Command on my behalf.

484
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,506
I spy?

485
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,508
You spy or you die.

486
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,275
Morning, Shorty.

487
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,156
LEPRECON!

488
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,222
Commander! What are all
these rumors about the Aculos?

489
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,789
Knock it off!

490
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,375
You've seen the news.

491
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,170
The Aculos is still missing.

492
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:24,464
Kelp, Verbil, B Squad, C Squad,

493
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,050
you're all
on triple night duty downtown.

494
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,513
The delicate balance of peace
in our world

495
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,557
now hangs by a narrow thread.

496
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:37,060
Until the Aculos
is safely returned,

497
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,647
our entire civilization
is at risk

498
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,065
from the humans

499
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,319
or from enemies
amongst our own kind.

500
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,989
There is a dark force at work,
and it will stop at nothing

501
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,200
until it has the Aculos.

502
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,203
So keep your eyes peeled.

503
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,247
See it and report it.

504
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:03,587
We must recover the Aculos
and protect our anonymity.

505
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:08,217
For the peace to remain,
so must our secret existence.

506
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,636
Preserve that at all costs.

507
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,970
Jeopardize it,

508
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:15,516
and I'll have you incarcerated
at Howler's Peak.

509
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,227
Any questions?

510
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,270
No? Good.

511
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,813
Get to work.

512
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,274
Commander Root!

513
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,568
Yes, what is it?

514
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,696
Commander, I have
a new lead on my father.

515
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,989
He was at the Hill of Tara.

516
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,950
- You're not going.
- But, Commander...

517
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,159
That's an order.

518
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:35,285
Not a request.

519
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,620
Yes, Commander.

520
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,003
A word of advice.

521
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,924
You're 84, you're young,

522
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,135
you have your whole life
ahead of you.

523
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,973
You'll have plenty of missions
to fly, Holly.

524
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,481
And you can be a good officer.

525
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,151
Just don't make this personal.

526
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,783
Let them take care
of the Aculos.

527
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,006
With Artemis Sr. gone...

528
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:30,299
Let's go with backup.

529
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,968
Domovoi knew
the stakes couldn't be higher.

530
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,596
He knew he would need to
bring in some reinforcements.

531
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,681
Someone he could trust
to watch his back

532
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,725
to help protect Fowl Manor.

533
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,230
There was only one person
he knew

534
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,858
who fully understood
tactical reconnaissance,

535
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,109
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,

536
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,403
and the complicated mind
of a 12-year-old.

537
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,824
Another 12-year-old.

538
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,578
His niece, Juliet Butler.

539
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,540
No links found.

540
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,625
Artemis.

541
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,834
The searching's important,

542
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,198
but you can't forget the basics.

543
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,380
- Eat.
- There's no time.

544
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,747
You've done 12 hours straight.

545
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,717
It appears to be nowhere
in this house

546
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,427
- and yet it has to be.
- Zero matches.

547
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,262
You're not giving up, are you?

548
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,430
Of course not.

549
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,782
But I think
I may know the problem.

550
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,934
I'm not the one to find it.

551
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,602
So, how do we summon

552
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,354
this mysterious finder
of Aculoses?

553
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,273
The fairies,
of course. They'll help us.

554
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:29,858
Will they?

555
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,401
With a bit of persuasion.

556
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,904
And do you know where they are?

557
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,948
In my father's journal,

558
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,241
he wrote of a fairy

559
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,660
who would periodically visit
the oak tree

560
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:40,994
on the Hill of Tara.

561
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,538
She's our best option,

562
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:44,998
because their world,
it's too well hidden.

563
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,375
And their books,

564
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,293
it's not
just a different language,

565
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,837
it's encoded.

566
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,677
Of course it's encoded.

567
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,679
By this guy. Foaly.

568
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,889
Fairy tech genius and centaur.

569
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:01,974
Foaly!

570
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,392
Do not ask him for a ride.

571
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,518
Hello, Holly.

572
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,703
I learned that the hard way.

573
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,937
Commander.

574
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,230
What is it, Foaly?

575
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,565
We have a problem.

576
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,609
One of ours is unaccounted for
on the surface.

577
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,278
Elf? Dwarf? Goblin?

578
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,155
Hard to tell. But it's big.

579
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,491
Could be a deep-tunnel breakout.

580
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,286
Perhaps through a fault
or dormant volcano.

581
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,454
Send someone up to identify it.

582
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,793
All active duty officers
are downtown

583
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,086
searching for the Aculos.

584
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,091
- Officer Short.
- Yes, Commander.

585
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,819
- I'm sending you up there.
- Yes, Commander.

586
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,428
Identify, report,

587
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,991
- but do not engage.
- Yes, Commander.

588
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,097
- Clear?
- Crystal.

589
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:43,408
- Go, go!
- Thank you, Commander.

590
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,433
Commander.

591
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,771
Two minutes until Lava Launch.

592
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,482
Authorized personnel only
on the launch site.

593
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,809
This is the quickest way
we can take you to the surface

594
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,195
so pay attention.

595
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,780
You'll be sitting on 200,000
tons of molten lava

596
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,824
and traveling at over
600 miles an hour,

597
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,036
so don't get out
until I give the all-clear.

598
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:05,662
Otherwise, it's...

599
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,831
Goodbye, Holly.
Rest in pieces.

600
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,666
No need to sound
so excited about it.

601
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,336
What can I say?
I just love science.

602
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,757
Um, Foaly?

603
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,301
Boy.

604
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,897
Lava Launch

605
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,524
in 30 seconds and counting.

606
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,568
Stay shielded
once you're up there.

607
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,571
- Total invisibility.
- Yes, Commander.

608
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,158
Magma flare in 12, 11...

609
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,701
The last thing we need

610
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,454
is a fairy sighting
on top of everything else.

611
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,830
Hello, Commander.

612
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,124
This is not the time.

613
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,419
We have an unidentified runner
on the surface.

614
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,088
Hold on
to your breakfast, Holly!

615
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,589
This is gonna be a bumpy ride!

616
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,211
Is this the best we can do?

617
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,678
Send in the daughter of
Beechwood Short, the traitor?

618
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,638
You're not fit to say his name.

619
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:13,814
Beechwood Short used his magic
to steal the Aculos from us,

620
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,232
which, need I remind you,

621
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,526
is the most precious artifact
in our civilization.

622
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,987
The Aculos was stolen
on your watch.

623
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:23,031
He has put our entire people
in danger and disappeared.

624
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,533
In my book, that's a traitor.

625
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,702
Get out, Cudgeon,
before I throw you out.

626
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,079
The executors
are watching you, Root.

627
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,583
And I am their eyes and ears.
And I see everything.

628
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,460
Carry on.

629
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,514
Ejecting you now.

630
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:56,148
Come on! Yes!

631
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,125
Artemis, I'm in position.

632
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,005
Domovoi, anything to report
from the Hill of Tara?

633
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,551
- Yes. I'm freezing.
- Understood.

634
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,262
Now, the oak tree's
where Dad saw that fairy,

635
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,472
and for my plan to work,

636
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,723
we need her.

637
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,391
And what exactly is your plan?

638
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,893
Keep watching.

639
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,144
Trust me.

640
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:35,521
Copy that.

641
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,567
Head east
towards Martina Franca.

642
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,238
Officer Short,
your orders are to

643
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,615
contain that thing
until Memory Wipe arrives.

644
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,075
Is that understood?

645
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,451
Yes, Commander.

646
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,345
Approaching Martina Franca.

647
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,102
Runner located.

648
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,479
It's a full-sized troll!

649
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,107
Pick on someone your own size!

650
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,512
I want a Time Freeze
around that thing

651
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:15,871
before anyone gets eaten.

652
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,122
Are you sure, Commander?

653
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,725
We'll need authorization
from the executors.

654
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,168
I'll take
full responsibility. Go!

655
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,003
Time Freeze capsule released!

656
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,018
Do not use magic on that human.

657
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,186
Do you read me?

658
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,437
She's hurt.

659
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,444
Come on.

660
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:48,612
Come on!

661
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,823
Go! Now!

662
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,497
Time Freeze loading.

663
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:01,083
Set focus
for interior paralysis only.

664
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,043
Leave these people alone!

665
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,014
Fire.

666
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,124
Retrieval.

667
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,252
Get that thing
back where it belongs

668
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:47,588
and mind-wipe all those humans

669
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,007
who think they've seen a fairy
or a troll.

670
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,481
L.E.P., begin withdrawal.

671
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,695
Good work, Officer Short.

672
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,488
Now get yourself home
immediately.

673
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:14,823
Yes, Commander.

674
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,451
That's an order.

675
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,749
Mind wipe complete.

676
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:25,542
Prepare to release Time Freeze.

677
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,706
Um, Commander Root,

678
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,459
it looks like Holly may be
taking a slight detour.

679
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,794
Officer Short.

680
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,004
Where are you going?

681
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,173
To clear my father's name!

682
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,050
I'll have her badge for this.

683
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,361
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

684
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,470
Shut up, Foaly,
or I'll have yours, too.

685
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,099
These are dangerous times.

686
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:23,851
I've lost a friend

687
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,370
and soon,
Artemis will begin to know

688
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,521
the rumors about me
and the thefts.

689
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,232
Is he ready for the truth?

690
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,900
That a darkness threatens

691
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,902
both the human
and the fairy worlds?

692
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,281
When Beechwood came to me,
I knew there was no choice.

693
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,741
The Aculos was being targeted.

694
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,119
In the wrong hands,
it would mean access

695
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,121
to the greatest spells
in fairy lore.

696
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:47,165
One could teleport armies,
wipe out life.

697
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,836
The wrong hands
are now very close.

698
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,964
They belong
to a brilliant fairy.

699
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,800
Perhaps the greatest
of them all.

700
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,760
But gone to the bad.

701
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,598
Name, Opal Koboi.

702
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,065
You are now approaching

703
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,192
the sacred Hill of Tara.

704
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,486
Coordinates 1-8-3-8-7.

705
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,655
Officer Short!
Return immediate...

706
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:19,990
Communication disabled.

707
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:32,669
Wow.

708
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,511
Dom. The fairies.

709
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,513
They're real.

710
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,853
Everything my father said
was true.

711
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,045
Reload. Quick! Quick!

712
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,214
Fire!

713
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:24,888
We got one.

714
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,367
Holly Short
just dropped off the grid.

715
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,517
I've lost sound and visual.

716
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:30,143
I warned her not to disobey me.

717
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,104
We can't rule out
an interception.

718
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,939
Give me her last coordinates.

719
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,859
She just arrived on
the Hill of Tara in Ireland.

720
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,068
I checked the maps.

721
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:40,115
The only human habitation
anywhere near it is...

722
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,280
Fowl Manor.

723
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,447
You know it?

724
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,033
Alert all personnel.

725
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,662
I'm launching
a full-scale recovery.

726
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,916
- All personnel, Commander?
- Land, sea, and air.

727
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,542
There's a fairy unaccounted
for in the real world.

728
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,961
If the humans see it,
we'll lose everything.

729
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:57,212
Dear me, Root.

730
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,589
Are you losing your touch?

731
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,757
Errant trolls?
Abducted fairies?

732
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:01,842
Whatever next?

733
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,027
If the executors find out
about this,

734
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,094
you'll be finished.

735
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,597
Get the four-leaf clover
out of here.

736
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,195
Not happy!

737
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,282
And what if
you look one in the eye?

738
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,450
Don't.

739
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,494
They're trained
in arts like telekinesis,

740
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,371
hypnosis, and mesmerism.

741
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:32,623
Correct.

742
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,374
So?

743
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,376
Defensive options?

744
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,171
Humans should wear
reflective glasses

745
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:42,174
in order to escape mind control.

746
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,342
Good.

747
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,260
What is unique about dwarves?

748
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,553
Besides digging,

749
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,222
they're master thieves
and pickpockets.

750
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:49,723
And why?

751
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,034
They're obsessed with treasure

752
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,476
and can't resist
searching for it.

753
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:58,815
Where am I?

754
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,192
I'm impressed.

755
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,693
You speak English.

756
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,460
Speak English?
Of course I speak English.

757
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,729
I thought you might be hungry.

758
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,074
Look, I don't know
what fairies eat,

759
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,325
but I thought maybe salad?

760
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,535
Yeah, whatever.

761
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,496
I bet you have beautiful eyes.

762
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,957
I wish I could see them.

763
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:16,291
That's not going to work.

764
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,626
We've got protection.

765
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,273
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

766
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,379
You're part of the plan.

767
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:22,005
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

768
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,382
You're just a child.

769
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,259
Welcome to Fowl Manor,
Officer Short.

770
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,886
- How do you know my name?
- It's on your helmet.

771
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,263
But it's in Gnomish.

772
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,181
Correct.
I've read all about you.

773
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,724
You've what?

774
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,686
I'm here to officially
invite you into my home.

775
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,646
Invite me? You just shot me!

776
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,565
You must now do
whatever I demand.

777
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,692
You'll have to
keep me here forever.

778
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,443
If that's what you want.

779
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,945
You'll never get away with this.

780
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,572
My people will come for me.

781
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,784
That's what I hoped you'd say.

782
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:52,870
This isn't over.

783
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,496
You expect us to believe

784
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,331
he did something this dangerous?

785
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,668
He captured a living fairy.
What do you think?

786
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,920
Try to imagine
if humans suddenly found out

787
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:03,484
there was a world
of magical creatures

788
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:04,673
living beneath them.

789
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,550
Most human beings
are afraid of gluten.

790
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,594
How do you think
they'd handle goblins?

791
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,598
Artemis wanted the Aculos
to save his father's life.

792
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,183
And at last, his master plan

793
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,684
was starting to fall into place.

794
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,269
He had his first piece.

795
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:18,520
Bait.

796
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,814
But now,
a storm was coming his way.

797
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,816
And the fate
of both of our worlds

798
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,861
was in the hands
of young Artemis Fowl.

799
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,166
Artemis. Dom.

800
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,169
It's like
the whole world is ending.

801
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:43,629
The fairies are doing it.

802
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,255
They're creating a Time Freeze.

803
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:46,757
I beg your pardon?

804
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,342
It's a kind of temporal vacuum

805
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,761
that they create
so they can operate

806
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,262
unseen by the human eye.

807
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,890
I read about it
in Dad's journal.

808
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,225
It's formidable.

809
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,727
Einstein and Hawking were right.

810
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,437
Time is bending all over.

811
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,189
Anything could happen now.

812
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,774
Anything's possible.

813
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,025
And while it holds,

814
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,860
the perfect conditions
for an attack.

815
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,278
Exactly.

816
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:15,661
We just picked up
your friends arriving.

817
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:16,995
Can't wait to meet them.

818
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:18,539
You won't even see them.

819
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,624
Whatever you're planning
will fail.

820
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,376
Fairies do not negotiate.

821
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,255
You can't win!

822
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:27,923
We'll see about that.

823
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,555
Sweet.

824
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:36,682
Incredible.

825
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,731
En garde!

826
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,568
You are so dead.

827
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,528
The pair of you.

828
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,240
Foaly,
I need that Time Freeze now.

829
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,575
Exterior only.

830
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,285
I need the inside to be alive.

831
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,786
I have to talk to that kid.

832
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,163
Receiver dishes
in position, check.

833
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,614
Time Freeze successful!

834
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,294
Top of the mornin'.

835
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:35,217
They're coming for her.

836
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,095
Artemis, do you really think
this is going to work?

837
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,221
Who knows?

838
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,265
I'm going to need the suit.

839
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:51,775
Send in the advance team.

840
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:52,943
Yes, Commander.

841
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,114
Capture only.

842
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:59,825
We need the humans unharmed.

843
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,411
We scare them.
We do not kill them.

844
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,787
I want them alive.

845
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:07,207
Scared, Artemis?

846
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,792
A little bit.

847
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,628
But I prefer scared to dead,
if possible.

848
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:12,963
I agree.

849
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,590
If possible.

850
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,425
- What are they doing?
- Unarmed?

851
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,051
Against all of us?

852
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,136
Take the shot!

853
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,262
Stop them!

854
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,625
They have Officer Short's
weapon.

855
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,813
Behind you, Dom!

856
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,197
No!

857
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,116
Shoot the Time Freeze capsule!

858
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,202
Take the shot!

859
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,380
He's
destabilized the Time Freeze.

860
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,049
How long do we have?

861
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,259
I can try to patch it,
but it's not going to hold!

862
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,470
This is serious.
Whatever you're going to do,

863
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:02,763
you need to do it fast.

864
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,768
Send in someone to negotiate.

865
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,937
You have five minutes.

866
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:11,104
No.

867
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:18,111
Well, it appears
your clever little son

868
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,197
has kidnapped a fairy.

869
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,200
He has your flair
for the dramatic.

870
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,285
Why are you doing this?

871
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,705
Why?
It's very simple.

872
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,207
Revenge.

873
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,419
Not only did your people
wage war on mine,

874
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:37,756
considered yourself superior
in every way,

875
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,883
mocked us, reviled us,

876
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,261
dismissed us
as the little people,

877
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,555
but as soon as we were gone,

878
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:47,975
you reduced us further
to silly stories.

879
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,687
To have people laugh at us,
or to frighten the children.

880
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:53,313
You can't win.

881
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:55,524
You underestimate your people
and mine.

882
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,693
Fairies and humans

883
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,611
are incapable of friendship.

884
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,446
Incapable of coexistence.

885
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,491
With the Aculos,
I will rise to the surface

886
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,493
then release my army
to take over the Earth

887
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,287
and own both worlds

888
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,540
and systematically wipe out
all of mankind.

889
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:14,668
Then, I will restore fairies
to their rightful place

890
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:17,212
as humanity crumbles beneath us.

891
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,423
Some said I was mad.

892
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,175
They wouldn't listen to me.

893
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,342
Guess what?

894
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,304
They're listening now.

895
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,687
My name is Commander Root.

896
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,523
I invite you into my house.

897
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,318
Nice try.

898
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm here to negotiate.

899
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,031
Who's in charge here?

900
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,157
I am.

901
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,867
You're only ten years old.

902
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,286
Twelve. How old are you?

903
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:51,997
If you must know,

904
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:56,251
I'm going to be 803 in May.

905
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:57,669
What's your name?

906
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:58,962
Artemis Fowl.

907
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:05,677
So, that explains it.

908
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:08,931
You Fowls have been giving us
trouble for centuries.

909
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,767
Where's your thieving father
these days?

910
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:14,019
I wouldn't worry about that.

911
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,813
Now, listen carefully,
Artemis Fowl.

912
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:21,652
Unless you release
Officer Short immediately,

913
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,487
I'll destroy this house
and everyone in it.

914
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,865
And I will expose
your existence to the world.

915
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,284
You can't.
You're in a Time Freeze.

916
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:30,953
You can't get out.

917
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,080
But only for another 27 minutes.

918
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,207
Commander, here are my terms.

919
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,628
Bring me the Aculos,
and Officer Short goes free.

920
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,046
I beg your pardon?

921
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:42,631
You heard me. The Aculos.

922
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:44,383
In one of those pots.

923
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,301
From under a rainbow, I presume.

924
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:51,139
I warn you,
we do not pay ransoms.

925
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,559
We never have,
and we never will.

926
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,644
You might just want
to reconsider that.

927
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,188
I'll give you 15 minutes.

928
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,899
And in case you're thinking
of storming the house,

929
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:04,069
no fairies are allowed
to enter it while I'm alive.

930
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:08,866
As you say.
While you're alive.

931
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,204
Who is this child?

932
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,290
I think he said
he was Artemis Fowl, Jr.

933
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:17,541
Shut up, Foaly.

934
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,085
Can't anyone ask a rhetorical
question around here?

935
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:22,355
But he's going to find out
we don't even have the Aculos

936
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,299
and we can't storm the house.
That's fairy rules.

937
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,633
He never said anything
about dwarves.

938
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,178
Remember what I said about
not underestimating the kid?

939
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,305
Well, here's exactly why.

940
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:33,891
The next piece of his plan
was set in motion.

941
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,934
Knowing the fairies
couldn't enter Fowl Manor,

942
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,520
he forced their hand and set
the stage for the entrance

943
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,273
of the true hero of our tale.

944
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:44,651
Well, if you ask me, that is.

945
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,447
Get me Mulch Diggums.

946
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,077
The kid's plan
was fiendishly clever.

947
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,954
He just had to get me
in the house

948
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,290
because he knew the truth
about dwarves.

949
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,793
We can't resist treasure,

950
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,421
which is what brought me back
to this cozy little jail cell.

951
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,798
See, this was my third time
in Howler's Peak,

952
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,092
the worst prison in Haven City.

953
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:12,095
My first time in,
I did 164 years.

954
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:14,556
But this time,
I came with music,

955
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,725
courtesy of Officer Holly Short.

956
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,040
1984, Foreigner!

957
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,959
It's a real classic.

958
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,753
You know,
if you like human music.

959
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:47,631
You seem like
more of a glam kind of guy.

960
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:49,591
What are you looking at, dwarf?

961
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,260
Your eyes.

962
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,849
Just wondering
what thoughts lie behind

963
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,017
those two impenetrable windows.

964
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:04,940
So, you like eating dirt.

965
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:10,070
Well, I don't know
if "like" is the right term.

966
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,905
Tunneling is kinda something
I have to do.

967
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,283
It's an occupational hazard.

968
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,578
Just don't stand behind you
while you're doing it, right?

969
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,671
So, this just got awkward.

970
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,923
Are you laughin' at me, dwarf?

971
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,175
At you? No.

972
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,968
I was just following
their social cues.

973
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,219
Because I'm not laughing.

974
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,387
Yeah, I can tell.

975
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,097
Wow.

976
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:39,850
Guards.

977
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,393
They're really
understaffed here.

978
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,187
Hi.

979
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:48,025
Do you like fire, too?

980
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,444
No. Not so much. That's...

981
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:54,573
So you know,
no dwarf really likes fire.

982
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,158
Careful, careful.

983
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,202
We could all go up in flames.

984
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,369
Not us.

985
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:02,372
Our skin
is completely fireproof.

986
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,583
That's right, isn't it?
Forgot about that.

987
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,961
Your skin may be fireproof,

988
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,380
but what about your brain?

989
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:16,637
Mulch Diggums!

990
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,264
Commander Root wants to see you.

991
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,391
Exceptional timing.

992
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:26,939
Goodbye, gentlemen.

993
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,406
So, I just spoke to your boss.

994
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,699
I think she got the message.

995
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,785
How are you
expecting this to end?

996
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,328
With me getting what I want.

997
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:42,913
Which is what, exactly?

998
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,414
My father's safe return.

999
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,709
This has nothing to do
with your father.

1000
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,169
Look at you with that grin.

1001
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,380
Thinking you're
outsmarting everyone

1002
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:53,799
in your little suit
and sunglasses.

1003
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:56,093
You're enjoying all this.

1004
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,428
You think it's a game.

1005
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:59,555
Game?

1006
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:00,973
My father was kidnapped.

1007
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,891
My father is dead.

1008
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,769
Can I trust you?

1009
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:07,938
You'll have to.
You have no choice.

1010
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,610
How did he die?

1011
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:15,779
It was on the Hill of Tara.

1012
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,657
He was ambushed
by one of our kind

1013
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,995
because he'd stolen
something called the Aculos.

1014
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,582
I've read in my father's
journals about the Aculos.

1015
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,169
About a fairy
who swore to protect it.

1016
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,753
A fairy named Beechwood.

1017
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,756
Beechwood Short was my father.

1018
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:39,761
He knew how dangerous
the Aculos can be.

1019
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,972
It can open portals
between worlds.

1020
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,349
A skeleton key
for the whole universe.

1021
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:45,726
He hid it.

1022
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:49,021
And for that, some say
that he was a criminal.

1023
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:50,731
That's what they say
about my dad.

1024
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,776
But you know it's not true.

1025
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:03,911
That hurt!

1026
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,588
Artemis, it looks like
we've got another visitor.

1027
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,720
Commander, Time Freeze
integrity down to 60%.

1028
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:25,849
Understood.

1029
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,726
Hold it together, Foaly.

1030
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:32,689
Mulch.

1031
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,609
This is a one-time offer.

1032
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,986
Fifty years off your sentence

1033
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,988
if you'll dig your way
into Fowl Manor

1034
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,615
and bring out Officer Short.

1035
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:43,367
Commander Root,

1036
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:44,993
do you mind if I call you...

1037
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:47,454
I actually don't know
your first name.

1038
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,289
Let me guess. Britney.

1039
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,416
I'm way off, aren't I?

1040
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:53,293
It appears to me

1041
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,587
like you've got a big problem
on your hands.

1042
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,713
But?

1043
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,633
Has anyone ever told you
you're like David Bowie

1044
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,593
if David Bowie were a fairy?

1045
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,513
So, essentially,
you're David Bowie.

1046
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:06,241
Do you think
the humans will ever

1047
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,474
find out he was one of us?

1048
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,142
Anyway,

1049
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:12,187
50 years off my sentence
just isn't gonna cut it here.

1050
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:14,815
I know what you want.
I can't give you that.

1051
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,692
Come on, Root.

1052
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,193
Please.

1053
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,112
I just...
I just want to be small.

1054
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:24,032
I just want to be normal,
like the rest of my kind.

1055
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,827
To be accepted.

1056
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:30,706
You fairies got magic
coming out of your ears.

1057
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:32,040
What have I got?

1058
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,751
Three, four feet I don't need.

1059
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,604
Look, a giant dwarf is exactly
what I need right now.

1060
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:37,754
What I need right now.

1061
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,424
A big, fast, hungry tunneler

1062
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,426
who'll dig their way
into that house.

1063
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:44,011
It's your choice.

1064
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:47,347
Either bring out Officer Short
or get back to jail.

1065
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,100
Listen to the two of us

1066
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:51,351
grunting at each other

1067
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:54,062
like a pair of hippos
with a throat infection.

1068
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,357
A criminal?

1069
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,401
A criminal.
That's what you think I am?

1070
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,614
I am so much more
than a criminal.

1071
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,994
Um, technically, most of what
I do is criminal activity,

1072
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:11,371
but I'm also an artist.

1073
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,792
You're picking my pocket.

1074
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:18,879
Okay. A hundred years
off my sentence

1075
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,282
and a single cell
with no goblins.

1076
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,965
Single cell and 55 years.

1077
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,133
- Seventy-five.
- Sixty.

1078
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,052
- Seventy-four.
- Done. Officers!

1079
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,638
You reading me, Mulch?

1080
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,806
Loud and clear, horsey.

1081
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,769
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

1082
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,439
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

1083
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,193
Everybody,

1084
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,903
stand back.

1085
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,284
It's feeding time.

1086
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:15,602
I'm in.

1087
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,107
I know that sound.

1088
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:21,775
Mulch Diggums.

1089
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:27,239
Mulch,

1090
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:28,949
I'm switching
your iris-cam to X-ray.

1091
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,868
That's good.
You do you, Foaly.

1092
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,203
You might feel a slight pinch.

1093
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,164
- You son of a...
- Sorry!

1094
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,292
What would your parents be?

1095
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,794
We have a visitor.

1096
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:42,421
What is it?

1097
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,924
It's in the portrait gallery.

1098
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:49,052
It's like a really, really

1099
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,637
big dwarf.

1100
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:55,434
Yes.

1101
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:56,977
Right on schedule.

1102
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,479
Well, if I was
gonna be manipulated,

1103
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,148
might as well be by the best.

1104
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,902
And make no mistake,
the kid is the best.

1105
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:08,363
House marks the spot.

1106
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,368
What have we here?

1107
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:28,175
The TXTL 5000.

1108
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:29,885
He's discovered a safe.

1109
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:31,220
Let him open it.

1110
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:32,888
That's exactly what I want.

1111
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,396
We meet again.

1112
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,943
So, they've sent in a dwarf.

1113
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,694
Look, I need your help.

1114
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,532
Listen, if I let you out,

1115
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,618
will you promise not to
take command of my brain?

1116
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:56,036
I want nothing to do
with that brain.

1117
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,550
And...

1118
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,141
Bingo!

1119
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:20,811
Temperamental.

1120
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,230
You've evolved.

1121
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:25,732
But so have I.

1122
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,404
Sounds like you're not
the only one opening locks.

1123
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,447
By the way, if you run,

1124
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,908
I will expose your existence
to the world.

1125
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:38,537
You are my guest.

1126
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:42,040
I invited you in.
The rules are clear.

1127
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:45,878
They are, but you think
you can trust me?

1128
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:50,966
Now you can trust me.

1129
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,968
Fair enough.

1130
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,636
Let's find that dwarf.

1131
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:58,265
Eight new
motion-sensitive tumblers.

1132
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,100
You devil.

1133
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,772
It can't be.

1134
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:08,233
Holy moly!

1135
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,286
Step back, Mr. Diggums.

1136
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,414
It's real.
It's perfect.

1137
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:23,582
The Aculos.

1138
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:27,169
The most powerful treasure
in the fairy world.

1139
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:37,054
Don't.

1140
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,224
It will kill you if you use it.

1141
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,559
If any human does.

1142
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:45,938
I don't need to use it.

1143
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:48,504
Because my bargaining position
just got a whole lot stronger.

1144
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:51,235
The fairies outside mustn't
get to hear that we have this.

1145
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,529
I'm sorry, human,

1146
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,156
but they already know.

1147
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,585
There's been a development?

1148
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,170
They found the Aculos.

1149
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:11,839
As I expected.

1150
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,298
In Fowl Manor.

1151
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:14,925
You know what to do.

1152
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,051
It's risky.

1153
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,262
Root has our entire army
at her disposal.

1154
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,639
It's quite simple, Cudgeon.

1155
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,141
If you wish to survive

1156
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:25,811
and thrive
in my brave new world,

1157
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,230
then you will intervene now.

1158
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,069
Commander!

1159
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,281
This Time Freeze
is seriously unstable.

1160
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,241
This may not hold.

1161
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:43,704
We've lost one!

1162
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,881
Commander Root,

1163
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,984
you are hereby officially
relieved of your command

1164
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:57,634
on authorization
of the executors.

1165
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,928
You're making a mistake,
Cudgeon.

1166
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,973
My only mistake was not
doing this a long time ago.

1167
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,727
With the Aculos in play,
the game has changed.

1168
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:09,354
Time for a little direct action,

1169
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:10,689
don't you think?

1170
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:12,482
Let me show you how it's done.

1171
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:14,358
Knock it off!

1172
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,320
Mistake.

1173
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,198
I mean, really, big mistake.

1174
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,245
This should wrap things up.

1175
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,373
Recognize our new recruit?

1176
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:33,337
We fed it a little potion
of nettles and wasp juice.

1177
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:35,881
Everything trolls
are allergic to.

1178
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:40,844
It's made it twice as strong
and 10 times as mad.

1179
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:49,436
D'arvit!

1180
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:01,114
That can't be good.

1181
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:06,662
Go!

1182
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:07,829
Come on, let's go!

1183
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,039
Come on!

1184
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,003
Gods alive.

1185
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,171
What is that?

1186
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:19,925
A creature that consumes
humans in 2.97 seconds

1187
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:22,052
and fairies in less than one.

1188
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,428
Get ready.

1189
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,264
This is going all the way.

1190
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:30,477
I'll need my gun.

1191
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,954
Jam all magic in the house.

1192
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:51,211
But Officer Short,
she'll need hers to survive.

1193
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:53,041
Her father used his magic
against us.

1194
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,711
I'm not making the same
mistake twice. Do as I say.

1195
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,383
I didn't read much on trolls.

1196
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:02,718
Anything I should look out for?

1197
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:03,802
The teeth.

1198
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:07,556
Good to know.

1199
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:16,023
All magic
in the house is now jammed.

1200
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:20,652
Everything okay?

1201
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:23,989
Sure.

1202
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,628
Help! I'm stuck!
Get me out!

1203
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,091
I'll distract him!

1204
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:53,602
Help! I'm stuck!

1205
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:56,230
Mulch, help.

1206
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,651
Juliet, look out!

1207
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:05,155
It's okay, I've got this!
Juliet, run!

1208
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,657
Run, Juliet! Run!

1209
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:08,534
Come and get some,
you big meanie!

1210
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,581
Help!

1211
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:15,707
Quick! Quick!

1212
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:16,834
I'm reaching!

1213
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:17,960
Gotcha!

1214
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,471
Artemis!

1215
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,101
No! No!

1216
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:43,902
Mulch!

1217
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,612
I could use a little help!

1218
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,786
Good.

1219
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,162
Hi!

1220
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,206
Okay.

1221
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:58,458
Let me just put this away.

1222
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:04,173
Artemis, run!

1223
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:05,619
I'll see you guys
on the balcony!

1224
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,012
Juliet! Jump!

1225
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,598
Holly!

1226
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:25,277
Dom!

1227
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,403
Holly!

1228
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,779
Holly! Holly!

1229
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:34,328
Dom!

1230
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:39,791
Let go!

1231
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:49,051
D'arvit!

1232
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:56,725
Artemis! Jump!

1233
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,484
Help!

1234
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,653
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1235
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,116
Juliet, run!

1236
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,048
Dom!

1237
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,176
Pull!

1238
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:58,036
Holly, look out!

1239
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:03,625
I'll get the gun!

1240
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:12,634
Artemis!

1241
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,854
Dom! No!

1242
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,901
My.

1243
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,821
Go!

1244
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,823
Get help!
Try the phones again!

1245
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:35,908
Now!

1246
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,703
Domovoi? Dom?

1247
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:50,797
The Time Freeze is collapsing.

1248
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,466
I can't hold it any longer.

1249
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:54,092
There goes another fairy!

1250
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:10,609
Help him!

1251
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:12,694
I can't.
They've blocked my magic.

1252
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,404
Artemis,

1253
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:17,616
there's nothing
I can do for him.

1254
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,911
Hold on, buddy.

1255
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:22,412
In kendo,

1256
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,624
we call it kiri oroshi.

1257
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,544
- "The fatal blow."
- No.

1258
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,505
You did great back there.

1259
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,550
Really. All the Butlers
will be proud of you.

1260
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,636
Goodbye, my friend.

1261
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,283
May the road rise up
to meet you.

1262
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:02,661
May the wind
be always at your back.

1263
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:06,415
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

1264
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:12,713
May the rains fall soft
upon your fields.

1265
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,424
And until we meet again,

1266
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:18,260
may a friend be always near.

1267
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:23,322
No sign of
further activity in the house.

1268
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,868
Five more minutes,
then we're going in.

1269
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,018
Request permission to

1270
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:27,328
restore
Officer Short's magic, sir.

1271
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:28,478
Permission denied.

1272
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:29,938
It could save her life!

1273
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,899
She's a traitor,
just like her father.

1274
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:33,233
No, she's one of us!

1275
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,401
Commander Root.

1276
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:37,571
I didn't make you captain
for nothing.

1277
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,533
Don't you dare!

1278
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,910
Squad!

1279
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:45,162
Unblock magic!

1280
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:53,378
Come on!

1281
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,422
Artemis, look out!

1282
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:58,800
Come on.

1283
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,553
Come on, Domovoi!

1284
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,056
You're back!

1285
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:06,892
Holly brought you back!

1286
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,567
I didn't cry, did I?

1287
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:19,738
Little bit.

1288
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:27,454
The Time Freeze is
gonna collapse any second now.

1289
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:29,873
All L.E.P. personnel,
evacuate.

1290
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:34,586
Mulch!

1291
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,713
The Aculos.
Do you still have it?

1292
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,090
Yeah, sure.

1293
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:39,341
Right there.

1294
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:44,012
Good.

1295
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,139
I have a plan.

1296
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:53,522
That's it.

1297
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,190
Temporal convergence
at maximum force.

1298
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,150
Time bend start now.

1299
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,443
Distortion, elastication,

1300
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:00,237
and space grabs coming your way.

1301
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:01,530
For your own sakes,

1302
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:03,323
get out of there now
and get home safe.

1303
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,784
This Time Freeze is gonna blow!

1304
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:21,967
Officer Short!

1305
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:23,760
Get out of there now.

1306
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,555
Leave the humans.
Save yourself!

1307
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,566
Artemis, what's happening?

1308
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,109
Take cover!

1309
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:56,919
Whoa!

1310
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:58,253
Watch out!

1311
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,900
Come on,
we've got to get out of here!

1312
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:01,924
We gotta get out...

1313
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,759
See you on the other side!

1314
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:05,219
Mulch, get out of here!

1315
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:10,599
Everybody!

1316
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,309
Take cover!

1317
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:14,061
Whoa!

1318
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,528
Holly, this is your last chance.

1319
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:23,862
You can't save him.

1320
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:25,864
Just get out of there now.

1321
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,227
And now,
the final piece of the plan.

1322
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:57,121
The Time Freeze is ended.
They're gone.

1323
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:58,146
Did we win?

1324
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,565
Not yet. I can't give this

1325
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:00,983
to Opal Koboi.
It's too powerful.

1326
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,168
Then what are you waiting for?

1327
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:03,672
Use its magic
to get your father back.

1328
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:05,404
- I can't. Not yet.
- I don't understand.

1329
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,447
This holds a power
no human can access.

1330
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:08,675
It's their source of magic,

1331
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,299
as important to them
as the sun is to us.

1332
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:11,410
You have to try.

1333
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:12,817
I thought I could, but I can't.

1334
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,830
Holly said if any human
uses it, they'll die.

1335
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,331
We're running out of time.

1336
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:18,250
Artemis, it's too dangerous.

1337
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:20,294
Exactly.
It's useless in my hands.

1338
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:21,795
But not in mine.

1339
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:23,172
You're late.

1340
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,300
You know I'm breaking
every rule in the book.

1341
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:28,594
You like to break rules.

1342
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,053
You can talk.

1343
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:32,681
Let's make a trade.

1344
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,349
The Aculos for my father.

1345
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,145
How do I know I can trust you?

1346
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,981
My father used to say,

1347
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:43,400
"A friend's eye
is a good mirror."

1348
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:45,986
Are we friends,

1349
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,905
Artemis Fowl?

1350
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:51,241
We are.

1351
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,705
Forever friends.

1352
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,251
We need to hurry.

1353
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,931
Your time is up.

1354
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:17,267
The young genius Artemis Fowl

1355
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:20,270
has failed his beloved father.

1356
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,316
Say hello to Beechwood for me.

1357
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:32,157
I don't even know
that this will work.

1358
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,077
You have to try.

1359
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:39,581
Carry me always.

1360
01:15:41,124 --> 01:15:43,293
Carry me well.

1361
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:47,548
I am thy teacher
of herb and spell.

1362
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:52,135
I am thy link to power arcane.

1363
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:57,724
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1364
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,363
Die, Fowl!

1365
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:15,993
To power arcane.

1366
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:20,539
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1367
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:23,584
Carry me well. Carry me well.

1368
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:27,921
Forget me, magic shall wane.

1369
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:35,679
Carry me well.

1370
01:16:57,326 --> 01:16:58,785
Did it work?

1371
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:00,412
Did you bring him back?

1372
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:02,706
I don't know.

1373
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:15,636
He can't be. Please.

1374
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,558
Dad!

1375
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,272
Dad!

1376
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,334
Artemis...

1377
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,671
I'm so sorry.

1378
01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:52,381
It's over.

1379
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,550
I've lost him, haven't I?

1380
01:17:56,426 --> 01:17:57,719
Artemis!

1381
01:17:58,637 --> 01:17:59,805
Did you hear that?

1382
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,767
Dad! Dad!

1383
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:07,980
Dad!

1384
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,357
Dad!

1385
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,152
Dad!

1386
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,446
Artemis.

1387
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:25,038
No!

1388
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:32,838
How?

1389
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:34,506
How did you save me, son?

1390
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:36,675
I just followed the story.

1391
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:39,720
With a little help
from a friend.

1392
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,514
Dad,

1393
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,600
meet Officer Holly Short,

1394
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,894
daughter of Beechwood Short.

1395
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:55,235
Your father was a great man
and a dear friend.

1396
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:58,989
He brought me the Aculos

1397
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:00,991
because there are forces
in your world

1398
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,619
who wanted its power
for themselves.

1399
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:06,705
So, he was trying to protect it?

1400
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:07,998
Yes.

1401
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:10,292
Yes, yes. He was.

1402
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:12,085
And he did.

1403
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,545
With his life.

1404
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,924
Your father was a hero, Holly.

1405
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:19,384
Just like you.

1406
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:23,722
He, gave me this list.

1407
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:27,184
It's a list of names
that I can't even pronounce.

1408
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:28,560
These are Opal's accomplices.

1409
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,562
We were looking for them
when I was captured.

1410
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,648
They're the ones
you'll want to investigate.

1411
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,651
I'm sorry for your loss.

1412
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,110
Thank you very much.

1413
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:42,824
- It's so good to see you.
- I am not going to cry.

1414
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:44,576
I'm not going to cry.

1415
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,954
The Aculos is safe at last,

1416
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,497
now that we know our enemies,

1417
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:32,207
thanks to you, Holly.

1418
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:39,840
Quite the day.

1419
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,383
Yes, Commander.

1420
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,223
Curb that maverick streak in you

1421
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:51,185
and you'll make
a decent officer someday.

1422
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,395
Thank you, Commander.

1423
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,785
This place needs
fairies like you.

1424
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:17,503
Our world has never been
so much in danger.

1425
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:22,341
It's not perfect, Holly.

1426
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,928
But it's ours,
it's a light to guide us,

1427
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,347
and it's worth fighting for.

1428
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,475
I want you to investigate

1429
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:34,144
every name
on your father's list.

1430
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,188
Me?

1431
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:39,274
Well, who else am I talking to?

1432
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,943
Nobody else, Commander, just me.

1433
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:43,862
- Go on.
- I'm going to...

1434
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:46,323
You won't regret...
I will not...

1435
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,699
- Go on.
- I'll just go.

1436
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:10,722
Here we go, Dad.

1437
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:24,361
- Nice work, Holly!
- Well done, Holly!

1438
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,037
All right, team,

1439
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,789
here we go.

1440
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,748
This is a community
still coming to terms

1441
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,791
with these stunning revelations.

1442
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,460
The family has lived
in the house

1443
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,213
for generations
and is well-known locally,

1444
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:27,549
but there's a sense of real
shock here that Artemis Fowl,

1445
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,385
who neighbors describe
as quiet and...

1446
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:32,638
It would appear we've garnered

1447
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:33,931
quite a bit of interest.

1448
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:35,015
Not ideal.

1449
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:36,266
The media?

1450
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,435
I have someone
working on that right now.

1451
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:40,312
I expected you would.

1452
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,898
These are for you, son.

1453
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:44,399
Just don't forget to wash it

1454
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:46,026
before you bring it back, okay?

1455
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,362
Where are we going?

1456
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:49,696
To finish this.

1457
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:51,406
You think I'm ready?

1458
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,116
I know you're ready.

1459
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:55,994
First, I have a call to make.

1460
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:16,515
You failed, Opal.

1461
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:18,851
You were wrong about my father.

1462
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:22,437
About Beechwood.
About everything.

1463
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:24,481
And now...

1464
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,192
we're coming for you.

1465
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,113
You think you can beat me?

1466
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,490
You have no idea the world

1467
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:36,368
that you have just entered, boy.

1468
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:39,329
Just who do you think you are?

1469
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:41,331
I'm Artemis Fowl...

1470
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:45,460
and I'm a criminal mastermind.

1471
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,331
What an extraordinary ending

1472
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:24,082
to your remarkable fairy tale.

1473
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:25,351
But let's get back
to the thief, shall we?

1474
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,561
He will be brought to justice,

1475
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:28,545
and you will not leave here
until you assist us.

1476
01:25:29,213 --> 01:25:30,964
You really don't believe
any of it?

1477
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:32,317
The only thing
in that fanciful tale

1478
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,967
I did believe
is that you can be bought.

1479
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,195
So, let us offer you a deal.

1480
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:36,762
Help us apprehend
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

1481
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:38,597
and then you'll walk.

1482
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,057
Tsk.

1483
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,268
Or perhaps I offer you a deal?

1484
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:46,271
I walk out on my own,

1485
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:49,483
and you leave
the Fowls alone forever.

1486
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:52,528
And why would we ever do that?

1487
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:55,531
So that you can
all sleep at night,

1488
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:59,868
knowing that the fairy tales
you tell your kids

1489
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,454
remain beautiful dreams,

1490
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:08,126
and not living nightmares.

1491
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:12,047
And the next time
you see the Fowls,

1492
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:15,551
be sure to thank them
for protecting us all.

1493
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:17,302
They keep the peace.

1494
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,054
Don't ever forget it.

1495
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:22,724
That's why Artemis
set up my arrest.

1496
01:26:22,808 --> 01:26:24,184
That's why I'm here.

1497
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:27,229
He figured
you'd have to believe me.

1498
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:35,779
Alert the guards.

1499
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,869
I hope you don't get squeamish.

1500
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,667
Lockdown!

1501
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:50,377
Immediate lockdown.

1502
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,882
A tracking device.

1503
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:57,885
Designed by the kid.

1504
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:01,972
Clap your hands
if you believe in fairies.

1505
01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:08,187
That's my ride!

1506
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:10,022
Lockdown!

1507
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:11,940
Get back here,
you filthy little dwarf!

1508
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:14,902
Dwarfus Giaganticus!

1509
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:24,870
Don't mind me, I got this.

1510
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,293
Are you ready
to get back to work?

1511
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,587
I thought you'd never ask.

1512
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:36,924
We have
some unfinished business.

1513
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:40,052
I love my job!

1514
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,198
Okay.

1515
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:03,158
Let's go.
