00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,078
(TAPPING ON MIC)

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,915
RICKY GERVAIS: Testing. Testing.

3
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,470
Testing over the credits.
The credits that no one cares about.

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,259
"Ooh, we’re the business people.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,309
"Ooh, we want our credit
before the film starts, 'cause... "

6
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,597
Anyway.

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,896
The story you’re about to see
takes place in a world

8
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,271
where the human race has never evolved
the ability to tell a lie.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,352
This is a typical town in that world.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,982
As you can see, people have jobs and cars
and houses and families,

11
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,825
but everyone tells the absolute truth.

12
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,663
There’s no such thing
as deceit or flattery or fiction.

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,907
People say exactly what they think,

14
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,414
and sometimes that can come across
as a bit harsh.

15
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,086
But they've got no choice in the matter.
It's their nature.

16
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,004
Look, I'm not coming in to work today.

17
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,466
No, I'm not sick. I just hate it there.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,170
Oh, your baby is so ugly. It's like a little rat.

19
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,092
Wow! I just took one of the biggest poops
of my whole life.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,266
What are you ordering?

21
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,596
GERVAIS: So if you're a chubby,
little loser like this guy, for example,

22
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,352
that's Mark Bellison, by the way,

23
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,901
then you're all alone
and at the bottom of the pile.

24
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,196
But later on in the story,
his luck's gonna change

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,490
when he tells the world's first lie.

26
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,068
He doesn't even know it himself yet.

27
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,279
So look forward to that.

28
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,993
(EXHALES)

29
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,131
Don't blow this.

30
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,139
-Hi!
-Hi.

31
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,689
You're early.

32
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,563
I was just masturbating.

33
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,270
That makes me think of your vagina.

34
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,108
I'm Mark. How are you?

35
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,612
A little frustrated at the moment.

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,821
Also, equally depressed and pessimistic
about our date tonight.

37
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,455
Sure.

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,453
I'm Anna. Come on in.

39
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,000
Um... Just wait there.

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,627
I need to finish getting ready.

41
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,549
While doing that,
I might realise I'm still horny

42
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,593
and try to finish masturbating
without you hearing.

43
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,091
(CHUCKLES)

44
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,025
I feel awkward now about being early.

45
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,398
ANNA: Yeah,
I'm disappointed that you're early

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,525
and not really looking forward
to tonight in general,

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,607
but the thought of being alone
the rest of my life

48
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,489
scares both my mother and me equally.

49
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,948
Sure.

50
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,128
Oh.

51
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm thinking you've started masturbating,
'cause it's like it's too quiet.

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:47,007
And you said you were gonna
try and do it without me hearing.

53
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,515
I'm worried the restaurant I've picked
isn't expensive enough for you.

54
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,276
It's all I can afford

55
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,103
in my situation.

56
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,031
I know I'm in my 40s,

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,618
but I haven't got any
financial assets to speak of.

58
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,331
Also, my boss said
he's probably gonna fire me this week.

59
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,214
Wow!

60
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,707
I just masturbated.

61
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,426
That makes me horny.
I hope this date ends in sex.

62
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,753
I don't find you attractive.

63
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,963
Oh!

64
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,173
Shall we?

65
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,929
Yeah.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,011
-After you.
-Thanks.

67
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,513
(SIGHS)

68
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,861
-This is not as nice as I remember it.
-What are we gonna talk about?

69
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,109
Hi. I'm threatened by you.

70
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,034
Mark Bellison. Table for two.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,202
Of course. Come with me.

72
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,617
MARK: Thank you.

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,539
Thank you.

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,710
-Plastic.
-I'm very embarrassed I work here.

75
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,166
-Hi.
-Hi.

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,592
-Hello.
-And you're very pretty.

77
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,048
That only makes this worse.

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,380
(CLEARS THROAT) Can I get
you two started on some drinks?

79
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,340
-ANNA: Yes.
-I'll have a Budweiser, please.

80
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,426
I'll have a mango margarita,

81
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,059
and I'll probably have three more drinks
by the end of the night.

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,560
-Your sister?
-No.

83
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,267
-Daughter?
-No.

84
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,477
She's way out of your league.

85
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,606
(STAMMERS)

86
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,107
Thank you.

87
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,988
Shall I ask you
some questions about yourself?

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,243
Yes.

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,332
How do you spend your days?

90
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,579
I get up at 8:00 in the morning

91
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,707
because the noise from my alarm clock
interrupts my sleep.

92
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,631
And I lean over and just turn it off.

93
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,958
Turn it off.
That's more specific than I thought.

94
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,463
-Oh. What did you want to know?
-Just...

95
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,592
-Well, do you have a job?
-I have a job in an office.

96
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,968
-What do you do?
-I'm an executive.

97
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,174
-Do you enjoy that?
-No.

98
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,305
-Oh!
-But I enjoy the end result of the job,

99
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,932
which is money.

100
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,809
And also the hours are pretty good
for the amount of money I make,

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,776
which I spend on things I like,
such as clothes and hiking and drinking,

102
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,774
even though I know it's bad for me.

103
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,403
But I'd rather just get all the money
and not have to work for the results.

104
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,858
Oh, sure.

105
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,785
Tell me something about you, though.

106
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,784
You already know a lot about me.

107
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,538
You know I'm good-looking
because, well, here I am.

108
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,540
And you know that I'm successful

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,997
because you've seen my apartment
and the clothes that I'm wearing.

110
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,342
And you know I'm happy
because I'm smiling.

111
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,631
-Are you always happy?
-Usually.

112
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,715
Some days I stay in bed, eating and crying.

113
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,310
-There you go.
-Thank you.

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,481
-I had a little sip of this from right there, so...
-Okay.

115
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,318
You guys ready to order
or do you need a moment?

116
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,732
I'm good.

117
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,407
Oh! I'll have the Caesar salad with chicken
because I think I'm fat,

118
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,326
but I also think I deserve
something that tastes good.

119
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,071
I'll have the fish tacos
'cause it's what I had last time I was here.

120
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,827
It's all I know.

121
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,867
Great. I'll get those two started.

122
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,710
If I gave you my number, would you call me?

123
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,954
No.

00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,123
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

125
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,923
Sorry. It's my mom.

126
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,344
I think she's probably checking on the date.
It won't take long.

127
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,679
Hello.

128
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,014
Yes, I'm with him right now.

129
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,182
No, not very attractive.
No, doesn't make much money.

130
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,764
It's all right, though.
Seems nice. Kind of funny.

131
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,269
A bit fat.

132
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,362
Has a funny little snub nose.

133
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,696
(EXCLAIMS)

134
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,275
Kind of like a frog in the facial area.

135
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,530
Yeah, but...

136
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,779
No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.

137
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,205
No. Probably not even a kiss.

138
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,538
Okay. You, too. Bye. Sorry about that.

139
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,291
It's all right. Don't think twice.
How is your mum, all right?

140
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,044
-She's all right...
-Great. That's...

141
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,223
Thanks for going on this date with me.

142
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,224
You're way out of my league,
and I know you only did it as a favour to Greg

143
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,848
and I'll probably never
hear from you again, but...

144
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,352
I had a better time than I thought I'd have.

145
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,985
But I won't really know how I feel about you
till I'm a little less drunk.

146
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,281
-Sure.
-Yeah.

147
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:17,407
Well, call me tomorrow
if you still like me when you're sober.

148
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,074
I might.

149
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,622
Oh! Thank you for kissing me on the cheek.

150
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,828
I know you didn't have to do...
You're very pretty! Good night!

151
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,543
MAN: (ON TV)...first used
roughly 4,000 years ago on Celtic chariots,

152
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:39,349
was, for the most part,
unchanged by man until the late 1800s.

153
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,937
Hi, I'm Bob. I'm the spokesperson
for The Coca-Cola Company.

154
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,481
I'm here today to ask you
to continue buying Coke.

155
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,104
I'm sure it's the drink
you've been drinking for years

156
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,730
and if you still enjoy it, well,
I'd like to remind you

157
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,277
to buy it again sometime soon.

158
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,693
It's basically just brown sugar water.

159
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,148
Haven’t changed the ingredients much lately,

160
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,279
so there's nothing new
I can tell you about that.

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,235
Changed the can around a little bit, though.

162
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,866
You can see the colours are different there,

163
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,073
and we've added a polar bear,
so the kids like us.

164
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,875
Coke's very high in sugar,
and like any high-calorie soda,

165
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,420
it can lead to obesity in children and adults
who don't sustain a very healthy diet.

166
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,169
And that's it. It's Coke.
It's very famous. Everyone knows it.

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,718
I'm Bob. I work for Coke.
And I'm asking you to not stop buying Coke.

168
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,090
That's all.

169
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,217
(SLURPING)

170
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,840
It's a bit sweet.

171
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,099

-Hey, Mark. How's it going?
-Hi, Frank. Not too well.

175
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,618
I went on a date last night with a girl
I've had a crush on for years,

176
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,294
and she'll most likely never call me again.

177
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,795
Oh, and I think I'm getting fired today.
How about you?

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,837
Oh, I'm not too great, actually.

179
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,547
I've been throwing up painkillers all night

180
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:05,102
because I'm too afraid to take enough
to actually kill myself, so...

If I'm not dead, then sure.

-Good. That's settled, then.
-All right. Have a nice day.

This isn't natural!
None of this is natural! We're all animals!

187
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,507
Why am I wearing clothes?
How do you people live like this?

188
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,055
Why is there all this concrete?

189
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,853
I woke up this morning and realised,
not only do I not love you,

190
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,431
but also the thought
of sleeping with you sickens me.

191
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,233
That should make me not love you,
but it only makes me love you more.

All of Lecture Films' productions are written,
filmed and edited on this very lot.

195
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,261
In fact, this building is
where Lecture Films' talented writers

196
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,215
scour the world's past events
for the most dramatic,

197
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,802
entertaining and even hilarious moments
from world history,

198
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,981
which are then turned into scripts,
handed over to our world-famous readers

199
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,276
to read off of teleprompters
and then filmed for your viewing pleasure.

of Lecture Films'
upcoming summer blockbuster,

202
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,658

screenplay by Brad Kessler
and starring Nathan Goldfrappe,

205
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,166
Napoleon: 1812 to 1813.

206
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,094
And so Napoleon invaded Russia

207
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,299
with a brute force
of nearly 700,000 men behind him,

208
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,887
armed with muskets
and supported by cannon brigades.

209
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,893
Crippled by disease and hunger,

210
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,851
Napoleon’s men persevered.

211
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,732
It was then that...

There's Mark Bellison,
one of Lecture Films' very own screenwriters.

214
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,069
Mark is one of Lecture Films'
least successful screenwriters.

215
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,780

getting fired today.

Morning, Shelley.

00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,181
Hi, Mark.

222
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,481
I realise more and more every day
how overqualified I am for this position

223
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,309
and how incompetent you are at yours.

224
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,901
Any messages?

225
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,607
Anthony is coming up within the hour to see
if he can get up the courage to fire you.

226
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,443
If he can't, he said
that he'll definitely do it tomorrow.

227
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,949
Anything else?
Any messages not to do with being fired?

228
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,904
Well, I told everyone
you're getting fired this week

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,536
and they shouldn't expect
their calls returned,

230
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,991
so no one left any messages.

231
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,872
Okay. Next time...

232
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,703
I don't think there'll be a next time.

233
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,834
...take the message,
just in case I don't get fired.

234
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,085
You're almost definitely getting fired.

235
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,508
Yeah, but I'm still here now, so...

236
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,880
Seems like a waste of time.

237
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,052
No, it's not.

238
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,803
You're getting paid for it, so let's
take the message in case I don't get...

239
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,804
-But everyone knows that you are.
-Hasn't happened yet.

240
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,432
Okay. But everyone knows you are.

Okay.
I'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist.

-Oh, Mark.

The 1300s, they're so boring.

251
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:36,076
And the last two scripts
you turned in were depressing.

252
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,623
They were about the Black Plague.

It's the 1300s.
What am I meant to write about?

Nothing new is gonna
have happened in the 1300s.

while I did enjoy your company,

272
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,557
based on your looks, your financial situation
and your position in life,

I have no interest in you romantically.

it was based on your looks.

So?

285

I loathed almost every minute
that I worked for you.

286
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,806
So, what are you gonna do now?

287
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,688

-Thank you.

"Fatty, fat faggot."

in front of an officer of the law.

515
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,100
GREG: Don't tell me not to puke
'cause that'll make me puke more.

Hello, Officer. How are you?

517

Well, I'm relieved
you're not a couple of black guys.

518

There's a much higher probability
that I'd be jumpy,

519
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,112
shoot you without provocation,
and then I could lose my weapon.

and operating this motor vehicle?

523

-Yeah, a lot of drink.
-Well, then you're probably going to jail.

524
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,459
I'm gonna need you
to breathe into this for me.

525
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,044
Officer, you don't need to do that.

526
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,372
I'm gonna say that,
judging by the look of this car,

527
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,752

529

5,400.

530
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,419
That's a lot.

531
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,880
That's too much, I think. Why so high?

00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,432
I have an expensive cocaine habit.

But, you know, it's more than that.

534
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:56,269
I feel like when I set the price up higher,
it takes it out of the realm of petty crime

535
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,191
and helps me preserve
my sense of personal integrity.

536

-I don't want to.

one more time.

-Might as well.
-I can't.

00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,281
Hang up, Mark.

680
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,407
Bye.

681
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,537
MALE NARRATOR: ...proudly presents
The Industrial Revolution.

682
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,589
Hello, I'm Angelo Badsmith.

683
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,634
Come, watch me read
about the exciting events

684
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,428
that took place during
the Industrial Revolution,

685
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:52,305
written by the most beloved and esteemed
screenwriter of his generation,

686
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,101
Brad Kessler.

687
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:58,649
I don't think anyone can write
a better screenplay than Brad Kessler.

688
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,399
No?

689
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,672
BRAD: Hey!

690
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,224
Did you come to beg for your job back?

691
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,517
Everybody!

692
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,310
That's the loser that thought
the Black Plague

693
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,682
would make an interesting film.

694
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,981
Hey! Good luck, douche bag.

695
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,861
-You can't go in there.
-I've got an appointment.

696
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,813
Oh, then go right in.

697
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,948
Talk to you later.

698
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,611
Hi. That was the head of the studio.

699
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,374
Why are you here?

700
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:03,376
Well, when you fired me,
I was seriously depressed.

701
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,832
-I knew it.
-But...

702
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,469
I went for a walk, right out of town.

703
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:14,266
And I came across a desert,
and I fell asleep under a tree, palm tree.

704
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,810
I don't do well
with other people's life-changing stories.

705
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:22,186
And then when I woke up,
I saw like a thing sticking out of the sand.

706
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,896
And I unearthed it,
and it was an ancient chest.

707
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,356
Really old. Seven hundred years old.

708
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,284
And in that chest was this.

709
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,451
What is it?

710
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,827
It's a never-before-heard event from history.

711
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,291
When does it take place?

712
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,493
1300s.

713
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,998
Oh, come on, no, Mark!

714
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,923
Mark, I've already told you,
we don't do Black Plague movies here!

715
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,003
It's not about the Black Plague!
It's not just about the Black Plague.

716
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,055
It's about... Can I just read it, please?

717
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,383
Get excited. Don't tap, get excited.

718
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,843
Get very excited,

719
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:05,434
because this is one of the best discoveries

720
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,691
man has ever discovered.

721
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,021
And you can be part of it.

722
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,732
Yes, but is there a movie there?

723
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,445
The greatest movie
Lecture Films has ever made.

724
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,955
Start reading.

725
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,668
"On the very first day of the 14th century,
a momentous occasion occurred.

726
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:33,550
"It began like any other day.
The sun rose, babies began to cry.

727
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,053
"But all of that was interrupted
when a giant, flying spaceship

728
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:41,978
"crashed down from the skies
and landed in the heart of Babylon."

729
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,100
What?

730
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,820
Uh... Get everyone in here, right now.
We got a big one.

731
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,068
Oh, please, Mark, continue.

732
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,821
MARK: "The ninja army
unleashed a giant fireball

733
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,909
"and brought the robot dinosaur
to its knees, saving Mars, Earth

00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,882
"Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry
by alien King Wanglor.

737
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,591
"It was to be the first human
nude Amazonian alien woman wedding,

738
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,887
"and no expense would be spared.

739
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,346
"All of Babylon and Mars were invited
to join the celebrations.

740
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,147
"The wedding was held
on a brisk summer's day on Mars.

741
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,021
"And all of the survivors
of the Great Ninja War

"King Wanglor performed
a mind-wipe on all the humans,

"thereby erasing all knowledge
of these events for about 700 years,

747
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,123
"until one day,
a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison

748
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:53,592
"would stumble across them in the desert
after being fired by his crap boss, Anthony,

"and mocked by Brad and Shelley,
two huge douche bags.

750

"Lecture Films would go on to make
the picture, and it'd be a huge success.

"And Mark would become very wealthy
and famous from it."

752
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,781
What are you gonna call this, Mark?

753
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,160
The Black Plague.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

755
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,423
I want you to start immediately
'cause I think this could be

756
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,671
the best screenplay ever written.

757
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,465
Oh, it will.

758
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,970
It will be the best screenplay
ever written by anyone.

759
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,813
Well...

760
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,522
I guess congratulations
on selling your script today.

761
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,740
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

762
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,113
Tell me something about your family.
I don't know that much about you.

763
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,448
(MARK EXHALES)

764
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,329
We're sort of what you'd call unlucky.

765
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,785
My dad was an alcoholic.

766
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,086
Sad.

767
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:16,257
Drinking got to a point where he lost his job,
and with a family to support,

768
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,380
he had no choice
but to turn to a life of crime.

769
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,049
What kind of crime?

770
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,048
Burglary. Houses, mainly.

771
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,479
What are you doing here?

772
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,523
It's Monday at noon.
You're not supposed to be at home now.

773
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,602
If you must know,
I'm incredibly stressed at work.

774
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,732
I've come home early.
I'm having a bit of me time.

775
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,230
More importantly, what are you doing?

776
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,982
Well, I was gonna rob your house.

777
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,408
I don't like that idea. Not a fan of that at all.

778
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,277
Well, I'm not gonna do it now
because you're in.

779
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,452
And do you know what's gonna happen?

780
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,030
I'm gonna call the police,
you're gonna be arrested.

781
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,786
Well, I'm just gonna leave,
and you don't know my name.

782
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,207
-What is your name?
-Richard Bellison.

783
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,704
(LAUGHING) Good to meet you.

784
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,833
You've got two options. Option one,
I send the police to your house, right?

785
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,256
Arrest you there,
embarrass you in front of your neighbours.

786
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,797
Or option two, you just come in
and wait for the police here.

787
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,048
-No, I'll wait.
-Yeah?

788
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,597
-Come on in then. Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

789
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,886
MARK: He spent the last years
of his life in jail.

790
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,847
I never really knew him.

791
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,102
But I've been blessed
with some luck as well in my life.

792
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,974
I had a wonderful mother who raised me.

793
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,776
-Oh, that's sweet.
-She's great.

794
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,894
Where is she?

795
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,067
At an old people's home.

796
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,943
But I'm gonna get her out of there tomorrow.

797
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,073
I'm gonna get her a mansion,

798
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,071
so she can spend
the rest of her life in luxury.

799
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,698
That's nice.

800
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,202
-Compliments from the chef.
-Thank you.

801
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,709
I don't know what's wrong with him today,
but these just look awful.

802
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,879
They look fine to me.

803
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,878
Well, you're stupid.

804
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,093
I was thinking.

805
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,310
Now I'm obviously rich and successful and...

806
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:58,402
Maybe I'm in your league
and that we could be together, romantically.

807
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,608
What would be the point?

808
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,070
We might enjoy it.

809
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,789
Well, I do like you
and I do enjoy your company.

810
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,749
And if we were to get together and procreate,

811
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,919
I would like the offspring
that are carrying half my genetic code

812
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,544
to be well taken care of, financially stable.

813
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,344
I also think you'd make a good father
and a good husband, which I like.

814
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,803
Fantastic.

815
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,098
Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact

816
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:33,770
that you'd still be contributing
half the genetic code to our children.

817
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,813
I don't want little fat kids with snub noses.

818
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,820
Sure.

00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,955
Mum?

824
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,788
They just called me. What's going on?

825
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,712
They said I'm probably gonna die tonight.

826

Hello, there.
I was just coming in to check on her.

You must be Martha's son.

829
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,930
What do you mean, she's gonna die tonight?

830
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,884
It does not look very good.
She suffered a major heart attack.

831
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,763
Her heart is very weak.
Her pulse is not very strong.

832
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,724
Her blood pressure is dropping rapidly,

833
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,729
and she will probably suffer
a fatal heart attack sometime tonight.

834
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,902
Yes. Still going to die.

but death is a horrible thing.

This is it, Mark.

844
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,242
Few more hours like this and then

845
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,116

Are you happier, at least?

Have you found someone yet?

1363
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,463
-Uh, no, I kind of gave up on that.
-Why?

1364
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,594
Well, because I was thinking
that if I get eternal happiness when I die,

1365
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,514
that'll be really great because it's eternal,

1366
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,607
you know, so you can't really beat that.

1367

So I'm just really happy
that that's gonna happen.

1368
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:06,025

I'm just gonna stick with the alcohol

hang out by myself and drink and watch TV.

That sounds like a long, miserable one.

1371

because the more I drink, the faster I'll die.

"Why are you speaking to that idiot?”

1385

It means just because
he's talking to the man in the sky

doesn't make him good enough
to be your friend.

chose to speak through,

01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:58,484
-That's up to the man in the sky.
-I'm talking to her.

1519
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,654
Why don't you just ask the man in the sky
what he wants for Anna?

1520
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,456
-Surely he knows best.
-She knows what's best.

1521
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,659
Just tell her
what the man in the sky wants, Mark.

1522
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:11,667
Why don't you tell me
what the man in the sky wants for us, Mark?

1523
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,669
Just please tell me.

1524
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,217
(SCOFFS)

1525
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:17,544
No.

(GUESTS MURMURING)

1527
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,185
(SIGHS)

1528
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,394
Are we married yet?

1529
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,113
-Because I have plans later.
-There's a few...

1530
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,549
ANNA: Mark, wait!

1531
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:10,100
Why don't you just tell me
what the man in the sky wants?

1532
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:13,229
-I did a bad thing.
-It's okay.

1533
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:16,652
-You're allowed three.
-No, you don't understand.

1534
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,069
There is no man in the sky.

1535
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:27,409
Why did you say there was?

1536
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:34,042
I couldn't stand the look on my mum's face
when she was dying.

1537
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,961
And things just escalated.

1538
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,383
But how did you say something that wasn't?

1539
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:45,637
I don't know, I just did. I just can.

1540
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,218
But when I asked you if being rich

1541
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:51,601
and successful and famous
changed your genetics,

1542
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,224
why didn't you just say yes?

1543
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,436
'Cause it wouldn't count.

1544
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:01,485
Mark.

1545
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:05,743
I know what I want.

1546
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,115
(SIGHS)

1547
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:13,080
I want little fat kids with snub noses.

1548
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,002
I'm your man.

1549
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,022
MARK: So that's it. I got the girl.

1550
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,772
Anna and I are very happy together,
by the way.

1551
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:45,529
She still doesn't fully understand
how I said or did all those things.

1552
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:49,496
No one does.
I'm still the only person who can tell a lie.

1553
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,787
Actually, that's not entirely true.

1554
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,499
What do you think?

1555
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,714
That looks good.

1556
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,629
It tastes so good, Mom my.

1557
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,882
-Your best yet.
-I'm so glad you like it.

1558
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,884
Huh? Oh.

1559
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:17,974
I don't know where to start.

1560
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:22,820
Just start on the bread, maybe,
then work my way up there.

1561
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:27,735
You eat that. You liked it so much.
Why don't you eat some more?

1562
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,449
He loves it.
