1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,128
In 1964, Run Run Shaw

2
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,622
head of Hong Kong's biggest film studio...

3
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:33,093
gave a rare interview

4
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,793
We have at least 50 actresses

5
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,831
and 24 actors

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,939
In Hong Kong
actresses are more important than actors

7
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,416
Because we have more beautiful girls

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,413
It's paradise, it's dreamland!

9
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,888
As I look at the heavenly dome

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,895
Stars twinkle in the dark night

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,866
We cling to each other tightly

12
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,515
Lunching with Run Run Shaw in 1964

13
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,150
are two of his latest crop
of young actresses

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,685
This is Lily Ho

15
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,555
Within two years she will be
as famous in the east

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,727
as Jane Fonda in the West

17
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,759
Shaw had built the biggest studio in
what was by then

18
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,197
...the third largest film industry
in the world

19
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:45,867
For three decades

20
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,630
he would provide Chinese cinema
goers with

21
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,968
every possible genre of movie

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,876
From epics to operas

23
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,510
from dramas to musicals

24
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,650
But he offered his audience
something else too

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,116
Home-grown film stars

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,389
beautiful glamorous women
who would...

27
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,526
promote his films and
become celebrities through them

28
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,960
In 1960, the rest of the world
got its first glimpse

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,365
...of the truly epic scale
of Hong Kong cinema

30
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,970
And of its beautiful stars

31
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,170
That year
a Shaw film- 'The Magnificent Concubine'

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,004
won a special prize
at the Cannes film festival

33
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,552
It starred a mainland-born actress

34
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,248
Li Li-Hua

35
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,834
The Magnificent Concubine is the story
of Yeung Ke Fei

36
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,801
...the Emperors favourite concubine

37
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,131
San Lang

38
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,034
The lavish sets & spectacular
costumes of Imperial-

39
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,681
China, all served to enhance
Li Li-Hua's star quality

40
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,818
Li Li Hua was very beautiful
very intelligent.

41
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,778
She was a big star

42
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,956
very popular.

43
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,625
Everyone agrees she was a superstar.

44
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,660
The Magnificent concubine
plays on an epic scale

45
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,301
At its conclusion

46
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,699
Yeung Pei Fei offers herself
in sacrifice...

47
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,498
to appease a mutinous army

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,899
Alright

49
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,877
If you will be loyal to His Majesty...

50
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,741
and escort him to Szechuen;

51
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,315
I will willingly die for it

52
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,521
Li Li-Hua's parts frequently
married beauty & strength

53
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,696
Epics like The Magnificent Concubine
were produced at

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,375
...Shaw's Movie Town
at Clearwater Bay

55
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,075
where 1200 people were employed.

56
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,777
There were 16 permanent outdoor sets

57
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,444
with streets, palaces and pagodas

58
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,012
Hollywood greats paid courtesy visits

59
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,126
Shaw wanted to create
a Studio-Star system

60
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,556
in the American style

61
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,623
Li Li Hua was one of his first big names

62
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,662
Already an established actress

63
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,336
she had been lured in 1956 to Hollywood

64
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,439
appearing in the film 'China Doll'
with Victor Matuire

65
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:41,208
Li Li Hua had an opportunity
to go to Hollywood.

66
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,540
She went to make a film...

67
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,681
called 'China Doll'

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,749
But the times were very conservative.

69
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,493
She refused to do a kissing scene
with the leading man

70
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,729
She decided that Hollywood

71
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,454
was too unreasonable for her

72
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,032
...and she returned to Hong Kong.

73
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,594
I think if Li Li Hua...

74
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,033
had been willing to pursue a career
in Hollywood

75
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,032
her style would have worked there.

76
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,675
Li Li Hua was one of the
few Chinese actresses...

77
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,403
to be sought after by Hollywood

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,309
But following a rumored flirtation
with Yul Brynner...

79
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,348
eventually she returned to Hong Kong

80
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,884
and married actor-director Yan Jun

81
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,717
Signed to the Shaw Studio

82
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,792
she was now cast in a variety of roles...

83
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,657
to exploit her acting talent

84
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:43,240
The beautiful young girl...

85
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,070
In the film 'Between Tears And Smiles'

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,007
she plays a singer
in pre-war republican China...

87
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,580
who is forced to perform
for a local warlord

88
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,886
I'm your sixth concubine

89
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,856
Who dares come near the sixth concubine?

90
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,433
Sixth concubine...

91
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,065
sixth concubine

92
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,601
She is driven mad

93
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,498
Sixth concubine...

94
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,801
You crazy woman

95
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,339
You're a disgusting sight

96
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,239
Beat it or I'll shoot you

97
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,574
I'll die anyway

98
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,787
What are you doing?

99
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,814
You beast

100
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,048
You monster!

101
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,590
I'll kill you

102
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,784
This performance won her

103
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,759
the best actress 'Golden Horse' Award

104
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,697
When she began working
for Shaw Studios...

105
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,664
she became very, very famous.

106
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,839
Very popular indeed

107
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,872
At the time, film stars of her age...

108
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,236
especially Hong Kong film stars...

109
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,777
were regarded as past their prime.

110
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,145
During 'The Magnificent Concubine'
and 'Empress Wu'

111
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,876
...she was in her late 30's.

112
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,917
You're outspoken

113
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,188
Guards!

114
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,822
Yes

115
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,759
You do believe in the old laws?

116
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,465
A woman in power...

117
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,307
is against them

118
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,205
I'll show you what the law means

119
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,404
Take him out and execute him

120
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,275
Yes

121
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,122
She plays a strong character

122
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,418
...who is independent and opinionated.

123
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,360
She also has a Ionely human aspect

124
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,860
...and a nasty side.

125
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,299
She plays the complexity of
the character very well.

126
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,112
Wait!

127
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,486
Her Majesty pardons Hsu Yiu-Kung

128
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,985
She wants to see him

129
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,555
We don't abide by the laws here

130
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,325
But don't worry

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,964
Nobody can inform on us

132
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,666
Your Majesty

133
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,570
Epic costume drama
was hugely popular with...

134
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,246
the Hong Kong audience
at the start of the 60's

135
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,683
The population of the British colony...

136
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,409
had doubled in the previous decade

137
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,554
...as immigrants
from the new communist China

138
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,086
flooded across the border

139
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,019
Shaw offered them an escape...

140
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,127
into an picturesque
and spectacular imperial past

141
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,231
He transferred to the screen
popular Chinese culture

142
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,900
in the form of traditional stories

143
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,230
and what was known as Huang Mei
or 'Yellow Plum Opera'

144
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,105
In 'The Grand Substitution'

145
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,835
based on a Chinese folk tale

146
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,274
Li Li Hua plays a princess

147
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,608
who gives up her baby-son to her retainer

148
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,645
...played by her own husband Yan Jun

149
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,113
to save the child
from a plot to murder him

150
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,257
15 years later the boy returns

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,025
Mother and son meet, without knowing

152
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,824
It appears that you've suffered too

153
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,065
The part of the son is played by a woman

154
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,171
...not unusual in Chinese Opera

155
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,765
Her name is Ivy Ling Po

156
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,847
I grasp my sword and go out

157
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,950
Her success in these male roles

158
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,246
would make her...

159
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,286
one of Hong Kong cinema's
best loved actresses

160
00:09:51,958 --> 00:10:02,163
To kill the traitor for revenge

161
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,370
You have to get the character right

162
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,232
and you have to play it well.

163
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,504
It's not easy. Right?

164
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,404
I think...

165
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,072
it was quite a good experience

166
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,975
I never thought of myself

167
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,874
as being abnormal.

168
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,378
Nor did I feel weird about it.

169
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,748
I felt comfortable.

170
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,216
At that time...

171
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,056
Cross-gender roles became trendy

172
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,590
with Ling Po's fame.

173
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,591
In Chinese history...

174
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,264
particularly in the theatre

175
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,692
cross-gender acting was common

176
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,061
both, women playing men and vice versa.

177
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,894
This was a very conservative period.

178
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,696
People didn't want to see...

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,068
men and women on stage at the same time.

180
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,578
In 1963 an opera,

181
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,270
'The Love Eterne' with Ling Po...

182
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,973
as the male lead broke
all box-office records for Shaw

183
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,446
It was far & away...

184
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,245
the most popular film of the year

185
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,921
The story concerns a girl

186
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,957
Zhu Ying Tai played by Betty Lo Ti
who...

187
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,426
disguises herself as boy
in order to get an education

188
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,796
Way of great learning lies in virtue

189
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,768
In the scene
the class of male students...

190
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,999
is almost entirely played by women

191
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,573
One must regulate one's home

192
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,674
To regulate one's home...

193
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,610
One must cultivate oneself.

194
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,550
Ying Tai falls in love
with fellow student, Liang Shan

195
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,881
...played by Ling Po

196
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,729
Despite some obvious clues

197
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,956
Shan Po never guesses...

198
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,532
Ying Tai is really a girl

199
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,832
Okay

200
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,965
See, it's as good as new

201
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,539
Good, better than a girl's work

202
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,807
The Love Eterne' shot Ling Po

203
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,277
to overnight stardom

204
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,083
After The Love Eterne...

205
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,220
So after this movie...

206
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,882
Ling Po...

207
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,492
became a household name.

208
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,352
It's also a turning point...

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,220
in my life.

210
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,159
Marry you! Marry you!

211
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:20,939
But you are not a girl

212
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,301
In The Love Eterne,

213
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,405
I like every part of the movie

214
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,669
every scene

215
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,437
but my favourite part

216
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,215
is when Liang Shan Po

217
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,646
realises Zhu Ying Tai is really a girl.

218
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,248
Is Ying Tai really a girl?

219
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,748
Of course she is

220
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,354
He is ecstatic

221
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,423
so happy

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,195
and goes to find her.

223
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,591
They'll always be together in this life

224
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,166
When Shan Po discovers
Ying Tai's real identity...

225
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,494
he proposes to her

226
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,262
But her parents...

227
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,337
have already arranged a marriage

228
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,977
But my father has given me

229
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,157
On her wedding day, news reaches her...

230
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,657
of Shan Po's death from consumption

231
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,319
She asks for her wedding procession...

232
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,089
to go by his tomb

233
00:13:52,765 --> 00:14:01,434
That's Liang Shan Po & Chu Ying Tai

234
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,973
Some people were so crazy
about The Love Eterne...

235
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,872
they went to see it dozens of times.

236
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,415
I think it's
because they liked to sing along.

237
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,884
To a Chinese ear the music
was simple to learn

238
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,984
And audiences frequently sang along
with the film

239
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,287
'The Love Eterne' started a craze
for Huang Mei Opera

240
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,756
throughout Southeast Asia

241
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,022
and the Shaw Studios
started churning them out...

242
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,665
mostly starring Ling Po

243
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,064
Hua Mulan was
another Chinese folk tale...

244
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,334
of the girl
who enlists in the army as a man

245
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,738
and becomes a hero

246
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,175
The same story would later
by taken up by Walt Disney

247
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,112
...in his cartoon, 'Mulan'

248
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,283
Don't make a move or I'll kill you

249
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,385
She falls in love
with a fellow General...

250
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,285
who once again

251
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,392
wants to marry her when all is revealed

252
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,553
The script even makes reference...

253
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,288
to the story of Liang Shan Po
and Chu Ying Tai

254
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,226
You and I shared a tent for 12 years

255
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,562
But it is only clear to you now

256
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:12,468
You are more stupid than Liang Shan Po

257
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,940
It was on the set of Hua Mulan...

258
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,843
that Ling Po first met
her co-star Zhin Han

259
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,948
who in real life

260
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,118
she would eventually marry

261
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,843
although strongly against the wishes...

262
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,282
of Run Run Shaw

263
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,056
The relationship was very strained.

264
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,454
We were young...

265
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,458
and reckless.

266
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,189
Everyone was very unhappy.

267
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,230
They said we can't get married

268
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,058
We insisted.

269
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,904
We continued arguing...

270
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,595
with the studio...

271
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,738
so they gave in and said "OK...

272
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,637
but you have to let...

273
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,602
Run Run Shaw be the witness

274
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,681
and you should hold
the wedding banquet...

275
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,209
in the studio ballroom."

276
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,489
We said "No...

277
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,085
no way"

278
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,490
and they gave in again

279
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,053
and said, "OK that's fine"...

280
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,318
but asked us not to go...

281
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,827
to Taiwan for our honeymoon.

282
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,966
We on the other hand...

283
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,829
deliberately went to Taiwan.

284
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,027
So in the end we went to Taiwan

285
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,865
we didn't have the wedding in the studio

286
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:15,904
and for quite a while

287
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,905
we were on bad terms with the studio.

288
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,777
Shaw believed that
for his actresses to be married...

289
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,448
was bad box-office

290
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,541
He exercised enormous
control over their lives

291
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,814
If an actress wanted to leave
for a rival studio...

292
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,582
he could be quite ruthless in
trying to prevent her

293
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,816
I kept my Taiwanese passport.

294
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,823
The Shaw Studio had always sponsored...

295
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,224
my work permit.

296
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,790
So they used this as a weapon.

297
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,433
Suddenly without warning...

298
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,659
they withdrew their guarantee.

299
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,564
If this had happened...

300
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,568
I would have been
forced to leave the country.

301
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,604
We have no restrictions here

302
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,310
We have no labour problem

303
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:01,050
Everybody is willing to work long hours

304
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,589
and they have an interest
in this industry

305
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,484
They feel happy to work for a film

306
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,326
and I think that contributes a lot

307
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:16,963
With 'cinema-going'

308
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,796
the colony's principal entertainment

309
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,005
Run Run Shaw
used his publicity machine...

310
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,639
to build up a dedicated following...

311
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,240
for his screen goddesses

312
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,775
The Studio produced a magazine
for the cinema-goer...

313
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,678
with articles on the actresses
and the productions

314
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,087
The audience was given story-lines...

315
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,451
for the latest production
in a comic strip

316
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,152
This edition is paving the way...

317
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,693
for the release of
the latest Shaw blockbuster

318
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,422
starring the queen of
the Shaw movie stars, Lin Dai...

319
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,498
in 'The Kingdom And The Beauty'

320
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,671
Lin Dai, who has been likened
to Marilyn Monroe...

321
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,344
was one of the great beauties
of Hong Kong Cinema

322
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,014
With a propensity
for being cast in tragic roles

323
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,246
roles which echoed...

324
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,350
the tragedy of her own short life.

325
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,182
Before joining Shaw...

326
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,947
she was already famous.

327
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,785
But with Shaw
she became even more popular.

328
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,656
Shaw was good at spotting talent.

329
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,527
Lin Dai had that something
which appealed to audiences

330
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:30,038
So Shaw invested heavily
in two films for her

331
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,006
Diao Sin and The Kingdom & The Beauty

332
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,078
and they made her a big star.

333
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,543
In 'Kingdom & The Beauty'
the heroine is betrayed by

334
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,743
a philandering emperor
who is travelling incognito.

335
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,323
He visits the inn
where she works and seduces her

336
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,325
Next morning she finds out his secret

337
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,533
The emperor promises to send for her

338
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,104
and bring her to court

339
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,144
But he goes away never to return

340
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:13,548
He went his way, but with her heart

341
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,511
When she gives birth to his child,

342
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,657
she is reviled and humiliated
by the townspeople

343
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,692
She falls ill with a broken heart

344
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,462
But when news of her condition
reaches the emperor...

345
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,760
he repents at last

346
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,300
and sends an escort...

347
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,665
for her to be brought in splendour
to the Capital

348
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,010
But her illness worsens on the way

349
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,243
By the time the emperor sees her

350
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,817
it's too late!

351
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,488
Unhappy endings were popular

352
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,462
even expected in the Hong Kong Cinema
of the period

353
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,930
And it was always the heroine

354
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,660
not the hero who suffered

355
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:16,914
Cannot forget, cannot forget

356
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,343
In "Love Without end"

357
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,780
Lin Dai plays another tragic heroine

358
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,613
...this time, a nightclub singer-

359
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,913
Li Tsing Tsing

360
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:29,992
I cannot forget your good

361
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,593
It's impossible to be forgotten

362
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,929
In Hong Kong Cinema
nightclub singer, or songstress

363
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,469
...is synonymous with misfortune

364
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,210
Tsing Tsing, Tsing Tsing

365
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,107
When her ex-boyfriend, Peng-nan

366
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,372
with whom she's still in love...

367
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,483
discovers from doctors
that Tsing Tsing has leukemia

368
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,279
he keeps the truth
from her and offers to marry her

369
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,357
But in the bridal parlor

370
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,458
she overhears a conversation

371
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,688
According to your estimates...

372
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,920
three or four months after the wedding

373
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,562
...she will die!

374
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,597
She decides to run away

375
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,338
What if Peng-nan finds out?

376
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,802
Peng-nan may not really love me

377
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,141
He knows that I am sick

378
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,644
He pities me

379
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,652
Peng-nan tracks her down
to a remote island...

380
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,355
but once again, it's too late!

381
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,384
Be quiet, my child

382
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,219
Let me go in. Please, let me go in

383
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,394
Tsing-tsing!

384
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,190
Tsing-tsing!

385
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,229
In Lin Dai's own private life

386
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,701
both love
and death quartered her attention

387
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,632
At one time

388
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,569
she had been the girlfriend of Yan Jun

389
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:51,876
...but he jilted her

390
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,841
and married her screen rival
Li Li Hua instead

391
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,575
He wasn't very attentive to Lin Dai.

392
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,014
Say, even if she had been broke...

393
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,345
he wouldn't have bought her
a pair of shoes.

394
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,115
He didn't care for her life

395
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,258
...so she was very disappointed.

396
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,027
Later she discovered...

397
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,023
that Yan Jun seemed to like Li Li Hua

398
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,324
and also had a wife in Shanghai...

399
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,764
though they were later divorced.

400
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,867
She had tried to kill herself once

401
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,800
because of this.

402
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,771
Lin left Hong Kong...

403
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,306
to spend several months
studying in the USA

404
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,835
There she met Leung Chan Chuen

405
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,776
son of a prominent warlord
of pre-communist China

406
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,308
They were married in Hong Kong in 1961

407
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,745
She was four-times best actress;

408
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,445
She had a great career and so much money.

409
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,957
She had married a good husband

410
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:40,920
had a wonderful

411
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,320
and beautiful child

412
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,121
Her son was cute
and with big eyes like hers

413
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,356
So, to me...

414
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,862
everything about her seemed perfect.

415
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,966
Despite all that...

416
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,663
I never saw happiness on her face

417
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,497
I found that very odd indeed.

418
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,967
When I grew up, I eventually understood.

419
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,145
She had everything...

420
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,406
but it wasn't what she was looking for.

421
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,951
She wanted a peaceful

422
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,481
and stable family.

423
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,883
Maybe her expectations of family...

424
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,115
didn't match the reality.

425
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,688
'The Blue And The Black'
was Lin Dai's last film

426
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,831
A tense drama set
during the Sino-Japanese war

427
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,099
Lin plays Qi
an independently-minded girl...

428
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,361
much younger than Lin's own 30 years

429
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,402
who faces an arranged marriage.

430
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,872
I've been tolerating with you

431
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,303
till now

432
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,444
I don't wish to argue and make you mad

433
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,270
Not because I am scared of other people

434
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,808
She runs away from her aunt's house

435
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,846
to be with her lover Sin Ya

436
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,680
Have you packed yet?

437
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,717
In the emotional melodrama
of the 50's and 60's...

438
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,857
the heroine was expected to suffer

439
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,083
Yet usually it was the woman
who showed strength

440
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,886
and the man weakness!

441
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,594
Qi

442
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,268
But I love you deeply

443
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,605
Can't you do better than just talk?

444
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,536
The audience is mainly housewives
with their kids...

445
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,476
so naturally they choose films
they can relate to.

446
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,250
For example the male character
will be weak...

447
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,181
and the female lead will be exploited

448
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,012
But in the end she triumphs...

449
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:22,216
through her strength and endurance.

450
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,754
The audience relates to this
and is moved.

451
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,028
In 'The Blue And The Black'

452
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,964
Lin's character supports herself...

453
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,398
working in a hospital

454
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,340
I don't think they're coming, Sir

455
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,737
But then she suffers
further humiliation...

456
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,574
when she is assaulted by her boss

457
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,208
Here, have one more
then I'll take you home

458
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,352
I've had too much already

459
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,205
When news of the rape is reported

460
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,348
she is disowned by her aunt's family
and becomes...

461
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,279
a singer in a nightclub!

462
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:30,954
I don't know if it's morning...

463
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,024
But Lin Dai never finished the film

464
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,392
One day, driving back from the studio

465
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,091
she stopped to pickup fellow actress
Qui Ping

466
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,133
She said, "Sister Qui Ping...

467
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,395
get in, get in."

468
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,435
I said, "I can't, I have to go home."

469
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,800
She said, "I'll take you home."

470
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,134
I got in

471
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,001
and asked, "What's the matter?

472
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,268
...Why the urgency?"

473
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,445
"Don't go home" she said.

474
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,273
"Come home with me
I've something to tell you...

475
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,743
something very important"

476
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,779
Then she started crying

477
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:52,745
I said, "Don't cry
you've got everything.

478
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,043
You've got money

479
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,254
fame and love...

480
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,220
and you've even got a child.

481
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,393
What could possibly make you unhappy?

482
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,356
Tell me now

483
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,529
I can't come home with you."

484
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,289
"So many people take advantage of me"

485
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,457
she said.

486
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,100
People take advantage of you?
I was thinking

487
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,799
how can someone with money
fame and family...

488
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,562
be taken advantage of?

489
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,435
Why are you being so petty?

490
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,700
I told her to relax.

491
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,307
"You need to be more like me
more optimistic.

492
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,542
Nothing's too important
every problem can be resolved

493
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,715
You must look after yourself.

494
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,114
Be strong

495
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,013
nobody can take advantage of you."

496
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,709
At this point I arrived home

497
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:30,785
and got out.

498
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:31,987
I said, "I'll call you tomorrow."

499
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,316
But the next day she had killed herself!

500
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,490
Chinese communities
across the world were shocked

501
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,231
Thousands attended her funeral
in Hong Kong

502
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,739
For a long time I felt so bad
about this news

503
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,273
...that I cried whenever
anybody mentioned it.

504
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,001
I still couldn't believe it.

505
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,339
One of the reasons I was so sad...

506
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,175
is that I started to realize

507
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,880
Sometimes what we are chasing
isn't actually

508
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,986
what we want.

509
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:11,559
I don't believe
she meant to kill herself.

510
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:16,427
I think there may have been
a small intention

511
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,393
On the other hand,

512
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,230
it was meant mainly...

513
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,235
as a warning to her husband.

514
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,033
'Blue and Black' is an exceptional film

515
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,612
because it is Lin Dai's
last unfinished film.

516
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,606
Shaw found a Lin Dai look-alike

517
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,681
Do Dip

518
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,352
I think that with the help
of cosmetic surgery

519
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,027
they made her look more like Lin Dai

520
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,592
...to finish the film.

521
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,124
By the time of Lin Dai's death
in 1964...

522
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,765
Run Run Shaw had begun to gather together

523
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,836
a stable of young actresses
with an eye to the future

524
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,102
He started an acting school for them

525
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,434
and housed them in purpose-built
dormitory blocks

526
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,803
on the studio lot

527
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,509
The new dormitory blocks had a few floors

528
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,478
It was for Yueh Hua, Lily Ho

529
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,344
Chan Ping, Jenny Wu, Li Qing

530
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,517
We lived together on that floor

531
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,385
It used to be quite big actually

532
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,557
There were 2 or 3 bedrooms
and a living room

533
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,288
So, other actors...

534
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,524
Their flat may be smaller

535
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,861
With only one bedroom

536
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:30,371
I mean
it used to be different for everyone

537
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,804
We listen to everything

538
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,242
We look to their living quarters

539
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,178
their comfortable living

540
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,516
their dresses

541
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,422
their social problems

542
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,016
The only thing that we cannot control...

543
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,785
is their loving affairs

544
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,727
Mr. Shaw found his starlet
by holding open auditions

545
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,534
Anyone could apply

546
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,828
Auditions were held not just in Hong Kong

547
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,139
His biggest star for the next generation

548
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,773
he found in Taiwan

549
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,733
Her name was Lily Ho

550
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,743
Lily Ho was a product of the 60's...

551
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,643
and of direct appeal to
Hong Kong's youthful audience

552
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,849
In search of that audience

553
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,144
Run Run Shaw starred her

554
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,082
in a series of modern roles

555
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,755
They're really rough customers!

556
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,425
Join them and find out what's up

557
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,977
Angel With The Iron Fists aped
just about every aspect

558
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,840
of the James Bond thrillers newly
released in the West

559
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,177
Got a light?

560
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,621
'Flying Horse Nightclub'

561
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,827
Lily Ho plays Agent 009

562
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,724
assigned to break-up the Devil girls

563
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,899
...a group of glamorous female gangsters

564
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,964
Find out where the headquarters is!

565
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,159
Then blow it up!

566
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,497
We'll be right behind you!

567
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,002
We'll capture them all

568
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,333
I'll try my best!

569
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,103
I have a couple of things for you!

570
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,479
Take this handbag

571
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,914
If you press here...

572
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,010
bullets will be fired from both sides

573
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,986
It's lethal within 20 yards

574
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,356
She infiltrates the gang

575
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,493
where failure carries a heavy price

576
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,019
The corrupt member of the group...

577
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,957
will now be punished

578
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,349
The masquerade is over.

579
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,113
Stand up!

580
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,488
What's the meaning of this?

581
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,192
She isn't Lona!

582
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,723
She is a cop!

583
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,754
Who are you anyway?

584
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,468
Agent 009!

585
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,796
I'll teach you a lesson!

586
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,201
Grab her

587
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,407
Among her peers at that time...

588
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:30,110
Lily Ho was the most feminine.

589
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,752
Cheng Pei Pei is young...

590
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,925
and pure

591
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,861
...and Chun Ping is more submissive
and soft

592
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,462
On the other hand...

593
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,731
Lily's striking feature
is her mature feminine side

594
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:56,270
Hong Kong's nights are uniquely beautiful

595
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,311
Those 3 actresses Lily Ho
Cheng Pei Pei and Chun Ping

596
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,949
co-starred in the 1967 musical

597
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,382
Hong Kong Nocturne

598
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,755
Hong Kong is a lovers' paradise

599
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:18,033
Love, like mist, covers blemishes

600
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,295
After their family conjuring
act breaks up

601
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,440
three sisters pursue
their separate careers and loves

602
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,305
Lily Ho's character...

603
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,035
aspires to be a film actress

604
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,736
...but is duped by a conman

605
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,380
Which dress should I wear?

606
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,514
No dress required

607
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,309
No. I mean, which dress should I wear?

608
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,010
Western dress or oriental cheongsam?

609
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,353
No dress!

610
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,060
No clothes at all!

611
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,461
She ends up as a singer in a nightclub!

612
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,693
Woman

613
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,666
Woman

614
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,933
Woman

615
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,173
She's a masterpiece of creation

616
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,475
She's the devil incarnate

617
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,850
she's the devil incarnate

618
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,449
Let me go, let go of me!

619
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,321
There she is rescued by a musician...

620
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,722
with whom she falls in love

621
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,863
But the conflict of marriage and career

622
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,057
Chinese girls of the time...

623
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,998
were not expected to have both

624
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,695
...means they decide to part!

625
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,969
Good bye!

626
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,635
I love you, I always will!

627
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,142
You're the most gifted person...

628
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,749
I've ever met

629
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,383
I wish you every success

630
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,787
Thank you

631
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,027
I'll remember your words

632
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,969
In the end, the three sisters
come together again...

633
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,195
to for a song-&-dance partnership

634
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,367
and the film ends with...

635
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,598
a grand Broadway style production number

636
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,503
Sing!

637
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,301
Dance!

638
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,205
Sing!

639
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,174
Dance!

640
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,041
Dance! Sing!

641
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,977
Hold your head high and strive on

642
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,246
Let no barriers stop your advance

643
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,947
New dancers and singers must arise

644
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,323
Let the world sing with music

645
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,427
Despite her association with...

646
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,831
these modern Western-influenced films

647
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,630
one of Lily Ho's best remembered roles

648
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,137
was in a period drama

649
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,570
...'Intimate Confessions Of
A Chinese Courtesan'

650
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,035
Boss

651
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,445
What's up, done with the checking?

652
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,047
Almost

653
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,446
She plays the part of Ai Nu

654
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,350
...a girl abducted
and sold into prostitution

655
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,987
When she refuses to cooperate

656
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,922
the beautiful brothel owner, Madam Jian

657
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,094
played by Betty

658
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,696
tries to whip her into submission

659
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,929
But there is a deeper sexual
undercurrent at play

660
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,240
You know... you are very beautiful

661
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:19,910
It seems I'm falling in love with you

662
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,585
In an ancient film, there was

663
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,152
actually such a movie

664
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,699
In the movie

665
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,632
Lily Ho paired with a girl
called Betty who came from Taiwan

666
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:49,538
It certainly was a breakthrough

667
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,849
to have some lesbian scenes

668
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,880
In that era...

669
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,489
Like the historical epics of Hong Kong

670
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:05,023
...it had never happened before

671
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,761
I think the performance of Lily Ho

672
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,398
is unhampered by conventions

673
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,031
So I think...

674
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,372
her performance is very sucessful

675
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,044
Four of the brothel's clients bid for...

676
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,508
Ai Nu's virginity

677
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,306
...and she is drugged into submission

678
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,077
Ai Nu attempts to escape but is caught

679
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,813
And you...

680
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,425
do you want to die?

681
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,557
If not, you will obey me

682
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,166
She decides it's better to live
for revenge than die

683
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,730
All right, I'll obey you

684
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,171
She agrees to comply;

685
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,209
Not only with the requirements
of the job, but...

686
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,507
with her employer's sexual tastes

687
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:41,086
In the beginning there was hatred

688
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,485
and then they developed
a lesbian relationship

689
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:49,223
Enmity surfaces again in the climax

690
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,561
It's a very complicated and interesting...

691
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,169
...character

692
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,872
Once established, and in demand...

693
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,234
Ai Nu takes revenge on the four men

694
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,240
who bid for her

695
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,077
Wei Chien Chung

696
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,811
Remember the first time you took me?

697
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,847
You too had tied me up then

698
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,856
From that time, I swore...

699
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:21,154
I would tie you up

700
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,525
and kill you

701
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,501
Now my chance has come!

702
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,742
This character was a good opportunity
for Lily Ho

703
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,048
So, to many people
it's a very strong film.

704
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,156
Intimate Confessions
Of A Chinese Courtesan...

705
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,088
foreshadowed a relaxation
in the laws of censorship,

706
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,591
...which would noticeably
affect the films...

707
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,161
of the 1970's

708
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,033
Li Han Hsiang who had directed

709
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,931
many of Shaws' historical epics...

710
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,500
...like 'The Kingdom And The Beauty'

711
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,641
now turned his hand to erotic films

712
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,709
known in Chinese as Fung Yue
or Wind-Moon films

713
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,072
What is this?

714
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:15,283
It's a Burmese bell

715
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,750
What's it for?

716
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,425
I performed in many fung yue films

717
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,293
...with director Li.

718
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,535
I've always been very self-confident

719
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,438
I'm not concerned
with what other people think.

720
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,837
Tanny Chen Li,

721
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,533
1seen here in the 1974 film 'Golden Lotus'

722
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,679
was one of Shaw's more prominent stars

723
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,347
who appeared in erotic cinema

724
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,680
To me,

725
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,944
if I couldn't perform in...

726
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,314
many different genres of film...

727
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,353
I would not be a good actress.

728
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,115
In terms of exposing myself...

729
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,226
I knew where to draw the line.

730
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,496
In 'Golden Lotus'
the other star was Hu Chien...

731
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,690
who made seven erotic films for Shaws

732
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,463
Hu plays wife no. 5

733
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,729
to the priapic womanizer Ching Hei-Men

734
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,932
a man who takes what he wants from women
But

735
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,772
there's a moral to the story as
what finally kills him

736
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,274
He is a surfeit of sex

737
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,379
from wife no. 5

738
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,755
Now Ching Hei-Men is dead

739
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,983
He died of too much sex and wine

740
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,887
He was an official and a landlord

741
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,893
But he was also a gangster, a hoodlum

742
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,897
And a sex maniac!

743
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,802
Such moral lessons in 'Fung-Yue' films...

744
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,499
left little to disguise
that soft-porn appeal

745
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,804
In 'Moods Of Love' the temptations
of a Buddhist monk

746
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,280
...well presented as a moralstruggle
for him

747
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,215
transparently offers the audience
something quite different

748
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,714
You're likely to catch a cold

749
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,629
Actually, I didn't depict much of...

750
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,592
a sexual expression

751
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:12,835
But there's a scene where...

752
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,971
I clutch my Buddha necklace tightly

753
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,264
and let it fall apart

754
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,580
So that it was expressed
in such restrained way

755
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,057
and not by any overt action

756
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,467
Sex scenes today and in the past
are quite different

757
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,635
They used to focus a lot of...

758
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,462
facial expressions in close-up.

759
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,233
The director would teach you

760
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,536
"you need to glimpse left

761
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,112
and smirk and go...

762
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,748
like this."

763
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,076
And we'd do just that.

764
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,947
We thought it was funny...

765
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,485
because most of the directors
were macho men

766
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,951
...showing us these feminine moves.

767
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,120
But in 1978

768
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,798
with a more liberal attitude
towards sex...

769
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,627
censorship rules were relaxed

770
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:23,168
You couldn't show the private
parts of a woman

771
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,272
But it was alright for the back

772
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:35,484
And the male actor wasn't allowed to...

773
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,453
touch the sensitive regions of the actress

774
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,481
You know what I mean

775
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:46,761
Later, the front of a woman's body
was allowed

776
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,663
However, touching wasn't permitted

777
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,370
Run Run Shaw tailored his films...

778
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,706
to the changing tastes of his audience

779
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,410
His leading ladies
starred in historical epics

780
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,778
in operas

781
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,178
dramas

782
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,319
musicals

783
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:12,980
the erotic

784
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,857
In the late 60's

785
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,288
he had added another genre...

786
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,655
usually more associated with male actors

787
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,323
Martial Arts

788
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,272
I'll settle the bill for one
who is sitting there

789
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,740
Alright

790
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,609
Reckon won't be able to leave
this place alive today

791
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,514
For one rising young star...

792
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,842
it was to herald the breakthrough
of her life

793
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,151
Cheng Pei Pei was just 19
when she was cast

794
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,522
to play the lead in King Hu's
'Come Drink With Me'

795
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:53,856
Cheng Pei Pei...

796
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,295
is a very dedicated actress.

797
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,260
She is quite different...

798
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,137
from other actresses.

799
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,806
She is a very down-to-earth sort

800
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,004
...doesn't wear much make-up.

801
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,943
She's very serious about her work...

802
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,635
and she's very punctual.

803
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,547
In 'Come Drink With Me'

804
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,480
Cheng plays a legendary swordswoman
Golden Swallow

805
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,519
...trying to release her brother
being held hostage

806
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,022
She has a very strong dancing background

807
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,390
...very good at ballet.

808
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,067
So...

809
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,599
when she's working on martial arts scenes

810
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,272
her movements are like dancing

811
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,672
...very beautiful postures.

812
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,802
She was a trained ballet dancer...

813
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,038
who learned her martial arts on the set

814
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,943
Director King Hu had chosen her

815
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,584
over a more established actress

816
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,218
Looking back on 'Come Drink With Me'

817
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,654
Director Hu had a good vision.

818
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,255
He could make me portray...

819
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,755
a convincing female fighter.

820
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,619
'Come Drink With Me'
is widely considered...

821
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,026
as one of the greatest
swordplay films ever

822
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,167
...and it propelled
Cheng Pei Pei to stardom

823
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,861
'Come Drink With Me'
has influenced me a great deal.

824
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,536
Because of 'Come Drink With Me'...

825
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,332
because of the character Golden Swallow...

826
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,011
I'm still working in action films.

827
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,245
But Cheng's career
had begun quite differently

828
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,874
Her first film
made when she was only 17...

829
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,315
was the Huang-Mei Opera
'The Lotus Land'

830
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,514
...in which she played the male part

831
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,815
opposite the great Lin Dai

832
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,729
I'm not suited to...

833
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,160
cross-gender acting.

834
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,527
Even though I'm tall and sturdy...

835
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,462
I can't imitate the aura of...

836
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,162
a real man.

837
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,306
Ling Po was much better at this.

838
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,906
So my cross-gender acting...

839
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,100
was not very successful.

840
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,445
Also I was quite young

841
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,480
...only 16 or 17

842
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,912
I had too much of a babyface.

843
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,717
In the second part of the film...

844
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,353
my character has aged

845
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,717
So I had to wear a false beard

846
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,993
and it was even less convincing.

847
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,422
Shaws deliberately promoted
Cheng Pei Pei's

848
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,065
...innocent youthfulness
and girl-next-door demeanor

849
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,092
Before 'Come Drink With Me'

850
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,600
she looked set to be the queen
of teen romance

851
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,598
But her success as a swordswoman...

852
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,798
changed all that

853
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,376
By 1969

854
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,209
the press had nominated her
'Queen Of Martial Arts'

855
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,361
Two years after 'Come Drink With Me'

856
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,395
she repeated the same character
in Golden Swallow

857
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,998
But under a different director
Chang Cheh

858
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,494
Little Roc

859
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:54,105
Don't you realise you're the one I love?

860
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,009
Chang believed that martial arts
was about masculinity

861
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,809
and relegated Cheng Pei Pei's role to...

862
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,852
second place love-interest behind
his hero Silver Roc

863
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,350
...played by Wang Yueh

864
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:07,751
Of course it bothered me!

865
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,520
But looking back now...

866
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,590
guess I shouldn't be bothered.

867
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,995
'Come Drink With Me' is
simply 'Come Drink With Me'

868
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,828
but in fact I'm really famous
for Golden Swallow.

869
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,400
However I was bothered for...

870
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,336
another reason.

871
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,707
When director Chang first asked me
to do this film...

872
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,207
he didn't tell it the way it was

873
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,382
So I felt a little deceived...

874
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,349
by him.

875
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,351
I was upset

876
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,283
...so I never went and saw the film.

877
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,654
Today Cheng Pei Pei rehearses
one of her daughters

878
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,420
for a stage performance

879
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,525
She left Shaws in 1973

880
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,226
when she married
and immigrated to America

881
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,639
From a certain perspective...

882
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,171
I left when I was at my peak.

883
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,472
If I had carried on...

884
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,573
maybe I could have gone further.

885
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,553
But if I had chosen that way...

886
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,654
I wouldn't have my four kids, and...

887
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,184
I would have missed out
on many beautiful experiences.

888
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,427
But Cheng Pei Pei did
return to the cinema

889
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,998
And is now internationally known...

890
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,795
for the role as the wicked swordswoman
Jade Fox...

891
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,469
in Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger
Hidden Dragon'

892
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,233
Cheng Pei Pei has every intention...

893
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,038
that the tradition of the swordswoman
should live on

894
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,509
With plans to cast her daughter

895
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,410
in a sequel to 'Come Drink With Me'...

896
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,480
recreating for a new generation...

897
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,051
one of the great heroines

898
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,915
of the Shaws Studio at its height.

899
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,163
In the mid 1980's

900
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,269
Run Run Shaw moving with the market...

901
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,200
wound down his film-making business

902
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,171
and turned the Studios over to
television production

903
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,634
For almost 20 years

904
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,041
over 800 films lay in the vault...

905
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,546
slowly deteriorating!

906
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
It seemed as if
the great performances of...

907
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,089
Shaw's screen goddesses were
never to be seen again

908
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,783
But in 2001...

909
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,053
the library was bought...

910
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,958
with a purpose of re-releasing the films

911
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,990
Now they would be digitally remastered...

912
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,464
to restore them to their original quality

913
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:38,001
Hold your head high and strive on

914
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,234
Let no barriers stop your advance

915
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,242
New dancers and singers must arise

916
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,813
It means younger generations...

917
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,447
can now watch the mandarin films
from the time.

918
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,180
Shaws were a movie empire

919
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,580
and they'll be able to see...

920
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,814
those achievements.

921
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,323
Thanks to 21st century technology

922
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,522
the golden age of Hong Kong Cinema

923
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,895
...is now safely preserved
for posterity

924
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,663
Making the screen goddesses
of the Shaw Studio...

925
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,066
truly immortal.

926
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,513
I'd really like to see...

927
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,483
the films I acted in

928
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,316
to see how I look in them

929
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,786
It's already been a few decades, right?

930
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,650
I can see when I was young,

931
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,849
what do I look like

932
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,157
I'm not as pretty as I used to be

933
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,592
I'd like to see how beautiful...

934
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,596
I once was.
