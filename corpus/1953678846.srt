00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>Southeast Asia became a Haven for biotechnology
companies who wanted to circumvent regulations.</i>

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,500
<i>A highly infectious pathogens from a research
institution is spreading in an urban area.</i>

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>The infection is on the rise
and turns people into rabid sick.</i>

4
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,100
<i>The city is quarantined.</i>

5
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:46,644
You'll have to move fast...
In and out, no more then a day.

6
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,816
And do not believe what you may have
heard, there is nothing hidden there now.

7
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:03,025
We model the life cycle of the infection...

8
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,578
the host population has devastated the city is dying.

9
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,413
Then why do you need me?

10

I've read your file.
Mogadishu 93 is Delta Force.

11
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:17,944
You can get through the military
blockade, no one will ever know...

12
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,728
What's the target?

13
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:35,648
My daughter is in there.

14
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:40,027
I need you to find her and bring her out.
I don't care what it cost.

15
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:44,992
Once you're in the zone, I promise
you there be nothing to fear.

16
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,639
Is that right?

17
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,558
Haul it!

18
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:01,771

Come in Traeger.
Where are you?

24
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:56,323
- <i>No, this is-- this is-- Broadus, Max.</i>
- Broadus, where's Traeger?

25
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:00,827
- Where's Traeger?
- <i>Traeger is dead, it's just us now.</i>

26
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:04,539
- Just who? Who else is dead?
- <i>All of them!</i>

27
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,793
<i>They ate them, right in front of
our eyes, they fucking ate them.</i>

28
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:13,380
- Location... Broadus, where are you?
- <i>I don't know... I.. I'm cut off.</i>

29
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,926
<i>There everywhere, Man.</i>

30
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:19,970
- <i>I need backup</i>
- There is no backup, listen to me.

31
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:24,350
Head North, look for the sun, find a pick-up zone...
North, you hear me?

32
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,354
<i>Yes, sir. I-- I got it. North.</i>

33
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:32,565
Broadus, my Ducati says I get there first.

34
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,987
Meet me there, the bike is yours.

35
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,740
Okay, where are we?

36
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:45,662
- Should be-- about-- here.
- They like the big boulevards.

37
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:48,789
- We go this way.
- Why that way?
- Ammo!

38
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,024
Yeah, but Chief. We got a
straight shot to that piece...

39
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,106
- right there...
- Yeah brother call in.

40
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,107
Tell me there is hot coffee, I might do it!

41
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:59,530
The sun is already up, the bird is coming.

42
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,301
Shit Yeah, okay.

43
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:04,681
Okay I'm on point, Smiley take the rear.

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,405
Where low, and the low story is... I'm out.

45
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:14,522
Plenty of reason to hold fire till absolutely necessary.

46
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:17,776
So, you really give your Ducati to Broadus?

47
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,986
Hell no!!

48
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:51,825
Oh, shit.

49
00:07:57,997 --> 00:07:59,706
Come on.

50
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:12,051
There are all over the place!

51
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,659

00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:09,523
- That's it, I'm out.
- Ditto... Goddammit!

55
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,739
Okay boys. Let's go.

56
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,791
Hey... You're okay?

57
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:37,424
- Hey, chief!
- I'm okay man! I'm okay...

58
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,221
Just get me back to the bird, get me to a Doc!

59
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:48,352
- No, Max.
- Hernandez...

60
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,604
There's our bird.

61
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:56,568
He's going for it!

62
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,643
Max...

63
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,604
Tough luck.

64
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:03,882
- What was that?
- Come on.
- You let him go?

65
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:11,264
- This whole fucking thing was fucked,
- Yeah!

66
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,355
- They lied to us, man.
- I know.

67
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:27,267
This whole Goddamned thing was a waste.

68
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:30,266
- We never had a chance.
- Shut up Smile, you made it!

69
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:35,786
- We made it.
- I'm not going!

70
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,840
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Completing the mission...

71
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,268
Are you crazy man?

72
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,229
- I got to find her.
- She ​​ain't there, Max.

73
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,819
- We don't know that.
- She's... dead, man!

74
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:54,096
Gatling... you're one stupid son of a bitch.

75
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,584
Broadus, are you receiving?

76
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,588
Broadus?

77
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,300
The bird is off, I repeat, the bird is off...

78
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,929
Heading for the treasure chest...
Over...

79
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:26,094
Gatling... You're a stupid son of a bitch.

80
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,702
Get on!

81
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,019
Inside.

82
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:39,163
Sit down.

83
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,561
That's mine!

84
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,235
You better reload.

85
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,657
- These are bad for you.
- So is life.

86
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:21,537
Where have you been? Around.

87
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:26,042
- Here?
- We don't come here much.

88
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:42,097
Fuck's your problem?! Not getting any
lately, well don't look at me, old man.

89
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:47,478
You're not my type... Jude.

90
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:54,734
- How do you know...
- Been looking for you.

91
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:02,908
- Where did you get this?
- Your Father.

92
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,661
- He sent you?
- Don't get excited...

93
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:11,792
Fuck him. He put me here.
You know who he is?

94
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:16,922
It's all his fault, you know.
All of this shit. He's an asshole!

95
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,969
Sounds right.

96
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,725
I hope it cost a lot.

97
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,690
It did... Your worth it?

98
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:42,279
- What is your name?
- Major Max Gatling.

99
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,576
- It's just you?
- Do you see anybody else?

100
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:52,915
- How did you even get into the zone?
- We're in.

101
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:57,545
- The question is, how do we get out?
- Oh, do we?

102
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:03,506
- You want to go, don't you?
- No, I like hanging

103
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,495
out were everone, I know want's to eat me...

104
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,723
- Just checking.
- Yeah, I wanna go.

105
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:16,020
But not-- if I'm gonna get shot or blown up...
Oh no...

106
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:21,192
- Can you really do it?
- I, can do it.

107
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:27,907
Okay... Max!

108
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:32,578
I take you to the others.

109
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,455
The others?

110
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:41,085
Yeah... You better promise you
wont say anything about my dad?

111
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,309
Duke!

112
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:04,608
- She's not here.
- You sure?

113
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:08,570
- We've checked everywhere.
- Did something get inside?

114
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:12,532
- I don't think so.
- That's reassuring.

115
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:17,453
So you don't have any idea, where she could have gone?

116
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:20,165
It's Jude...

117
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:47,189
This should be good?

118
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,401
Didn't anybody, see anything?

119
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:52,654
Not me?

120
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:58,909
- Duke, I want to look for her.
- Outside? No!

121
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,371
- She could be in trouble.
- You just said you wouldn't know where to look.

122
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:05,624
- We can't just sit here.
- Clearly. She doesn't want you to know.

123
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,795
Duke! Yo, Duke!
You're not gonna believe this.

124
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:15,572
Jude!

125
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:20,554
Jude... you have a friend.

126
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:25,392
- Yeah Jude, who is that?
- A very-- large-- friend?

127
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:33,276
- Everyone, this is Major Max Gatling.
- Major?

128
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:38,030
- He's gonna save our arses.
- Really?

129
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:44,078
Well... that really is
something, if it's true?

130
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:48,372
Pleasure to meet you, Major.

131
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:52,544
Do you... have the gift of speech?

132
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,174
Nice jacket.

133
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,137
Your the first unafflicted
person, we've seen in some time.

134
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:06,764
- Is this everone?
- I'm afraid so, all that's left.

135
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:08,559
Except you, of course.

136
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,936
Let me introduce our entrapped band of survivors.

137
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,062
Reese.

138
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:15,232
Lynn.

139
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,359
Elvis.

140
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,740
- And not least of all, Anna.
- Hello.
- Welcome to Hell, Major.

141
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:29,163
Were the damned.
You're one of us now.

142
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:33,875
You can't be to careful.

143
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:37,086
You had us all worried, Jude.

144
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:41,465
- Sorry, Duke.
- Do you might explaining the purpose of your little surgent?

145
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:43,258
Clear. She's clear too.

146
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,489
What was it, that was so important you had to go out

147
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,638
shopping alone?
- It doesn't matter, she's back now.

148
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,475
We have rules.
Rules that are important for our survival.

149
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:54,977
I'm sure, Major Gatling here
is familiar with the concept.

150
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:57,273
You put us all in danger.

151
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:06,154
But then how can I stay mad at you, Jude?
Just don't do it again.

152
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:11,369
- Sure.
- Major, talk in my office.

153
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,421
- What's going on.
- Can we do this later.

154
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:25,713
You just take off, you don't say anything to me at all?

155
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,696
What does it matter.

156
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:29,741
What are you talking about, of course
it matters. Who the hell is that guy?

157
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:33,681
- I told you.
- You just happend to find him out there?
- Yeah!

158
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:37,475
- How stupid do I look?
- Let me think.

159
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:40,396
Hey, would you tell the truth!!

160
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:45,756
He picked me up... with his
great big motorcycle.

161
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,965
- And we went back to his place.
- Hey... that's not funny.

162
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:50,933
So much for the truth.

163
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,075
- Jude, Jude...
- What!

164
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,207
Oh, I didn't find him.
He found me.

165
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:12,594
Those I can't resist... that's our Jude.

166
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:16,055
Make yourself at home, Major.

167
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:20,393
- Cigar?
- No thanks.

168
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:27,942
Drink?... Only the good stuff.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

169
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,819
You got coffee?

170
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:37,157
Confiture... Sugar? Cream?
Powdered... all we can do.

171
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:39,056
Black.

172
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:43,811
Black, okay... Anna, would you mind making
the Mayor, a cup of coffee please.

173
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:52,089
So, Major Gatling.

174
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,552
Retired... I presumed you're with
some kind of a paramilitary.

175
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:02,975
- Private.
- Is there a difference?
- There pussy's.

176
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:07,687
I'm an arsehole.

177
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:11,440
- So, what do I do?
- Don't be an arsehole, bro.

178
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,082
Hey... thank you very much for that.

179
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,217
Uh, ancient chinese wisdom.
That's-- that's beautiful...

180
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,682
I could have used a man like you a couple of

181
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:23,499
months ago, Major...
- You weren't here then were you?

182
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:28,165
- How long?
- 14 days.

183
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:32,295
Must come in from above, the only safe way.

184
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:39,176
Gone through a... lot of
trouble for one man.

185
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,345
Must of been more, huh...
A team?

186
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:48,393
I say, there all gone?
Huh... Last man standing Major.

187
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,813
- Why are you here?
- The girl.

188
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,357
Jude?

189
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,735
- What is so special about her?
- Somebody wants her.

190
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,029
Who?

191
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,865
Couldn't say.

192
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:10,956
- Just her? No one else?
- Nothing personal.

193
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:30,558
The city, outlined area's all still
completely infested, but you found that out.

194
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:36,564
Blockade, remote surveillance, tanks.

195
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:41,152
Troop positions. This is good.

196
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:46,615
Should be, paid for it in
blood... Bloody useless.

197
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:50,368
Might as well be... a map to Shangri La.

198
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:54,622
Damned if we do... Damned if we don't.

199
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:02,506
I know what you're thinking, Major.
It can't be done.

200
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,842
- Maybe you could.
- We've tried everything.

201
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,721
Every possible route.
Each time we came back fewer.

202
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:16,185
It's impossible... There is no
way out of the infection zone.

203
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:20,104
All we can do is survive.
Outlive the virus.

204
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:22,315
You'll might as well get used to it, Major.

205
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:26,736
Any other idea's will just gets people killed.
Like your man.

206
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:31,366
I won't lose any more people.
You understand, Major?

207
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:56,098
Get out!

208
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:06,775
Shit, girl!

209
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,840
Please... don't tell him.

210
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:32,006
We-- don't normally stand in ceremony
here, but-- this is a special occasion.

211
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:34,759
To our lovely chefs.

212
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,472
To the French for inventing canned food... and there wine.

213
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:44,269
...And to new friends, and fallen comrades.

214
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,147
Awesome, let's eat.

215
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:52,193
Where you from, Major?

216
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,235
Victorville.

217
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:57,947
- You kill a lot of zombies?
- What's your problem?
- I'm just asking.

218
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:59,949
They're not zombies.

219
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,160
The Infection invades the sediba and
may kills the Hydrocordian functions.

220
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,560
- Brain dead.
- Yeah, but mostly there not walking around...

221
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:06,936
- Gentlemen...
- Zombies...

222
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,250
When are we leaving?

223
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:13,797
- Nobody is going anywhere.
- Why not?
- Nothing has changed.

224
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,383
Bullshit... Tell him, Max.

225
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:21,762
- Major Gatling knows only to well.
- I don't.

226
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:26,017
Didn't he tell you? His
men, they didn't make it.

227
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,062
Oh no, Jude.

228
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,949
You heard the man. No
spa's, no pedicures.

229
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:36,650
What would poor Bambi and Thumper do?

230
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:40,779
- Hey screw you.
- Okay everyone, calm down.

231
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,035
What matters... Is that were safe here.

232
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:49,284
Oh-- safe?
It's-- ground zero of a pandemic.

233
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:51,144
That can end human life as we know it.

234
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,667
But maybe I would't call that "safe".

235
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,796
Thanks.

236
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:02,215
Oh, by the way, where going shopping... tomorrow for fuel.

237
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:04,454
I hope, I can count on you Major?

238
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,267
Why not?

239
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,962
What are you doing?

240
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,845
Take me when you go.

241
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,322
Duke.

242
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,951
Why did he come for you?

243
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,787
Me?

244
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:19,792
- So he says.
- I don't know.

245
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,254
I think you do.

246
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:31,836
- Were not going, so...
- ...In time, you must believe that.

247
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:35,624
Whatever...

248
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:42,396
You can talk to me.
You know that.

249
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,859
Sure.

250
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,280
Who are you?

251
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,951
Nobody.

252
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:33,903
Hi.

253
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:45,956
You're were gone, and I-- I just freaked so.

254
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,042
Sorry.

255
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,589
Jude... Hey, what's wrong?

256
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:06,893
- What is it? What?
- My father sent him.

257
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:09,771
Major Gatling?

258
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:20,072
- He is sending for you, not... not us?
- You're a dick, right!

259
00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:31,041
- So, do the others know about, you know.
- He won't tell them.

260
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,719
Now I don't feel so guilty about
sleeping with the boss his daughter.

261
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,139
No guilt, nothing.

262
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:56,064
Where did you even find that guy?
Super Soldier factory? Or what?

263
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:58,234
Are you intimidated?

264
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:01,779
- How big is his bike?
- Huge.

265
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:04,239
Really?

266
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,494
Maybe Duke's wrong.

267
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:13,790
He's keeping us alive this long, we've got to trust him.

268
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:18,626
You don't want to go. You love
It, you think you're a warrior.

269
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,797
I am a warrior.

270
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:38,480
They say a swordsman that never
draws his sword... is a true master.

271
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:42,776
They don't know shit about zombies!

272
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,660
We had good luck with the SOV Force,
so that's where were going.

273
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,459
Pick up some more can's.

274
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,798
Now I got some extra muscle, I wanna
get as much fuel as possible.

275
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:12,304
- Jude, I didn't ask you to come along.
- Like I stayed behind!

276
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:17,850
- Anything to add, Major?
- It's your show.

277
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,686
Let's go.

278
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:31,489
Elvis, you fill!

279
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,242
Four corners.

280
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:08,483
Run.

281
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:13,069
- What's going on?
- Were getting out of here!

282
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,030
- What about the others?
- There not coming, come on.

283
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:19,492
- I can't leave them!
- That's not my mission.

284
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:23,370
- So what?
- Do the math kid. Duke is not gonna stick with the plan.

285
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:25,137
Even if the others decided against him.

286
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:28,000
There a liability...
We've got to be invisible.

287
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:30,460
- You lied.
- Never said I take them.

288
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:34,257
- You said you were alone.
- I am.

289
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:39,804
We can do this easy or hard.
You're going home, Jude-- home...

290
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:43,308
Yeah.

291
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,357
No, let go!

292
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,069
Hey, take your hands of her!

293
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:05,995
I would have come this way too.

294
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:31,853
What's going on? Duke.

295
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:39,403
You're to dangerous, Major.
You won't stop. You won't give up!

296
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:43,365
It's been a bind.

297
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:46,326
I know the feeling.

298
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:51,580
You think you're the first?
They've been others like you.

299
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:56,877
Plans, weapons.
And they all died.

300
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:04,509
You think you're different?
You think you're better?

301
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:08,930
You didn't listen Major?

302
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:12,391
I won't let any more of them die.

303
00:41:12,392 --> 00:41:17,522
I won't let you take any of them.
Not one, not any.

304
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,195
I can save them.

305
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:44,171
It's not that.

306
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,007
What's wrong?

307
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:48,969
Nothing, it's just stress.

308
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:59,561
I'm listening, Duke!

309
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,898
We can work this out.

310
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,817
- I'm not going to kill you.
- Then, get these off me.

311
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:11,114
I said, ...<i>I'm</i> not going to kill you!

312
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,702
I know something you don't?

313
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,955
Really?

314
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:24,501
But I tell you what? If you're still
here in the morning. I let you go.

315
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:25,878
Fair enough?

316
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,172
You're gonna burn.

317
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:32,092
Do you really think there is a
hell worse than this, Major?

318
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:37,828
It's no joke. there gonna torch the
city, Duke... Burn the infection out.

319
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:44,897
- You're Lying.
- Any day now. I take you with me.

320
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,356
You're desperate, Gatling.

321
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:50,151
- They've been discussing it for weeks.
- Who?

322
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:53,112
- My government. Their government.
- How do you know?

323
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:57,032
The girl, father's company who created the virus.

324
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:02,704
- He sent me to get her out.
- But she ran away from you. She doesn't wanna go.

325
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,206
- I didn't tell her.
- Really?

326
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:10,963
Well if that's the best you got, Major.
I'm afraid I have to love you and leave you.

327
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,758
Duke.

328
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,694
- What's happening?
- Well, she's sick.

329
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:40,074
I'm fine, just wanna clean up.

330
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:42,284
I'll go.

331
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:01,136
Oh, no!

332
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,821
Hey buddy... you don't look so good.

333
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,965
- Where's Max?
- He's gone.

334
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:27,885
He's dead?

335
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:36,309
- Major Gatling... chose to go his own way.
- Why would he do that?

336
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:39,813
It was his decision.

337
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,526
There is nothing more to say.

338
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:51,157
Is there, Jude?... More to say?

339
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,118
Like what?

340
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,663
That's what I thought.

341
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,793
Ah... Come, come.

342
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,854
What are you...?

343
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:10,357
Oh... Reese.

344
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:14,193
- Reese!
- You stay here.

345
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:17,822
- What are you doing?
- Stay here. Please. just... just stay.

346
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,953
You fucking told him!

347
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:10,705
Holy shit!

348
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:12,625
The axe!

349
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,716
Again.

350
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,513
Can you walk?

351
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:32,811
My gear.

352
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:54,539
Sorry.

353
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:02,005
I didn't know that they were gonna...

354
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:05,028
Well, I had a pretty good idea.
So you know...

355
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:07,078
I don't expect you to forgive me and all.

356
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:15,309
- Listen, I need to know something.
- There it comes.

357
00:49:15,726 --> 00:49:19,147
Can you really get Jude out?

358
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:22,816
Depends.

359
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:27,696
- What changed?
- She's pregnant.

360
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:32,284
Okay, I didn't know. I only just find out.

361
00:49:32,784 --> 00:49:38,205
So, she can't have it here. Okay, not in this.

362
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:41,028
I help you. Anything you say-- you know.
Look-- look.

363
00:49:41,056 --> 00:49:43,904
You don't even have to take me with you.
I don't give a shit.

364
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:46,839
Can you do it?

365
00:49:57,057 --> 00:49:59,600
Do you believe in God?

366
00:50:01,937 --> 00:50:06,609
Maybe there is... And this is really Hell.

367
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:18,201
- Do you believe in anything?
- I believe in my mission.

368
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,543
Do you got any kids?

369
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:31,757
Look, you gonna have to go
outside, if you wanna keep this up.

370
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,389
You know what, I tought someday--
but not so soon... A career and--

371
00:50:43,977 --> 00:50:48,355
I'm a Lab-Geek.
I do bacteria, not babies.

372
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:54,654
Zombies everywhere you look, and
you're scared of dirty diapers?

373
00:51:02,286 --> 00:51:04,579
They're not zombies.

374
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,961
She didn't tell me.

375
00:51:12,588 --> 00:51:15,924
Maybe she doesn't even wanna have the kid.

376
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:33,315
Thanks.

377
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:41,448
Now shut up.

378
00:51:58,089 --> 00:51:59,673
Where are you going?

379
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:02,092
- Out.
- Why?

380
00:52:02,093 --> 00:52:04,219
He's out there.

381
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:07,931
Who?

382
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:20,026
Come on, this way.

383
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:27,534
- Hold up.
- What-- what is it?

384
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,121
Let's take a look.

385
00:52:32,205 --> 00:52:34,831
So, let me get this straight.

386
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:38,137
Now it's Reese who's gone missing, and you who want

387
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:41,281
to go look for him.
- I mean what is it with you two?

388
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:45,675
- Oh please, no you stay put.
- Right.

389
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,509
Jude.

390
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,846
- What's going on?
- He didn't come back.

391
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,431
Jude!

392
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:54,391
I forbid it!

393
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:57,394
You really do believe that dom title, don't you?

394
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:00,732
Listen Jude... this is
stupid... you little fuck!

395
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:04,861
Duke, she is pregnant!

396
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:08,448
Shut your fucking mouth!

397
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,252
That's why you ran away from Gatling.

398
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:31,594
You wanted to be with the father.

399
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:36,433
Oh, sweet fucking jesus.

400
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:49,236
Robots?
Where they come from?

401
00:53:50,404 --> 00:53:52,321
Where are they going?

402
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:54,784
Come on!

403
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:10,506
Oh, no, no...

404
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:13,468
What's wrong?

405
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:18,806
- He said, there going to burn the city.
- What are you talking about?

406
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:24,437
They are going to burn this city and everybody in it!

407
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:31,151
Maybe there rescue robots.

408
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,494
Bad boys.

409
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:49,209
I think I know what they are.
That-- that-- huge refinery disaster, you remember.

410
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,047
They had a bunch of prototype robots working.

411
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:54,631
They all went berserk, shooting
people and tearing them apart.

412
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:58,552
No one got out alive.
It's got to be them.

413
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:03,556
Zombies... Killer robots?

414
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:05,682
Nice town you got here!

415
00:55:05,683 --> 00:55:09,311
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Obviously, I though he was lying.

416
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:11,981
Where is he?

417
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:14,733
Where is he, Duke?

418
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:17,277
Tied to a post.

419
00:55:17,278 --> 00:55:19,488
You fucking killed him?!

420
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:23,700
To protect you, would you say
as much about your own father?

421
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:26,369
Wait. Who?

422
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,038
Oh yes, there's more.

423
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:35,671
It's appears, that's Jude's father...
Cooked up this delightful plague of ours.

424
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:43,345
Gatling was coming for her, he was
never going to take anyone else.

425
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:46,096
You didn't give him a chance.

426
00:55:46,097 --> 00:55:50,476
He would have left us, all to burn.

427
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:54,104
What do they look like to you?

428
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,776
Robots.

429
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:02,363
What do they look like to you?

430
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,365
Soldiers.

431
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:10,704
Go!

432
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,791
What just happened?

433
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,094
Don't move.

434
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,431
Good-- good doggie...

435
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,561
Say what?

436
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:24,774
Do you require medical assistance?

437
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,487
- What, what-- what do you mean?
- Are you injured?

438
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,407
No.

439
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:35,785
Okay so, now what?

440
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:41,956
- What are you?
- Advanced utility robots.

441
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,668
Where do you come from?

442
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:51,174
These models where assembled at Midora
Industries Robotics Home... Tokyo.

443
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:55,053
- How did you get here?
- We walked.

444
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:59,014
- Are you dangerous?
- I do not understand.

445
00:57:59,015 --> 00:58:03,144
- Are you... gonna hurt us?
- No!

446
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:05,645
- Did you ever hurt anyone?
- Yes.

447
00:58:05,646 --> 00:58:07,607
- Did you ever killed anyone?
- Yes.

448
00:58:07,608 --> 00:58:08,858
Why did you do it?

449
00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:11,581
The operating code of all models in service on

450
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:14,362
the Midora deep crescent location was corrupted.

451
00:58:14,363 --> 00:58:18,200
Causing a system wide execution error.

452
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,619
You got that?

453
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:26,916
- So, what happened?
- The error was corrected.

454
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:30,421
- What about them?
- I do not understand.

455
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,588
Well there dead?
You killed them.

456
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:36,425
- They are not people.
- How do you know that?

457
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:40,136
Sensory devices indicate normal
thermal values are to low.

458
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:42,013
They are not people.

459
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:44,850
It means there to cold.

460
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:48,729
- Can I touch you?
- Yes.

461
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:53,441
Woo, serious nerd'gasm.

462
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:00,491
- So, what's your mission?
- We are awaiting instruction.

463
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,952
Well... I think we gonna
get along, just fine.

464
00:59:04,953 --> 00:59:07,039
Jude!

465
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:10,999
- Jude!
- What!

466
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,044
Is it true?

467
00:59:13,169 --> 00:59:15,795
That my dad created the zombie apocalypse.

468
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:19,716
- What can I say, worst Disneyland dad ever!
- You should have told us!

469
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:21,050
I have to find Reese.

470
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:23,386
- You're not going anywhere.
- Leave me... alone!

471
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:25,598
Jude!

472
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:40,945
How did it get inside?

473
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,574
I check the gate.

474
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:54,584
Anna.

475
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:14,852
Duke.

476
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:24,195
No!

477
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:49,052
There inside the gate.
There everywhere!

478
01:00:51,012 --> 01:00:53,430
What are we gonna do?

479
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:56,226
What, we gonna do?!

480
01:00:58,352 --> 01:01:00,438
What's that?

481
01:01:06,986 --> 01:01:08,821
Reese!

482
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:23,793
- You brought robots?
- It's cool, huh?

483
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:26,419
Say hello, boys.

484
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,338
- Hello.
- Hello... Hello.

485
01:01:29,756 --> 01:01:34,510
- Who is your commander?
- Major Max Gatling.

486
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:38,681
- What do we do zombies?
- We fucked them up, we fucked them up!

487
01:01:38,682 --> 01:01:40,725
That's right.

488
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:42,769
Who wants to get the hell outta here?

489
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,104
- Me!
- Me!

490
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,688
Let's go.

491
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:52,028
Bring what ever you can carry, the deadlier
the better. We move out in thirty minutes.

492
01:01:57,826 --> 01:02:00,828
I did it... to protect them.

493
01:02:01,454 --> 01:02:03,246
Sure.

494
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:08,919
Wait, wait... I need to know when
we get through this, do you...?

495
01:02:14,174 --> 01:02:18,679
- It was a mistake, I should not have left you out there.
- It's to late.

496
01:02:19,388 --> 01:02:21,765
Your taking him?

497
01:02:22,765 --> 01:02:27,104
Well he's the wingman, you're the Duke.

498
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:33,943
Who the fuck finds robots, who
the fuck finds robots anyway?!

499
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:38,529
I'm open to possibilities.
See you around, Duke.

500
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,699
Wait!
Wait, wait...

501
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,910
I can help you.

502
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:47,874
I mean, the map? I can read
the map, I'm the only one.

503
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:52,084
I mean... I've been out there. I
know what's going on out there.

504
01:02:52,085 --> 01:02:56,715
You got them, but... they got a army?

505
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:01,803
Get in!

506
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,348
You won't be sorry.

507
01:03:29,329 --> 01:03:31,248
Got, the love baby!

508
01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:02,986
Major?

509
01:04:09,868 --> 01:04:11,744
Keep moving.

510
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:18,000
Inside.

511
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:27,301
- Why are we stopping?
- We got work to do. Cover the gate.

512
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:30,388
You two, up there.

513
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:32,931
Let's go.

514
01:04:55,869 --> 01:05:00,249
Right, so... that should keep them
out for a while... And us in.

515
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,940
- Hey you-- brought-- brought Duke?
- Were best friends.
- Hey listen-- listen.

516
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:11,278
Are you sure about the fire bombing?
Jude's father told you?

517
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:14,741
Are you surprised?

518
01:05:14,804 --> 01:05:16,639
No!

519
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,808
It's the right thing to do.

520
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:24,480
Major, generator... powered up if you want.

521
01:05:26,941 --> 01:05:30,403
Here or here.

522
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:34,073
These are where the lines, the weakest.

523
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:40,411
Your call... Show me the
best way to get there.

524
01:05:41,788 --> 01:05:46,250
Still the matter of the ground troops?
How do you propose we do that?

525
01:05:46,251 --> 01:05:49,002
Decoys.

526
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:51,006
The robots!

527
01:06:13,194 --> 01:06:15,779
What do you think?

528
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:29,083
I like it.

529
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,145
Wicked.

530
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:44,697
We'll go tomorrow.

531
01:07:51,911 --> 01:07:55,749
Hanging with your friends?

532
01:08:07,218 --> 01:08:09,553
He never blink, you know.

533
01:08:13,474 --> 01:08:19,105
Machine-- versus-- machine.

534
01:08:20,147 --> 01:08:22,399
Who will win?

535
01:08:26,278 --> 01:08:29,823
You lose if you have a heart, right?

536
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:36,621
Don't worry, I can keep a secret.

537
01:08:36,788 --> 01:08:38,915
So I hear.

538
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:49,300
Can't even tell, except when I'm spewing all over myself.

539
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:56,264
I bet you're sorry, you took this mission.

540
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:59,643
I'm sorry, I didn't ask for more money.

541
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:06,066
Yeah, me too... My Dad, totally
bribed me to come for the summer.

542
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,277
You don't seem like the science type.

543
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:14,323
I'm-- well... One more strike
I'm out... type.

544
01:09:15,491 --> 01:09:19,536
My mission, had I chosen, to accept it...

545
01:09:19,537 --> 01:09:23,792
Was to get serious about my future.

546
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:29,421
You think, getting knocked up counts?

547
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:34,051
You can handle it.

548
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:38,304
How do you know?

549
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:42,058
I've been around, kid.

550
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:54,196
- I'm thinking about hugging you, Max.
- Not in front of the robot.

551
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:08,208
What are you looking at?

552
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:15,840
Okay, let's see what we got here...

553
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,230
What is it?

554
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,818
- Assuming Alpha 3-3.
- Huh?

555
01:10:36,693 --> 01:10:39,988
Automated return function.

556
01:10:40,531 --> 01:10:42,325
Auto... what?

557
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:49,997
- Unit malfunctioning.
- Crap!

558
01:10:49,998 --> 01:10:51,666
Weapons!

559
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,801
Fuck you!
You fucking can opener!

560
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:44,940
There still out there.
The robots are holding them off, on the street.

561
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:51,695
- Times up!
- Is that the fire bombing?

562
01:12:51,696 --> 01:12:53,949
Were dead!

563
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:59,747
They start in the centre and work there way out.

564
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:03,833
Come on!

565
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:05,919
There still out there!

566
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,671
Get in! Come on! Do it!

567
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:12,382
Where is he?

568
01:13:12,383 --> 01:13:14,510
You're okay?

569
01:13:17,012 --> 01:13:18,765
Seriously?

570
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:25,186
Drive!

571
01:13:25,187 --> 01:13:27,981
There is no engine!

572
01:13:31,109 --> 01:13:34,070
- Duke!
- He is dead.

573
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:38,032
- Are you sure?
- Uh-uh.

574
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:42,162
No, no, no...

575
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:47,081
- Where were going?
- We need cover, so we go deep.

576
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:49,751
- Ghost City!
- Not helping.

577
01:13:49,752 --> 01:13:51,961
No. We gotta go Ghost City.

578
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:56,050
It's really old. It's been sinking in the mud forever...
It goes real deep.

579
01:14:07,185 --> 01:14:10,145
Betrayal!!

580
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:14,192
I saved them! Max!...
I saved them...

581
01:14:44,971 --> 01:14:47,222
You hold them back.

582
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:07,258
There getting closer.

583
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,394
Look for stairs!

584
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:21,395
Guys, check it out!

585
01:16:22,813 --> 01:16:24,399
Come on!

586
01:16:25,484 --> 01:16:28,361
Elvis?!

587
01:16:28,903 --> 01:16:30,489
Stop!

588
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:36,285
No!

589
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:40,080
Careful, there might be more!

590
01:16:40,456 --> 01:16:42,082
No!

591
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:44,918
Lynn, he's gone!

592
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,506
Guys, guys they're coming!

593
01:16:51,799 --> 01:16:54,136
Let's go!

594
01:17:17,074 --> 01:17:19,659
Wait, you see that?
Up there.

595
01:17:38,385 --> 01:17:41,264
There everywhere!

596
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:06,694
Hey, it's you again.

597
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:09,988
Find Jude.

598
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:23,502
Jude!

599
01:20:38,473 --> 01:20:39,766
Hey!... Down here!

600
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:43,228
Reese, where's Jude?

601
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,439
Reese!

602
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,650
Jude.

603
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:52,111
Look out!

604
01:21:31,107 --> 01:21:37,072
Gatling...
You stupid son of a bitch!

605
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,920
Where is he?

606
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:36,044
It's over.

607
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:45,093
Max!

608
01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:04,696
You made it!

609
01:23:11,328 --> 01:23:13,955
You know, don't you?

610
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:20,127
How did he find out, that it was me?

611
01:23:32,222 --> 01:23:35,433
What is your mission, Major Gatling?

612
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,977
Rescue the girl...

613
01:23:38,895 --> 01:23:42,232
...Kill the whistleblower.

614
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,527
And that way the company can deny,

615
01:23:47,554 --> 01:23:50,864
Everything that happend here...
Blame it on someone else...

616
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:55,286
There won't be anyone to say any different.

617
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:58,246
That's why you did it?

618
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:05,212
I had to say something...
There was still a chance to stop it before...

619
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:11,552
It's some pile of shit.

620
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,845
Yeah.

621
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:19,475
What are you guys so serious about?

622
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:24,104
Hey... Come on, Max. You did it.
Mission accomplished.

623
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:26,481
Now what?

624
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,361
What?

625
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:47,128
Now we get you and little Max, back where you belong.

626
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:52,820
Whoo... Whoo...
Who said anything about naming him Max?

627
01:24:53,967 --> 01:24:56,843
A boy needs a good strong name!

628
01:24:56,844 --> 01:25:01,724
Not bad...
I think she likes it, just fine...

629
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:10,983
Hey, buddy...
Why don't you go get me a coffee?
