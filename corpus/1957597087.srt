00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,512
Nobody will
be able to help you,

358
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,916
and it's honestly your fault.

359
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:13,220
You could have asked them
to eat with you at home,

360
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:15,356
but you were too busy
chatting with someone

361
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,292
on your cell phone,
weren't you?

362
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,529
What a shame.

363
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:24,231
Now they're all dead...

364
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,035
and you're all alone,

365
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,304
and nobody cares.

366
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,246
[clapping]

367
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,215
Let's take a quick
five-minute bathroom break

368
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:42,883
and return here for process.

369
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,185
Let's take five minutes.
Great job.

370
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,969
[door thudding]

371
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,372
Hey.

372
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,875
Uh... hello.

373
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:09,243
Hey.

374
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,744
Uh...

375
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:13,480
I was just wondering if
you guys are hiring right now?

376
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:15,549
Uh...

377
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,217
I don't think so.

378
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,056
Okay. Well, I have a lot of
experience with ceramics.

379
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,557
I use a lot of pottery.

380
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,226
I pay very,
very close attention to cups.

381
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,463
Um, well, I'm not the manager.

382
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,566
Well, I still would like
to get involved.

383
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,769
- Mm-hmm.
- So, okay.

384
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:37,037
[papers crackling]

385
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,373
Here's my resume
and references.

386
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,141
You can call
the number at the top.

387
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,777
[woman] Uh, yeah.
You can set it right there.

388
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,146
Yes. Set it right down, thanks.

389
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,414
Okay.

390
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,985
Thank you for your time.

391
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,754
Uh, appreciate it.

392
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,023
[woman] All right.

393
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,294
[hinges squeaking]

394
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,144
A social worker
would never really say that.

395
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:23,016
So, it's... it's dumb, but it
also really scares me because

396
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,185
like, Richard
and everybody are, like,

397
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,621
falling out of their seats,

398
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,089
I was a nine,

399
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:31,158
I don't know if
anybody could tell.

400
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,328
Same thing happened to me
the night before my exposure.

401
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:37,531
My SUDs went really
high thinking about it.

402
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,000
I always think that thinking
about it makes it happen.

403
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,736
- [Nickie] Yeah.
- But you get to see

404
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:45,472
and hear your thoughts
right out there in the open.

405
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,975
That's why
I found mine so helpful.

406
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,778
That's... that's why
I haven't done mine yet.

407
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,881
I can't even say it out loud.

408
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,915
About Liz?

409
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,117
Mm-hmm.

410
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,653
Now my SUDs are an eight.

411
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,223
I can feel my heart.

412
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,992
Yeah, that happens to me too.

413
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,895
I know that's the whole point.

414
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,062
It makes it absurd.

415
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,666
I did a relapse one,

416
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,636
and I didn't relapse.

417
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,274
- Does that count?
- Definitely.

418
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:23,710
And you said it made you feel
like you could handle it.

419
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,279
- Right, Richard?
- [Richard] Yeah.

420
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,315
- Doing it gave me the power.
- [Anne] Mm-hm.

421
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,751
[Richard] Like, I could see
what would happen.

422
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:32,352
I would freak out,

423
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,522
and I'd say a bunch
of dramatic shit,

424
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,224
but it would be fine.

425
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,092
I could handle it.

426
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,132
[papers crackling]

427
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:51,738
[phone beeping]

428
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,980
[lively upbeat music]

[crickets chirping]

432
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,274
[Tavi] You know colosseums?

433
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:06,213
[Julian]
Like Rome or the Aztecs?

434
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,715
[Tavi] Yeah.

435
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,551
Have you ever made one?

436
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:13,387
[Julian] Um...

437
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,290
probably in some way,

438
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,426
an accidental
sort of colosseum.

439
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:25,867

461
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:33,901
I don't have all my numbers.
Who is this?

462
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:40,008
[woman] <i>Oh, it's Mel.</i>

463
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,275
- <i>Mel.</i>
- Mel?

464
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:46,881
[Mel] <i>Yeah, from group.</i>

465
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,584
Oh, uh, Mel. Hey.

466
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:52,552
Yeah, sorry, I can't really

467
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,755
hear so good
in my car speakers.

468
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:01,728
[Mel] <i>Um...</i>

Uh, yeah.

472
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:19,579
Yeah, I'm just cruising around,
you know, uh...

473
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:23,450
business, resource recovery,
trying to get in that zone.

474
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:27,721
Probably be good to have
another head, brain.

475

[Mel] <i>Hey, you're in the car?</i>

476
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:32,225
Yeah, I could, uh...

477
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,727
I could take you off speakers,

478
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:36,329
it's just one button
versus another.

479
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:40,233
[Mel] <i>So could you, like,

00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,478
[Julian] A baby.

482
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,483
These aren't just for babies.

[trolley creaking]

484
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,435
My hamstrings are tight
from those jumps earlier.

485
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:19,272
I might have to hum
on them later.

486
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,742
- You ever done that?
- No.

487
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:26,713
The vibrations reorient
the muscle if it gets twisted.

488
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,895
What do you eat?

489
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:42,897
Food-wise?

490
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,832
Pale colors.

491
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,969
Well.

492
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:49,871
Rice?

493
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,638
Yeah.

494
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:53,975
[Julian] Cheese?

495
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:55,375
[Tavi] Not really.

496
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,046
[Julian] Hmm...

497
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,616
- Chicken?
- [Tavi] No.

498
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,052
- You vegetarian?
- Yeah.

499
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:06,821
Huh, me too.

500
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:09,623
Well, I mean,
when I can afford it.

501
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:14,962
Shall not kill...

502
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,330
shall not gossip.

503
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,235
I shalt not kill.

504
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:23,971
Would you kill an animal
if you had to?

505
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,740
I don't know.

506
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:30,211
Like... if I was starving?

507
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,948
Yeah, I like these... color.

508
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:36,616
I mean...

509
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,518
I could kill a fish.

510
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:41,155
I have killed a fish before.

511
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,057
[Tavi]
Nobody cares about fish.

512
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,624
But...

513
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:48,162
like, if I was starving?

514
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:49,796
You know, it's tricky.

515
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,598
[woman] You know that coconut
have the exact same

516
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:54,434
- number of calories.
- It's about the milk, Mom.

517
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,037
[woman] I'm just saying.

518
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,537
Isn't that your friend Tavi?

519
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:00,407
- Oh, my God, stop.
- Hi, Tavi.

520
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,610
Fancy seeing you here.

521
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:06,948
Alison's getting
her tonsils out tomorrow,

522
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,183
so I let her take off
and we're...

523
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:10,918
buying a ton of ice cream.

524
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,320
Huh...

525
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,989
sounds like a lot of fun.

526
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,958
I got mine out.

527
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:22,762
Get peppermint.
Peppermint soothes.

528
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,564
Also raw honey.

529
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,734
Just put some on
your lymph nodes, like this.

530
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,839
Does your dad know you're here?

531
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,009
[Tavi]
Does your dad know you're here?

532
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,345
Excuse me? No. But that's not
really the question here,

533
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:38,813
