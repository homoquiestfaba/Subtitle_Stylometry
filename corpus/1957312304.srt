1
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,674
Raymond,

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,023
I just want to let you
know how proud I am of you

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,509
and the young man
that you've become.

4
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,753
Now, watching you
walk across that stage

5
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:33,792
and get your diploma has been
the highlight of my life.

6
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:37,174
You're a man now.

7
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:42,144
And as you go off into this
world and make your way,

8
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,422
take the things I've taught you,

9
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,597
all the lessons I've showed you,

10
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:49,221
and be the best person
that you can possibly be.

11
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,912
And if there ever comes a time

12
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:55,814
when life becomes
too hard or too much,

13
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,300
talk to someone, anyone.

14
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,441
And whatever anyone
says about me,

15
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,272
just know that I love you

16
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,482
and nothing was ever your fault.

17
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,140
I love you son.

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,846
- What are we working with?

19
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,951
- Come on Pops, give
me something harder.

20
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,229
You know I know this
car front and back.

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,333
- Well answer the question.

22
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,955
What are we working with?

23
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,681
- 409 Turbo Thrust.

24
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,959
- Block material?
- Cast iron alloy.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,652
- Horsepower?
- 230 horses.

26
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,172
- Come on Pops, I
can do this all day.

27
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,898
- All right, I see somebody's
been paying attention.

28
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,142
- Yeah I've been
paying attention.

29
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,143
But I say,

30
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,180
bore it out over 60.

31
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,217
- Bore it out huh?
- Mm-hm.

32
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:58,703
- Uh-uh, no my father'd
turn over in his grave

33
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,775
if I changed one thing
on this here car.

34
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:02,915
He loved this car.

35
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,505
He bought it new,
kept it till he died.

36
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:10,370
It ain't even been
driven since he died.

37
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,476
- But why would
somebody who's dead

38
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:14,824
care about a car that
they can't drive anymore?

39
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:19,035
- We keep his memory alive
by keeping this car alive.

40
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:22,693
When people leave
us they're not gone

41
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,867
unless we forget about them.

42
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,146
You love me, son?
- Yeah, of course.

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,805
- All right, would you love
me any less if I was gone?

44
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,567
- No, no I love
you just the same.

45
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:38,261
- Exactly, 'cause I'll still
be alive in your heart.

46
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,469
You understand now?

47
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,957
All right, now you know
what day it is right?

48
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,131
You ready?

49
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,548
All right, well you go into
the car and get the stuff

50
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,931
and we'll meet you in
the kitchen, all right?

51
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,428
How is my beautiful queen doing?

52
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:10,292
- Fine.

53
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,192
- Fine? You don't
sound no fine to me.

54
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,610
Sound like you need a big
hug and kiss from your man.

55
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,439
- You forgot.

56
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:22,029
- Forgot what?
- Forgot my birthday.

57
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,308
- Oh, yeah it is your
birthday, ain't it?

58
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,723
- Yeah, today.

59
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:30,209
- I'm sorry babe. I've
just been so busy.

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,694

00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,523

- You got me.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,155
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:48,848
- Now, slide on over here

67
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,402

68
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:55,613
- My two favorite guys doing
something for me for a change?

69
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:59,168
All right what we havin',

70
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,377

00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,896
- I had your birthday
dinner catered babe.

72
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,623
I went all out.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:15,531
- You're a military man right?

74
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,396
I mean your father was at
West Point for chrissakes.

75
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,846
I don't have to tell you-
- Baby.

76
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:27,231
- Baby, come on over
here and sit with us.

77
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,096
- We'll dismiss
the need for them altogether.

78
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:33,064
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

79
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,309
- I mean, 'cause we-
- I said I'm fine.

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,104
- Now would you get off my back?

81
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:41,314
- Okay, just want
us to keep having

82
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,867
a good birthday, you know?

83
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,559
- And we can keep
having a nice day

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,803
if you all will leave me alone.

85
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,738
- Are you taking them?

86
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,676
Your meds. Raymond are you
still taking your medication?

87
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,782
'Cause you know you're supposed
to be taking it every day.

88
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,783
You know that.

89
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,445
- How about you just come
sit over here with us, Pops?

90
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,863
- Yeah. Come on over
here and sit with us.

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,187
- Mama, what's wrong with Pops?

92
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,467
- Nothing baby, he just
needs a little space.

93
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,986
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no baby

94
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,747
you didn't do anything wrong.

95
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,749
- Then why is he
so upset with us?

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,578
I'll go talk to him.

97
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,235
- Okay, wait wait wait.

98
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,652
Look, your father's just
going through something

99
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:45,620
right now, all right?

100
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:49,038
Just give him a little
space and he'll be okay.

101
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,251
Now come on, come on
let's watch this program.

102
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,014
- Cramer, I thought you said

103
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,016
you were taking
care of Fletcher.

104
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:06,918
- No, no, no,
you said you were on this.

105
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,474
- Mom!
- Stay here.

106
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,719
- Ma where's Pops?
- I said stay here.

107
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:33,461
- Raymond?

108
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,431
Raymond you all right?

109
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,609
No!

110
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,823
Help me! Help me, please!

111
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:52,682
My husband, he shot
himself. Help us please!

112
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,832
No, my baby-my baby, no.

113
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,422
No baby.

114
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,723
- Here you go.

115
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,727
You ready, baby? You
excited, you ready?

116
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,694
- Yeah, yeah I'm ready.

117
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,662
- Damn, that's the best you got?

118
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,423
Come on D today's a big day.

119
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:44,290
- No, I'm sorry. I'm just,
I'm just a little tired.

120
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,016
I haven't felt
like myself lately.

121
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,258
- Yeah, what's wrong?

122
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,330
- I don't know, I just feel off.

123
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,677
- Well, make yourself
a doctor's appointment,

124
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,472
just in case there's
a bug or something.

125
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,957
- Yeah, yeah I will, hon.

126
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,406
- Baby, I'm so excited.

127
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,925
You about to meet
Rick Parsons today.

128
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,306
- I know right?
- And then if he likes

129
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,170
your script, Dee man oh my God,

130
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,275
no telling where
that's gonna lead.

131
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,554
You could be famous.

132
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:09,488
Yo, we could move to California.

133
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,627
And I could buy a
bunch of purses,

134
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,525
you know be a snobby bitch.

135
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:13,940
- For real?
- I just playing.

136
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,529
- I don't wanna
live in California.

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,221
Relax, Dee today's a big day.

138
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:20,740
- It's just a meeting Shan.

139
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,224
I mean nothing's guaranteed.

140
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:24,364
- Babe, Rick Parsons doesn't
just meet with anybody.

141
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,195
Your writing is so good,
give yourself some credit.

142
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,819
- Well, I'm gonna go get
dressed before I'm late.

143
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:41,692
- You got this baby, okay?

144
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,073
- I got this.

145
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,351
- You got this.

146
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,874
And put a smile
on your face Dee.

147
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,703
Remember I love you.
I'm always here for you.

148
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:53,705
- I love you too.

149
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:03,921
- Okay.

150
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:05,751
All right.

151
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,272
This is for you Pops.

152
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:24,209
♪ Reminisce on, on, on

153
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:28,075
♪ Reminisce on, on, on

154
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,422
- Hey, look at me son.

155
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:34,875
Look, nothin' to be
scared of, all right?

156
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,982
The first day in any
new place is never easy.

157
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,500
You're just gonna
have to go in here

158
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,381
and remember the three
things that I taught you.

159
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,713
And they are?

160
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:48,163
- Carry myself like a man.
- That's right.

161
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:51,511
- Carry yourself like
a man, and number two?

162
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:54,825
- Keep my mouth shut about
shit I don't know about.

163
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,897
- Things, things you
don't know about.

164
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:00,003
- Things, things I
don't know about.

165
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,452
- And most importantly?

166
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,697
- Be me all the time.

167
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:08,529
- Yeah, that's right.
Be you all the time.

168
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:12,049
People don't like people who
pretend to be somebody else.

169
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,569
Isn't that right, Fred?

170
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,744
Plus it's easier that way.

171
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,193
These people around here,

172
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,679
they either going to
accept you or they're not.

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,577
Look at Fred back there.

174
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,337
You ain't nervous at
all, are you Fred?

175
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,823
- Man these clowns know
what these hands can do.

176
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,652
They don't want none
of these problems.

177
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,689
- Keep them hands
to yourself son.

178
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
- Yes sir.

179
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,589
- All right.

180
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,247
Go on in there and do
what y'all got to do.

181
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:40,043
- Hey D, I got your back.

182
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:43,357
I'll always have your
back, no matter what.

183
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,845
- I know Fred. I know.

184
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,986
- Hey Darius, I ain't gonna
make it home.

185
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,712
- Mr. Thomas?

186
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,713
Are you okay?

187
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,062
- Yeah, yeah I'm, I'm okay.

188
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,547
- Mr. Parsons will see you now.

189
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:03,861
- Okay, cool.

190
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,629
- Mr. Thomas, how are we-

191
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,631
Have we met before Mr. Thomas?

192
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,357
- Uh no, sir.

193
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,635
- Mmm you look
extremely familiar.

194
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,119
I'm sure we've met.

195
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,363
- If we had, you know I
would definitely remember.

196
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,814
- Eh, maybe you just
got one of those faces,

197
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,022
I don't know Darius.

198
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,715
Anyway, the script, not
bad, not bad at all.

199
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,510
Look, we're having an
honest conversation here?

200
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:36,409
I gotta tell ya, the
script, it's a little dark.

201
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,617
I mean not in a bad way.

202
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,067
But it's pretty clear Darius,

203
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,931
that there's something
trying to cut through.

204
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,762
- It's just all
personal experiences.

205
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,626
- Like the part
about the father?

206
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,733
- Sir, I'm not-
- The father, in the script.

207
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,355
- He dies of a heart attack.

208
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:52,910
Is that what
happened to your dad?

209
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,327
Is your father still alive?

210
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,194
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm
sure you miss him greatly.

211
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,748
You know what I think, Anthony,

212
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,198
I think that's your real father.

213
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,510
I mean in the script he's the
embalmer at the funeral home

214
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,616
and all that, but it's clear.

215
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,756
Something resonates about him.

216
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,309
I mean he's the
last one to see Glen

217
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,897
get made ready before he goes-

218
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,969
- It's suicide, sir.

219
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,044
My father committed suicide

220
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,390
when I was younger.

221
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,879
He'd been battling
with depression

222
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,226
practically his whole life.

223
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:38,887
And on my mother's
birthday, he shot himself.

224
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,856
There was no "Goodbye Darius,"

225
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,996
no "I love you Darius,"

226
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,965
no "Hang in there Darius."

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,657
And that script is,

228
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,556
it's that thing that
gets that out of my head.

229
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:56,973
- So this, what, this
script, it's your life?

230
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,562
- Well, yeah, pretty much.

231
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,014
- Okay okay, tell you
what I'm gonna do.

232
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,051
I'm gonna go ahead and
kick this upstairs.

233
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:08,261
If they like it, if,

234
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:10,710
you might just get
to see your name

235
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:11,988
in the movie credits some day.

236
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,506
Right, picture this.

237
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,888
A Darius Thomas Story,

238
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,203
directed by Mike Berry.

239
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,411
Yeah?

240
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,826
- Yeah, I mean it
sounds good to me.

241
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,586
You know Mike Berry's my
favorite director in the world.

242
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,450
- Eh, wait till you
meet him in person.

243
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:27,831
Anyway, doesn't matter.

244
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,039
You gotta go home keep writing.

245
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,282
You got a gift okay,

246
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:32,767
'cause nothing
frustrates me more

247
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:36,702
than when I send those boys
and girls upstairs a stud

248
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,566
and it turns out to
be a one-trick pony.

249
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,119
- Sir, I just thank you.

250
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,880
I just really appreciate
you actually taking time

251
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,743
to meet with me.

252
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:44,020
That was-

253
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:46,574
- Um, all right,
we're done here.

254
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,231
Uh, don't call us,
we'll call you,

255
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,785
you know all that good kind
of information and stuff.

256
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,959
Come on come on.
- Okay.

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,374
- You like the shirt?
You feeling it?

258
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,754
- Yeah, it looks good.
- No, I don't like it.

259
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:55,997
- My wife bought it.
- All right.

260
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:57,516
- Come on, how'd you
get here, bus, car?

261
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:58,449
- I took the car.

262
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,932
- Okay, let's go find your car.

263
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,093
Well, I'm not gonna help you
find it, but someone will.

264
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,596
- All right, all right.

265
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:15,016
Babe, it's happening.

266
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,605
Right, it's happening
it's happening!

267
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:18,917
Look, nothing's concrete yet,

268
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,609
but he definitely
likes my script.

269
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:23,577
Well, yeah I'm just,

270
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,165
babe I'm just ready
to turn a corner

271
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,410
and just start a new life
for the both of us, you know?

272
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,965
Right, yeah well look, I'm
on my way to my mom's house

273
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,725
then I have to work.

274
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,107
We'll celebrate later okay?

275
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,215
Hey, wear that lingerie I like.

276
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:43,114
All right, babe.

277
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,682
- Hey Darius.
- Hey Ms. Jones.

278
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:02,167
- Ain't seen you in a while.

279
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,583
- Yeah, yeah I just been
busy with working, family.

280
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:05,550
- Well praise the Lord.

281
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:07,034
- Praise the Lord Ms. Jones.

282
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:08,483
- You can't praise him if
you're not going to church.

283
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,968
- I go every day in
my heart Ms. Jones.

284
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,797
- The Bible says, "Where
there are two or three

285
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:14,731
gathered together in His
name, there He is among them."

286
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,077
- Okay, all right well look,

287
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:17,976
I'm going in to see my mother.

288
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,701
So that makes two of us.

289
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,980
So that'll mean God
will be present right?

290
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,981
- Come on here.

291
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:26,674
God bless you Darius.
- You too Ms.Jones.

292
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:27,916
- Take care now.

293
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:28,849
- You look good
in that dress too.

294
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,023
- Well all right, thank you.

295
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:39,721
- Ma, what did I tell you

296
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:41,202
about leaving that
back door unlocked?

297
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,105
- And hello to you too.

298
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:46,695
- I'm serious, you can't
be doing that around here.

299
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,493
So, what the doctor say?

300
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,013
- Same thing as before.

301
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,775
- I still think you should
consult with another specialist,

302
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,190
just to get a second opinion.

303
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:03,055
- Look, I've seen every
specialist from here to Maine.

304
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,781
They all same the same thing.

305
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:07,335
- I don't understand why-
- My heart

306
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,992
just ain't strong enough.

307
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:10,787
- Ma I don't understand
why you just won't check

308
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,168
with another specialist.

309
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:15,309
- If God wants me to see
another doctor I will.

310
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,173
But He ain't spoke
to me about that yet.

311
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:20,591
- Really Ma? You waiting on
God to tell you what to do?

312
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,905
- It's all in His time
and it's all in His hands.

313
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,047
- He might be doing his
part up there, right,

314
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,876
but you have to do
your part down here.

315
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,084
You just can't put it all on Him

316
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,706
to make all your decisions.

317
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:37,021
- Like I said, He ain't
spoke to me about that yet.

318
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,651
You need to get to
church on Sunday.

319
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,860
- Ma I ain't going
nowhere near that church.

320
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,345
- I cannot believe
the day has come

321
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:53,312
that a son of mine
does not believe

322
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:54,589
in the House of the Lord.

323
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,730
- No, I never said
I didn't believe.

324
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,802
I just, just don't
believe all of it.

325
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,150
It's just a book.

326
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,919
You know Fred
getting out tomorrow.

327
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,164
- Yeah, I heard.

328
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,097
And before you start running
the streets with him,

329
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,375
you'd better make sure he
on the right side of things.

330
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,686
- Ma he gonna be all right.

331
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,896
Uncle Reese got him
a job at his company.

332
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,657
Plus Fred not like that no more.

333
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,176
I think the last bit
actually got to him.

334
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:30,625
- Well that's great.

335
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,902
That sound like both of y'all

336
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,214
need to be at the
church on Sunday.

337
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,491
- Damn Ma, he just getting out

338
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:36,114
and you already trying
send him door-to-door

339
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,598
on Saturday morning?

340
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,324
- Look all I'm saying is
before he hit them streets,

341
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,947
he better hit that church first.

342
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,400
- Well I gotta go,
I gotta go to work.

343
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,780
- It's almost one o'clock.

344
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,611
- I took a half a day.

345
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,302
- Okay.

346
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,821
Well you need to do me a favor

347
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:55,409
and bring my crock pot back.

348
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,515
And then I'll make you
your favorite stew.

349
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,208
- Yes ma'am.
- All right.

350
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,209
- Yes ma'am.

351
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,969
And the cake too, right?

352
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,970
- You pushing it.

353
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,628
Just bring the crock
pot back please.

354
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,388
- Okay, yes Mama.

355
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,356
- All right, be safe.

356
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,150
- I love you.
- Love you too.

357
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,876
- All right.

358
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:24,817
- Thomas.

359
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,200
Fourth day late in two weeks.

360
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,478
One more and we've got problems.

361
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,962
- I told you I was
taking a half a day.

362
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,482
- Half a day, it's
damn near 1:30.

363
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,071
You said noon at the latest.

364
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,799
Like I said, one
more, it's problems.

365
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,956
- Babe where you at?

366
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,898
- You looking for me?

367
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,418
- Looks like you looking for me.

368
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,005
- From what I hear you're
the guy I need to talk to

369
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,629
if I wanna be in the movies.

370
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,494
- That depends if you're
a good actress or not.

371
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:21,564
You a good actress?

372
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:22,738
- I think I am.

373
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,051
Since I'm already on
your casting couch,

374
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:29,019
why don't I prove it to you?

375
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,574
- You know I don't do
PG-rated movies right?

376
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,197
- Neither do I.
- Is that right?

377
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,855
♪ My heart beats for you, baby

378
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,685
♪ You're my ecstasy

379
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,204
♪ Slow me down

380
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,171
- Baby, I'm ready.

381
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,621
- For what?

382
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:45,622
- Marriage.

383
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,281
- Wow.

384
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,215
Um...

385
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,150
Where'd that come from?

386
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:58,980
- Well I mean, I thought
we're in a good place

387
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,363
and it's time for us to
take it to the next level.

388
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,090
- Wait a minute, I mean,

389
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:07,126
ain't I the one supposed
to ask you first?

390
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,336
- I'm not asking you.

391
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,130
I'm saying you're definitely
who I want to spend

392
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,374
the rest of my life with.

393
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:15,239
And I wanna be your wife,

394
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:17,862
if you want to
make me your wife.

395
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,176
- Wait a minute, let's roll
this back for a second, hold up.

396
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,626
Weren't you just a porn star

397
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:25,559
looking to get on my casting
couch a little while ago

398
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,458
and now you're talking
about marriage?

399
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:31,842
But no, but seriously babe.

400
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,122
It'll happen, okay?

401
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,853
When the time is right,
it'll happen, okay?

402
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:11,571
- Baby you okay?

403
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,055
- Yeah.

404
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,782
Yeah.

405
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,646
- Was it the dreams?
- Yeah.

406
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:19,647
- I'm good, just,

407
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,650
just go back to sleep.

408
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:23,928
- You sure?
- Yes.

409
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,571
- But sometimes
you need somebody

410
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:47,744
to feed that back to you

411
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:49,367
and your spirit to help you,

412
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,127
up out of what
you're going through.

413
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,163
But oftentimes you
don't get that so-

414
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,374
- Dee! Dee why
ain't you at work, it's 7:30!

415
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,514
- So there's
a big stigma because-

416
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,481
- Dee! Why ain't you at work?

417
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:03,450
- Many many
people suffer from depression,

418
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,521
but they don't want
other people to know

419
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:07,868
that they're suffering
from depression.

420
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,216
- Damn. Must have overslept.

421
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,390
- Overslept?

422
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,219
Suicidal depression,

423
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,219
there's different types.

424
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:17,913
- You look wide awake to me.

425
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,053
You've done this two or three
times already this week Dee,

426
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:23,124
You're already on
probation at work.

427
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,333
- Ease up Shan.

428
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:26,956
I said I overslept.

429
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,409
- You said that two or
three times already.

430
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,721
Dee I know something
is wrong with you.

431
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,136
I can see it, I can feel it.

432
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,069
Talk to me. What is it?

433
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,555
- I'm good.
- Well get up.

434
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:40,763
- Okay.

435
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,147
Let me get my ass to work.

436
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,634
Ron'll pop a fuse if I'm late.

437
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,762
- Look, your father's just
going through something

438
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,730
right now, all right?

439
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,146
Just give him a little space

440
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:20,147
and he'll be okay.

441
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,506
- Hey what's up Ron it's Dee.

442
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,232
Yeah I ain't feeling
good today, man.

443
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,717
I ain't coming in.

444
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,445
Okay but what about
vacation time?

445
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:45,518
Don't I got sick time?

446
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,521
Come on Ron.

447
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,316
You know I've been sick
the last couple weeks.

448
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:53,008
But you know I be
on time though.

449
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:56,771
All right. All right.

450
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,497
- Baby I'm off to go to work.

451
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,498
- Okay.

452
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,274
- Hey Pop, I've been
working on this story.

453
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,656
I want you to hear it later.

454
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:22,761
Pop?

455
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,922
That was Granddad's chain right?

456
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,202
- Yeah it's my father's chain.

457
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,551
He gave it to me
right before he died.

458
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:56,451
One day I'm gonna
give it to you.

459
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:00,212
You know what that means?

460
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:01,213
- No.

461
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:08,532
- It means that I will
always be with you.

462
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,192
Even when things
get their hardest,

463
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,746
I'll be right there.

464
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,930
- How did Granddad
pass away Pop?

465
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:29,933
- He kill...

466
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:34,213
He keeled over and
died one night.

467
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,492
- From what though?

468
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:41,565
- It was something
wrong with his brain.

469
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,362
Working too hard,

470
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:47,847
it just gave up.

471
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,540
- You mean like cancer?

472
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,374
- Yeah, something like that.

473
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:04,726
- I don't know what I'd
do if you died Pops.

474
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:13,251
- Hey Darius?
- Yeah Pop?

475
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:16,255
- I can't do this anymore.

476
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:23,330
- What the hell Dee?

477
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:24,884
You been on this couch all day?

478
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,887
Hey I'm talking to you.

479
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,787
What is going on? What's wrong?

480
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,340
- I don't know.

481
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,376
I feel like I'm coming
down with something.

482
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,516
- What, like you sick?

483
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:40,692
- I just feel kinda drained.

484
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,178
- That's because you need
some sun up in here Dee.

485
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:46,665
Go get in the shower while
I get dinner started.

486
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:10,135
- You know Fred
getting out today.

487
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:11,343
- Now he's home?

488
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:13,691
- Yeah, I'm gonna run
over to Milt's Bar

489
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,132
to holler at him
for a little second.

490
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,798
I won't be out long, though.

491
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,629
- So you can go to the bar
Dee, but you can't go to work?

492
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:22,977
- Whatever babe.

493
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:27,670
- And don't call me at 2 AM
to come get you out of jail

494
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:29,327
'cause you got caught
up in his street shit.

495
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,779
- Babe it's cool. He's changed.

496
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:34,436
- I'll believe it when I see it.

497
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:41,202
- All right, well, I'll be
back in a little while okay?

498
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,208
- And don't spend
money we don't have

499
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,004
trying to prove
something to him Dee.

- What's up, Fred?

508
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:15,200
- You, look at you, all
clean-cut and what-not.

509

- No you're the one, man,

got your buff going
on and everything.

511
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,756
I see you.

512
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,343

What's up Mikey?

516
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,177
- Long time homey.

517
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,661
- Yeah, it has been a while.

518
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:28,939
Last time I saw you,

519
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:31,596
you was going out to
county for a murder.

520
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:32,977
- And I beat that one.

521
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:35,462
And the one after that
and the one after that.

522
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,704
- All right, okay.

551
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,262
- Man.

552
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,402
- Without you and my
fellas holding me down man,

553
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:55,853
that shit would've been tough.

554
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,406
- We're blood cuz.

555
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,891
- Being like that, I learned
that blood make you related,

556
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,550
but loyalty is what
makes a family.

557
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,450
Me, Mikey and Cook,
that's my family.

558

So, uh, my mom wants you

I already told her you

561
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,325

563

to how the righteous and the
meek gonna inherit the earth.

564
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,746

569
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,042
- I'm Fred.

570
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,940
- So what that name supposed
to mean something to me?

571
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,632

00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:53,496
So I'm gonna need you and

575
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:00,503
- Oh yeah, well I don't
appreciate your disrespect,

576
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,988
and I don't think
Poncho would either.

577
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:04,270

guns when they made yours bro.

578
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:07,717
- It's all love my G.

579

and tell Poncho to stay
his ass off the Deuce.

581
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:13,516
- Let's go.

582
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:18,042
- Hey follow them and make
sure they cross the tracks man.

583
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:22,077
- Cuz, what the
hell was that man?

584
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:23,595
You ain't even
been out 12 hours.

585
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:26,012
- And I told you, shit ain't
going back to the way it was.

586
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:28,429
But don't worry cuz,
I know what I'm doing.

587
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,805
- You sure you're okay?

588
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:01,806

25 pages of my new script,

591
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,920
just to see if he likes it.

592
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,163
- That's cool Dee,

593
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:15,924
but we need to worry
about things here first.

594
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:19,375
- I know, I know.

595
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:20,687
- All right.

596
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,723
Oh, me and the girls are

I don't feel like
hanging out today.

- No seriously Dee.

614
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,798
I know you ain't
about that life, man,

615
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,663
and I was wrong for
pulling you into it.

616
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,976
- Yeah I just thought this
time you'd be home to stay.

617
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,980
- I am home to stay. Seriously.

618
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:50,363
You listenin' man?

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,400
Dude, where you at man,

- Yeah, my bad man.

622
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,270
I just ain't been feeling like
myself the last few weeks.

623
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,582
- You depressed or something?

624
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,997
- I don't know.

625
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:05,310
- Depression mean you weak.

626
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,346
And only weak guys
get depressed man.

627
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:10,280
Ain't no room out
here for no weak cats.

628
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:18,356
Seriously Dee, you got
you a girl, a crib,

629
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:19,633
and you can still get you a job

630
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,876
without them running your record

631
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:22,947
and finding out that
you a four-time felon

632
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,053
with two robberies and
aggravated assault.

633
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:27,607

00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:29,368
I just been really moody, man.

635
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,372
I literally find
myself laying around.

636
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,030
I mean I'm losing track of time.

637
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:40,137
You know, some days I just
can't pull it together Fred.

638
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,623
- Trust me dude, You good man.

639
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:44,900
♪ I need to know everything

640
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:45,729

642
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,525

649
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:04,678
- Make yourself at home Fred.

650
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,785
- Most definitely,

651
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,097

653
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:12,963
- Your job left a voicemail.

654
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,519

655
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:20,313

00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,286
- What we gonna do Dee?

658
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,701
- I don't know.

659
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:28,978
- You know you can
always get out here

660
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,497
and get some real money
in the streets with me.

661
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:33,120
- Damn nosy.

00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,262
ain't nothing wrong with
a little street money.

663
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,988
- But there's definitely
something wrong
with prison time.

664
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,820
- Look babe I'll
figure it out, okay?

665
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,512
I'll just call Uncle Reese, see
if he got another spot open.

666
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:47,065
- Yeah, you could
definitely have my spot cuz,

667
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,621
'cause I can't do it.

668
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,246

you were going through.

677
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,238
Come on, babe tell me something.

678
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,480

But you gotta talk to me baby

You've been laying around here

00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,659
Pull yourself together Dee.

691

694
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:52,639
That was Granddad's chain right?

- Yeah it's my father's chain.

696
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,681
He gave it to me
right before he died.

697
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,409
One day I'm gonna
give it to you.

698
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:05,343
You know what that means?

699
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:07,999
- No.

700
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,316
- It means that
I will always be with you.

701
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:47,142
- Fuck.

702
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,491
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

703
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:10,337
- Do you love me son?
- Yeah, of course.

704
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:12,996
- Would you love me
any less if I was gone?

705
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:17,794
- No, no I love
you just the same.

706
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,858
Dammit Pops, why'd
you leave me here

707
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:50,586
to deal with this
shit by myself?

708
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:56,661
I needed you Pops! I needed you!

709
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,681
- She didn't have no business

710
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,476
wearing that damn outfit.

711
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,167
- She swore
she was looking cute.

712
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:22,996
- Girl, whole damn
stomach hanging out,

713
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,585
looking like balled up homework.

714
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,036
- Oh bring some glasses.

715
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:33,248
- So what's up with Darius?

716
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:35,181
- Girl, I don't know.

717
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,494
He's going through something
and I don't know what to do.

718
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,254
- What is he saying?

719
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:40,842
- He ain't saying much,

720
00:41:40,843 --> 00:41:43,016
just that he got
it under control.

721
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:46,882
But I'm telling you,
he lost his job,

722
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:48,747
he's sleeping all
day, moody as hell.

723
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:52,578
And I saw where he was googling
depression in his phone.

724
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,511
- But I'm sure
it'll all be fine.

725
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,031
With love and prayer,
anything can be worked out.

726
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:58,999
- You think he'd do
something to you?

727
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,103
- No, Darius ain't like that.

728
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,898
He's sweet and loving.

729
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,935
He's just going through
something right now.

730
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,626
- Well I ain't trying
to be negative,

731
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:09,698
but my aunt's husband
had the same thing.

732
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,597
He came home from work one day,

733
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:13,391
parked his car in the driveway,

734
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:15,842
walked in the garage
and hung hisself

735
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:18,155
in the middle of day,
just hung hisself.

736
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,572
- Oh my God, I feel
so bad for your aunt.

737
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,091
She didn't know he was
going through something?

738
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:26,646
- No, not at all,
just hung hisself.

739
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:29,131
- Again, I'm sure
Darius will be fine.

740
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,927
I think he just needs
to find his way back.

741
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:32,963
- I hope so.

742
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,413
- Look, I like Darius.

743
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,070
I like him a lot.

744
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,694
But if he tripping
like you say he is,

745
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,973
you have to be careful,
for his safety and yours.

746
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,252
And my only concern is
making sure you good.

747
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,255
- Um, okay girls,

748
00:42:49,256 --> 00:42:51,119
me and Vikki gonna
get out of here.

749
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,708
- Yeah Shan, call you later.

750
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:05,754
- So that's what you talk
about with your friends,

751
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:07,584
about my personal life?

752
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,792
- It's not like that Dee.

753
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,346
- Then how the hell
is it then Shan?

754
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:13,797
You supposed to be my girl.

755
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:15,005
Talk about you
wanna get married,

756
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:16,523
but you think it's okay
to go behind my back

757
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:19,526
to talk about my business
to everybody in the street?

758
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,114
- They're not everybody
in the street Dee,

759
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:22,392
Those are my friends.

760
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,256
And I just needed
someone to vent to.

761
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:26,638
- Needed someone to vent to?

762
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:30,814
You know, it's so funny

763
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:32,332
how you want me
to open up to you,

764
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:35,025
but you go behind my back
and talk about my business.

765
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,751
- What do you want me to do Dee?

766
00:43:36,752 --> 00:43:38,029
You're not telling me nothin'.

767
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,341
You're telling me a little
here a little there,

768
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:41,548
and I don't know what to do.

769
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:43,310
- What, so you can
tell the whole world?

770
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,623
Look at me.

771
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,834
You know I ain't with that.

772
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:54,147
Okay.

773
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,995
- Dee, open the door, it's Fred.

774
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,552
Dee, open the door man.

775
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:24,246
- It's open.

776
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:30,218
- Damn, dawg.

777
00:44:32,393 --> 00:44:33,981
Where the hell you been at man?

778
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:42,195
Shan called my line,

779
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:44,094
talking about you ain't
been off the couch in weeks.

780
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:46,752
I'm blowing up your jack.
You're not answering.

781
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:49,996
Hell, you ain't even been by
to check on your mama man.

782
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:51,689
- Just a little
stressed out cuz.

783
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:55,899
- Yeah Shan called me

784
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,832
talking about she
think you're depressed.

785
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,248
I told her hell
na'll that ain't it.

786
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:01,560
- I don't know, I'm just...

787
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:06,461
Crazy mental space.

788
00:45:06,462 --> 00:45:08,774
- Man chill with all that man.

789
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:10,292
You're good.
- Man ease up Fred.

790
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,674
- Ease up? I need to turn
up to take you out of this.

791
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,365
You can't keep laying
around here like some lame

792
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:17,197
because you got a few
things going on, bruh.

793
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:22,892
You going to the bar tonight?

794
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:24,722
- No, I'm good.

795
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:31,313
- Look man, whatever you going
through, come on back bruh.

796
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:32,625
I know you stressed
and all that,

797
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:34,732
but you moping around
ain't gonna help.

798
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,802
You gotta be stronger cuz.

799
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:38,114
- Strong like who Fred?

800
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,944
Strong like Pops?

801
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:42,152
- Man what is you talking about?

802
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,154
- My pops killed
himself you know that?

803
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,431
- You don't know nothing man.

804
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:46,226
That could've been an
accident or something.

805
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:47,434
- It wasn't no accident.

806
00:45:48,435 --> 00:45:49,643
What you talking about?

807
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:53,197
He blew his damn brains out

808
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:54,474
because he was dealing
with the same thing

809
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:55,959
I'm dealing with right now.

810
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,201
- But you don't even
know what you're dealing with.

811
00:45:57,202 --> 00:45:58,444
- It ain't even
been a few months

812
00:45:58,445 --> 00:46:00,584
and my head is all
over the place.

813
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:02,828
And he fought it for years Fred.

814
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:03,863
- You're trippin' Dee.

815
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:05,107
- No, you're trippin'.

816
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,178
You're telling
what I should feel,

817
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,077
and I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.

818
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:15,393
- Look man, call your mom
and make sure she okay.

819
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:18,499
I got a few things
I gotta handle.

820
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,640
So I'll holla at you later man.

821
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,782
Dee.
- What?

822
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,199
- Pull yourself together, man.

823
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:59,057
- Darius.
- Hey, Mr. Parsons.

824
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,646
- Hey, how are you buddy?

825
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:04,821
- I'm doing good,
I'm doing good.

826
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,064
Hey I was just calling to see

827
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:10,827
if you had a chance to have
your guys check out that script?

828
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,001
- Uh, they did,
they did actually,

829
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:14,831
and they got a chance
to read the draft

830
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,040
you emailed me as well.

831
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:19,628
- Okay, what you think?

832
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,183
- Well, to be honest
with you Darius they passed.

833
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,980
You know, it's just not what
they're looking for right now.

834
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:29,811
- I thought you loved it.

835
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:31,640
- I did, I do, I like you.

836
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,504
But you know, the
people upstairs?

837
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,299
They got their own
things going on.

838
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,645
Unfortunately for both of us,

839
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,614
they're the ones that
write the checks.

840
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:41,824
Darius? Hey, you still there?

841
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:45,723
- Yeah, yeah I'm still here.

842
00:47:45,724 --> 00:47:47,864
- By the way
that draft you sent me,

843
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,106
it's not your best work.

844
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:50,246
Keep writing Darius.

845
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,801

888
00:50:14,357 --> 00:50:17,530

Think he got the rights
to these streets.

890

turn into something?

892

896
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:34,341
Los said something about
your little run-in.

00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,273

00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:45,213
- That's cool. You just can't
get it in my hood though.

902
00:50:45,214 --> 00:50:48,216
- Your hood? Bruh you
not from around here.

903
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,046
I was born on these streets.

904
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,324
So I got the right to get
money on these streets.

905
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:53,601
But I'm also one
of the ones who say

906
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,327
who else can get money
on these streets.

907
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:57,261
- Is that right?
- Yeah that's right.

908
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,401
- It can get ugly real quick G.

909
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:02,886
- Use it or put your toy up.

910
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,612
- I see you gonna
make this difficult.

911
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:07,063

00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:15,795
Keep crossing them tracks,

00:51:15,796 --> 00:51:17,935
and you liable to get
ran over by a train.

917
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,800
- Oh for real?
- Yeah for real.

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,082

Come on, come on.

- What you wanna do?

922
00:51:36,714 --> 00:51:38,404
- I told you.

923
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:39,992
Let it play out.

924
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:41,476
- You know he ain't
gonna let this go down.

925
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:42,478
- Yeah I know.

926
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:48,483
- Depression can be brought
on for any number of reasons.

927
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:50,416
A chemical imbalance
in the brain,

928
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,211
a traumatic experience,

929
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,937
a combination of both.

930
00:51:53,938 --> 00:51:57,147
There's still so much we
don't know about depression.

931
00:51:57,148 --> 00:52:01,047
- I just, I just need
for it to ease up.

932
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,671
- And it can with
the right approach.

933
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:06,502
Like I said, there is
no one absolute fix.

934
00:52:09,436 --> 00:52:10,436
Tell you what,

935
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:13,370
I'm gonna give you something
to help take the edge off.

936
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:15,131
It's called Celexa.

937
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,822
I'm gonna start you
with a small dose.

938
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:21,482
Meanwhile, I want you to
follow up with Dr. Nancy Franz.

939
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:23,449
She is really good at
getting to the root of issues

940
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,624
related to past trauma.

941
00:52:25,797 --> 00:52:28,489
- How, this isn't
gonna, you know,

942
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,353
have me all spaced out is it?

943
00:52:30,354 --> 00:52:33,839
- No, like I said, we're gonna
start you with a small dose

944
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,255
until we see what works best.

945
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:39,016
- Is this something
that will, you know,

946
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,535
eventually go away?

947
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:41,536
- It's hard to say.

948
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:45,161
Judging by what you told me
about your family history,

949
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,472
it's probably something
you're gonna be dealing with

950
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:47,473
for the long haul.

951
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,028
But it is manageable.

952
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,688
- Thank you Dr. kates.

953
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:57,173
- Not a problem.

954
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,484
Make sure you follow
up with Dr. Franz.

955
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:00,037
- I will.

956
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:01,867
- And make sure you take
that medication every day.

957
00:53:01,868 --> 00:53:02,902
- Yes sir.

958
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:04,110
- Not one miss.

959
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:06,182
- Every day without
a miss, got it.

960
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,806

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,760
you wanna quit.

1042
00:58:10,038 --> 00:58:11,522
Life don't work that way, son.

1043
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:14,698
You can't just give up
'cause things get rough.

1044
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:18,943
- I can't be on the bench while
all my friends are starting.

1045
00:58:20,324 --> 00:58:22,119
- Let me tell you
something, Darius.

1046
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,950
Every day I wanna give up
on things, but I can't.

1047
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,539
Believe me son,

1048
00:58:30,023 --> 00:58:33,199
I wish I had the chance to do
half the things you get to do.

1049
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:38,066
Can't give up son.
Keep fightin'.

1050
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,897
Keep pushing. Keep believin'.

1051
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:48,386
I just wish I had
more time with you.

1052
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:53,011
Darius.

1053
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,568
I'm batting zero son.

1054
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:24,526
- Hey, how was your day?

1055
00:59:26,217 --> 00:59:28,910
- Good. It was good.

1056
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,983
- How are the pills working?

1057
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,571
- Good.

1058
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,884
I'm beginning to feel
like myself again.

1059
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:41,508
- That's funny, because
this pill bottle

1060
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:44,580
looks mighty full to me.

1061
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,098
- Look Shan-
- Don't open your damn mouth

1062
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,688
to lie Dee, don't say a word.

1063
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:52,967
The doctor told you to
take these pills every day.

1064
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:54,659
Did he or did he not?

1065
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,350
- Listen-
- Did he or did he not Dee?

1066
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:58,663
- He did, but them things
were making me jittery.

1067
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:00,735
- Jittery or depressed,
take your pick.

1068
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:06,187
- I'm tryin'.
- Tryin' what?

1069
01:00:06,188 --> 01:00:07,430
- Tryin' to call Dr. Franz,

1070
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:08,604
because I looked
through your phone

1071
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,019
and I don't see her
number nowhere in there.

1072
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,021
Keep lyin' to me.

1073
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:13,609
- Why are you on my back?

1074
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,334
- Because I love you Dee,
that's why I'm on your back.

1075
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,613
- Well get off, because
I don't like it.

1076
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,615
- You don't like it?

1077
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,927
You don't like it, okay.

1078
01:00:21,928 --> 01:00:24,655
So you don't like it when
someone's trying to help you.

1079
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,486
You don't like it when
someone's telling you the truth?

1080
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:33,008
No, Darius just wants to be
a selfish ass little kid.

1081
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:36,080
I don't care if
you don't like it.

1082
01:00:37,979 --> 01:00:39,496
How am I supposed to help you

1083
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:41,465
when you don't even
wanna help yourself?

1084
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:44,398
Stupid.

1085
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,359
- Hi, I'd like to make an
appointment with Dr. Franz.

1086
01:01:16,603 --> 01:01:17,603
Okay.

1087
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,263
- Hello Mr. Thomas,
I'm Kathy Franz.

1088
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:23,851
- Hello Dr. Franz.

1089
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:26,199
- Please just
Kathy's fine, okay?

1090
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,548
So, what brings
you to my office?

1091
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:37,347
- I guess I'm all messed up.

1092
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:38,935
- You're not all messed up.

1093
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:41,420
You're just dealing
with life's issues

1094
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:43,250
the best that you can.

1095
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:47,255
So again, what brings
you to my office?

1096
01:01:49,844 --> 01:01:53,364
- I guess I'm just dealin'
with some things like,

1097
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:01,200
I don't think I've ever gotten
over the death of my father.

1098
01:02:02,857 --> 01:02:05,203
I keep seeing him
in my dreams, happy,

1099
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:07,585
but then it just goes
completely wrong.

1100
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:14,040
- The chain on your neck.

1101
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:18,873
Tell me about that.

1102
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:23,912
- He gave it to
me before he died.

1103
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:27,604
And his father did
the same thing.

1104
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:29,986
I've worn it ever
since I was little.

1105
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:34,820
- So it's almost as if it
links you to both of them?

1106
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,270
- Yeah.

1107
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:40,514
Yeah.

1108
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:43,517
- Wow, Mr. Thomas, I must say,

1109
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:46,451
you are very in tune
with your feelings.

1110
01:02:46,452 --> 01:02:47,764
And that is a good thing.

1111
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,148
It is going to take some
truths that are hard to face

1112
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,288
in order to deal
with your depression.

1113
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:57,849
- I just wanna do
whatever I have to do.

1114
01:02:58,015 --> 01:02:59,395
- Good.

1115
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:01,846
Well, first things first.

1116
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,951
I want you back on the Celexa.

1117
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:07,437
Now, we'll lower the dose,

1118
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:09,163
and that with some
time will help you

1119
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,821
with your jitters, agreed?

1120
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:18,484
Now, next, I want you to
sit and talk with everyone

1121
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:20,797
in your circle of trust.

1122
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:26,111
Explain to them where
your life is right now

1123
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:27,803
and how they can help.

1124
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,080
- Well that's easy.

1125
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:31,634
It's my mother, my
girlfriend Shantell,

1126
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:33,118
and my cousin Fred.

1127
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,951
But they all see my
situation differently.

1128
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:41,576
My girlfriend just
wants it to go away.

1129
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:45,752
And she says she understands,
but I don't think she does.

1130
01:03:46,892 --> 01:03:48,651
And my mother wants
me to pray it out

1131
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:50,550
and my cousin wants
me to thug it out.

1132
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:57,556
- Well, just try your best to
explain to them individually

1133
01:03:57,557 --> 01:03:59,525
what you need from them.

1134
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:03,562
There is absolutely no reason

1135
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,600
why you can't have a good life,

1136
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:09,362
both happy and
fulfilled, all right?

1137
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:13,296
- No problem.
- Great.

1138
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:15,299
- I look forward to
seeing you next week.

1139
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:29,830
- The therapist wants
me to meet with everyone

1140
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:32,626
in my circle to kinda
explain what's going on.

1141
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:35,111
- Okay, so that everyone that
needs to know knows, right?

1142
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:38,875
- Yeah, but I just need you
all to know that I just,

1143
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,049
I just really needs your words.

1144
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,326
I know you guys love me,

1145
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,708
but other times I
just need silence.

1146
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:48,642
I think I just need to
process things on my own.

1147
01:04:48,643 --> 01:04:51,783
- But what about Fred? Does he
know you're seeing therapist?

1148
01:04:51,784 --> 01:04:53,336
- No, not yet.

1149
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:55,752
But come on babe, Fred is Fred.

1150
01:04:55,753 --> 01:04:57,202
He just wants me
to be super thug

1151
01:04:57,203 --> 01:04:58,859
and everything is gonna be okay.

1152
01:04:58,860 --> 01:04:59,860
- Right.

1153
01:05:01,138 --> 01:05:02,311
- I'm actually supposed to
meet up with him later on

1154
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:04,451
to kinda explain
what I need from him.

1155
01:05:04,452 --> 01:05:06,798
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1156
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:09,525
- And the therapist
wants me to meet with her

1157
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:10,596
at least once a week.

1158
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,634
And I want you to
start coming with me.

1159
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:18,051
- Whatever you need
baby, I'm here.

1160
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:19,846
- Yeah, I know.

1161
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:27,199
- Hey Darius, you want
something to drink?

1162
01:05:28,131 --> 01:05:29,201
- No I'm good Mama.

1163
01:05:30,616 --> 01:05:33,514
- All right, now, you
know what day it is right?

1164
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:34,515
You ready?

1165
01:05:35,828 --> 01:05:38,174
All right, you go on into
the car and get the stuff.

1166
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:40,039
We'll meet you in the
kitchen, all right?

1167
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:48,116
- Ma, help me wash this car.

1168
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:51,463
- You know I ain't
in the mood today

1169
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:53,741
for all your foolishness now.

1170
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,260
- Come on.

1171
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:58,263
Look, you don't go nowhere
but church and home, okay?

1172
01:05:58,264 --> 01:05:59,299
I mea, you need to get out.

1173
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,921
Plus you could use the exercise.

1174
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,164
- Watch your mouth.

1175
01:06:02,165 --> 01:06:04,200
- I'm just sayin'.

1176
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:05,822
Look I'll wash and you rinse.
- What?

1177
01:06:05,823 --> 01:06:08,239
- I'll wish
and then you just rinse.

1178
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,792
- Hey Sister Thomas.

1179
01:06:09,793 --> 01:06:11,725
- Well, hey Sister Jones,
how you doin' today?

1180
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:13,037
- I'm doin' good
girl, how you doin'?

1181
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:14,279
- I'm all right.

1182
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,487
- Good, I'm heading
on down to the church

1183
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:17,593
for midday worship,
you wanna come?

1184
01:06:17,594 --> 01:06:19,698
- No, think I'm gonna
stay right here,

1185
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:21,493
help my son wash this car.

1186
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:22,978
- Well you know the Lord
don't like it when we-

1187
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,947
- The Lord don't care if I
miss one day of bible study.

1188
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:28,053
- God bless.

1189
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,642
- All right, come on.

1190
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:33,057
- All right, look Ma, just look.

1191
01:06:33,058 --> 01:06:34,506
I need you to spray right here.

1192
01:06:34,507 --> 01:06:36,094
- Where, where you
sayin'? Right here?

1193
01:06:36,095 --> 01:06:37,923
- No, Ma, stop, stop!
- Right here?

1194
01:06:37,924 --> 01:06:39,477
- No, Ma that's not

1195
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:40,685
where I'm goin'!
- Oh, where you want it?

1196
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:41,618
- Where you want it?
- Stop playin'!

1197
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:42,899
- You gettin' my shirt! Come on!

1198
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,591
- What's up cuz.

1199
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:54,043
- We been tight our whole lives,
ever since we were little.

1200
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,115
You know you've always
been a big brother to me.

1201
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,636
But right now I need
that big brother.

1202
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:03,432
- What you talkin' about?

1203
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,227
- I'm sufferin' from
depression dawg.

1204
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:06,297
- Here you go with that again.

1205
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:07,368
- I'm serious Fred.

1206
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,613
That's why my father killed
himself, and his father too.

1207
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:15,375
- So what you want from me Dee?

1208
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:16,652
What you want me to
lay you on my shoulder

1209
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:17,894
and pat you on your back?

1210
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:19,965
- What I need for you
to do is understand man.

1211
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:21,657
- Understand what Dee?

1212

That you about to

1213
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:23,901
turn you into a zombie?

1214
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:27,594
I seen it in the joint
many a times man.

1215
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:29,009
Soon as you start
takin' them pills,

1216
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,736
your ass can barely function.
- It's not like that.

1217
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,358
- It doesn't have
to be like that.

1218
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,739
But it's pressin' on me cuz.

1219
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,740
It's killin' me.

1220
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:40,952
- Whatever cuz.

1221
01:07:40,953 --> 01:07:43,404
If you need me to hold
your hand, I'll do it.

1222
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:50,825
I'm out man.

1223
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,241
- Fred.

1224
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,077
- All right, there go
that lame right there.

1225
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,114
When we pull up, dump on him.

1226
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,565
You ready lil homie?

1227
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,671
- We did it young blood!

1228
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:12,294
We did it! We the champs!

1229
01:08:12,295 --> 01:08:13,640
We're the champs
baby, we did it.

1230
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:14,779
Come on man, get a drink man.

1231
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,126
We did it, we the champs.

1232
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,300
We the champs baby, we did it.

1233
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:19,301
- What's up Fred?

1234
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,789
- Fred!
- Let's go.

1235
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:27,171
- Come on Fred.

1236
01:08:27,172 --> 01:08:29,622
Come on Fred get up. Get up!

1237
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:33,660
Someone call the damn ambulance!

1238
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:35,386
Someone call that
fuckin' ambulance!

1239
01:08:35,387 --> 01:08:36,663
Come on Fred, come on!

1240
01:08:36,664 --> 01:08:38,975
Come on Fred! Don't

01:08:38,976 --> 01:08:40,253

Come on Fred, get up!

1270
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:13,338
Hello?
- Darius?

1271
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,099
- What's wrong?

1272
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,996
- Baby it's your mom.

1273
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,032
- She okay?

1274
01:11:19,033 --> 01:11:20,482
- No baby she's not.

1275
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:24,038
- All right, all
right I'm on my way.

1276
01:12:24,616 --> 01:12:25,789
- Let us all be seated.

1277
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:44,152
Many of them looked unto
Jesus for verbal gymnastics.

1278
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:48,190
But according to John 14:12,

1279
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:52,056
he simply said that
"In my father's house,

1280
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:53,851
there are many mansions.

1281
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:57,579
If it were not so, I
would have told you.

1282
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:02,342
I go to prepare
a place for you."

1283
01:13:02,343 --> 01:13:05,310
The Bible teaches
us that eternal life

1284
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:08,486
is not here on earth, but
shall be in the hereafter,

1285
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:12,835
in a place that God has
prepared for eternal peace,

1286
01:13:12,836 --> 01:13:17,012
a peace not seen or heard
by the eyes and ears of man,

1287
01:13:17,013 --> 01:13:19,428
for I know my redeemer lives.

1288
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:22,362
Thus, when my flesh
has been destroyed,

1289
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:25,089
I shall stand and see God.

1290
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:28,299
For we all know that
the Lord has said,

1291
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,475
"Whoever shall believeth in me

1292
01:13:31,476 --> 01:13:36,412
shall not perish, but shall
have everlasting life."

1293
01:13:48,596 --> 01:13:50,218
- You coming to bed baby?

1294
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:54,706
- Nah I'm gonna sit
here for a little bit.

1295
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:06,475
- I cannot
believe the day has come

1296
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,443
that a son of mine
does not believe

1297
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,685
in the House of the Lord.

1298
01:14:09,686 --> 01:14:11,411
- Do you love me son?

1299
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:12,378
- Whatever you're going through,

1300
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:13,793
I'm going through.

1301
01:14:13,794 --> 01:14:15,450
- Depression mean you're weak.

1302
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,692
- I don't want it!

1303
01:14:16,693 --> 01:14:17,728
- And only weak
guys get depressed.

1304
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:19,315
- I don't want it!

1305
01:14:19,316 --> 01:14:20,869
- Pull yourself together, D.

1306
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,284
- I don't want it,

1307
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:23,458
I don't want it!
- Man chill with all that,

1308
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,459
man you're good.

1309
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:26,909
You can't keep laying
around here like some lame

1310
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,670
'cause you got a few
things goin' on at work.

1311
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,981
- God if you're
there, help me please!

1312
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:05,742
Help me please, God!

1313
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,677
I need you man! I
need you foreal man!

1314
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:53,825
I need you, God.

1315
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,552
I need you.

1316
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,470
- Dear Darius,

1317
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:40,059
you're too young to
completely understand

1318
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,716
why I did what I did.

1319
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,958
I don't want you to ever think

1320
01:18:42,959 --> 01:18:45,098
that it was because
I didn't love you,

1321
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:47,343
that somehow you
did something wrong.

1322
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,829
The pain just got too
heavy for me to hold.

1323
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:54,729
I feel like I took
the easy way out.

1324
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,179
But life seemed hard.

1325
01:18:57,698 --> 01:18:58,975
Be good to yourself son

1326
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:01,909
and to the people who love you.

1327
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,156
And if this monster comes
for you, keep fightin',

1328
01:19:08,019 --> 01:19:09,503
more than I could.

1329
01:19:10,642 --> 01:19:13,024
I love you, Pops.

1330
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:07,250
Now, slow it down
son, do circles.

1331
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:11,358
Yeah, yeah just like that.

1332
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,297
- Do you think I'll ever get
to drive it one day Pops?

1333
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:21,574
- Maybe.

1334
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:23,541
Depends.

1335
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,959
- Depends on what?

1336
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:30,686
- Well it depends
on if you understand

1337
01:20:30,687 --> 01:20:32,448
everything that
it represents son.

1338
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,174
- Well I know it
represents the bond

1339
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:36,831
between you and Granddad.

1340
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,592
- Yeah, that's right.

1341
01:20:39,489 --> 01:20:40,765
And if you get that,

1342
01:20:40,766 --> 01:20:42,446
then maybe one day I
will let you drive it.

1343
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,429
Matter of fact, hop on in
now and see how it feels.

1344
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:51,881
Yeah, go on in there.

1345
01:20:55,954 --> 01:21:00,337
Mm-hm, yeah see how
that feel right there.

1346
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:01,338
Yeah.

1347
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,847
Get in son. Go on get in.

1348
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:55,875
- Yeah.

1349
01:22:38,505 --> 01:22:40,921
- You turned out to
be a good man Darius.

1350
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,236
A strong man. I'm proud of you.

1351
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:50,240
- You spent all of
that time teaching me.

1352
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:52,932
- Nah, I was just
gettin' you prepared

1353
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:54,107
for what might be.

1354
01:22:57,903 --> 01:22:58,974
You wanna come with me?

1355
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:03,874
- No.

1356
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:07,015
I wanna live.

1357
01:23:09,363 --> 01:23:11,778
I'm sorry Pops,
but I wanna live.

1358
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:14,298
- Well live then son.

1359
01:23:14,299 --> 01:23:17,302
Live, even when it gets hard.

1360
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,580
Keep doing it anyway.

1361
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:24,309
- I miss you so much Pops.

1362
01:23:26,691 --> 01:23:27,830
- I miss you too son.

1363
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,522
But I'm with you all the time.

1364
01:23:31,523 --> 01:23:33,077
I was there on your first date,

1365
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:36,287
your first job,

1366
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:38,289
graduation.

1367
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,878
I'll be with you
your entire life son.

1368
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:46,262
- Hey Pops um,

1369
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:51,026
you know I'm about
to have a kid.

1370
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,442
You think maybe that-

1371
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:56,996
- We ain't going to worry
about all that right now.

1372
01:23:56,997 --> 01:24:01,484
You just love him or her the
way that I tried to love you.

1373
01:24:03,245 --> 01:24:05,488
Get 'em prepared, just in case.

1374
01:24:13,393 --> 01:24:14,980
- Just in case.

1375
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,722
- You ready baby?

1376
01:25:07,723 --> 01:25:10,622
- Yup. I didn't think
I'd ever find a job.

1377
01:25:11,796 --> 01:25:14,832
- You'll be fineee D.
They're gonna love you.

1378
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,455
- Not as much as I
love you Mrs. Thomas.

1379
01:25:16,456 --> 01:25:18,458
- Not as much as I
love you Mr. Thomas.

1380
01:25:19,562 --> 01:25:21,839
- All right I'm gonna
go to work okay?

1381
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,152
I love you.
- Love you.

1382
01:25:32,817 --> 01:25:35,198
- What does a big movie need?

1383
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,269
Exactly, we need big money.

1384
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,305
All the stops, right?

1385
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,186
We need big budget, we
need big cast, we need big
food for craft services.

1386
01:25:42,723 --> 01:25:44,068
I do not go cheap.

1387
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:45,829
So we need you to
open your checkbook

1388
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,658
and you to open your check.

1389
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:47,969
You writing this down?

1390
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:49,143
Get the pen out,
get the paper out,

1391
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,627
we gotta make this happen.

1392
01:25:50,628 --> 01:25:53,285
The only way we make this
happen is we get some money.

1393
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:54,838
You open your check,
you got a pen?

1394
01:25:54,839 --> 01:25:57,703
Do you have a pen? All
right, write that down.

1395
01:25:57,704 --> 01:26:01,016
Darius! Oh, how are you doing?

1396
01:26:01,017 --> 01:26:01,984
- Hey Rick, how are you doin'?

1397
01:26:01,985 --> 01:26:03,157
- Oh I'm so happy to see you.

1398
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,676
Are you ready for today?
- Yeah I'm ready.

1399
01:26:05,677 --> 01:26:09,473
- I knew, I knew when I first
saw you, you looked familiar.

1400
01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:11,235
You look just like him.

1401
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,342
Your dad man, he's a hell of
a writer, hell of a writer.

1402
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,033
He'd be really,
really proud of you.

1403
01:26:18,034 --> 01:26:19,518
- Thank you.

1404
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:21,899
- And I'm really happy to
see you keep his work alive.

1405
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,660
- Me too.

1406
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:25,938
- Are you excited?
- I'm ready.

1407
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:26,871
- All right

1408
01:26:26,872 --> 01:26:28,182
You got it?

01:26:29,045 --> 01:26:29,977
Is everyone ready?

01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:31,945
We are gonna make a movie!

1412
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:36,190
- All right let's get it up!

1413
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,536
Quiet on the set!

1414
01:26:37,537 --> 01:26:39,158
Let's roll the sound.

1415
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,780

1416
