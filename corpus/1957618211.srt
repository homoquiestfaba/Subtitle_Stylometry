- [Narrator] Maybe if I just hadn't got

28
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:53,876
out of bed yesterday,
maybe a lotta things.

29
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,586
You gotta hold on here, think.

30
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,943
Yeah, now that I think on it,

31
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:04,016
yesterday started seriously fucked up.

32
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,433
You didn't exactly wake up feeling

33
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,266
like some way cool dude, did ya?

34
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:10,993
Nah, you had one of those hangovers

35
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,643
you wish you could just die from.

36
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:18,623
- Get up, man, Chris is here.

37
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:25,973
Did you drink so much, you
can't even fucking wake up, man?

38
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,773
You're gonna make the old man proud.

39
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:30,286
Get up, man!
- Get off!

40
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,028
- What the fuck's wrong with you,

41
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,943
pushing me away like that, man?

42
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:35,843
Just telling you to wake up.
- It's weird.

43
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,623
Once my older brother,
Brandon, and I were like this,

44
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:40,323
and now we drive each other crazy.

45
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,714
He is right about things.

46
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,253
There just isn't anything
I can do about it.

47
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:47,823
The craziest story I ever heard

48
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:50,103
is how our mom named us Marlon Brando Ray

49
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,536
and James Dean Ray, her
two favorite actors.

50
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,653
You can't be any more American than that.

51
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,903
Now we're just Brandon and Jimmy.

52
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:03,443
Everything would've been
different if Mom hadn't died.

53
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,493
At least, I think so.

54
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,793
We've always kicked back
by the local airport,

55
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,243
watching the planes take off.

56
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,913
We even got up once
with some uncle of ours,

57
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:14,513
our mom's brother, or something.

58
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,646
That was five years ago, when I was 18.

59
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,273
Sometimes, watching the birds
take off is the only way

60
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:24,073
to see people get out of this
piece of shit little town.

61
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,093
Yeah, newcomers always complain

62
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,193
about the sound of planes taking off.

63
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,473
Me, I like it.

64
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:35,193
It's comforting, and as close
to heaven as I'll ever get.

65
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,463
- Just get Chris in here, okay?

66
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:38,313
- [Brandon] Yeah.

67
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:40,351
Look, I'm sorry man.

68
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:41,184
I guess you don't need to hear all this

69
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:42,553
when you have a hangover, huh?

70
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,963
Bro, just take it easy, all right?

71
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,733
- Yeah, goddamn right, take it easy.

72
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,133
I just should've last night.

73
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:53,926
- Yeah, I'll just let Chris on in.

74
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,583
Hey, maybe when I get
home from school today,

75
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,793
we can hang out, or something.

76
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:02,223
At least we'll go to that party together.

77
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,323
- [Jimmy] Yeah, maybe.

78
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,653
- I'm not telling you your
business, or anything,

79
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,893
but if you wanna keep
Alyssha as your girlfriend,

80
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,110
you better show at that
party tonight, man.

81
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,256
- [Jimmy] Fuck that, we'll see.

82
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,156
- Later.

83
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:20,233
- [Narrator] Before all
this shit went down,

84
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,756
we had a great time, when
it was just Brandon and me.

85
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,746
He was almost as crazy as I was, almost.

86
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:34,293
God, I used to look up to
him, my big brother, still do.

87
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,483
The TV always gave me ideas,

88
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,453
hot thing to do, easy crime to commit.

89
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,896
I guess it keeps 'em in
business, I don't know.

90
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,523
It is funny how sometimes in life

91
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,023
things are just handed to you.

92
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,649
- Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me

93
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,853
how I can get back onto the motorway.

94
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,393
- Oh yeah, I can help you.

95
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,713
Where you from?

96
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:55,043
- From England, Gloucestershire.

97
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,183
- Oh, uh-huh, and where's that?

98
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,843
- Oh, it's a long way west of London.

99
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,193
- You're from England or
Ireland, or something?

100
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,673
- A little of both, I think.

101
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:08,413
- Well, there sure are enough of us here.

102
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:09,423
It's a great country.

103
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:10,496
- It sure is.

104
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,863
You can show us that map, or something?

105
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,493
- Yeah, thanks.

106
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,843
- Yeah, why don't you put it
on the hood, or something,

107
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,313
so we can tell where you're going?

108
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:19,813
- All right, thanks very much.

109
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,216
Thanks.

110
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:25,896
Thanks.

111
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:27,906
- Yeah.

112
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,916
- [Englishman] I came off here.

113
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,416
- Oh, uh-huh?
- Mm.

114
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,573
- [Narrator] I wish I hadn't done that.

115
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:38,986
It seemed funny at the time.

116
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,503
Poor bastard probably thought he was safe

117
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,573
with a couple of white boys.

118
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:46,276
We should all be safe, but we ain't.

119
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:00,772
(Englishman groaning)

120
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,029
- Shit, bloody hell.

121
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,862
(slow rock music)

122
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,253
- [Narrator] Chris Hollins
has been a good friend

123
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,853
since I met him in kindergarten.

124
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:36,146
Old man has always hated
him for being black.

125
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,216
He has no reason, he just does.

126
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,633
Chris was trying to warn me.

127
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,033
I just wouldn't listen.

128
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,883
- Josh Brawly told me Ford
Davis is looking for you, man.

129
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,853
But I told him you were out at the

130
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,473
kosher market, or something,
man, I made some shit up.

131
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,673
- He can't find me, man.

132
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,063
- Dude, what's up with that?

133
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,126
Josh said you skipped on Ford, man.

134
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,606
I told him that ain't like you.

135
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,308
- Yeah, well, I'll take
care of it later, all right?

136
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:12,808
- All right, dude.

137
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,283
(metal clattering)

138
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:31,650
(brooding rock music)

139
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,503
- [Narrator] Yeah, I should've
just pulled the covers

140
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,856
over my head for a day,
till it all flew over,

141
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,366
but that's never been my style.

142
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:30,973
I always wanted to be
like my old man, Nick Ray,

143
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,833
but it was best if we
just ignored one another.

144
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,936
He hated me, and I didn't give a shit.

145
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:37,986
Maybe I did.

146
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:42,186
It's sad, I wanna remember
something good about him.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,313
I can't.

148
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,513
All I can remember is his
hand coming down on my face

149
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,571
when I was too small to fight back.

150
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:52,904
(melancholy rock music)

151
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,259
- Come on, man.

152
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:26,523
Come, there we go, Pop.

153
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,198
- [Jimmy] Come on.

154
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,104
- Oh shit, you fuck! (laughs)

155
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,354
- [Nick] Jimmy.

156
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,728
- [Brandon] Come on.

157
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,883
- [Jimmy] Steady.

158
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,363
- [Nick] He fucking spilled
beer on me, the son of a bitch.

159
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,863
- [Narrator] As much as I've
hated him my whole life,

160
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,763
that's how much now I see we're alike.

161
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:55,106
- Hey, good to see you
could make it up here today.

162
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,473
- Hey, man I really
tied one on last night.

163
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,983
- Tell me, Jimmy, do you have any idea

164
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:04,163
what you're doing with yourself, man?

165
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,803
- Well, at least I ain't getting
drunk here in the morning.

166
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:09,676
- When I was your age, I
at least had a goddamn job.

167
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,476
I had a wife, and I had a kid.

168
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:18,173
And I fought a fucking war,
so don't start with me, Jimmy.

169
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,273
- Yeah, see, I am smarter than you, right?

170
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:21,976
- Why?

171
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,193
I can see you didn't learn shit

172
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,543
from your little visit to County, did you?

173
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,353
- Oh yeah, I learned one thing.

174
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,253
- What's that?

175
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,483
- Never get caught.

176
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,167
- Ooh.

177
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,663
Is this the best you can do?

178
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,263
- It's better than you, old man.

179
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,533
- Oh, Jimmy, I don't feel
like arguing this morning,

180
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,783
so why don't you just go?

181
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:45,133
Go on, get outta here.

182
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,383
- Hey, man, you always
have time for arguing.

183
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:58,673
- Have a good one.

184
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:01,406
- Yeah.

185
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,733
- I got a hundred-and-something
channels on this thing,

186
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,100
and I can't get shit on any of 'em.

- [Narrator] I wasn't really
worried about owing money yet.

190
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,043
I figured I'd sell what I had,

191
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,893
and come up with a plan for the rest.

192
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:43,463
The only time I can think
sometimes is when I'm driving.

193
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:46,773
I have this fog over me,

194
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:50,713
especially since I got out
of County about a month ago.

195

What others call trouble,

196

00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,903
down here, down here.

199
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:06,493
- Come on, man, you patted me down before,

200
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,736
and didn't find nothing.

201
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:09,903
You know me.

202
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,143
- Yeah, I know you.

203
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:12,893
Have a seat in your favorite chair.

204
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:19,023
Is this your weed I found in the car?

205
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:20,723
- Yeah, it's my bud and marijuana.

206
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:23,716
What's Mr. Handycam here doing?

207
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,253
- Oh, he's from the Junior College.

208
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:29,156
He's doing a short film
on cops and arrest.

209

- Shit, man, I was hoping
I was gonna be on TV.

210
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,273
- Yup, meet Jimmy, an
out-of-work drug dealer,

211
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,780
this week on "The Real World".

212
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:41,956
Now, is there anything else in this car

213
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,803
you wanna tell me about before I find it?

214
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,753
- Yeah, I got nothing to hide, officer.

215
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:54,613
- You should've just told me.

216
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,614
- Ain't my weapon, man.

217
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:59,123
- We both know you carry a
weapon, you fucking scumbag.

218
00:13:59,123 --> 00:13:59,956
Hey, edit that part.

219
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,923
Get a shot of his dope
or gun, or something.

220
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,503
Let's go.

221
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,336
Fuck, get up!

222
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,484
- No, no!

223
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,981
- Get up!
- No!

224
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:08,981
- Now, fuck!

225
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,409
You have the right--
- All right!

226
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:13,326
- Let's go.

But look at me, I fucked up.

232
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,283
I guess we all do sometime with this.

233
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:33,786

234
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,571
- He's not here, man.

235
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,711
- It's Jimmy.
- What do you want?

236
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,794
- I go something for him.

237
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,953
- Yeah?
- How's it going, Krystal?

238
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:44,786
- Okay.

239
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:47,926
So, what do you got?

240
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:49,093
- What I have.

241
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,323
- Why don't you just give it to me,

242
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,073
and I'll get Dave to pay you later?

243
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,036
Come on, dude!

244
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,089
- Nah, I need 60 bucks.

245
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,703
- I'll give you part of the money.

246
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,973
I'll give you 40, and Dave will
pay you later for the rest.

247
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,724
Come on.
- Come on,

248
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:14,106
just score me another 20.
- Come on, man!

249
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,029
Hand it over.

250
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,619
- Nah, another 20.

251
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,452
Come on, I need it.

252
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:20,806
- Hold on.

253
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:27,976
Shit, man.

254
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,695
It's all I can do.

255
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:34,528
- It's all right.

256
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,643
So, see you later, all right?

257
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,946
Thanks.
- Okay, dude.

- [Narrator] Poor Davis,
I've known him my whole life.

259
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,723
He's always been a little ahead of me,

260
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:55,286
with him being Brandon's age.

261
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:58,726
I hung out with him more
than Brandon did, though.

262
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,343
Ford's been dealing local
shit since he was born.

263
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,386
He farms it out.

264
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:06,793
He made the mistake in spotting me.

265
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:09,261
I messed up, and used the
most of what he gave me.

266
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,928
(pager beeping)

267
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,915
(phone ringing)

268
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,057
- [Ford] Hello?

269
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:21,033
- Hey, Ford, it's Jimmy.

270
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,063
- [Ford] Hey, Jimmy, where you been?

271
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,363
I've been looking for you.

272
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,923
- You know, here and
there, doing business.

273
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:31,533
- [Ford] Cool, we need to get together,

274
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,323
get things straightened out.

275
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,256
- Yeah, sure.

276
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,693
- [Ford] You didn't use all
the shit, did you, Jimmy?

277
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:42,513
- What, now, who said that?

278
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:44,480
- [Ford] That's what I hear.

279
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,109
- Yeah, well, you heard wrong.

280
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,837
- [Ford] I hope so.

281
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,263
- It ain't about that, you know me.

282
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:53,203
- [Ford] Okay, look, let's meet
in the grove by the old boat

283
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:55,896
in about 20 minutes, and talk about this.

284
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:57,763
- Okay.

285
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,193
- [Ford] See you there.

286
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:00,293
- Yeah, see you there.

287
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:10,053
- [Narrator] Looking back,
I let it all go too far.

288
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,323
Geez, why did I keep going deeper,

289
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,723
when I was already drowning?

290
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:16,459
It seems ridiculous now

291
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,163
that I went to meet Ford at the old boat

292
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,563
that was once our fort
when we were little kids.

293
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,846
Brandon and I used to
play with Ford there.

294
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,513
We never did know who owned that boat.

295
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,416
Isn't that funny?

296
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,343
- Lotta memories here, huh, dude?

297
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:53,316
- Yeah.

298
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,383
I remember, I learned about this place

299
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,696
from you older kids, man.

300
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,666
- This is the first place
I ever got stoned, dude.

301
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:17,040
- Yeah, me too.

302
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,519
In fact, you were there.

303
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,306
- That's why I wanted to meet here, Jimmy.

304
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,463
It's like we all come from the same place.

305
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:27,346
- From the rack?

306
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:29,523
- I guess so.

307
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:31,513
So, why are you packing?

308
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:34,593
- Hey, man, I just didn't take
it out before I came over.

309
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,763
- Not too cool for a
man who just got busted

310
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,963
for a concealed weapon.

311
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:43,963
Besides, old Brandon would
kick your ass if he knew.

312
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,303
- Hey, this ain't got
nothing to do with Brandon.

313
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:48,353
- Easy, dude, relax.

314
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,073
- Hey, man, he don't know
shit about what I do now.

315
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:52,703
He's a schoolboy, and
that's that, all right?

316
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,886
- You've always been a
temperamental kid, Jimmy.

317
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,523
So, how are you gonna pay be me back?

318
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:00,886
I mean, ain't nobody
spotting me a thing, dude.

319
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,710
- I'll get it to you.

320
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,493
- I need it today, Jimmy.

321
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:10,543
It's been too long, and too
many people have been talking.

322
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,483
- So, are you fucking threatening me?

323
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,783
- Look, we don't have
to play like this, dude.

324
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,273
This isn't the big city, man,

325
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:19,023
so we don't have to play like that.

326
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,229
There's just not that much competition.

327
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:26,083
Get the money by today.

328
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,683
- Yeah, I'll have it by tonight.

329
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:33,653
- Just don't make me
look like a fool, dude.

330
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:50,153
I always wondered what she'd
be like on the ocean, man.

331
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:51,553
- She'd be like a boat, man.

332
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:09,613
- You know, you've always
been a weird one, Jimmy.

333
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:12,693
Maybe you're the one who
should be at school, man.

334
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,143
Some kind of philosopher,
or something like that.

335
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:19,593
Sure you couldn't give me
a little something, dude?

336
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,283
- Yeah, I got things
going later, all right?

337
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,183
- It's gotta be today, thought, Jimmy.

338
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,703
Keep me informed, all right?

339
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,566
Call me.

340
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,703
I don't want this to become a problem.

341
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:33,996
Call me.

342
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:40,593
(brooding rock music)

343
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,723
- [Narrator] I wish this was all a dream.

344
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:45,703
Maybe that's all life is, is a dream.

345
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,176
If I could wake up, then
my life would start.

346
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,016
But it's not.

347
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,076
When did this safe place
become so dangerous?

348
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,123
You know what they say,

349
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,386
when everything goes wrong, that's right.

350
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,291
(heart pounding)

351
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,106
- You're fucking nothing.

352
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:18,956
Go on, cry, you little piece of shit, cry!

353
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,216
Here, drink up,

354
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:31,306
'cause that's all the fuck
there is in this life, boy.

355
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,363
You either drink it the fuck down,

356
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,786
or it's gonna fucking drink you down.

357
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:39,816
Oh, no?

358
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,626
Yeah, boy.

359
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,793
(lively rock music)

360
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:06,325
♪ You should've seen
the one that got away ♪

361
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:15,949

362
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:23,383
- [Narrator] He's the
only person I've felt

363
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,426
truly close to most of my
life, my brother Brandon.

364
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,103
I should've followed him
out of all this mess.

365
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:32,903
It got a friend of ours, Frankie, killed.

366
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:36,496
But I always felt like he
left me, but he really didn't.

367
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:39,273
It's sort of crackup to think this guy

368
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:41,703
that has sold drugs and done drugs

369
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,036
is sitting there taking a college test.

370
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:47,813
Why not, right?

371
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,313
I wish I coulda talked to him.

372
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,629
I miss all the fun I had with him.

373
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,546
We had such good times at the old boat.

374
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,513
- I wanna take this boat
with us, though, man.

375
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,646
I dig this boat.

376
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,064
It's like--
(Brandon laughing)

377
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,383
What the hell you
laughing at anyways, man?

378
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:09,803
- You, man.

379
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:11,943
I swear, Pop beat your ass too many times

380
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:13,636
when we were growing up, dude.

381
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:16,943
- Man, I used to think about all the ways

382
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:18,693
I could kill him when I was little.

383
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,344
I was too scared then, though.

384
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:26,313
Most of the time, I wish I would've.

385
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:29,176
- Yeah, I thought about it, too, man.

386
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:33,056
I don't know, he's our
old man, though, you know?

387
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,770
Sometimes I wish he'd died in
the war, and that Mom hadn't.

388
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,273
- Fuck, man, half the time
I wish I wasn't even born,

389
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,833
you know?

390
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,433
I got no reason for fucking anything.

391
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,603
- No, man, you can't think like that.

392
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:52,796
It'll drive you crazy.

393
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:56,983
Besides, it don't do no good.

394
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,373
Everybody thinks like that sometimes.

395
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:00,936
- Yeah, but where are we going?

396
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:04,613
- Anywhere but here.

397
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:06,963
In fact, I tell you what.

398
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:08,003
Put a hitch on your car,

399
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:10,253
and we'll take this boat
wherever we go, man.

400
00:24:11,303 --> 00:24:14,856
- Cool, we could just go till
we like somewhere, you know?

401
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:21,333
- [Narrator] Yeah, that
boat wasn't going nowhere,

402
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,356
and neither were we.

403
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:25,406
- Hey, Jimmy.

404
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:27,593
- Hey, Erica, how's it going?

405
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,082
- What's up, you looking for Aly?

406
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:30,915
- Nah.

407
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:32,732
- Looking for Brandon?

408
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,043
- Hmm-mm.

409
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,833
- Enrolling in class?

410
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,633
- Hey, maybe I just came to see you.

411
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,733
- Coming to the party tonight?

412
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,863
- Nah.

413
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:44,363
- Well, then you won't see me.

414
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,370
- Huh, yeah, see you later, all right?

415
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,208
- That's were I'm gonna be.

416
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:53,375
(brooding rock music)

417
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:09,039
- [Narrator] Yeah, that's when I really

418
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,363
should've thought of a game plan.

419
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:13,563
Instead, I was headed over
to Chris' to get stoned,

420
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,826
get me to relax, help me think.

421
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,827
Duh!

422
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:23,660
- What you think, man?

423
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:28,911
- Shit, it's the best in the country, man.

424
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,923
- I'm finally relaxing, man.

425
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:41,697
You want some more?

426
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:42,530
- So, are you gonna
tell me what's going on

427
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,793
with you and Ford, or what, dude?

428
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:46,955
- Wanna buy my car?

429
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,243
- Just ain't got no money, man.

430
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:53,996
- Yeah.

431
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,823
Me neither, man, that's the problem.

432
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,676
- Ah, so you do owe Ford.

433
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:03,568
- Yeah, man.

434
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,296
- Jimmy, man, don't fuck with Ford.

435
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,606
Dude, he's out trying to make
it big in this shit, man.

436
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:15,106
Watch your back, dude.
- Check this out, man.

437
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:17,906
I'm carrying.

438
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,092
- Shit, dude, put that thing back, man,

439
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:23,546
before my mom comes back and
has a heart attack, dude.

440
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,023
I got enough problems with her thinking

441
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,173
I'm too old to be living
here and all, man.

442
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,683
- Hey, I'm sorry, man.

443
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:33,033
- It's cool.

444
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,813
It's just, you know, she will
get weird about that, man.

445
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:39,313
- Yeah, your mom has always
been real cool to Brandon and I.

446
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:42,956
- Yeah, you guys did an
awesome snow job on her, man.

447
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,470
She says to me,

448
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,800
"Why can't you be more
like Brandon and Jimmy?"

449
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,026
- Yeah, well, at least like Brandon.

450
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:55,733
- So, how much you owe, dude?

451
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:56,566
- Eight.

452
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,160
- $800?

453
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:03,693
How much you got?

454
00:27:05,743 --> 00:27:09,191
- Well, I got about
100 I can come up with.

455
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:12,133
- You gotta come up with $700, dude?

456
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,963
- No, man, don't worry about it.

457
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,925
- Shit, dude, you'll get
your ass kicked, man.

458
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,956
Even worse if you don't
so something about it.

459
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:24,303
Ford's got too many friends
to be starting that shit, man.

460
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,826
I'll see what I can come up with, man.

461
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:30,233
But you see what you
can come up with, dude,

462
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:33,646
and I'll fucking get you some help, man.

463
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:36,573
- Man, you're fucking
stoneder than me, man.

464
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,803
- Dude, so at least
I'm thinking here, man.

465
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:41,076
- Yeah, all right, Super Fly.

466
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,443
- Man, fuck you.

467
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:43,293
I am trying to help you,

468
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,643
and you get fucking racial
and shit on me, man.

469
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,666
- I'm sorry, man.

470
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,913
- That's better, dude,
show fucking gratitude.

471
00:27:52,913 --> 00:27:55,143
- You got any more of this shit?

472
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:56,993
- Fuck, dude, I'm floating here, man.

473
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,542
- Yeah.

474
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:04,253
Well, I guess I better get
up and get myself going here,

475
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:05,453
and look for this money.

476
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:08,186
- I'll get you half by tonight, dude.

477
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:10,413
- How much is that?

478
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,153
- I'll get you 400 tonight.

479
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,603
- Thanks, man.

480
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:16,716
- No problem.

481
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:19,496
Dude, I can't wait for
that party tonight, man.

482
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:23,883
- Catch you later, man.

483
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:24,833
- All right, amigo.

484
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,633
Take care, dude.

485
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:38,573
- [Narrator] Pride?

486
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:42,806
I don't know.

487
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:46,456
Alls I know is that
was $300 I didn't have.

488
00:28:47,983 --> 00:28:50,696
That's when I started getting
some real stupid ideas.

489
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:54,793
I've always found more trouble
to get me out of trouble.

490
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:02,464
(ignition whirring)

491
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,631
(brooding rock music)

492
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:25,526
- [Cashier] Howdy.

493
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,461
- [Jimmy] Give me your fucking money!

494
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:39,493
- What?

495
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:40,343
What?
- I ain't gonna hurt you.

496
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,693
Give me your fucking money.

497
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,713
Do something!

498
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:46,998
- I can't help you.
- Fuck, give me the money!

499
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,003
- What are you talking about?
- Give me the fucking money!

500
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,858
- I can't open the drawer.

501
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,193
- Do something!

502
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:54,283
- What's your member number?

503
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:56,493
I can't open the drawer without a number.

504
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:57,846
- Fucking do something!

505
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:02,606
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.

506
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,407
- Ah!

507
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:13,403
- [Narrator] I always dream
what it would've been like

508
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:14,476
to have my mother.

509
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,880
I envy everyone that has one.

510
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:22,439
(melancholy music)

511
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:44,853
I love playing with Alyssha's dogs.

512
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:46,213
The collie's name is Dusty,

513
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,733
and the Australian
shepherd's name is Clint.

514
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,676
Pretty cool, huh?

515
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:52,186
Everybody should have a dog.

516
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,483
They're better than people.

518
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,783
- [Narrator] Boy, we've
had some good times here.

519
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:12,503
I remember, when I first met Alyssha,

520
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,583
Brandon and his girl, Kim,

521
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,823
were thinking I might go to school

522
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:17,356
if they fix me up with
some sexy college girl.

523
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:20,636

At least I still get my checks, huh?

about half 'em were faking it.

He wasn't drunk.

He was open, I can see that now.

about the money and shit.

Could I have told my dad?

No, never, not in a million
years would I do that.

622

You wanna know what it means?
- Yeah, I wanna know!

00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:14,373
you ain't never had time
for me, so I'm never

Jimmy over here was just telling me

how much he doesn't need
me, ain't that right, Jimbo?

631

He's crazy, I told ya.

637
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:52,283
- Yeah, I'm crazy, so the fuck what?

638
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:54,823
- You see?

639
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:56,633
I'd have never talked
to my father that way.

640
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,123
Never, no matter what age.

641
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,516

642
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,356
- And who in the fuck are you?

643
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:09,403
Hey, come on, sport, I'm only kidding.

644
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,626

00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:22,082
And you can get the hell out
of my house any time, you know?

646

Hello, is anybody listening over here?

647
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,106
Is anybody listening?

648
00:41:36,653 --> 00:41:37,743
- [Narrator] What is it with my family

649
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,893
that makes us all so
cruel with each other?

650
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:43,163
I guess it was the lack
of a mother's hand.

651
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:45,973
Closest thing I had to a mother

652
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,813
was a few different girlfriends Pop had

653
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,063
while we were growing up.

654
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,666
I guess my real mom was Brandon.

655
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,563
He'd be sore if anybody said that,

656
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:58,066
but he was a pretty good mom.

657
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,296
- Hey, what are you doing in my room?

658
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,813
- This was my room first, man.

659
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:08,873
- Yeah, well, it's mine now.

660
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:10,843
- No, no, I'm just letting
you borrow it, man.

661
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,503
It's really still mine.

662
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:13,336
- Yeah, right.

663
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:19,225
- You ever think about giving
him a break sometimes, man?

664
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,143
- Hey, I gave him a break my
whole life, you know that.

665
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,390
- Yeah, I know that.

666
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,696
But he's older now,
man, he's not the same.

667
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,813
- Look, I know what you're trying to do,

668
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:28,876
but don't defend him.

669
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:31,373
- I'm just tired of all the fighting, man.

670
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:32,376
It's all bullshit.

671
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:36,623
- Yeah, well, I've been
fighting for 23 years.

672
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:40,213
You know what they say, we're
like that MTV generation shit.

673
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:42,205
Immediate gratification.

674
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,643

675
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:46,183
- I was just fucking with you.

676
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:47,833
- Yeah, I know.

677
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,253
But next, you'll say some shit
like my fucking professors

678
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:52,053
about our generation again.

679
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:54,979
- Hey, man, give me all
the credit, why don't you?

680
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:57,256
- Credit, shit, no, I
ain't giving you no credit.

681
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:00,485
- What the fuck is a generation, anyways?

682
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:09,696
Brandon, um, I need to
tell you something, man.

683
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,356
Tonight, you know, after
I see how things work out.

684
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:18,846
- Yeah, sure.

685
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,047

party, then whenever, man.

686

All right?

687
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,713
- Yeah.

688
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,349
- Is it good news or bad news?

689
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,693
- Is your girlfriend going to the party?

690
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:31,526
- Of course.

691
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,792
I saw Alyssha today at school.

692
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,506
She still thinks we're gonna
get your ass there, man.

693
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:41,925
- Yeah, well, you can
believe in some things.

694
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:44,993
It's just, I believe some
things ain't ever gonna happen.

695
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:48,467
- You're so fucking smart to
say things like that, man.

696
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:49,873
I don't get you sometimes.

697
00:43:49,873 --> 00:43:51,106
- Yeah, nobody does.

698
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:54,723
Hey, man, don't hurt yourself.

699
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:55,816
- Yeah, I'll try not.

700
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:01,903
You know, things would
be a whole lot easier

701
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:04,173
if you'd just help me out a little, man.

702
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:06,783
- Yeah, well, I learn all
I need to on the radio.

703
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,983
- [Brandon] Yeah, I guess
you probably can, at that.

704
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,136
Later.
- Yeah.

705
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:16,874
(Jimmy laughing)

706
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:19,863
- [Narrator] If I ever was to be a father,

707
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:21,353
I'd never say half the stupid things

708
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:24,823
my father has said to us
daily while growing up.

709
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:26,303
It's just some shit that will never end

710
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:28,387
if some just don't stop it.

711
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:31,054
(Nick laughing)

712
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:42,153
- Oh, man, I don't want no
fucking niggers in my house.

713
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:44,506
Not in my fucking house!

714
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:49,383
God, what the fuck are
the neighbors gonna think?

715
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:53,686
I don't want the fucking
niggers in my fucking house!

716
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,593
Man, I don't want the fucking world

717
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:01,873
knowing about what I'm doing,

718
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:04,863
just because you're gonna be
smoking some wacky tobaccy

719
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:07,003
with these black motherfuckers.

720
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:09,403
Get 'em the fuck outta here, now!

721
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:10,903
I don't fucking want 'em here.

722
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:13,286
(pager beeping)
- Damn!

723
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:27,046
Yeah, it's Jimmy.

724
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,516
Yeah, I'm working things.

725
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,893
Hey, look, man, I said
I'll get your money, man.

726
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,193
Yeah, I said I'll have it.

727
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:37,716
Look.

728
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,873
Come on, man, why are you
fucking with me like this?

729
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:46,266
What?

730
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:48,616
Hey, big deal, I haven't called you.

731
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:53,613
You fuck, you wanna
threaten me, you fucking?

732
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:56,173
What, kill me?

733
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,356
You wanna kill me?

734
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:01,883
Why don't you try, you
fucking pencil dick?

735
00:46:01,883 --> 00:46:05,163
Hey, man, fuck you, don't
call me again, all right?

736
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah, I said I'll get your money.

737
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,026
(phone beeping)

738
00:46:20,832 --> 00:46:22,239
Boom!

739
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,089
Boom, boom, boom!

740
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,633
Boom!

741
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,466
Boom!
- What are you fucking doing?

742
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:30,964
- Nothing, man.

743
00:46:30,964 --> 00:46:31,797
- Are you tripping on me?

744
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:33,593
- Nothing, I was just playing, man.

745
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:35,473
- Come on, is that shit loaded?

746
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:36,306
- No.

747
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:38,646
- You need a hobby, bro.

748
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,113
- Shit, I got a hobby, man.

749
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:43,863
I'm a cowboy, and you're an Indian.

750
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:46,883
- You watch way too much TV, man.

751
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:49,283
You oughta try reading some time.

752
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:52,052
- You ever think about living and stuff?

753
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:54,423
- As little as possible
when I'm studying, man.

754
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:56,323
- Yeah, but what are you studying for?

755
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:59,283
I mean, you're just gonna die
in the end anyways, right?

756
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,286
- Slow down, man.

757
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,686
Look, I gotta get back to
my studying, all right?

758
00:47:06,263 --> 00:47:09,196
You know, man, you shouldn't
say things like that.

759
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,533
You know, it's like bad karma or something

760
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:11,796
to say shit like that.

761
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,363
- Yeah, you better get
back to your studies.

762
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:20,946
Hey, sorry.

763
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:28,013
- [Narrator] I've always
been a daydreamer,

764
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,226
even when I was little.

765
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,963
It's the place I always wanted.

766
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:37,420
I always got the girl, always
was the hero, whatever.

767
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:41,827
I really dig thinking wild like this.

768
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:44,994
(brooding rock music)

769
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,116
- I've always been faster than you, dude.

770
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,323
- Yeah, at least I hit what I aim at.

771
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,849
And your momma's faster than both of us.

772
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:01,682
- Oh, that's.

773
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,515
(gunshot banging)

774
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:11,616
You missed me, you missed me!

775
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:14,533
(gunshots banging)

776
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:21,123
- [Narrator] I think of
some crazy shit sometimes.

777
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:22,773
I just wish it was all so simple.

778
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,823
Brandon and I had fun when we were little.

779
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,523
We were always playing cowboys
and Indians, and stuff.

780
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,613
Reality hit when a friend of ours died,

781
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:35,613
messing with all the same stuff we were.

782
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:40,216
Frankie OD'd, some said it was suicide.

783
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:43,596
I can't say I haven't thought of it too.

784
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,126
I never cried so hard in my whole life.

785
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,183
But instead of going like Brandon,

786
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:52,503
who turned his shit around in a heartbeat,

787
00:48:52,503 --> 00:48:53,626
I just got deeper.

788
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:57,723
I started using all my own stuff.

789
00:48:57,723 --> 00:49:00,473
I haven't been clearheaded for so long.

790
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:01,926
What good is it anyways?

791
00:49:03,003 --> 00:49:04,683
I should've done it like Brandon,

792
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:06,133
and got the hell outta Dodge.

793
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:08,963
I went around that afternoon

794
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:11,513
and called on every favor I could,

795
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:13,686
borrowing money to pay for borrowed goods.

796
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:17,603
I came up with $350, and with Chris' half,

797
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:18,956
I should've been home free.

798
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:22,726
I thought Ford would
even spot me the cash.

799
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:27,943
Yeah, I just never took to
being threatened very well.

800

818
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:42,093
What happened, man?

819
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:45,523
- Man, he's fucking just pulled up on me,

820
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,913
and just drove me off the road, man.

821
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:48,746
- Damn!

822
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:51,773
- Dude, it's fucking crazy, man.

823
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:53,842
He got out of his car, came running back,

824
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,896
and I just fucking drilled his ass.

825
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:56,836
- Dude, you beat him bad?

826
00:50:57,853 --> 00:51:00,326
- Fuck, man, I kicked his ass bad.

827
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:02,210
- Fuck.

828
00:51:07,308 --> 00:51:09,862
- Fuck, this tastes good.

829
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,737
- No problem, man.
- Thanks.

830
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,106
- Look, dude, I got your 400,

831
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:17,813
but it looks like we need
someone to talk to Ford,

832
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:19,743
and calm him down now.

833
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,743
I mean, it's a whole nother thing, dude.

834
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:24,613
Dude, maybe we can have
Brandon talk to him.

835
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:27,042
- No, no, man.

836
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,113
I can't fucking bring
Brandon into this shit again.

837
00:51:29,113 --> 00:51:31,270
I'm always bringing him into this.

838
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,103
- But that's your brother, though, man.

839
00:51:32,103 --> 00:51:33,933
I mean, he should be able to do something.

840
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,313
- Lay off, all right?

841
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,213
- Yeah, sure, man.

842
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:39,905
Dude, let's just go to the party,

843
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:41,263
and have a good time tonight, man

844
00:51:43,543 --> 00:51:45,443
Come on, man, this shit'll pass, dude.

845
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:52,003
(brooding rock music)

846
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:53,693
- [Narrator] I should've just left town.

847
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,233
I got some help from those who
coulda helped me out of this.

848
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:59,996
Shit, everybody gets in
over their head sometime.

849
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,453
- You're not really thinking
about carrying your gun

850
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:00,473
to the party, are you, Jimmy?

851
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:03,273
- Hell, no, man, I'm just making my bed.

852
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:04,106
- Uh-huh.

853
00:53:05,113 --> 00:53:08,033
Shit, I know this makes
you uncomfortable, man,

854
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:10,403
but she is your girlfriend, and besides,

855
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:12,293
Chris and I will be there.

856
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:13,953
What could happen?

857
00:53:13,953 --> 00:53:15,723
Dude, something like
bringing a gun to a party,

858
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:17,673
and you're bound to find trouble.

859
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:19,366
Shit, it might even find you.

860
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,123
- Yeah, what could happen?

861
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,553
- I know you're still mad at
me for going to school, man,

862
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:30,663
but one of these days,
we gotta talk this out.

863
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:32,633
Something's going on with you.

864
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,523
I know it and you know it.

865
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,433
Still, you won't tell me.

866
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:38,283
- Come on, I said, later, let's talk.

867
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:44,513
- Well, it should be a
good party tonight, man.

868
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,916
- Yeah, well, any party's a good party.

869
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:51,313
- You got any money on
you for tonight, man?

870
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,373
- No, not very much.

871
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,973
- Now, don't go weird on me now.

872
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,833
And don't sweat that, I'll
catch the beer tonight.

873
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:05,455
(heart pounding)

874
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,496
(Jimmy coughing)

875
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:27,181
- Hell, the only time it matters
what people talk about you

876
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,014
is when you die.

877
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:31,923
Do you wanna know what
they'd say about you

878
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:34,656
if you died today, huh?

879
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:39,762
They'd say you're a fucking loser.

880
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:46,120
A smart-ass, fucking
slopping dressing, slacking,

881
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:51,526
no-good fucking drug-dealing loser.

882
00:54:56,573 --> 00:55:01,573
(heart pounding)
(Jimmy coughing)

883
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,311
(upbeat music)

884
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,035
- Yeah, Brandon, man,

885
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,243
you said you were gonna
introduce me to Erica

886
00:55:32,243 --> 00:55:33,683
when we get to that party, man.

887
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:35,513
- Yeah, man, I'll take care of it.

888
00:55:35,513 --> 00:55:36,826
- Hey.
- Thanks.

889
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,573
- Ladies first.

890
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:41,466
- Yeah, well, get your
ass in the car then.

891
00:55:48,497 --> 00:55:51,247
(engine roaring)

892
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,495
Yo, man, listen to this,
I love this song, man.

893
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:58,495
(upbeat rock music)

894
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:01,003
Hey, man, keep your beers down.

895
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:03,026
I don't need to get no DUI, man.

896
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:06,223
- Yeah, Jimmy, you gotta
watch getting a DUI.

897
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:08,733
- You guys are crazy.

898
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,583
Just keep your beers down, all right?

899
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:15,303
- Hey, Brando, why don't
we just go up to the hills,

900
00:56:15,303 --> 00:56:17,360
and have a few beers, fuck the party?

901
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,453
- No, man, we do that, we'll
have a couple of chicks

902
00:56:19,453 --> 00:56:21,703
really pissed off at us
when we show up, man.

903
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,546
- Hey, hey, hey, Jimmy.

904
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:30,413
You tell him yet, dude?

905
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:31,633
- Tell me what, man?

906
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,093
- Hey, it's nothing.

907
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:34,706
- No, come on, tell me what?

908
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,693
Look, some bullshit's been
going on all night, man.

909
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,646
Tell me what?

910
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:44,533
Look, you can't tease me like that, man.

911
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:45,676
- It's nothing, dude.

912
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,303
We just got ahold of this,

913
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,573
this huge doobie today, man.

914
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,883
We smoked it this afternoon,
homes, it's nothing.

915
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:55,702
- Yeah, right.

916
00:56:55,702 --> 00:57:00,702
♪ Do right, you do right,
do right, you do right ♪

917
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:05,772
♪ Right, you do right,
do right, you do right ♪

918
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:10,763
♪ Do right, you do right,
do right, you do right ♪

919
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:13,663
♪ Do right, you do right ♪

920
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,343
- Man, let's kill these
beers, and get in there.

921
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:18,883
- I knew there was
something good about summer.

922
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:20,083
All the women wear less.

923
00:57:21,993 --> 00:57:23,113
- Dude, there's nothing more beautiful

924
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:25,053
than women in bathing suits, man.

925
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,953
- Yeah.
- I mean, a naughty one, too.

926
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:31,833
- Yeah, I think I'd rather have
my women naked in the pool.

927
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,982
- Dude's got a point there, man.

928
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:35,664
- Naked women in a pool, man, that's hot.

929
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,433
(engine revving)

930
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:40,533
- Well, what do say we do this thing, huh?

931
00:57:42,343 --> 00:57:43,703
Tell you what, why don't
you put the empties

932
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:45,153
in the bag back there,

933
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:47,522
and I'll take in the rest of the beer.

934
00:57:47,522 --> 00:57:48,373
- Oh, yeah, Brandon gets
the good stuff, man.

935
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,056
We get to carry empty bottles.

936
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:53,676
- Yeah, well, that's
'cause I'm older, man.

937
00:57:54,863 --> 00:57:56,120
- Dude, you're a mean old man.

938
00:57:57,296 --> 00:57:59,156
- Well, if you guys are good,
I'll let you share some.

939
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:03,331
(upbeat rock music)

940
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:18,733
- Will you stop worrying,
he's gonna be here.

941
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:20,583
- I know, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

942
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:23,915
I don't care, it doesn't matter.

943
00:58:23,915 --> 00:58:25,723
- He's even been pretty cool lately.

944
00:58:25,723 --> 00:58:28,403
I mean, he took us to lunch last week,

945
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:30,943
and he gave you a card.

946
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:33,143
- Well, that sounds really good to me.

947
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,803
And Brandon will make
sure he comes anyways.

948
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,093
Chris is never gonna miss a party.

949
00:58:38,093 --> 00:58:38,926
- That's true.

950
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,793
- I just think something's
up with Jimmy, you know?

951
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:45,626
Something wrong.

952
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,823
I just feel it.

953
00:58:49,823 --> 00:58:51,400
- Listen to her, she can just--

954
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:53,234
- Shut up!

955
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:56,133
(girls laughing)

956
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,009
- Wait, she's got a fluke
coming down into her.

957
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:01,759
(girls laughing)

958
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:06,490
He's gonna be here.
- I don't care, I don't care.

959
00:59:10,784 --> 00:59:12,713
- It has been nice lately, huh?

960
00:59:12,713 --> 00:59:15,040
- Sorry, Jimmy, you think I'm stupid.

961
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:18,835
- No, that's all right, thanks.

962
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,076
- Hey, how's it going, Chris?

963
00:59:20,076 --> 00:59:22,408
- Hey, it's going great, Kim.

964
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:24,793
- Oh, I'm sorry, Erica, this
is Chris, Chris, this is Erica.

965
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:27,157
- Hi, nice to meet you.

966
00:59:27,157 --> 00:59:27,990
- It's good to meet you.

967
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,930
- [Erica] I've heard a lot about you.

968
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,999
- Thanks.

969
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:32,663
I hear there's gonna be a really
cool band playing tonight.

970
00:59:32,663 --> 00:59:34,704
- [Erica] Yeah, they're
supposed to be really good.

971
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,537
They're gonna start in a few minutes.

972
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:36,403
- Well, this is a cool party.

973
00:59:36,403 --> 00:59:38,216
- Yeah. (laughs)

974
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:43,314
- Does anybody need another beer?

975
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:44,664
- Yeah, I could go for one.

976
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,746
- Yeah, let's get another beer.

977
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:51,181
- I'm up for that.

978
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,883
- So, is everything okay?

979
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:02,436
You just seem a bit uptight.

980
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:04,606
- Yeah.

981
01:00:06,153 --> 01:00:07,853
- You didn't even call me, though.

982
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:10,556
- Well, I was busy.

983
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,473
- Do you wanna talk about it?

984
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:17,473
- Look, later, okay?

985
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:28,377
- You okay with all these
strange people you don't know?

986
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:32,813
- Yeah, well, they are kinda strange.

987
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:33,796
- You're strange.

988
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:35,686
- Thanks.

989
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,929
It's a nice party you
got going here, you know?

990
01:00:46,106 --> 01:00:47,813
Your parents are pretty nice to do this.

991
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:51,253
- I'm old enough, and they trust me.

992
01:00:51,253 --> 01:00:52,086
- Why?

993
01:00:55,363 --> 01:01:00,363
- Yeah, well, what they don't
know won't hurt them, right?

994
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:01,923
Don't you think?

995
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:02,756
- Yeah.

996
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:10,313
- [Narrator] Nobody appreciates life

997
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:11,863
till it's taken away from them.

998
01:01:12,913 --> 01:01:15,266
We don't treat it with
love, respect, you know?

999
01:01:16,603 --> 01:01:20,573
I knew big trouble was coming,
trouble that I made myself,

1000
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:21,716
my own worst enemy.

1001
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:27,356
And watching all these people
seeming to have so much fun,

1002
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:31,736
I wondered why I always
felt alone, an outsider.

1003
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:35,446
Thinking about it, maybe I was wrong.

1004
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:39,556
Maybe we're all outsiders,
maybe we're all alone.

1005
01:01:40,773 --> 01:01:43,423
Maybe the beauty is those
very few moments we're not.

1006
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:51,123
(gunshot banging)

1007
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:54,290
(brooding rock music)

1008
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:12,608
(upbeat rock music)

1009
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,433
- What are you doing smoking that?

1010
01:02:29,433 --> 01:02:31,393
Will you hurry up and
finish that off, please?

1011
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:32,226
- I'm sorry.

1012
01:02:33,352 --> 01:02:34,563
I'm mean, we were having a few beers.

1013
01:02:34,563 --> 01:02:36,763
I thought it'd be a
nice time to get stoned.

1014
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:41,716
- Well, I'm sorry, but, you know.

1015
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,363
- It's cool, I mean, like,
you're not into that scene.

1016
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:46,553
- Well, it's just--
- No, that's not it.

1017
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,083
- She's just concerned that the cops

1018
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,433
will show up, or something.

1019
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,563
- Well, the cops aren't
gonna bother you too much

1020
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:52,903
about one joint.

1021
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:55,523
It's how many people here have them.

1022
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:57,363
- See, now, that's what
makes me nervous, you know?

1023
01:02:57,363 --> 01:02:59,963
I mean, look at all these people here.

1024
01:02:59,963 --> 01:03:01,053
- Just kidding.

1025
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:02,093
As long as you're not selling,

1026
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:04,500
you don't have to worry about it.

1027
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,423
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Which is good anyway.

1028
01:03:06,423 --> 01:03:07,256
- Cool.

1029
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,863
- Just don't do it here, you know?

1030
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,056
Did you talk to him?
- Where's Jimmy?

1031
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:25,717
- I think he's playing pool, I think.

1032
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,446
- He seems really sad.

1033
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:32,344
Is there something wrong with him?

1034
01:03:32,344 --> 01:03:34,511
- Nah, he'll be all right.

1035
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:37,273
- He's okay.
- I hope that it's not me

1036
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:39,093
that's making him act that way.

1037
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:41,343
- It's not, you know that.

1038
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:44,833
It's just, we haven't totally
gotten along in a while.

1039
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:48,313
But I don't even think it's
me that's bothering him.

1040
01:03:48,313 --> 01:03:49,313
It's something else.

1041
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:54,906
- He won't talk to anybody.

1042
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:59,893
- [Brandon] He's a survivor,
he'll make out whatever it is.

1043
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:03,653
- Man, I can't be quiet anymore, he's,

1044
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:04,786
he's--
- He's what?

1045
01:04:05,997 --> 01:04:06,830
- [Brandon] Chill, man.

1046
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,593
- Yeah, it's getting pretty fucked up.

1047
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:12,313
Thanks, bro.

1048
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:13,833
- Anytime, man.

1049
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:14,666
- Here.

1050
01:04:15,649 --> 01:04:17,013
- Sorry, Jimmy.
- I need a soda, or something.

1051
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:18,816
I'm getting a little too buzzed.

1052
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:20,753

1071
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:35,442
- Yeah, well, you'd be
better off if I did.

1072
01:05:35,442 --> 01:05:36,753
- So, you are gonna leave me?

1073
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:39,633
- Come on, I didn't say that to you.

1074
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:41,223
- You won't talk to me, or anything.

1075
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:43,373
It's like you're mad at
the world, or something.

1076
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:44,686
- It's not you, all right?

1077
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:04,683
- Well, I'm glad you're not leaving me.

1078
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:09,476
- Stop it!

1079
01:06:10,353 --> 01:06:11,186
God!

1080
01:06:14,331 --> 01:06:15,193
That's always the fucking answer?

1081
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:16,650
- Well, I can't believe I'm
standing here telling you,

1082
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,107
"I don't know what I'll do without you,"

1083
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,200
and you say, "Stop it."

1084
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,960
- I don't want you to depend on me

1085
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,193
forever.
- You're so fucking cruel.

1086
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:30,735
- I don't want you to
depend on me forever.

1087
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:32,993
- I open myself up to you, and
you just slam the door shut.

1088
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:34,693
I'm just a piece of ass, aren't I?

1089
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,680
- No, that's not it.

1090
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:42,036
That's not it.

1091
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,385
- Why do I stand here and listen to you?

1092
01:06:46,385 --> 01:06:48,596
Do you know how many guys
would kill to be with me?

1093
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,578
- Hell, I'd kill to be with you, too.

1094
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:56,146
- Well, you're not
making any sense, Jimmy.

1095
01:06:57,343 --> 01:07:00,093
I'm confused, do you like to
confuse women, is that it?

1096
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:03,316
- No, that's not it.

1097
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:11,550
Hell, I don't even know
what's going on, I mean...

1098
01:07:17,352 --> 01:07:18,545
A lotta shit.
- What?

1099
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:20,533
- A lotta shit's...

1100
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:21,366
I don't know.

1101
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:23,936
- Great.

1102
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:36,126
- I'm sorry, okay?

1103
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:45,352
- Yeah.

1104
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:49,282
- You're so temperamental.

1105
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:50,115
- Screw you!

1106
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:53,836
- Yeah?

1107
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,999
- You wanna spend the
night with me, Jimmy?

1108
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:29,683
- You want me to?

1109
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,006
- Yeah.

1110
01:08:35,713 --> 01:08:36,546
What's wrong?

1111
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,713
- I gotta go somewhere
with Brandon to make this,

1112
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:49,156
all this shit turn out right.

1113
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:58,358
I'll come back, though.

1114
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:01,186
- Good.

1115
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,943
It's gonna be okay.

1116
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:22,653
- So, why don't you talk to me?

1117
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,306
- Hey, man, I owe Ford money.

1118
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:28,406
- What for, shit?

1119
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:32,166
Hey, why are you messing
around with a loser like that?

1120
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:37,823
- I don't know, man, I was
trying to make some money.

1121
01:09:37,823 --> 01:09:39,383
- Don't sound like it.

1122
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,933
How do you deal and owe, Jimmy?

1123
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,173
- 'Cause I was buying more
than I was selling, man.

1124
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:51,855
I don't know, man.

1125
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:52,755
This fucking shit,

1126
01:09:55,062 --> 01:09:56,556
it got way outta hand, you know?

1127
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:00,780
And you've been going to school, and shit.

1128
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,896
- No, fucking don't blame this
shit on me, man, all right?

1129
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:05,766
- I'm not.

1130
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:11,286
- Well, how long you owed Ford then, huh?

1131
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:17,993
- Hey, man, I kept thinking
I'd get ahead of it,

1132
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:19,343
and it got way ahead of me.

1133
01:10:20,952 --> 01:10:22,346
- Why didn't you come to me, man?

1134
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,483
- Hey, you know we haven't
been close for a long time.

1135
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:31,956
- Yeah, maybe, but I am your
fucking older brother, huh?

1136
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:34,006
- Yeah.

1137
01:10:35,393 --> 01:10:37,893
- So, what, you been using
since I went to school?

1138
01:10:43,353 --> 01:10:46,582
- No, I've been using since
Frankie killed himself.

1139
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:47,976
- Man, why?

1140
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,523
- I don't know, man,

1141
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:54,703
maybe I fucking like how
it makes me feel, you know,

1142
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:56,026
or doesn't make me feel.

1143
01:11:02,223 --> 01:11:04,676
What, man, fucking look at me.

1144
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:08,727
- I'm fucking looking at you,
don't fucking be like that.

1145
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,066
- You fucking worried what
other people are gonna think?

1146
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:11,003
- Don't fucking be like that, all right?

1147
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:14,013
- Fucking worried they're gonna
say I buy and sell cocaine?

1148
01:11:14,013 --> 01:11:16,063
- I don't give a shit about anybody else.

1149
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,696
So, how bad is this with Ford, man?

1150
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,046
- Yeah, well, it's real fucking bad.

1151
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:31,556
- All right, how much
do you owe him, then?

1152
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:36,283
- Hey, man, that's not
all there is to it, right?

1153
01:11:36,283 --> 01:11:38,233
- All right, well, what else then, huh?

1154
01:11:41,483 --> 01:11:43,023
- Hey, wait a second, man.

1155
01:11:43,023 --> 01:11:44,403
- What?
- Hold on.

1156
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:46,034
What?

1157
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:47,135
- Fuck.
- What, man?

1158
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:48,796
You wanna fuck with my girl.

1159
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:49,930
- Hey, Jimmy, please!
- Out of my way!

1160

(lively rock music)

1161
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:56,571
- Hey!
- Cut it out!

1162

- [Alyssha] Wait, no, Jimmy!

1163
01:11:57,972 --> 01:12:00,055
Please, stop it, stop it!

1164
01:12:02,576 --> 01:12:06,508
- [Man] All right, come on,
right now, right now, let's go!

1165
01:12:06,508 --> 01:12:07,996
- Can you tell me why you did that?

1166
01:12:07,996 --> 01:12:09,703
- Hey, what am I supposed to do?

1167
01:12:09,703 --> 01:12:11,498
- A lotta guys would just be
proud, you know, it takes two.

1168
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,524
Man, I didn't do anything.

1169
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:13,984
Gimme some credit.
- Forget it, man.

1170
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:15,447
- You can't just do stuff like that!

1171
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:17,697
- Hey, leave me alone, man.

1172
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,833

I can't make excuses.

1176

go to my mother's grave.

1187

again; I'd do it different.
