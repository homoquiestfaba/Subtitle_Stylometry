2
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:40,672
It's not quite right,
is it, Jules?

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,741
No, Grandma.

4
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,610
It's missing something.

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,015
Well, Jules, like I always say,

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,219
"When in doubt,
add glitter."

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:10,002
You were right!
Now it's beautiful.

8
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,470
Just like you.

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,710
Children, my name is
Glinda Stanwyck,

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,681
and I love Christmas so much

11
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,983
that I created
this entire holiday village

12
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,454
for you and your families
to come and enjoy.

13
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,523
But it's getting late,
and you don't wanna miss

14
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,626
the Christmas tree
lighting ceremony, do you?

15
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,562
No!

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,597
All right then!
Chop chop!

17
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,570
There she is! Look!

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,656
They're gonna light the
Christmas tree. Let's go see!

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,483
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Glinda!

20
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,651
- Hi!
- Hi!

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,553
Okay.

22
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,723
Wave at the camera, darling.
When you're not here,

23
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,060
I can watch this
and pretend that you are.

24
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,864
I love you, Grandma!

25
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,666
Merry Christmas, Glinda!
We love you!

26
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,602
- Hi!
- Come on!

27
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,374
Merry Christmas, Glinda!

28
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,144
Merry Christmas, Glinda!
We love you!

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,884
Merry Christmas, everyone!

30
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,886
Merry Christmas!

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,054
Thank you all so much for coming

32
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,759
to tonight's Christmas tree
lighting ceremony.

33
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,529
All right, everybody,
on the count of three!

34
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,900
One, two, three!

35
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,638
It's so beautiful!

36
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,741
- Look at that!
- Merry Christmas!

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,748
This is so awesome.

38
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,083
I'll never forget it.

39
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,853
And I'll never forget you.

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,315
This is Jules.

41
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,250
Yes, all media have
the press release.

42
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,821
#wear_red_go_green"
is officially trending.

43
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,890
Perfect. Bye.

44
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,463
Ho ho ho ho.
I think we can wear red.

45
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,333
Yes! Go green!

46
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,939
Now through Christmas,
any customer wearing red

47
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,642
will get a green
reusable coffee mug.

48
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,111
Bring it back to any Nickerson's
location coast to coast,

49
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,946
and your coffee refill
is half-price.

50
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,548
It's Nickerson's way of saying,

51
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,116
"Ho ho ho!" to their customers

52
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,651
and to the environment.

53
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,519
For News 8, I'm Hudson Goodell.

54
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,721
Megan, back to you.

55
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,322
And we're clear.

56
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,391
- Jules, how you doing?
- Good.

57
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,293
- Good to see you.
- That was great. Thank you.

58
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,295
The place looks fantastic.
Jules is here.

59
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,463
Hi.

60
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,698
Pardon me.

61
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,133
Jules.

62
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,637
Thank you for
all of your tireless work.

63
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,506
I mean, I had high hopes for
this campaign, but I must say

64
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,241
I am thrilled.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,744
It is better than I could
possibly have hoped for.

66
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,679
Well, that is my job,
Ms. Nickerson,

67
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,247
to exceed expectations.

68
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,082
Well, you're darn good at it.

69
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,818
In fact, I was just singing
your praises to your boss

70
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,919
when you came in.

71
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,222
That was very nice of you.

72
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,190
And while you're here,

73
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,192
I wanna get a picture of you
at the big event.

74
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,328
Do you ever stop working?

75
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,497
I'm gonna take some time off
over the holidays.

76
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,065
Tim, Ms. Nickerson.

77
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,067
I wanna get a picture
of her with the customers.

78
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,568
Great, thank you.

79
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,838
I know exactly where
I'd like it. Over here.

80
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,774
Hey, Jules,

81
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,776
if Nickerson's Coffee
can ever help you

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,411
as much as you've
helped us, please,

83
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,179
do not hesitate
to pick up the phone.

84
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,548
I just might
take you up on that.

85
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,950
I hope you do.
Merry Christmas.

86
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,085
Merry Christmas.

87
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,187
- So, Tim?
- Yes.

88
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,189
Let's set up the shots

89
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,725
so you can see the menu
as well as the employees

90
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,293
and all the happy customers.

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,083
<i>You've reached Mitchell Johnson.</i>

92
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,908
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

93
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,577
Mitchell, where are you?

94
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,014
You said you'd be here.
Text me your ETA.

95
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,153
So... did you
get stood up again?

96
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,154
No.

97
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,823
No, Mr. Hobbs.

98
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,325
Mitchell said he'd be here.
He promised.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,670
You hit a home run
with this campaign.

100
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,662
I mean, you never fail us.

101
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,466
I'm beginning to think you're
some kind of branding genius.

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,567
Thank you.

103
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,169
And you're kinda promoted.

104
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,107
How does "Executive Vice
President of Brand Strategy"

105
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,141
sound to you?

106
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,577
That sounds fantastic.

107
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,246
And you know the best part?
No more globetrotting.

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,117
Yeah, you finally get to call
New York City your home.

109
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,960
Hey. Getting a cab was nuts.

110
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,528
I got your text.

111
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,531
Sorry I missed the coffee thing.

112
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,767
I got caught up with a client.
How'd it go?

113
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,303
Pretty well.
I got promoted.

114
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,107
- That's... That's great.
- Yeah!

115
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,075
Executive Vice President
of Brand Strategy.

116
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,278
Executive Vice President
of Brand Strategy.

117
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:58,650
"Executive Vice President
of Brand Strategy."

118
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,888
You still have no idea
what I do, do you?

119
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,790
You...

120
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,659
You develop brand identity

121
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,327
through the eyes
of the customer.

122
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,862
Cheater.

123
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,374
Well, hey, maybe now
you can buy that condo

124
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,965
you've been eyeing on West 80th.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,701
I got a promotion.
I didn't win the lottery.

126
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,704
Well, congratulations.

127
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,007
Thank you.

128
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,843
No more traveling.

129
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,479
I can finally
unpack my suitcases

130
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,848
and live like
a normal human being.

131
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,185
I hope this doesn't
screw up your vacation time.

132
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,686
No, I still have the time off,

133
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,231
but they want me
to hit the ground running

134
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,656
first of the year.

135
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,293
Good, because I've got
some news too.

136
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,995
How would you like to spend
Christmas in Aruba?

137
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,397
Aruba?

138
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,232
Yeah, a client of mine
has a place there,

139
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,777
and he was so thrilled
with our last deal

140
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,735
that he offered it up to me
for the holidays.

141
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,604
Leaving next week.

142
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,606
I guess I won't unpack.

143
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,577
While we're gone,
you might wanna think about

144
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,579
holding your mail, as well.

145
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,048
It's just junk mail.

146
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,083
Subscription to
<i>The New Yorker</i> expired.

147
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,252
I never had time
to read it anyway.

148
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,422
Did you see this letter?

149
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,524
I don't know.
Who's it from?

150
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,993
A law firm, marked
"Third notice. Urgent."

151
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,129
Hey!

152
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,800
I think opening
someone else's mail is illegal.

153
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,635
I know. I'm an attorney.

154
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,906
What is it?

155
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,041
Well, it appears
you've inherited a house

156
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,377
from a Ms. Glinda Stanwyck.

157
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,146
That's Grandma Glinda.

158
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,949
She died when I was
in Poland, remember?

159
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,619
Well, I think you should go
take a look at this property,

160
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,621
see what kind of shape it's in.

161
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,089
I'll push Aruba a week.

162
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,157
I think the sooner you
take a look, the better.

163
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,593
No. Why can't I just
go after?

164
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,162
Well, legally, you've only
got nine months to claim it,

165
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,498
otherwise it goes to probate
the first of the year.

166
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,077
Who knows? You might be able
to sell this thing,

167
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,735
make a nice little profit.

168
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,603
Let me see that.

169
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,942
"House and
surrounding compound."

170
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,177
- I don't believe it.
- What is it?

171
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,214
I inherited Christmas Land.

172
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,470
Jules Cooper, I presume.

173
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,605
Guilty as charged.

174
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,639
Hi. Tucker Barnes.

175
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,042
You must be the caretaker.

176
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,044
No, not exactly.

177
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm the estate attorney
with Barnes and Bantley.

178
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,051
My boyfriend's an attorney

179
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,020
and, well, you just don't
look like an attorney.

180
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,622
I will take that
as a compliment.

181
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,223
Nice to meet you.

182
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,892
Likewise.

183
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,628
We actually had a heck of
a time tracking you down.

184
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,064
Sorry. I have been
traveling for work,

185
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,166
and I can barely keep up
with my emails,

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,401
much less snail mail.

187
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,671
Life in the fast lane.
I understand.

188
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,374
Things are a little
less hectic here.

189
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,176
I remember.

190
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,912
I used to come every year
when I was little.

191
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,181
I know you did.

192
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,382
You do?

193
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,850
I was in the crowd one year

194
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,086
when Glinda had you
light up the tree.

195
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,588
Really?

196
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,223
That's amazing.

197
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,826
Well, welcome back
to Christmas Land.

198
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,594
Do you want me
to show you around?

199
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,196
Sure.

200
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,041
And the Christmas tree farm,
who does that belong to?

201
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,599
You.

202
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,601
Wait, I thought it was
just Grandma's house

203
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,036
and these buildings.

204
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,405
No. Everything the eye
can see from here

205
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,774
belongs to you now.

206
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,581
Do you want me to show you
the house now?

207
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,249
Yeah.

208
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,397
Like a picture in a storybook.

209
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,244
It's been closed up
for the last couple months.

210
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,914
As you can see, everything
was pretty much left intact.

211
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,251
Grandma.

212
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,224
Are you okay?

213
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,126
Just miss her.

214
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,131
Why'd you stop coming to visit?

215
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,667
When I was 12,
my dad got transferred,

216
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,737
so I wasn't able
to make it back as much.

217
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,007
She came to visit us instead.

218
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,576
- Where are your parents now?
- Seattle.

219
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,344
Could use some dusting.

220
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,715
Yeah, and the village could use
a little paint here and there,

221
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,783
and most of the attractions
need maintenance.

222
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,952
But, you know,
with a little TLC,

223
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:05,490
I think the place could be
as good as new.

224
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,758
Ta-da!

225
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,626
Cute.

226
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,361
So are you interested?

227
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,130
Absolutely.

228
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,166
- Yes, I am really glad I came.
- Great.

229
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,771
I'm just wondering
how long it will take to sell.

230
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,707
Sell?

231
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,442
Is that a problem?

232
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,344
No, no.

233
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,880
It's your right, of course.

234
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,650
It's just that,
well, when the town heard

235
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,986
that Glinda's granddaughter
was inheriting the place,

236
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,056
I think that
we all hoped that...

237
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,891
that you might open it up again

238
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,193
and run it like
your grandmother did.

239
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,166
Me?

240
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,971
No. No, no, no.

241
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:58,009
I... Well, I actually
just got promoted.

242
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,813
No. I'm a city girl now.

243
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,083
But, I mean,
this place is great.

244
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,353
It's just as wonderful
as I remember it.

245
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,687
Yes, it is.

246
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,825
But I'm still gonna sell it.

247
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,693
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

248
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,731
Let me show you
the rest of the place.

249
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,735
Hey, what's cooking?

250
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,170
Hey, Tucker.

251
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,871
You must be the granddaughter.

252
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,240
That would be me.
Jules Cooper.

253
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,042
Honored to meet you.

254
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,778
Uncle Frank
is the caretaker here.

255
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,382
It's an honor to meet you too.

256
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,184
I thought this place was closed.

257
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,219
This time of year,
we sell Christmas trees,

258
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,054
thanks largely to Uncle Frank.

259
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,124
You're the spitting image of
your grandma when she was young.

260
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,127
She's gotta be smiling,
looking down at you right now.

261
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,029
It's a great thing,
you being here.

262
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,464
- Uncle Frank...
- Opening this place back up,

263
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,634
getting her going again
like it was in the glory days.

264
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,203
Uncle Frank...

265
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,205
It's gonna make so many
people in town happy.

266
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,474
Okay...
I'm just going to stop you.

267
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,878
I'm not going
to reopen the place.

268
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,080
Well, that's what you said.

269
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,582
I never said that.

270
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,985
I said that maybe she would...

271
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,256
I said that maybe you would.

272
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,258
She's not moving to town.

273
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:24,162
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.

274
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,397
Yeah, well, have fun telling
that to everybody in town

275
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,600
whose Christmas you just ruined.

276
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,168
Uncle Frank, I...

277
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,171
- Unc...
- You know what?

278
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,641
I can possibly find a buyer who
might wanna reopen the place.

279
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,344
I'll keep that in mind!

280
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,956
Believe me, I didn't tell people

281
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,292
you were gonna open up
the place again for sure.

282
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,661
But you told them I might.

283
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,529
A guy can hope, right?

284
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,498
You have to understand that...

285
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,968
I do. It's...
It's just people around here

286
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,171
have a tendency
to jump to conclusions.

287
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,040
I can see that.

288
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,210
Look, I know how special
this place is,

289
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,446
and I can see
how much potential it has.

290
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,825
Totally! And right now
we're only selling trees.

291
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,683
When Glinda was in her prime,

292
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,620
and this place was going
full blast...

293
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,855
You know, he's right.

294
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,324
You actually do
look a lot like her.

295
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,832
Is this her?

296
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,302
Gretchen, Eloise,
this is Jules Cooper,

297
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,703
Glinda's granddaughter.

298
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,539
I used to work in the bakery,

299
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,543
and I just want you to know
I am ready to bake again.

300
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,645
- Welcome.
- Ladies...

301
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,881
And I used to work
in the ice cream parlor,

302
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,684
and I know what it's like
to get a place going again.

303
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,687
So whenever you're ready,

304
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,724
I am available when you need me!

305
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,025
She has her eyes.

306
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,494
Don't you think
she has her eyes?

307
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,997
- She has her eyes!
- Yes!

308
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,765
Well, thank you.

309
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,168
You are quite
the welcoming committee.

310
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,503
We thought since you're
opening up the place again

311
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,340
that you deserve
the red carpet tre...

312
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,776
that is, the red velvet
cupcake treatment!

313
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,846
No....

314
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,184
See, I think there's been
some sort of miscommunication.

315
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:31,289
Ladies, gather up your treats
because we've been tricked.

316
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,924
- Tricked?
- Tricked?

317
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,794
She has no intention of
opening Christmas Land back up.

318
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,397
Well, what is
she doing here then?

319
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,569
If you're not gonna
tell 'em, I will.

320
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,137
I'm gonna sell the place.

321
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,106
Told ya.

322
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,449
Sell it?

323
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,752
Or rent it maybe.

324
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,421
You see, I don't live here.

325
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,624
I have a job
and an apartment in New York.

326
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,627
Well, la-Dee-dah.

327
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,629
I guess the bright side is,
we don't have to get

328
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:16,334
any of the attractions ready
in time for Christmas now.

329
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,271
Okay, well, this has been fun.

330
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,608
I'm sorry.
They just got their hopes up.

331
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,410
I think we all got
a little carried away

332
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,413
with a trip down memory lane,
but let's get real.

333
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,749
If I'm gonna sell this place,
I need to claim it first, right?

334
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,785
Right. I have the papers
at my office.

335
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,386
Great.

336
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,192
And just your signature here
to make it official.

337
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,362
I'm glad you had the paperwork
drawn up and ready to be signed

338
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,697
because I have a lot going on
back in New York.

339
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,433
I can't take on anything else
right now,

340
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,135
especially
this close to Christmas,

341
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,872
so selling it...

342
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,275
does make the most sense.

343
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,611
Yes. You have said that.

344
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,813
A few times.

345
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,184
Well, I don't think
you'll have much trouble.

346
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,196
Over the years a lot of
people made offers to Glinda,

347
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,353
but she never sold.

348
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,122
Why not?

349
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,058
They always had their own ideas,
and it was important to her

350
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,061
that Christmas Land
stay the way it is.

351
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,397
Or was.

352
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,504
You know,
I guess I... could,

353
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,206
I mean should...

354
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,908
clean the place up, right?

355
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,410
If I'm gonna sell it,

356
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,414
then a buyer needs to see it
in its best light.

357
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,351
You think it's difficult for
people to see its potential?

358
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,487
Well, I can see it, but...

359
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,657
some people need
a little more convincing.

360
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,694
Yes, some people do.

361
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,436
Hey, hon, here's Mr. Barnes.

362
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,705
Hello, Mr. Barnes.
I'm here from St. Ed's

363
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,707
to ask if you'd be willing
to make a donation

364
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,675
to our annual Christmas show.

365
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,846
Wait a second.
Are you her?

366
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,181
Her who?

367
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,883
The Christmas angel lady

368
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,918
who's going to reopen
Christmas Land?

369
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,229
- Listen...
- Yes.

370
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,531
What?

371
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,434
I am going to reopen
Christmas Land.

372
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,709
I'm going to reopen
Christmas Land!

373
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,011
You're gonna do what?

374
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,146
I am going to reopen
Christmas Land.

375
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,049
I'm gonna get the whole thing
up and running for Christmas.

376
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,918
Are you nuts?

377
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,754
Christmas is in a couple weeks,
and we're going to Aruba.

378
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,191
We can go after Christmas and
then stay through New Year's.

379
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,569
So you're gonna stay there
for Christmas?

380
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,761
Yes! Prospective buyers
need to see

381
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,229
the full potential
of this place.

382
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,398
That's why I have to reopen it.

383
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,167
- I'm not following.
- <i>I've been marketing.</i>

384
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,936
Picture it.

385
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,438
You are showing
a potential buyer

386
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,208
this beautiful winter wonderland

387
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,910
all decked out
in ivy and mistletoe,

388
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,181
<i>the smell of gingerbread
and peppermint fills the air.</i>

389
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,850
Carolers serenade you
all the while,

390
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,721
passing acres and acres
of Christmas trees.

391
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,625
Wait, wait. Wait a second.
Did you say acres?

392
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,394
I thought it was just this old
house and a row of little shops.

393
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,296
It's like 200 acres.

394
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,665
200?

395
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,104
Mitchell, are you there?

396
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,308
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?

397
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,644
<i>Have that lawyer
email the paperwork,</i>

398
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,013
<i>and you stay there and make
the place look presentable.</i>

399
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,383
Just leave it me,
Mrs. Claus.

400
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,821
Santa is gonna deliver you
a buyer by Christmas Eve.

401
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,522
<i>Talk to you later, babe.</i>

402
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,794
There you go.

403
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,265
Thank you for letting me
use your office.

404
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,568
Well, thank you
for changing your mind.

405
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,803
Do you know how far it is
to the inn?

406
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,438
The inn?

407
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,683
That's where
I'm staying tonight.

408
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,409
No, no!
Christmas Land is yours now.

409
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,083
Uncle Frank and
those nice ladies you met,

410
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,689
they're cleaning up
the place as we speak,

411
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,649
getting ready for you
to move in tonight.

412
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,856
Here we are.

413
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,429
Goes without saying
all this is yours too.

414
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,498
So what do you say?
You gonna move in?

415
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,932
No.

416
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,602
I mean, I don't think so.

417
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,437
All I'm concentrating on
right now

418
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,308
is getting Christmas Land
up and running again ASAP.

419
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,942
Well, your grandmother
loved this place.

420
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,047
It's a far cry from the city.

421
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,449
And that's why I love it.

422
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,451
Doesn't get too quiet for you?

423
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,120
I guess it's a bit slower,
but that doesn't bother me.

424
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,789
You like things slower?

425
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,157
I like to enjoy myself.

426
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,627
Everyone's always
in such a hurry.

427
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,862
Comes a time in your life
when you have to slow down,

428
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,900
decide where you want
to call home, right?

429
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,072
So you have everything
you need here?

430
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,773
Almost everything.

431
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,311
- I gotta get this.
- Yeah.

432
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,979
It's my boyfriend.

433
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,314
Yeah.

434
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,582
Hi, Mitchell.

435
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,417
Hey, babe.
So how's it going?

436
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,387
Fine, but hold on a second.

437
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,089
I'll just be a minute.

438
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,024
No, no, no, that's okay.
You talk.

439
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,059
I'll come by tomorrow at 9 a.m.,
pick you up,

440
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,494
show you the rest
of the property

441
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,097
and help you get started
fixing the place up.

442
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,033
Night.

443
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,434
Bye.

444
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,937
<i>Who was that?</i>

445
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,038
Tucker.

446
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,439
Tucker?

447
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,076
Yeah, Tucker Barnes,
the estate attorney.

448
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,178
Wait, Tucker Barnes
is the attorney?

449
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,747
What?

450
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,281
<i>Do you know him or something?</i>

451
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,760
I went to law school
with a Tucker Barnes,

452
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,251
if it's the same guy.

453
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,886
<i>How old is he?</i>

454
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,592
Our age.
Brown hair, your height.

455
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,762
- Athletic build.
<i>- Yep.</i>

456
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,930
That's him.
He was...

457
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,365
He was what?

458
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,934
He had a reputation.

459
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,572
Are you jealous?

460
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,675
Jealous of Tucker Barnes?
Give me a break.

461
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,123
<i>I know. Give me a little more
information about this place.</i>

462
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,364
<i>Are you okay?</i>

463
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,767
It's actually amazing.

464
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,104
It would be a great place
to raise a family.

465
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,306
Yeah, if you're into
that kind of thing.

466
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,309
"That kind of thing?"

467
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:09,180
Well, what I mean is if you're
able to sell this place,

468
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,782
you might be able to make an
amazing investment in the city.

469
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,852
<i>Maybe that dream condo
on the upper west side?</i>

470
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,755
- Yeah.
<i>- Well, you get some sleep,</i>

471
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,690
and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

472
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,791
Good night.

473
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,493
'Night.

474
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,621
What have I gotten myself into?

475
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,672
- Good morning.
- Morning.

476
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,442
Tucker stopped by
on his way out last night,

477
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,679
and asked me to get you
breakfast this morning at 8:30.

478
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,216
Well, you didn't
have to do that.

479
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,552
I gotta eat too.

480
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,389
And it's just as easy to cook
for two as it is for one.

481
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,091
Well, thank you.

482
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,395
So do you live here too?

483
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,797
Yes, there's a guest house
behind the gift shop.

484
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,600
I squat there from time to time.

485
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,937
I hope that's not a problem.

486
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,773
No.

487
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,276
No, not at all.

488
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,214
Jules, I wanted to apologize
about yesterday

489
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,783
and how harsh I was.

490
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,385
Tucker said that you're gonna be

491
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,956
opening up the old place again.

492
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,591
Morning!

493
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,893
This is cozy.

494
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,429
Yeah...

495
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,264
You know what? I...

496
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:45,636
I'm gonna just go get ready and
shower and, you know, just...

497
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,237
You just...

498
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,307
- Shovel the walkway.
- Yeah, yep, yep, okay.

499
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,508
10 minutes!

500
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,891
Amazing.

501
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,033
Nice coat.

502
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,769
I found some
of Grandma's clothes.

503
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,571
What? You don't think
it suits me.

504
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,507
No, I... I love it.

505
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,609
It's fitting,

506
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,711
especially now that
you're running the place.

507
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,680
So how was your sleep?

508
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,049
Okay, once I fell asleep.

509
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,785
It's really quiet,
which kind of freaked me out.

510
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,853
Freaked you out?

511
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,354
Not a lot of sirens here.

512
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,756
I'm used to sirens.

513
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,791
I like sirens.

514
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,793
Don't sirens usually mean
someone's hurt?

515
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,728
That's not what I meant.
It's just...

516
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,897
I have a lot on my mind
with fixing this place up

517
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:47,931
and Aruba...

518
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,701
Yeah, you seem a little vexed.

519
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,303
- Vexed?
- Yeah.

520
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,973
Vexed.

521
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,077
Can you promise me something?

522
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,279
Depends on what it is.

523
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,250
Look...

524
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,752
I do still plan
on selling this place.

525
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,290
Now I understand
why you're vexed.

526
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,794
But I also still plan on
reopening Christmas Land.

527
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:21,331
I do. I just don't everyone to
get down and out and like that,

528
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,134
like it's the last
Christmas or something.

529
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,071
Well, if you sell the place,
it is the last Christmas.

530
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,441
You see? No.
I have a plan.

531
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,576
- Lying to everyone.
- No!

532
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,411
If everything goes
the way I think it will,

533
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,157
I'm pretty sure I can find
a buyer for this place

534
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,148
who will keep it open for good.

535
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,750
But not you.

536
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:44,021
Tucker, I have a life
and a job in New York.

537
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,589
Right. The sirens.

538
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,658
Okay, will you help me?

539
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,493
How can I help?

540
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,929
Just... go along with it.

541
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,098
Keep everyone's spirits up.

542
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,533
Seems like you're the one
that does that anyway.

543
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,535
What makes you think that?

544
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,337
First impressions.

545
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,975
Come on. Just help me.

546
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,712
I'm really not that good
at lying to people.

547
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,314
It's not lying!

548
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,016
It's just,
withholding the truth.

549
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,854
What is it you do again
for a living?

550
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,991
I'm Executive Vice President
of Brand Strategy.

551
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,393
You make stuff up.

552
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,263
You wanna show me
the rest of this place?

553
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,834
Come on.

554
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,749
So here we are at the barn.

555
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,287
Okay.

556
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,095
Well, this was probably

557
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,798
Christmas Land's
biggest attraction...

558
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,067
I remember.

559
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,869
But as you can see...

560
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:09,907
it's...

561
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,508
Missing a wheel.

562
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,544
Yeah.

563
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,579
You'll probably wanna leave
this particular project

564
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,548
to whoever actually
buys the place.

565
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,217
You don't think I can fix it?

566
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,120
No.

567
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,088
And even if you could,

568
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,025
I think it would take a level
of commitment to Christmas Land

569
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,993
that I just don't think
you have.

570
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,134
Coming?

571
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,586
So, Frank,
what's the damage this year?

572
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,553
25.

573
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,222
25. No problem.

574
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,623
Best trees in town.

575
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,059
- Yeah, they are the best.
- Here you go.

576
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,637
You have a Merry,
Merry Christmas, okay?

577
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,329
Merry Christmas to you, Frank.

578
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,764
You make your customers
pay right on the spot?

579
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,299
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

580
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,401
That's just shortsighted.

581
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,170
Make 'em pay in the gift store.

582
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,182
When they're in there,
they might find some ornaments

583
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,007
and things to decorate
their trees,

584
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,477
and on the way out, smell
the cookies from the bakery,

585
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,145
buy a dozen of those.

586
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,481
That's not a bad idea, actually.

587
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,251
It's what I do.

588
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,019
So you spend quite
a bit of time here.

589
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,989
Not a lot going on in
the office this time of year?

590
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,690
Hey, I'm working.

591
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,626
I'm showing you
around your property.

592
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,504
That is until you sell it
to the highest bidder.

593
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,162
Stop!

594
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,008
You don't have much of
a sense of humor, do you?

595
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,967
I have a keen sense of humor,
and I sense none.

596
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,705
But not a bad gig, right?
Showing me around?

597
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,042
I'm still making up my mind.

598
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,613
Honestly, I like to try to
get out here as much as I can,

599
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,482
especially this time of year.

600
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,317
And as high maintenance
as you are...

601
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,119
High maintenance?

602
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,021
Yes! You can't
sleep without sirens.

603
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,522
You are definitely
high maintenance.

604
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,191
But what I was
trying to say is...

605
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,060
glad you're here.

606
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,363
I wasn't here last Christmas,
and this gives me a good excuse.

607
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,899
Well, I'm glad I could help.

608
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,205
These trees are gorgeous.

609
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,643
They're missing something
though.

610
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,046
- They are?
- Yeah, don't you remember?

611
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,858
Some of the trees were
decorated with ornaments

612
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,182
that the kids made?

613
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,750
Oh, yes!

614
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,586
Crafty Christmas Club.

615
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,488
And when you said you were
reopening the place,

616
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,857
I thought you might wanna
bring some traditions back,

617
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,593
so I took some liberties.

618
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,162
What kind of liberties?

619
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,097
Come on, I'll show you.

620
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,236
Making sure I don't have
boogers in my nose.

621
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,175
Kids,
this is Ms. Cooper.

622
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,776
Jules.

623
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,411
This is the lovely young lady

624
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,181
who is going to reopen
Christmas Land!

625
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,216
Yay!

626
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,252
You know what? Maybe you would
like to show 'em how it's done.

627
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,589
Making ornaments.

628
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,890
Well, I... I couldn't.

629
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,559
No, that's a great idea.

630
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:19,963
Show us how it's done,
queen of Christmas Land.

631
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,365
Oh, yes.

632
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,768
And I'm so glad
you changed your mind.

633
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,437
What do you think of this,
Ms. Cooper?

634
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,072
Well!

635
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,875
I think it's pretty great.

636
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,844
Is it finished?

637
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,146
I don't know.
I can't decide.

638
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,650
Well, my grandmother
always used to say,

639
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,487
"When in doubt, add glitter."

640
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,155
How do I do that?

641
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,557
I will show you!

642
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,394
So you're gonna take this
brush, brush the glue on...

643
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,796
She has a way with the kids.

644
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,700
You take the glitter
and just sprinkle it on.

645
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,307
And then blow off the excess.

646
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,813
She's quite the girl.

647
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,149
I know what you're doing.

648
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,484
What?

649
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,520
I'm just missing work,

650
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,357
walking a lovely young lady
around Christmas Land all day.

651
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,795
Wait.
That's what you're doing.

652
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,697
Thanks, Ms. Cooper.

653
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,534
My pleasure, sweetheart.

654
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,804
It's gonna be beautiful,
just like you.

655
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,043
Bye!

656
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,817
Are you okay?

657
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,885
I should have had
photographers here.

658
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,454
What?

659
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,066
I should have had
photographers here for this.

660
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,224
The place wasn't ready.
I wasn't ready.

661
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,026
Things need to be
cleaned and fixed.

662
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,562
What are you talking about?
The kids had a great time.

663
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,531
Well, I'm sure they did, but
there's a lot more work to do.

664
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,767
You haven't seen anything yet.

665
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,610
They created
a Christmas monster.

666
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,829
You know, I could throw
some trash on the ground

667
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,664
and make it feel more
like home, if you like.

668
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,668
You would do that
for little old me?

669
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,477
George.

670
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,845
Tucker.

671
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,580
George, I want you
to meet the young...

672
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,716
You must be Jules Cooper.

673
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,585
I can't tell you what
a great thing you're doing.

674
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,587
Reopening Christmas Land?

675
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,056
Best news we've had
around here in a long time.

676
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,192
Well, actually,
that is why I'm here.

677
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,761
- I need some paint and...
- Sure, sure.

678
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,430
Anything you need,
and it's on the house.

679
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,166
Has anyone ever told you

680
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,201
that you have
your grandmother's eyes?

681
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,070
I've been hearing that
a lot lately.

682
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,741
It's fitting
that Glinda's granddaughter

683
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,210
would swoop down like
some kind of Christmas angel

684
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,611
and save us again.

685
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,513
- Again?
- Yeah.

686
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,116
That place out there
is a real shot in the arm.

687
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,287
Businesses in Fox Valley
were closing left and right.

688
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,822
Then Glinda opened
Christmas Land

689
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,291
and saved my store.

690
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,128
Heck, it saved
the whole community.

691
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,497
Let's go get you some paint.

692
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,574
Hey, so what did he mean,

693
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,776
that Christmas Land
saved the whole community?

694
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,611
Well, like most
people around here,

695
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,915
George has a tendency
to exaggerate a little bit.

696
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,151
But Christmas Land
made people feel special.

697
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,652
They're proud of it.

698
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,322
It's something for them
to feel good about.

699
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,824
You know, get behind the town.

700
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,927
It's kinda like a mascot or a...

701
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,762
Symbol.

702
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,130
Yeah.

703
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,269
Sometimes a symbol
is all you need.

704
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,781
How much do I owe you
this year, Frank?

705
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,183
Don't handle payments
out here anymore, Gary.

706
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,152
You gotta pay at the gift shop.

707
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,622
- New owners, new policies?
- Yup.

708
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,359
But this is one policy
I think you're gonna like.

709
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,328
Since you're buying a tree,

710
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:22,332
you get 25% off
any tree decorations or lights.

711
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:26,403
Really?
That is a darn good deal.

712
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,738
Thank you kindly, Frank.

713
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,607
Merry Christmas, Gary.

714
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,014
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

715
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,218
Well, I gotta hand it to you.
You were dead right.

716
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,688
Through the eyes
of the customer.

717
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,190
The key to a successful
business plan.

718
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,759
So this is what you city
slickers call a soft opening?

719
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,896
Yep! You open up the doors
a few days early,

720
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,433
iron out the kinks, and then you
have the grand reopening gala.

721
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,702
Gala. We're not
in the city anymore.

722
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,203
We don't do galas.

723
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,771
I do galas!

724
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,207
Don't worry.
Plenty of eggnog.

725
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,076
No champagne.

726
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,545
Place looks pretty great.

727
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,883
What's it like here
in the offseason?

728
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,919
Well, it's a bit quieter.

729
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,121
I worked here
as a kid in the summers.

730
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,522
Doing what?

731
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,891
Growing Christmas trees
with Uncle Frank.

732
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,760
It's a Christmas tree farm,
Jules.

733
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,464
So you planted
all of these trees.

734
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,933
No, not all of them,
but a lot of them.

735
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,969
See that patch over there?

736
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,571
Planted those.

737
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,606
Those are scotch pines.

738
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,411
- What about that one?
- You tell me.

739
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,980
- How am I supposed to know?
- You need to know this stuff.

740
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,448
I don't think that's necessary.

741
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,827
If you're gonna be
running the place.

742
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,551
Only for a couple of weeks.

743
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,754
Yeah.
I keep forgetting.

744
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,958
I think the Christmas tree farm
is doing just fine without me.

745
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,427
Well, don't forget, the trees
are the heart of the place.

746
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,164
- All this other stuff, it's...
- A brand, Tucker.

747
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,199
Speaking of which...

748
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,341
- I'm fixing this!
- Jules!

749
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,943
Look around!
This is a great business,

750
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,746
and it's finally
becoming a great brand.

751
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:21,117
This is the final touch,
and it's gonna be so sweet.

752
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,820
You're going to fix this?

753
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,255
What do you know
about carriages?

754
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,958
A lot, actually,
thanks to this place.

755
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:34,030
My grandmother taught me
how to care for the horses

756
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,765
and maintain the carriage.

757
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,467
Came in handy too.

758
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:41,304
One summer,
I worked in Central Park,

759
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,772
driving a carriage.

760
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,041
You're kidding.

761
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,609
What? You think
you're the only one

762
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,221
that worked in nature
during the summers?

763
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,347
Central Park is nature now?

764
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:55,118
What exactly happened to you
in the city, by the way?

765
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,120
Were you mugged or something?

766
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,689
There are lots of nice things
to do in the city.

767
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,524
Pass me those tools, please.

768
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,903
And I have nothing
against the cities.

769
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,561
They are great places to visit.

770
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,763
I just don't wanna live there.

771
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,670
Somebody broke your heart.

772
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,376
Let's just saying that
the breaking was mutual.

773
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,913
You know, she didn't
like the snow,

774
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,092
she didn't like the leaves,
she didn't like the rain...

775
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,517
So seasons then?

776
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,720
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

777
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,594
My parents moved to Florida
a couple years ago,

778
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,691
my brother lives in San Diego.

779
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,727
Everybody I know is
just so over the cold.

780
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,532
And I know this
sounds strange, but...

781
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,501
the cold keeps me warm.

782
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,903
Does that make sense?

783
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,204
What about you?

784
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,906
What about me?

785
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,608
Why don't you buy it?

786
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,577
Well, pro Bono work
doesn't exactly pay that well.

787
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,680
Which reminds me, I have
to get back to the office,

788
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,215
wrap up the year-end stuff.

789
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,917
Whoa!

790
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,254
You're not gonna stay
and watch me fix this thing?

791
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,289
Watch you?

792
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,260
You know if you asked nicely,
I could help you.

793
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,529
I can fix it fine without you.

794
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,898
I just thought
you'd enjoy the lesson.

795
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,400
You're going
to give me a lesson.

796
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,970
Class is about to begin,
Counselor.

797
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,242
Jules?

798
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,014
Mitchell Johnson?

799
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,694
I fell.

800
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,828
Are you okay?

801
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,163
I'm fine.

802
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,299
No, I mean what you're wearing.

803
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,467
Well, actually, this is my...

804
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,669
You look like a hobo.

805
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,671
...grandmother's.

806
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,408
Anyway it's great to see you.

807
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,314
So what are you doing here?

808
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,482
I have the same question.

809
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,251
Tucker Barnes.
Can't believe it.

810
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:12,055
'Though I'm not surprised
to find you in a barn.

811
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,591
Nice to see you, Mitchell.

812
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,862
Funny story, actually.

813
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:25,034
Mitchell told me that he went
to school with a Tucker Barnes.

814
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,070
I wasn't sure
it was the same guy.

815
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,238
It's a small world, huh?

816
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,940
It's too small.

817
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,246
This is your boyfriend, huh?

818
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,750
So, Mitchell,
what are you doing here?

819
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,685
I've got some business
in Chicago,

820
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,388
so I thought I'd come by and
check out this place of yours.

821
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,232
This is pretty amazing.

822
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,234
It's beautiful, right?

823
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,236
Think you're gonna
make quite the killing.

824
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,872
Same old Mitchell, I see.

825
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,784
You know, you're just in time
for the grand reopening.

826
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,086
Mitchell, it's gonna be amazing.

827
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,611
Really just want to see
the property.

828
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,382
Well, you could try
opening your eyes.

829
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,051
Maybe it's time
for a private tour?

830
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,154
- Yeah, sure.
- That's all right.

831
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,089
I have to get back
to the office anyway.

832
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,191
Where's that, the barn?

833
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,197
Nice seeing you again,
Mitchell. Jules.

834
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,436
Jules?

835
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,505
Yeah. Yeah...

836
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,007
let me finish
showing you around.

837
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,848
What's the deal
with you two anyway?

838
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,785
With me and Tucker?
There's no deal.

839
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,353
I just never really
liked the guy,

840
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,955
always talking
about his hometown.

841
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,626
Kinda crazy that this was the
place he was talking about?

842
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,728
Yeah, it is.

843
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,864
Sad, actually.

844
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,499
So listen, I...

845
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:11,140
Sorry. It's hard to talk
to you with that coat.

846
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,042
Jeez!

847
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,844
I'll take it off.

848
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,946
Scrooge.

849
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,015
So listen, I didn't want
to say anything earlier,

850
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,617
but I've got a meeting with a
guy who wants to buy this place.

851
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,454
Already?
But I haven't even shown it.

852
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,889
I told you that I would
find someone by Christmas.

853
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,825
Sound good?

854
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:29,959
Yeah.

855
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,894
Yeah, that sounds good.

856
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,396
This guy that I have lined up

857
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,465
has actually been
to Christmasville.

858
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,866
Christmas Land.

859
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,402
They are signs
all over the place.

860
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,738
Right. Same thing.

861
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,249
Anyway, he said
that if Christmas<i> Land...</i>

862
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,574
Thank you.

863
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:45,875
...was for sale,

864
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,577
then he would definitely
be interested.

865
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,812
Well, what do you think?

866
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,415
It's not really
our thing, is it?

867
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,486
I mean, we can leave the sticks
for guys like Tucker, right?

868
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,096
You know, the grand reopening
is tomorrow.

869
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,393
It might make a great
presentation for this guy.

870
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,395
Do you think he could come
on such short notice?

871
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,397
I know that he's really busy
right now.

872
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,368
That's why I had to line up this
meeting in Chicago for tomorrow.

873
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,836
Why don't you come with me?

874
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,205
This guy is gonna
keep it open, right?

875
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,907
- What do you mean?
- Christmas Land.

876
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,886
I just wanna make sure
whoever winds up with the place

877
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,744
is devoted to it.

878
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,380
That's why you should come
with me and ask him yourself.

879
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,282
I told you.
I have the reopening tomorrow.

880
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:30,119
But I could do a lunch meeting
the following day in Chicago.

881
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,355
He seemed pretty excited,

882
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:36,292
so yeah, pushing it a day
might be a good move.

883
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,028
Make him want it more.

884
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,398
All right, see what he thinks.

885
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,037
Think there's
any bears out here?

886
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,806
Maybe, Mitchell.

887
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,841
Maybe.

888
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,086
We worked very hard to
get Christmas Land open again.

889
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,389
So what inspired you
to open this place back up

890
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,824
after so much time?

891
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,893
Well, aside for
my grandmother, of course,

892
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,963
I would have to say
that people in this town

893
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,598
really inspired me.

894
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,819
Your grandmother
would be really proud of you.

895
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,744
Thank you.

896
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,648
And you know, your cookie
looks a little sad.

897
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,018
Maybe you should add
some sprinkles or frosting.

898
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,788
Or not,
because this is my design.

899
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,457
Well, I'm just trying to help.

900
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,828
So where's your boyfriend?

901
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,096
Chicken out?

902
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,465
He had to go to Chicago
on business.

903
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,766
That's a shame.

904
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,870
I was looking forward
to catching up.

905
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,540
What is your problem with him?

906
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,209
I don't have a problem
with him at all.

907
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,847
I think you found yourself
a very special guy.

908
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,816
But I don't think
he ever got over the fact

909
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,986
that I graduated first
in our class.

910
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,387
Wait a minute.

911
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,725
He told me he graduated
first in his class.

912
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,995
Is that want he told you?

913
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:22,832
No.

914
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,001
Are you kidding me?

915
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,836
I think you two
make a good match.

916
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,015
In the way you were talking
out there with the newspaper,

917
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,506
you really had me going.

918
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,308
What are you talking about?

919
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:36,712
"Oh, well, the people in
this town really inspired me."

920
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,024
If I didn't know
the whole story,

921
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,192
I would've almost believed you.

922
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,018
I wasn't...

923
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,387
Tucker, I meant that.

924
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,757
Okay, children, time's up.

925
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,192
Stop decorating your cookies.

926
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,763
Ms. Cooper, will you do
the honor of picking a winner?

927
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:58,601
Does that mean I have
to disqualify my own design?

928
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,670
I'm afraid so.

929
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,338
And what about me?

930
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,574
Mr. Barnes, unless you're
under the ago of 12...

931
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,411
Okay.

932
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,447
If I must,
then judge I shall be.

933
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:15,451
But I am warning you kids,
I am not easy to please.

934
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,987
You can say that again.

935
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,394
You know, if I were judging,
I would pick yours.

936
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:33,869
Okay.

937
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,238
I have made up my mind.

938
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,141
And the grand prize winner is...

939
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:44,647
Joey and his marshmallow
snowman cookie!

940
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,749
Congratulations.

941
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,220
No disrespect to Glinda,

942
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,557
but I think Christmas Land
is better than ever.

943
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,925
Thank you.

944
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,216
Hi!

945
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,218
You, you startled me.

946
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:26,288
I take it you're not coming
to the s'mores campfire roast.

947
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,592
I hate to sneak way like this,

948
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:33,429
but I promised Mitchell I'd sit
down with a buyer in Chicago.

949
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,433
Buyer. Right.
Well, have fun.

950
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,404
Tucker, it's just one day.
Will you cover for me, please?

951
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,544
Do you realize that in
all my years practicing law,

952
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,915
I have never been so dishonest
in my entire life?

953
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,718
I know for people
like Mitchell and you,

954
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,453
lying comes a little bit easier,

955
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,056
but I have
a harder time with it.

956
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,457
Is that really why you're upset?

957
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,925
I'm not upset.

958
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,928
- You seem upset.
- I'm not...

959
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,597
Why would I be upset?
You're gonna sell the place,

960
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,842
you're gonna move back
to New York,

961
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,100
everything's gonna be fine.

962
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,502
Everything is gonna be fine.

963
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:18,674
That's why I'm going to Chicago
to make sure of it.

964
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,942
Okay, then go.

965
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:22,845
Okay.

966
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,717
Okay.

967
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,256
Okay.

968
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,658
Yeah.

969
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,697
Good luck.

970
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,666
Don't worry.

971
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,343
Ooh!

972
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,777
Excuse me.

973
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,150
I don't miss that.

974
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,086
What? People actually
on their way somewhere?

975
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,488
Is that what that was?

976
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,223
You've been out
in the wilderness too long.

977
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,592
I gotta deprogram you.

978
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:46,562
Here you go.

979
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,831
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

980
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,033
You look amazing, by the way.

981
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,002
Lot better than
the other day, right?

982
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,336
Mitchell.

983
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,739
What? I just said
you look amazing.

984
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,208
Thanks.

985
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,777
You gotta admit,
this is a lot more civilized

986
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,046
than hanging out
in a barn, right?

987
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,048
You might not want
to trash the place

988
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,750
when you're trying to sell it.

989
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,687
There he is.

990
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,422
- Mitchell.
- Mason.

991
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,691
Mason Richards, Jules Cooper.

992
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,459
Ms. Cooper.

993
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,230
I don't know if Mitchell
mentioned it to you,

994
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,532
but I'm very familiar
with Christmas Land.

995
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,135
I took my own family there
years ago.

996
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,604
It truly is a marvelous place.

997
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,940
And your grandmother
was the owner?

998
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,075
Yes. Yes, she was.

999
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,944
What can I say?

1000
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,913
I love it, and I want it.

1001
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,483
Just like that?

1002
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,320
Don't you at least
want to see it first?

1003
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,487
Don't need to.

1004
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,956
But...

1005
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,491
Why don't you tell me
how this sounds?

1006
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:53,495
I'm willing to pay you
$1.7 million right now,

1007
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,800
provided you sign this contract.

1008
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:10,346
Now you and Mitchell
can start your lives out right.

1009
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,118
Did Mitchell tell you how
important Christmas Land is?

1010
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,353
He didn't have to.

1011
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:21,757
What I mean,
Mr. Richards, is...

1012
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,126
this is my grandmother's legacy,

1013
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,664
and I have to be sure whoever
buys it won't tarnish that

1014
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,634
and, well, destroy the place.

1015
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,937
Jules, as long as
I've known you,

1016
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,011
you've always wanted to
live on the upper west side,

1017
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,674
nearby the park.

1018
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,011
That used to always
just be talk.

1019
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:44,680
But now,
thanks to your grandmother,

1020
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,117
that could be a dream come true.

1021
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,552
What better legacy is there
than that?

1022
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,559
Mr. Richards...

1023
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,795
No one will take
better care of it than me.

1024
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,363
I can assure you of that.

1025
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,532
If it makes you feel better,

1026
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,534
I'll take over
the first of the year.

1027
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,558
Congratulations.

1028
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,860
You are now a millionaire.

1029
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,168
To Christmasville.

1030
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,004
Christmas<i> Land.</i>

1031
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,405
Thank you.

1032
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,114
And this guy, he really seems
to love this place.

1033
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,918
I'm just... I'm so excited
and honestly relieved.

1034
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,887
Everything is going to be okay.

1035
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,622
I'm really happy for you, Jules.

1036
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:09,465
I really care about
this place a lot.

1037
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:12,501
And it's gonna be here now,
and I'm gonna come and visit.

1038
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,203
You're gonna move
back to the city,

1039
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:16,972
and you're never
gonna come visit us.

1040
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,741
That's not true.

1041
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,143
I think they're over here.

1042
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,945
- Hi.
- Hi.

1043
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,414
Are you lady who reopened
Christmas Land?

1044
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,384
I am. Actually, it was
my Grandma Glinda's place.

1045
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,153
Well, we certainly
appreciate it.

1046
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,489
I grew up in town and...

1047
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,759
Christmas Land was always one of
my favorite childhood memories.

1048
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,761
I'm just so happy
my daughter Emma

1049
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,797
will get to share that too.

1050
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,233
We're looking for
the best Christmas tree,

1051
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,168
but there are so many
different kinds.

1052
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,771
Yes, there are.
It's really hard to choose.

1053
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,240
What's this one called?

1054
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,143
It's the Colorado Blue Spruce.

1055
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,755
They're not as popular
as they used to be

1056
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,346
'cause the needles
are really prickly.

1057
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,314
But smell it.

1058
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,119
It smells like Christmas!

1059
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,989
Daddy, I want this one.

1060
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,925
Okay, sweetie.
That one it is.

1061
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,261
- Hey, thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

1062
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,263
All right, let's go find
the man with the saw.

1063
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,836
See? I do care
about this place.

1064
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,004
Very much.

1065
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,374
Just makes it harder
to see you go.

1066
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,553
Howdy! Come on in.

1067
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,556
I have every ice cream flavor
known to mankind,

1068
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,790
and then some.

1069
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,559
I'm looking for Jules Cooper.

1070
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,893
I'm Jules.

1071
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:45,894
I'm Walter Hayes.

1072
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:49,164
I work with Mason Richards.

1073
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,167
Why don't we go outside?

1074
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,404
Right this way.

1075
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,513
Sorry. I haven't announced
the sale yet.

1076
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,482
I'm waiting till
after Christmas.

1077
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,150
Are you the new groundskeeper?

1078
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,519
No.
I don't see that happening.

1079
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,855
This is 206 acres, right?

1080
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,757
- Yes, exactly.
- Do you know this property

1081
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,393
is centered perfectly
between two interstates?

1082
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,162
It's perfect for commerce.

1083
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,599
Well, yes, we actually get
quite a bit of church traffic.

1084
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,935
There's gonna be a great deal
of competition for the lots.

1085
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,370
The lots?

1086
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,205
Real estate development.

1087
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,674
What's to develop?

1088
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,920
With a property like this,
the possibilities are endless.

1089
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,112
And we could put an industrial
park right over there.

1090
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,516
I predict if you come back
in five years,

1091
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,253
this place will be
completely unrecognizable.

1092
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,422
Are you okay? You look like
you're gonna be sick.

1093
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,893
I think I am.

1094
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,396
Excuse me. I have some business
to attend to in Chicago.

1095
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,809
Hey.

1096
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,511
I specifically told you

1097
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,848
I wanted a buyer who would not
destroy Christmas Land.

1098
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,316
What are you talking about?

1099
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,317
Some developer.

1100
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,785
Said he worked for Mason.

1101
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,688
Mitchell, they're gonna
sell the land.

1102
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,124
They're gonna chop it up
and sell it into lots.

1103
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:27,329
What does it matter?
We're gonna be in New York.

1104
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,431
You knew.

1105
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,732
Didn't you?

1106
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,336
Didn't you?

1107
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:38,607
This was the fastest
and easiest way.

1108
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,109
I really don't see
what the problem is.

1109
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,844
And that,
that right there, Mitchell,

1110
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:43,946
that is the problem!

1111
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,881
That is a huge problem!

1112
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,449
Okay, calm down.

1113
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,028
- You lied to me!
- I didn't lie to you.

1114
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,652
I just...

1115
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,154
I withheld the truth.

1116
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,727
I want out.

1117
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,729
What?

1118
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,531
I'm not selling.

1119
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,534
What are you talking about?
You sold.

1120
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,869
Well, there has to be a way out.

1121
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,906
Babe, it doesn't work that way.
You signed a contract.

1122
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,308
Look, if you have
any feelings for me at all,

1123
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,178
you owe it to me to fix this.

1124
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:19,581
And as your attorney,
I advise you to not do anything

1125
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,551
that will upset this opportunity
for you to become a millionaire!

1126
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,153
And what do you mean,
<i>if</i> I have feelings for you?

1127
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,923
'Course I have feelings for you.

1128
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,691
I love you.

1129
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,565
I don't.

1130
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,902
I don't love you, Mitchell.

1131
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,776
What do you want, Jules?

1132
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,245
I don't know anymore, but...

1133
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,114
I know I don't want you.

1134
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,952
All you care about is money.

1135
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,389
And I want out of the deal,

1136
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,867
and I'm gonna figure out
a way to get out of it.

1137
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,859
- Jules.
- I'm gonna fix this.

1138
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,461
You can't fix this.

1139
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,264
It's not broken.

1140
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,135
It's just done.

1141
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,508
Goodbye, Mitchell.
Have fun in Aruba.

1142
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,357
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop her.

1143
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,362
It's all right.

1144
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:44,933
- Have a seat.
- I'll stand.

1145
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,668
What seems to be the problem?

1146
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:51,139
Well, one of your employees
paid me a little visit.

1147
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:56,011
Yeah. Seems like you're planning
on developing the land.

1148
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,648
It's what I do.
I'm a real estate developer.

1149
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,350
See, I was under the impression

1150
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,319
that you loved Christmas Land.

1151
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,656
I do.

1152
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,358
And it's not like I'm gonna roll
a bulldozer through the place

1153
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,827
on January 1st.

1154
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,429
But that land has
a lot of potential,

1155
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,699
and eventually, I'm gonna have
to just let the market decide.

1156
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,301
I don't wanna sell it.

1157
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,837
Ms. Cooper, you don't
seem to understand.

1158
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,472
You've already sold it.

1159
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:29,978
Now, I don't know
what you've heard, but...

1160
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:34,483
yes, I plan on selling some lots
on the edge of the property.

1161
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,318
But I have no intention
of touching

1162
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,731
your grandmother's house or any
of the buildings in the village.

1163
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,223
Yeah, right.

1164
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,226
Well, not at first.

1165
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,129
The Christmas tree farm
is a business.

1166
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,864
It employs a lot of people,

1167
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:52,567
and the town really cares
about that place.

1168
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,137
Please.

1169
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,739
I am begging you.

1170
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,044
All right,
this is what I can do.

1171
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,314
You have $1.7 million
right there.

1172
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,518
You scrape up another
1.3 by Christmas,

1173
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,187
I rip up the contract.

1174
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,588
What are you saying?

1175
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,224
I'm saying I own the property.

1176
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,226
A property, let me remind you,

1177
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,029
I've had my eye on
for quite a while.

1178
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,999
But I'm willing to flip it.

1179
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,200
Flip it?

1180
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,235
Sell it back to you...

1181
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,739
if you can meet my price:
$3 million.

1182
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,241
And I'll give you
till midnight, Christmas Eve.

1183
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,784
Jules...

1184
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,388
I don't even know
what to say, but...

1185
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,923
what have you done?

1186
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,895
Did you read
the entire contract?

1187
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,531
I mean, there's gotta be
a way out.

1188
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,366
Remember what I told you

1189
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,041
about people coming around
over the years,

1190
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,536
but your grandmother never sold?

1191
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,071
Yeah.

1192
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,006
Mason Richards
was one of those guys.

1193
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,246
I really wish you had checked
with me before you signed this.

1194
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,617
No, no. There's got to be
something that I can do.

1195
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,019
Jules, stop. It's done.

1196
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,122
It's done.

1197
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,824
You know, I believed in you.

1198
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,603
I really thought you were
committed to Christmas Land.

1199
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,394
Tucker, I was!

1200
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:27,896
I am!

1201
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,297
Christmas Land is history.

1202
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,008
Enjoy your apartment
next to Central Park.

1203
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:58,586
Ladies and gentlemen, our sweet
Jules Cooper is here now.

1204
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,221
- Jules!
- Come on up!

1205
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:10,365
Also, I would like to say
that I am so happy and grateful

1206
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:13,201
for everything that our little
Christmas angel has done

1207
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,437
for Christmas Land.

1208
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,707
And I said it before,
and I think it bears repeating:

1209
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,410
Christmas Land
is better than ever.

1210
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,380
Yeah! Welcome back!

1211
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:29,851
I just wanna say how proud your
grandmother would be of you.

1212
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:33,021
Eloise, thank you. I...

1213
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,957
Actually...

1214
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,427
there is something
that I need to say.

1215
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,201
I...

1216
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,937
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

1217
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:52,073
When I first came here,

1218
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:56,111
my intention wasn't to move here
and run the place.

1219
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,713
My hope was that I would
make it attractive enough

1220
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:02,484
for someone to buy it so that
I could go back to my life

1221
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,918
in New York.

1222
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:08,323
But something happened.

1223
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,792
I fell in love.

1224
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,595
I fell in love with this place,

1225
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:17,766
and I fell in love
with all of you.

1226
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,604
But I sold it.

1227
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,773
- You sold it?
- I didn't mean to.

1228
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,776
I thought that I was selling it

1229
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,412
to someone who would keep
Christmas Land open,

1230
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:34,949
but it doesn't appear that
that is what he is going to do,

1231
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,485
and I'm just...

1232
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,821
I'm just so sorry.

1233
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:44,325
I am still trying to
get out of the deal, but I...

1234
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,962
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

1235
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,499
<i>Wave at the camera, darling.</i>

1236
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,601
<i>When you're not here,
I can watch this</i>

1237
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,203
<i>and pretend that you are.</i>

1238
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,473
<i>I love you, Grandma!</i>

1239
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:23,057
<i>One, two, three!</i>

1240
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,003
Come on, pick up.

1241
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,971
- Pick up.
- <i>Hello?</i>

1242
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,574
Ms. Nickerson?

1243
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,409
It's Jules.

1244
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:47,015
<i>So I guess you can say
I'm calling in my favor.</i>

1245
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,718
Jules, once again,
your pitch doesn't disappoint.

1246
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,154
This Christmas Land place
sounds wonderful.

1247
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,157
It really is special,
Ms. Nickerson.

1248
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,493
Well...

1249
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,429
you've always delivered for us.

1250
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,933
I think this time
I can deliver for you.

1251
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:09,704
I can gladly provide you
with $850,000 in advance

1252
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,073
for the exclusive right
to serve Nickerson's Coffee

1253
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,708
<i>at Christmas Land.</i>

1254
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:18,413
850,000.

1255
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,582
Look, I know you needed more,

1256
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,084
but you're catching us
at year end.

1257
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,120
I mean, my cash flow just can't
handle any more than that.

1258
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,556
<i>- I'm sure you can understand.</i>
- Yes, of course.

1259
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,359
No, I do.
I'm... I'm thrilled.

1260
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,529
Great. I'll get the contracts
out to you in the morning,

1261
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,531
and I can wire the money
in the afternoon

1262
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,233
before the ink is even dry.

1263
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,603
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this.

1264
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,605
It's my pleasure.

1265
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,140
And it's good business.

1266
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,275
Merry Christmas!

1267
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,177
Merry Christmas.

1268
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:58,620
It's not enough.
I need 450,000 more.

1269
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,604
Well, you can knock me
over with a feather.

1270
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,339
I thought you two lovebirds
would be picking out

1271
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,830
china patterns by now.

1272
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,999
Yeah, well we had an argument.

1273
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,934
I said some things I regret.

1274
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:15,670
Honey, romancing has
its ups and downs.

1275
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,606
All you gotta do
is say you're sorry

1276
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:21,376
and then let
the makeup smooching begin.

1277
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:29,150
Hey, Uncle Frank.

1278
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,654
Just saw Jules.
She's in the barn.

1279
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:36,624
Well, stop moping
and go apologize.

1280
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,427
Apologize?
She should apologize to me!

1281
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,195
She never should've
signed those papers.

1282
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:44,132
She didn't know that man
was such a scoundrel.

1283
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,134
You should ease up on her
a little bit.

1284
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:50,338
The poor thing really seems to
be trying to make things right.

1285
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,677
Yeah.

1286
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:56,811
Yeah.

1287
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,629
I can't believe it. You...

1288
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,264
You did it.

1289
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,966
Not quite.

1290
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,537
But I... I tried, Tucker,
I really tried,

1291
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,239
and I came close.

1292
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,842
What are you talking about?

1293
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,745
I raised 850,000.

1294
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,349
Jules, that's amazing.

1295
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,684
To be fair,
it all came from one company,

1296
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,886
but there's a catch.

1297
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,923
We are contractually obligated

1298
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,759
to sell Nickerson's Coffee
here now.

1299
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,929
At least until we close,
which barring a miracle

1300
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,498
will probably be
at midnight tomorrow.

1301
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,434
Well, while there's still time,

1302
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,403
isn't there anyone else
you can call?

1303
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:59,941
I'm gonna try a few people,
but it doesn't look good.

1304
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,877
And I am all out of ideas.

1305
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:08,015
The carriage looks...

1306
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,118
It looks amazing.

1307
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,926
I was gonna get two horses

1308
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,862
and drive up to your office door

1309
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,532
and tell you
that I raised all the money

1310
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:28,069
and Christmas Land
was gonna stay open.

1311
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,973
That would have been
one heck of a show.

1312
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,276
Yeah.

1313
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,148
I'm really sorry, Tucker.

1314
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,110
Well, looks like tonight

1315
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:13,314
will be the last Christmas
tree lighting ceremony.

1316
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,749
Déjà vu.

1317
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,818
I remember the last time

1318
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,288
it was the<i> last</i> Christmas
tree lighting ceremony.

1319
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,024
You know, which reminds me...

1320
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:33,401
I still have some
Christmas shopping to do.

1321
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,143
Uncle Frank!

1322
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,347
This is quite a stash.

1323
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,950
Everybody has a stash
for a rainy day.

1324
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,351
Everybody.

1325
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,695
What are you doing here?

1326
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:01,863
It's Christmas Eve.

1327
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,298
This seems to be
the place to be.

1328
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,733
And I have to hand it to you.

1329
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,835
You've really done
amazing things here.

1330
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,172
I remember it being quaint,
but nothing like this.

1331
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,473
Bravo.

1332
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,475
Well, if you like
what I've done,

1333
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,078
is there any chance
you might keep it as-is?

1334
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,349
Or lower the asking price?

1335
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,718
After all, it is Christmas.

1336
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,654
Jules.

1337
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,657
I admire your tenacity,
but a deal's a deal.

1338
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:34,428
I think I gave you a relatively
reasonable opportunity.

1339
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,732
I'm sorry,
but your time has run out.

1340
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,336
Yeah, I know.

1341
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,872
Well, I'm gonna get back
to packing my bags,

1342
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,875
since this isn't
my place anymore.

1343
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,911
Good night, Mason.

1344
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,753
- Evening, Tucker.
- Mason.

1345
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,088
Long time.

1346
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,090
Look, I'm glad you're here.

1347
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,721
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

1348
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,339
You're not coming downstairs?

1349
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,342
I don't think I'm wanted.

1350
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:24,111
Come on. It's the Christmas
tree lighting ceremony.

1351
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,648
And thanks to me,
it's the last one.

1352
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,558
That's okay.

1353
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,963
Why don't you come
downstairs with me?

1354
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,002
Guys.

1355
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,872
Tucker, what's going on?

1356
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,107
You'll see.

1357
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,775
And what are you
still doing here?

1358
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,811
Okay, we're all here.

1359
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,481
Jules, we wanted to thank you

1360
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,226
for everything that you've
done for this place.

1361
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,719
No, I don't think
you understand.

1362
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,555
I was unable to raise the money.

1363
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:09,657
Yes, but...

1364
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,158
we were.

1365
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,294
What?

1366
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,663
All of us.
It occurred to us

1367
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,065
that if we really want
to save Christmas Land,

1368
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,667
well, maybe we should
do our part.

1369
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,536
After all,
Christmas Land saved us once.

1370
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,071
You're darn tootin'.

1371
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:27,041
So we all decided
to chip in ourselves

1372
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,010
to save Christmas Land!

1373
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,511
How much did you raise?

1374
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,413
Well, that's why
I asked you down here.

1375
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,981
Do you still have
that commitment

1376
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,316
from Nickerson's Coffee?

1377
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,953
I do, but I'm still
$450,000 short.

1378
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:46,761
Well, there is
$450,000 in that box,

1379
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:50,297
if you would do us
the honor of accepting it.

1380
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,944
Well, I will accept...

1381
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:09,216
this $450,000...

1382
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:14,722
from you sweet,
generous people...

1383
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,227
...on one condition.

1384
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,096
It is a loan,

1385
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,633
and I will pay back every penny
as soon as possible

1386
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,802
from the profits
of Christmas Land

1387
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,704
with interest.

1388
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:32,273
Take it or leave it.

1389
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,451
Sold!

1390
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:57,298
I will write you a check
for the rest

1391
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,868
if you will kindly
tear up that contract.

1392
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,820
Merry Christmas.

1393
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,922
Merry Christmas.

1394
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,291
Yeah!

1395
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:31,165
Well, do you think
Glinda would approve?

1396
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,237
I know she would.

1397
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,241
I have one more surprise
for you.

1398
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,716
Almost there.

1399
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,421
Oh, my gosh, Tucker.

1400
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,391
Wanna go for a ride?

1401
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,260
Crowd awaits.

1402
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:04,565
It's cold out,

1403
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,668
and I thought you might
want something warmer.

1404
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,762
There she is!
Hey, Jules!

1405
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,545
Merry Christmas!

1406
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,184
Happy holidays!

1407
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,001
Merry Christmas!

1408
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,106
Thank you, Jules!
Thank you!

1409
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,311
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1410
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,047
Merry Christmas!

1411
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:33,621
I want to thank you all
so much for coming out.

1412
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,991
I wanna say,
despite what you have heard,

1413
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:39,994
I am not selling Christmas Land.

1414
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,229
Yeah! All right!

1415
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,098
And I'm not leaving.

1416
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,333
Yeah, Jules!

1417
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:52,706
Christmas Land is back
in business for good.

1418
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,842
That's wonderful!

1419
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,477
All right!
Love you, Jules!

1420
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,847
So the time has come

1421
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:03,918
for the Christmas tree
lighting ceremony!

1422
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:07,922
I want to dedicate tonight

1423
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:11,125
to the memory
of my beautiful grandmother,

1424
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,860
Glinda Stanwyck,

1425
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:16,130
the grande dame
of all things Christmas

1426
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,866
and the founder
of Christmas Land.

1427
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,339
So let's do this!

1428
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,942
Light it up!
All right!

1429
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,146
Everyone, on the count of three.

1430
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:35,916
One, two, three!

1431
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:43,057
It's so beautiful!
It's beautiful!

1432
01:22:56,604 --> 01:23:00,074
I don't wanna go back
to New York.

1433
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,242
It's not my home.

1434
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,850
This is.

1435
