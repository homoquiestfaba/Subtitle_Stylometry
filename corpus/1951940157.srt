the different passwords.

179
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,192
And the blue?

180
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,625
It's rivers.

181
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:08,991
So where
are the roads?

182
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,962
Maybe these
red dashes.

183
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,623
Backpacking trail.

184
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,291
What about
the black ones?

185
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:18,464
G-path. It says
closed to the public.

186
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:20,631
They stuck us in the
middle of nowhere, man.

187
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:24,143
Here. Fort Badish,
right here.

188
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,337
It's the Army.

189
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:27,505
It's a
historical marker.

190
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:28,980
So no Army.

191
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,485
No, but campers?
Tourists? Rangers?

192
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,782
Why don't we just keep
reading off the map?

193
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:36,015
[roar]

194
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,283
Oh God.

195
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,352
<i>Alright, time</i>
<i>to move.</i>

196
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,919
Here's the deal. We stick
together, tell the same story.

197
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,023
No one's gonna believe the counselor
was killed by a giant mutant bird.

198
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,590
They're gonna
think we did it.

199
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,136
You don't
know that.

200
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:53,001
Yeah? I'm the only one of
you losers who's 18 now.

201
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm not going
to real prison.

202
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:58,100
We stick together, tell
the same story. Got it?

203
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,646
<i>[rustling, roar]</i>

204
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:03,547
What about Porky?

205
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,847
We can't leave him here.
He can't move.

206
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,887
We leave him.

207
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:10,515
<i>I doubt he</i>
<i>would make it.</i>

208
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,023
You bastards!

209
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,150
I'll help him.

210
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,660
No, you stick
with us.

211
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,159
You wanna drag him along?
That's fine.

212
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,632
But he can't
slow us down.

213
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:24,726
Let's move.

214
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,503
Come on.

215
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,568
(female doctor)
You brought him in here?

216
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:58,035
(Garrett)
Is he gonna make it?

217
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:03,105
Do I know you?

218
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:06,202
I don't believe
it. Jacks!

219
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,578
Dr. Hale. Good to see you.

220
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,777
"Good to see
you"? Wow.

221
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,583
These markings,
what caused them?

222
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:18,681
Beats the hell
out of me.

223
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,885
How are you?

224
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,428
You're the expert
on fish and game.

225
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:25,397
You don't look like
you've aged a day.

226
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:30,232
It's the mask. I've aged
ten years. So have you.

227
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,168
What attacked him?

228
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,801
Okay then. Uh,

229
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,679
I've never seen
anything like it before.

230
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,407
It's definitely
not a bear attack.

231
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:44,712
See how deep those are there?
Looks like he's got two or three.

232
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:47,185
There's no mauling,
just cuts and tears,

233
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:50,746
no canine bites, no feline
bites, I don't know what it was.

234
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,291
Well, can you
find out?

235
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,022
I'm not an expert on
animal attack forensics.

236
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:59,429
You'll have to send somebody
down from the state tomorrow.

237
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:03,094
He didn't say anything to
me when I picked him up.

238
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,164
He's running a fever.
There could be an infection.

239
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,868
Look at him.
Something's not right.

240
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:23,145
Look at that.

241
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:25,191
What is that?

242
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:37,469
<i>(Derek)</i>
<i>Closed.</i>

243
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,296
I'll open it.

244
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,365
Derek.
You go.

245
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,240
Why you gotta point
the gun at me, man?

246
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:47,542
<i>Just remember</i>
<i>what I said.</i>

247
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:49,639
Alright, man, we're
cool, we're cool.

248
00:19:58,391 --> 00:19:59,915
Hello?

249
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,868
Cool!

250
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:19,241
Hey, send hard-ass's
pack through.

251
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:21,405
To hell with that,
tell us what you see.

252
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,808
I don't see anything,
it's too dark.

253
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:28,787
They must have closed it for
a reason. It says "Danger."

254
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,085
Hey, is it safe
or what, Derek?

255
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,149
I don't like this.

256
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:37,253
Yo! Guess what?
I'm still alive.

257
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,066
I'm going through.

258
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,159
Then you pass
hard-ass's pack to me.

259
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,328
Got it?

260
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:46,304
Yeah, I understand.

261
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:51,335
Don't even
think about it, trick.

262
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,614
[chuckles sarcastic]
What are you gonna do about it?

263
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:05,647
Hey, why don't you go smoke a
bowl and think about it some more?

264
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,454
Little Janie Pothead.

265
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,860
I'm coming through.
Help me, boo.

266
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:19,323
Give me the gun!

267
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,094
Hey, give
that back, man!

268
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,101
It's funny, who's the master now?

269
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:25,364
Who's the master and
who's the servant?

270
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:26,871
And I'm telling
you right now...

271
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,467
No! I'm telling <i>you</i>
you can kiss my ass!

272
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,738
You better shoot me
while you got the chance

273
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:34,643
or you're gonna
regret it later.

274
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:36,978
Oh yeah? Who
put you in charge?

275
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,039
I did.

276
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:39,107
I'm in
charge now!

277
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:40,174
You're dead.

278
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:42,118
Do not make
me shoot you!

279
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:44,554
Hey, Johnson, man,
why don't you step up?

280
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,057
Shut up, Gordon.

281
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,616
Why don't you just
put the gun down?

282
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,321
Shut up
all of you!

283
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:52,126
<i>Can't you see this guy
is gonna get us killed?</i>

284
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,198
Hey, guys?

285
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:59,004
What'd you
do, Derek?

286
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,369
Look what
you made me do?!

287
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,431
You shot the guy.

288
00:23:23,897 --> 00:23:25,762
Yo, this is so
messed up, yo!

289
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,367
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>the dude's name.</i>

290
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,563
Hank, I think.

291
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:37,040
These crates are
filled with dynamite!

292
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,045
Oh, great. You idiots are
shooting off flares in here.

293
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:49,585
<i>[Loba]</i>
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

294
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:51,146
<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>We need to get out.</i>

295
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:53,590
Those things followed
us here. They're outside.

296
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,185
We're gonna have
to find another way.

297
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:21,442
Oh. Something
died down there.

298
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:22,783
[click]

299
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,756
No, it's not that.

300
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,315
<i>(Loba)</i>
<i>something smells bad.</i>

301
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:30,989
It's gas! Johnson,
close the door!

302
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:34,124
<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>Dammit, close the door!</i>

303
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:37,767
Dammit, close it!

304
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,508
What is the gas gonna do?
Is it gonna kill us?

305
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:47,341
Not if anyone shoots
any more guns, no.

306
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:51,180
But in time it will displace the
oxygen in this room and we'll suffocate.

307
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,513
We need to get
out of here.

308
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:54,348
One of you
check out there.

309
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,150
Do it!

310
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,095
Cowards.

311
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:50,135
So what do you see?

312
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,111
<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>strange, really strange.</i>

313
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:56,808
Okay, and?

314
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:00,450
Garrett?

315
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,421
Patience was never
your strong suit.

316
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,653
I save lives.
Patience is not an option.

317
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,694
It might save
relationships, though.

318
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,422
One in particular
I'm thinking of.

319
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:12,761
Yeah, two years wasn't
enough time for you?

320
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,232
Seemed like
an eternity to me.

321
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:19,101
Excuse me, Dr. Hale.
The bloodwork's back.

322
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,140
You're not gonna
believe this.

323
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,869
It's an H5N1 variant.

324
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,570
Avian flu?

325
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,510
<i>How?</i>

326
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,643
It's a mutant virus. It's beyond
anything we've seen or even read about.

327
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,687
Okay, the good news is
it's still bloodborne.

328
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:37,655
So it can only be
transmitted through wounds?

329
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,693
Blood, prolonged contact with
body fluids, sexual intercourse.

330
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,287
I want a full course of
antivirals for this guy, stat.

331
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:48,391
Rimantidine,
Tamiflu, everything we've got.

332
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:52,895
And Dr. Thomas?
Let's put him in quarantine.

333
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,132
Shut down C-ward.

334
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,141
That's gonna scare
a lot of people.

335
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,871
Just do it.
Please.

336
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,276
Okay.

337
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:06,308
Aside from the usual sex
with an infected chicken,

338
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:07,978
how do you get
this bird flu?

339
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:11,956
You don't unless you're a
poultry farmer in Vietnam or Laos.

340
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:16,155
We haven't had a single confirmed case
of avian influenza in this country.

341
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:19,790
And there's never been a case of
another type of animal infected with it.

342
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:23,563
So you have to come into contact with
an infected bird? Like its scratch?

343
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,103
What are you
getting at, Garrett?

344
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,433
Take a look
at this.

345
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:32,074
See the pattern?

346
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:33,237
Striations.

347
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:34,337
Yeah.

348
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:37,941
Scratches.
They're Scutella.

349
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,644
Scutella?

350
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:45,988
Scales. The only things with
scales are reptiles and birds.

351
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,686
This isn't
alligator country.

352
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,992
But birds don't attack people.
Do they?

353
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:56,900
Rarely. Maybe a small child,
or when defending a nest.

354
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:00,869
I'm just concerned
that they won't have to.

355
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,703
What do you mean?

356
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:06,006
This virus has mutated, which
means it could mutate again,

357
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,412
and become airborne. So forget
the coming into contact part,

358
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:12,144
we have a pandemic
on our hands.

359
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,016
It's the only way.

<i>We can't do this.</i>

361
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:23,985
It does kinda
make sense.

362
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,964
The gas, eventually,
it's gonna kill us.

Besides, he's dead already.
Look at him.

371
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,417
Eva, for real though.
What if it's contagious?

372
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,930
You may as well die saving
everyone else, right?

Yeah, by letting those

375
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,269
Yes way.

376
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,806
Please don't!

377
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:10,775
We can't do this. What
about feeding them his body?

378
00:29:10,843 --> 00:29:12,970
I'm not touching
his body.

379
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:14,809
Great.

380
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:18,510
Those things are just supposed to
ignore us as we drag him out there?

381
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:22,179
I don't think so. We
need a moving target.

382
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,189
This is wrong!

383
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:27,818
You want a democracy? Fine.
Let's put it to a vote.

00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:29,452
Ohhh!

385
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,258
That sounds fair.

I just know
it's wrong.

Well, that's it. That's everything
we've got to throw at him.

it's too much.

I don't know what
else we can do for him.

What about us? We gotta wake him up
and find out what he's talking about.

409
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:58,099
It's not that simple. You can't
wake him up while he's hallucinating.

Honestly Garrett, it wasn't the
drinking, it was all that anger.

Okay, doctor.

Could be one of a thousand things.
Transmutation.

Genetic manipulation.

But who? Why?

we were dealing with?

Well, according to you
it's infected birds.

But the ward
is quarantined.

not sealing them in.

You're putting more
people at risk of exposure.

521
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:49,778
I'm protecting the
public, doctor.

522
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,750
This country hasn't seen
a single case of H5N1,
let alone a mutant bird.

523
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:56,253
Letting people run in
and out of that hospital

524
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,790
is potentially giving this
entire city a death sentence.

525
00:39:58,857 --> 00:39:59,846
Are you a doctor?

526
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:01,586
No.

527
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,959
Why don't you let the medical
people make the medical decisions?

528
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,261
This is my hospital, my patient,
and I decide who comes and goes.

529
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:11,599
Doctor, please,
let's be professional.

530
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,697
<i>I'm dispatching a team to the
forest where you found patient zero.</i>

531
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:20,438
<i>Based on their success and an investigation
to determine if C-ward has been compromised</i>

532
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:23,037
I'll decide if it's safe to
let the other patients go.

533
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,845
And those kids I spoke to?
They're in danger, what about them?

534
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,180
We'll find them.

535
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:29,311
No you won't.

536
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,721
[sigh]
I should go. I'll get them.

537
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:35,658
You may be infected.
You shouldn't leave.

538
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,320
The virus
isn't airborne.

539
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,296
We haven't been exposed
to any infected fluids.

540
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:41,424
Good luck.

541
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,900
Excuse me,
I need to see my patients.

542
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:47,632
<i>Sorry, doctor.
Nobody in, nobody out.</i>

543
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,571
He's my patient.
He needs me.

544
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,871
Nobody in,
nobody out.

545
00:40:51,944 --> 00:40:53,571
Come with me.

546
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,272
You don't have
much time.

547
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:57,645
I'm under orders to use whatever
I deem necessary to ensure

548
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,411
that this
incident stays local.

549
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,248
What the hell
does that mean?

550
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,256
It means that if we can't neutralize
these infected birds quickly,

551
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,588
there may not be much forest
left for you to search.

552
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:21,431
[painful gasping]

553
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:28,773
<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>Yo. Which way is the sun going?</i>

554
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:36,412
Who knows?
It's too bright to look at. East.

555
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:39,423
West, idiot. Which direction
it's been going all day.

556
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,618
I don't know,
that way?

557
00:41:41,693 --> 00:41:44,628
Alright, so
that's west.

558
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:47,187
And that's
gotta be east.

559
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:49,700
We've been going in
the wrong direction.

560
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:52,635
That's north, back that way.
It's where we want to go.

561
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:55,537
Yeah, if the
city's north.

562
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,440
True, true.

563
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,070
Are either one of you
sure the city is north?

564
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:05,883
Oh! You're
both idiots!

565
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,145
Watch your
mouth, son!

566
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,279
Yo son, this is a
messed-up situation.

567
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:13,347
It's got all
out of control.

568
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:14,824
Where are
you going?

569
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:17,987
I'm going over there to
put some leaves over me

570
00:42:18,063 --> 00:42:20,554
and hide in the grass.
I suggest you do the same.

571
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,831
He may have
the right idea.

572
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,401
That kid's a
survivor for sure.

573
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:31,568
He did crazy stuff
up in Juvie.

574
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:33,702
His pop used to beat
the crap out of him.

575
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:37,237
He did some bad things,
I'm talking terrible things to him.

576
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:39,841
Then tough luck
for Derek.

577
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:43,581
Maybe he's not the only one
who's had bad things done.

578
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:47,853
Hey, just because
we ain't got nothin',

579
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,393
don't mean we
ain't nothin'.

580

so respect is due.

581
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,861
That was terrible.

582

Oh, please.

583
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:02,665
Yo, we should probably
just keep moving.

584
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,816
I know, I know, but you have got
to keep your cool, Dr. Thomas.

585
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,652
You do your job.
You're in charge now.

586
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:21,284

It's gone airborne.

589

It's too much.

Oh God.
This is it.

593
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,216

599
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:01,429
I just can't.

since I met you.

Mm. I'll make it

Some punk pulled a knife
on me over 20 bucks.

Okay, well look,

Now we're gonna find
out if it's contagious.

842

She's right. Now we're gonna
find out, no matter what.

843
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,826
32 rounds of white phosphorus, sir.
That's a hell of a lot.

844

What are we
going after?

845
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:18,465
Birds.
How wide will our radius be?

846
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:20,840
The payload's good for three
square miles of shake' n' bake.

847
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:23,903
Do we have confirmation that
the area is clear of civilians?

848
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:25,573
Let me worry
about that, officer.

849
01:05:25,649 --> 01:05:26,980
How long till liftoff?

850
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,678
Bird's up in
15 minutes, sir.

851
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:43,258
I hated this place
since I saw it.

852
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:46,428
Yeah. It reminds
me of home.

853
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:59,210
Let's do some
big game hunting.

854
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:01,410
With white
phosphorus, sir?

855
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:04,420
We can't afford to
miss this target, son.

856
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:19,031
Was it his
getting scratched?

857
01:06:19,103 --> 01:06:24,063
I'm not sure.
Yeah. Seems so.

858
01:06:28,178 --> 01:06:29,702
Do you think
he's gonna die?

859
01:06:31,815 --> 01:06:33,840
It's not
looking good.

860
01:06:35,185 --> 01:06:37,380
Then we're good
as dead too.

861
01:06:37,454 --> 01:06:38,580
Don't say that.

862
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:40,055
It's true.

But we're tough.

We're survivors.

868

We're all here because we did
what we had to do to survive.

What did you have to do to survive?

870

Arson.
I burnt my house down.

How did that help
you survive?

872
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:19,854
My father was inside.

873
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:28,528
If I hadn't done it, he
would've killed me first.

874

are we looking for?

878

for directions.

887

We're gonna
find them, Garrett.

01:19:53,717 --> 01:19:55,116
[shouts]

1035
01:19:55,185 --> 01:19:58,018
Mayday!
Mayday!

1036
01:20:02,525 --> 01:20:05,551
Get inside!
Come on!

1037
01:20:14,904 --> 01:20:17,168
So much
for our rescue.

1038
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,571
Yeah, no doubt.

1039
01:20:18,641 --> 01:20:20,609
It stinks even
worse than before.

1040
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:23,874
It's gas. It's the reason why
they closed this place down.

1041
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:26,313
What?

1042
01:20:26,382 --> 01:20:30,910
We may have made it worse
by cracking the seal.

1043
01:20:30,987 --> 01:20:32,420
That's not good.

1044
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:34,855
If we stay here, we
are gonna pass out.

1045
01:20:34,924 --> 01:20:38,860
If we go out there, Dr. Hottie,
those things are gonna find us.

1046
01:20:38,928 --> 01:20:40,953
Maybe they died
in the explosion.

1047
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,726
Unlikely. They're way
too smart for that.

1048
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,233
We're humans,
we're smarter.

1049
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:47,929
<i>[bird screech]</i>

1050
01:20:48,004 --> 01:20:50,802
You were saying,
M r. Ranger?

1051
01:20:50,874 --> 01:20:53,809
Oh my God.

1052
01:20:53,877 --> 01:20:56,539
It's like they know we're here.

1053
01:20:56,613 --> 01:21:03,485
Two, three... five.
God, Garrett, look.

1054
01:21:03,553 --> 01:21:05,646
There's another
way out.

1055
01:21:05,722 --> 01:21:07,121
Through that
hall and up.

1056
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:11,058
Up in the what?
Woods? They'll track us, man.

1057
01:21:11,127 --> 01:21:14,221
He's right. We need to
find a way to stop them now.

1058
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:18,563
We've got about an hour
before we lose consciousness.

1059
01:21:20,203 --> 01:21:22,068
Take this dynamite
outside and blow 'em up.

1060
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:25,130
We ain't got enough dynamite
to blow up the whole forest.

1061
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:29,508
I say we fight. Either at the
cabin or we can do it here.

1062
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:31,979
That only worked
because of Derek.

1063
01:21:32,048 --> 01:21:34,949
They divide us and they kill us.
We need to use that.

1064
01:21:35,018 --> 01:21:36,042
What do you mean?

1065
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:39,452
We have to lure
them in here,

1066
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:42,582
and then we'll blow the fort,
the gas, the dynamite, all of it!

1067
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:46,186
We'll need bait.
Somebody to draw them in.

1068
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:48,822
Everyone runs and
one of us blows the dynamite.

1069
01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:51,093
And boom! Damn,
that shit's ghetto.

1070
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:53,692
It's suicide,
is what it is.

1071
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:56,671
The bait makes
a run for it,

1072
01:21:56,739 --> 01:21:58,934
<i>uses a fuse to</i>
<i>blow the dynamite,</i>

1073
01:21:59,008 --> 01:22:00,339
I might survive.

1074
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:03,038
<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>What do you mean "you?"</i>

1075
01:22:03,112 --> 01:22:04,477
I'm gonna do it.

1076
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:07,778
Eva, I don't like
the sound of that.

1077
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:10,786
No way! Garrett,
back me up on this.

1078
01:22:10,854 --> 01:22:13,015
There's gotta be
another option.

1079
01:22:13,089 --> 01:22:15,319
It's down to us.
We're not all gonna survive.

1080
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:17,382
It's better one of us
dies than all of us.

1081
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,087
No, I can't let
you do that.

1082
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:21,062
It's a good plan.

1083
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:23,030
With one
minor change.

1084
01:22:23,099 --> 01:22:24,498
What are you
talking about?

1085
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:27,365
It's crap.
Like I said before,

1086
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:29,029
<i>It's hard luck</i>
<i>or no luck at all.</i>

1087
01:22:29,105 --> 01:22:30,333
What you gettin'
at, homie?

1088
01:22:30,406 --> 01:22:33,239
It's me.
I'm the bait.

1089
01:22:33,309 --> 01:22:35,243
You're not
that sick.

1090
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:37,006
<i>It's only a
matter of time.</i>

1091
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,069
It's not clear.

1092
01:22:38,147 --> 01:22:39,546
Don't give me
that crap!

1093
01:22:39,616 --> 01:22:41,914
With immediate intervention,
you might survive.

1094
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:44,249
If he doesn't do this,
then none of us will survive.

1095
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,153
This isn't right.
Let's vote, like we did before.

1096
01:22:47,223 --> 01:22:49,623
No. No vote.

1097
01:22:55,164 --> 01:22:59,624
It's me.
I'm the volunteer.

1098
01:22:59,702 --> 01:23:01,602

1099
01:23:08,077 --> 01:23:09,476

This isn't gonna hold!

1100
01:23:09,545 --> 01:23:11,979

You know the way, Yogi Bear.

1101
01:23:12,048 --> 01:23:14,744
Come on!

1102
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:15,806
Go!

1103
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:17,750
Thanks, bro.

1104
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:21,854
Gordon, what are
you waiting for? Go!!

1105
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,392
No way!
You first!

1106
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:26,155
This is my plan!
I'll go last!

1107
01:23:41,878 --> 01:23:43,277
Eva, listen to me!

1108
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:45,405
Don't make me come
over there, Hip-hop!

1109
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:48,477
Tell me you
have a plan.

1110
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:51,076
I do! I'll make it.
Go!

1111
01:23:51,154 --> 01:23:52,712
Go!

It's over, Eva.
They're gone.
