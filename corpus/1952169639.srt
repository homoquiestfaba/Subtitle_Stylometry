1
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,325
For years,
the Wildman of the Navidad.

2
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,493
was the talk and mystery of Texas.

3
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,130
One after the other,
rumors surfaced of a creature.

4
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,163
...prowling the dense thicket along the.

5
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,437
...lower regions
of the Navidad River.

6
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,810
...just west of the tiny
rural community of Sublime.

7
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,407
Sometimes the unknown was called.

8
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,112
"The Wild Woman," as again and again...

9
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,883
...two and even three of the
elusive beings ran together...

10
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,360
...leaving a trail of curiosities
and terror in their wake.

11
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,886
Over time, history books
outlined numerous theories.

12
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,365
...on their possible origin...

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
...but for the residents of Sublime...

14
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,129
...none of them conclusively explained.

15
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,198
...how the sightings continued
far beyond record.

16
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,474
Official reports remained
sketchy until the recent discovery.

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:58,246
...of a detailed journal
kept by townsman Dale S. Rogers.

18
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,617
Within the pages of his
veracious account.

19
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,680
were the gritty details
and graphic illustrations.

20
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,922
...of a bizarre series of encounters
with the savage.

21
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,726
What follows is his story...

22
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,790
wretched, but entirely true.

23
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,047
Get on over here, boy.

24
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,821
You're gonna watch this.

25
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,803
That blood make you
a little queasy, boy?

26
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,805
I shoulda made you gut
and skin your first one.

27
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,813
...like my old man did me.

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,475
It's all part of the ritual.

29
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,715
You sure didn't waste
any time, did you, Charlie?

30
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,685
- Nope.
- Yeah.

31
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,018
Boy, that's sure gonna be
some good eating.

32
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,045
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,489
That's a nice one.

34
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,787
He got his first deer.

35
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,952
Good backstrap.

36
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,723
First blood, huh, boy?

37
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,491
She's dead and I'm thirsty.

38
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,965
You kill the deer,
we drink the beer.

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,797
You said
a mouthful there.

40
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,978
Tanya, bring me
a couple of Stars.

41
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,990
Well, we got us
a good eating one.

42
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,719
Peckerhead son of a bitch.

43
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,887
Damn, what's it been -
three hours of the season?

44
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,454
Actually, the boy here
did the shooting.

45
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,090
Made a shit shot.

46
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,363
I finished her off
with my knife.

47
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,370
He didn't have the balls for it.

48
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,729
Figures.

49
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,673
So... Little scared.

50
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,676
...of that deer were you?

51
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,379
Karl Crabtree, look what
the cat dragged in.

52
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,490
Ain't bad shit,
is it, boss?

53
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,832
No, sure enough ain't.

54
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,200
Say, how come you still got.

55
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,104
...that froot loop Dale
working for you?

56
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,166
He's a strange
son of a bitch.

57
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,770
I mean, never says
nothing to nobody.

58
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,976
Well, how'd you be if your
old man was shot down cold.

59
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,381
...in the street like that?

60
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,045
He ain't never been right since.

61
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,055
All he does is tinker
around with that bullshit crap.

62
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,182
...in his yard all day -

63
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,455
...not to mention that
retard wife of his.

64
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,928
...stuck in her roller chair.

65
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,897
Jesus Christ.

66
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,197
Hey, you know, before that bitch
had that car wreck.

67
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,432
...and got stroked out,
that was some Grade-A pussy.

68
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,936
Really?

69
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,840
You're a cat's ass.

70
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,408
But Jack, you oughta think
about really getting yourself.

71
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,681
...a good welder, you know?

72
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,951
God damn, I'd have to go
all the way to Campbelton...

73
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,890
45 miles, to find one.

74
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,792
There ain't nobody in this
town's dependable.

75
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,819
What the fuck am I, Jack?

76
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,331
Am I chopped liver?

77
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,765
I mean, plus...

78
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,393
I come with my perks.

79
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,199
Yeah, you do.

80
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,079
Rogers!

81
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,383
You're fired!

82
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,387
I'm giving Karl your job!

83
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,494
What the fuck
did you do that for?

84
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,497
Now he's gonna think
I'm the one that got him fired.

85
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,623
Well, you did, Karl.

86
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,293
Quit being such
a goddamn candy ass!

87
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,339
God, I swear, Earl, if you don't
start burning something cleaner...

88
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,072
...every damn law dog
around here is gonna find.

89
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,443
...that there still of yours.

90
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,540
Ah, that machine smokes worse
than a cancer patient.

91
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,542
It's that 199 proof diesel
you're serving up, Earl.

92
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,613
Those people don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground, man.

93
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,217
They're gonna think I'm burning
trash out there.

94
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,456
Shit, burning New York City
is more like it.

95
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,862
A goddamn blind man
could see that smokestack.

96
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,866
...from Ching Chong China.

97
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,794
Them law dogs know better.

98
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,269
...than to come around
these parts, right, Earl?

99
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,465
You're correct.

100
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,475
They come out here,
they'll go away limping.

101
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,844
# I can feel the presence
in the room here beside me #

102
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:53,257
# I turn but there's
nobody there #

103
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:58,059
# I turn but
there's nobody there #

104
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,588
And that was
the Manchaca Allstars.

105
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,998
with "Gardenia Blossoms".

106
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,730
You're listening to 99AM-CC...

107
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,397
...non-stop Country and Western.

108
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,067
...favorites for the lower
Navidad regions.

109
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,874
Today marks the official start
of deer season in Lavaca County.

110
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,573
Residents are gearing up for the.

111
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,208
...estimated 3- To 400 hunters.

112
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,218
...making their way through the
area in the next few weeks.

113
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,241
I'll tell you what...

114
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,279
...that number would be a lot
higher if old Samuel Rogers' boy.

115
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,850
Dale opened up that five generations
of Rogers land he's a-sittin' on.

116
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,487
That's a 600-acre gold
mine he's got out there.

117
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,483
# Well, if you're
feeling down and out #

118
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,952
# Tell him
what you want #

119
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,455
# If you're feeling
down and out #

120
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,890
# Tell him what you want #

121
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,416
# If you're feeling
down and out #

122
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,895
# Tell him what you want #

123
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,560
# Call him up
and tell him what you want #

124
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,230
# Jesus is on the main line #

125
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,239
# Tell him what you want #

126
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,679
# Tell him what you want #

127
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,628
Beau!

128
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,727
Come here, boy!

129
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,897
Come here, boy.

130
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,510
Oh, no.

131
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,924
Looks like I won't be going back.

132
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,935
...to the shop anytime soon.

133
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,807
Jack got himself
another welder.

134
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,713
I shoulda known they play
favorites around here.

135
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,380
But don't you worry, Jean.

136
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,392
Everything's gonna be all right.

137
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,987
I promise you.

138
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,234
I still got those two
gunsmithing jobs.

139
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,969
And I expect a lot more,
being the start of season and all.

140
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,110
Besides, we could always lease out.

141
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,108
...a bit of the land if we had to.

142
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,219
Ralph, Ralph!

143
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,881
Ralph!

144
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,083
Shut the door, quick!

145
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,218
I never seen anything
so awful in my life.

146
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,387
What are you talking about?

147
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,022
Something took after me
down in the swamp.

148
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,088
What was it?

149
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,123
I don't know whether
it was a man, a beast.

150
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,999
...or old satan himself.

151
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:31,934
Have you been drinking?

152
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,597
Not a drop, so help me.

153
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,748
Been a lot of shit
talking around here lately...

154
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,910
...hasn't there?

155
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,112
Mm-hmm.

156
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,711
Speaking of shit...

157
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,154
...motherfucker is uglier
than homemade sin.

158
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,657
...and his tits
smell like wolf pussy.

159
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,123
Think he's ever seen
a pocket knife before?

160
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,130
Give it to him.

161
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,032
It's all yours, dude.

162
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,044
No, it's all yours, dude!

163
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,370
You pig fucker!

164
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,383
Couple of smart boys, huh?

165
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,695
That son of a bitch...

166
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,759
...always backed into the corner...

167
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,771
...scribbling on some silly note pad.

168
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,863
You'd think he was writing.

169
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,272
...love notes to that Mexican
living with him.

170
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,332
Well, I don't know about that...

171
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,901
...but he opened up that
river bottom this year.

172
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,879
You lying son of a bitch.

173
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,007
Seen the sign
on my way over here.

174
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,607
Well, I'll be damned.

175
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,449
That bottom hasn't been hunted
in 30-some years.

176
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,422
I bet there are some
monster bucks down there.

177
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,550
Yeah, and you know every
limp dick between here.

178
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,890
...and Atascosa County's gonna
want a piece of that.

179
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,488
Yeah, probably pay
top dollar too.

180
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,106
Can I get you anything, hon?

181
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,844
I guess let me have
another one of those, Tanya.

182
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,078
All right.

183
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,086
- Hey, Tanya.
- Yes?

184
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,146
If you don't mind, would you,
uh, hang these up for me?

185
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,554
Sure.

186
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,891
Uh, this round's on me, Tanya.
Get me another Star.

187
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,020
What you drawing on there, Dale?

188
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,394
Karl.

189
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,595
Look, I just dropped by to
say that I'm sorry about.

190
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,500
...taking your job and all.

191
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,667
You know, Jack can be
kind of a peckerwood.

192
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,141
You know what I mean?

193
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,145
Yeah, well, you and him
are pretty tight.

194
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:40,810
Yeah, but look, I came by
to offer you a proposition.

195
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,683
I know how you like that shine.

196
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,518
I been brewing and I was.

197
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,990
...thinking maybe we could
do a little trade.

198
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,289
I go hunting on your land and...

199
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:55,891
...uh, well, bring by maybe 10, 11,
12 jugs maybe for you?

200
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,561
Compensate and all.

201
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,605
Might be able to work
something out.

202
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,670
All right then.

203
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,679
Why don't you come by
this evening?

204
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,482
What time?

205
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,078
6:00 or so.

206
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,089
That'd be great.

207
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,650
You got that?

208
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,291
Well, Dale, I brang
a couple extra.

209
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,625
...for a little bit of
good measure, you know?

210
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,292
Uh, so, I got my, uh...

211
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,030
...gun in the car... Sir.

212
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,267
Uh, yeah, so it's down there.

213
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,207
...at the bottoms, right?

214
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,406
Yeah, just, um just
drive your truck down the road.

215
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,610
...there and, uh, take a,
take a right on, on the second gate.

216
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,708
O.K.

217
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,981
Don't, don't go on the first
one, now, I got some.

218
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,681
...cows down on the river bottom.

219
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,714
...and, um... Second gate.

220
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,225
All right.

221
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:40,893
You, you don't mind if i If
I take one for the hunt, do ya?

222
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,465
I'll bring you another
one later... Right?

223
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,064
Yeah. Appreciate it, Karl.

224
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,074
Thank you, Dale.

225
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,735
Ma'am, Sir.

226
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,721
Jesus.

227
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,599
Dale, how much you charging.

228
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,006
...for them hunts
out there now anyway?

229
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,042
Evidently too much.

230
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,742
Tanya, have you seen Karl?

231
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,911
Been here since
seven this morning.

232
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,130
Hey, Dale.

233
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,139
Karl.

234
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,877
Hey, Karl...

235
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,541
Did you shoot anything
out there yesterday?

236
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,816
Yeah, I shot... I shot.

237
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,382
...me a big old doe...
Something.

238
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,393
Karl, what did you
shoot out there?

239
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,161
Do you have any
bears out there?

240
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,604
No, there ain't
no bears, Karl.

241
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,499
I have a couple of flyers
left over, Dale.

242
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,168
I didn't have anywhere else
to hang 'em.

243
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,301
Thank you, Tanya.

244
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,834
Well, well, well...

245
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,109
I'll be damned.

246
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,547
Look what I got.

247
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,211
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

248
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,618
Melvin.

249
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,016
Your daddy always
talked about.

250
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,251
...leasing that property
again someday.

251
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,283
Well, I already been
out there.

252
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,591
Shot me a Mossback...

253
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,621
...big old fucker.

254
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,030
I already got it.

255
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,726
Shut up, Karl.

256
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,826
You probably
put one up its ass.

257
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,530
Miss Annie Oakley over here.

258
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,297
Blow it out your ass.

259
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,137
Chicken shit son of a bitch.

260
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,270
Besides, a man takes
another man's job.

261
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,280
...ain't worth a puddle of piss.

262
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,042
Anyway I got a little
incentive here.

263
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,678
Take this.

264
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,491
I got the winning ticket.

265
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,369
Oh...

266
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,744
Mmm...

267
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,807
Huh?

268
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,349
Mmm...

269
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,857
Oh...

270
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,326
Mmm...

271
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,329
Mmm, oh, oh...

272
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,970
Come on, boy.

273
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,883
Melvin.

274
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,407
My son Kevin.

275
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,976
Nice to meet you.

276
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,478
If you, uh, you go down this
road right here and veer off...

277
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,354
...just take your second right...

278
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,292
...you'll come to a gate
and that oughta.

279
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,295
...take you down to the river bottom.

280
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,429
Uh, you want us to set up on
the other side then?

281
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,436
Well, actually, if, uh,
if you don't mind...

282
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,405
I'd rather you set up, set up camp
over to the west.

283
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,669
It's just a better piece of
land... it's a little greener.

284
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,109
...over there and I just, uh,
I just think it'd be better.

285
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,511
All right, Dale, we'll see
you in a couple of days.

286
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,976
Come on, boy.

287
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,753
I haven't been down
here in a coon's age.

288
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,283
Me and Dale's old man used to.

289
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,786
...plant oats up and down this
bottom stretch...

290
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,697
God rest his soul.

291
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,134
I doubt that there's
a lonelier place around here.

292
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,330
...than this bottom.

293
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,771
That man's kinda weird -

294
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,273
...that Dale guy.

295
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,902
Yeah, he's a lot different.

296
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,468
...than his daddy.

297
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,208
Didn't he say to set up camp
further downstream?

298
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,011
Hell, if we'd set up further.

299
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,143
...downstream, it'd be darker than.

300
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,153
...a well digger's ass before we
get any hunting in.

301
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,359
You brought the 30-30, daddy?

302
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,295
Special occasion.

303
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,993
There's big game all over this
stretch of bottom, boy.

304
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,366
I can't believe it took him
this long to open it up.

305
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,464
Karl said he shot a bear
the other day.

306
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,498
Karl's a damn drunk.

307
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,510
It's trash talk like that.

308
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:17,310
...that gets the people believing in
shit like Sasquatch.

309
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,576
It's just lies.

310
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,211
...or hallucinations brought on
by the town's killer.

311
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,221
The town's killer?

312
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,159
Moonshine, boy.

313
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,519
Son of a bitch!

314
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,128
Goddamn shit!

315
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,135
Chicken shit son of a bitch.

316
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,404
What are you trying to do?

317
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,374
Send smoke signals
to the next village?

318
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,469
I've been working on this
machine all day.

319
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,174
I can't get the alcohol
contents right.

320
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,553
Shit fire!

321
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,387
That'd take the calluses
off a nigger's hands!

322
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,861
I told you, the alcohol
content's too high.

323
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,661
Half of the people in town
are nitwits now.

324
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,658
You take that in there
they're all gonna be brain-dead.

325
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,800
You know, uh,
Samuel's boy Dale.

326
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,435
...opened his land up
this week.

327
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,637
Yeah.

328
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,646
He probably needs the money.

329
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,016
You think it's still
out there?

330
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,986
Lt?

331
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,285
We don't even know
if there is an it.

332
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,257
You know what it is, Earl.

333
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,590
Don't play dumb on me.

334
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,222
That thing could up and kill
someone one of these days.

335
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,755
...as sure as the world.

336
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,996
Don't be causing
any problems, Lyle.

337
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,300
You know you enjoy that.

338
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,307
...dirty money that lines
your pocket every month.

339
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,015
What happens when it
comes out, Earl?

340
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,684
'Cause it's coming.

341
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,023
I guarantee you that.

342
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,688
It's coming.

343
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,145
That's a good'un, boy.

344
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,158
Man, look at the tusks!

345
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,555
Don't you think you need
to take another shot, boy?

346
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,019
What the hell was that?

347
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,543
Aw, nothing... Just some bucks.

348
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,182
...out there rooting around
for some does.

349
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,522
Grab that hog and let's go.

350
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,366
Hold up there, boy.

351
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,265
Hold this.

352
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,277
I want to show you something.

353
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,476
Stick your finger in that, boy.

354
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,188
It's wet, daddy.

355
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,251
That's what they call
pear pussy.

356
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,823
Pear pussy, boy.

357
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,794
You know, I think we oughta go.

358
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,329
...a little deeper in the
bottoms tomorrow.

359
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,137
That's where the big'uns are.

360
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,512
Daddy, you sure that was
a buck back there?

361
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,014
Yeah, it was a buck.

362
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,846
What do you think it was?

363
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,919
A big old bear?

364
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,084
Speaking of, I gotta go take me.

365
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,093
...a big old grizzly shit.

366
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,910
Daddy?

367
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,852
Dad?

368
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,590
All right, dad, I'm not 10.

369
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,289
I'm not gonna fall for this.

370
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,193
Dad?

371
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,157
God damn, daddy!
You scared the shit out of me!

372
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,285
Relax, boy, I'm just fooling.

373
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,723
Boy, I ain't never heard you
cuss like that.

374
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,800
Relax.

375
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,396
Good night, boy.

376
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,235
Night, daddy.

377
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,350
# I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

378
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,520
# Or see them
sneakin' round the door #

379
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,724
# Way they did way back in '54 #

380
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,894
# Lord, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

381
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,730
# I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

382
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,467
# Or see them
sneakin' round the door #

383
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,840
# Way they did way back in '54 #

384
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:05,542
# Lord, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

385
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,541
# No, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

386
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,833
I don't want you worrying
about our arguing, Jean.

387
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,000
We just got different views,
that's all.

388
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,473
You know, we've been doing
pretty good with these hunters.

389
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,614
I guess it was sort of a
godsend, me losing that job.

390
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,687
Keeps up like this and I might
be able to get you some therapy.

391
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,265
I know it's been hard.

392
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,273
These last years
have been real hard.

393
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,975
But I think there's some light
at the end of the tunnel...

394
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,776
I really do.

395
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,414
A dense fog advisory has been issued.

396
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,922
...until 10 A.M. Tomorrow morning.

397
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,722
Weather is expected to continue
cool and partly cloudy.

398
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,389
No chance of precipitation
in the immediate forecast.

399
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,921
Tonight's low will be
48 degrees.

400
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,594
Our current temperature is 56...

401
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,604
with the wind out of the
southeast at three miles...

402
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,670
Damn, this sausage is tougher
than a mule's foreskin.

403
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,372
Well, we'd be eating Bigfoot
steaks by now if you'd hurry up.

404
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,846
...and kill that big hairy monster.

405
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,213
...running around out there
at Dale's place.

406
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,316
I got a tube steak for you.

407
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,345
Yeah? Looks more like
a Vienna sausage to me.

408
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,515
Well, when Melvin gets here...

409
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,650
I guarantee you we'll be
eating some deer meat.

410
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,952
He's not back yet?

411
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,189
I hadn't seen him.

412
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,460
I ain't seen him
since Friday.

413
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,397
Hmm.

414
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,266
He's been gone
since Wednesday.

415
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,167
He should be back by now.

416
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:24,901
Hey, Henry, what'd you
and Mel catch on Sunday?

417
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,670
He never even showed up.

418
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,610
Seemed kind of funny to me.

419
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,612
Didn't show up?

420
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,637
That's like the Pope missing
Sunday meeting.

421
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,148
Yup.

422
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,684
He always goes
catfishing after church.

423
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,348
Think something's wrong?

424
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,354
Aw, Mel's tough as an old boot.

425
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,590
Thank you, Tanya.

426
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,289
My better half
shot anything yet?

427
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,592
Who's that?

428
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,326
Herbert.

429
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,765
No, not that, uh...

430
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,292
Not that I know of.

431
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,770
Keep an eye on him.

432
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,434
You know he shot his big toe off
last year in the Turkey Trot.

433
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,443
Not playing with a full deck.

434
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,284
Dale.

435
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,050
- Hey, Lyle.
- How you doing?

436
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,716
Doing all right.

437
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,450
You know, old Melvin's been
out there quite some time now...

438
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,893
...hasn't he?

439
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,420
Yeah. I guess he's faring pretty well.

440
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,325
I reckon so.

441
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,805
Now listen, Dale,
I've been thinking.

442
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,279
I know times are tough,
with you out of work...

443
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,146
Jean the way she is and all...

444
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,549
But I sure would hate to see
anything go wrong.

445
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,518
Wrong? What's gonna
go wrong, Lyle?

446
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,358
You know what
I'm talking about.

447
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,628
They're not on
the riverbed, Lyle.

448
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,655
You sure about that?

449
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,165
Yeah.

450
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,838
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

451
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,001
Because if something did
go wrong, I sure would hate.

452
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,841
...to see folks start pointing
fingers at anyone.

453
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,502
Hey, Dale.

454
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,064
You a little bit early for
church, aren't you?

455
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,599
Yeah, I guess I am, preach.

456
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,008
Matter of fact...

457
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,675
I haven't seen you in church
in several Sundays.

458
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,349
Yeah, it's probably...
been quite a while.

459
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,281
Well, you know, Dale...

460
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,622
...it says in the Bible...

461
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,094
...in Proverbs,
chapter 11, verse 3...

462
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:17,065
If you do the right thing,
honesty will rule your life.

463
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,729
But if you're crooked, you'll be
trapped by your own dishonesty.

464
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,808
Maybe I'll see you in church
Sunday morning.

465
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:47,355
# Out on
the perilous deep #

466
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:54,701
# Dangers silently creep #

467
00:57:54,737 --> 00:58:02,974
# And storms
so violently sweeping #

468
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,708
# You're drifting
too far from the shore #

469
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,308
Melvin!

470
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,048
Kevin!

471
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,730
Melvin!

472
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,981
# Freight train, freight train,
running so fast #

473
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,187
# Freight train, freight train, #

474
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,093
# running so fast #

475
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,099
# Please don't tell
what train I'm on... #

476
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,630
Closing down a little
early, are you?

477
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:20,033
Yeah, well, uh, I might have
been a little, uh, a little rash.

478
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,544
...in my thinking, you know?

479
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:27,072
Yeah, that's probably the
smartest thing, Dale.

480
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,311
You know, knowing Samuel...

481
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,843
...he'd have wanted it that way.

482
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,478
Stop that, you old pervert!

483
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,139
Who you calling old?

484
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,149
You, that's who.

485
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,186
Ooh, watch it!

486
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,051
You all right, baby?

487
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,420
Aah!

488
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,322
You all right, babe?

489
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,723
Yeah.

490
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,253
What is all of this?

491
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,923
Oh, my God!

492
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,739
Jesus of Nazareth!

493
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,287
And that concludes the sermon.

494
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,846
...here at the
Cornerstone Baptist Church.

495
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,619
So remember, all you have to do.

496
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,957
...is ask Jesus to
come into your heart...

497
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,962
...repent your sins...

498
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,488
...and everlasting life is waiting
for you on the other side.

499
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:02,061
Now I take you over to 99AM-CC
to listen to a little gospel music.

500
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,038
...from Dark Holler.

501
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,042
Enjoy, and make Jesus
king of your life.

502
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:13,308
Hurry up, lady, let's get out
of here! Quick!

503
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,976
Oh, mercy me,
what happened to you?

504
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,178
Go! Drive! Get out of here!

505
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,155
There was some crazy animal!

506
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,054
He was cutting my wife up...

507
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,321
Oh, my God!

508
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,657
It was terrible.

509
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,889
That looks terrible.

510
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,329
I'm hurt bad. Hurry!
Get me to town!

511
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,333
I'm getting you to town
as soon as I can.

512
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,426
Drive faster!

513
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,937
I think she's dying, or dead.

514
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,541
All right,
everybody just calm down.

515
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,704
Let's let the man speak.

516
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,408
Vern, can you tell us
what happened?

517
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,976
The son of a bitch
was massive, Sheriff.

518
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,112
He split my wife in two -

519
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,553
...one swipe.

520
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,613
Oh, dear.

521
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,750
Must have stood seven, eight feet.

522
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,693
Ran on two legs,
not all fours.

523
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,856
He was hairy and crazy eyes.

524
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,365
An animal of a man!

525
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,663
See, I told ya!

526
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,169
That wasn't no bear I shot at!

527
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,365
I ain't fucking crazy!

528
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,738
Some sort of wild,
crazy man out there...

529
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,573
...some half-breed.

530
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,876
Look, Melvin and his son
is still down there.

531
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,577
We don't know who else
is in that bottom.

532
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,586
We need to get on down to Dale's
and see about it.

533
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,485
Let's go get that bugger.

534
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,012
Yeah, let's do it!

535
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:28,853
Let's go!

536
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,119
Now look, going out there tonight.

537
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,753
would only get
someone else hurt.

538
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,025
Now, it'll be long
about dark soon.

539
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,395
First thing in the morning...

540
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,662
we need to meet
at the community center.

541
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,134
with hound dogs, rifles.

542
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,330
...and enough rations
for a two-day hunt.

543
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,498
Now let's get this man
to a medic.

544
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,013
It's O.K.

545
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,581
It's O.K. Now, Jean.

546
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,388
It's O.K., babe.

547
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,591
Holy shit!
What the hell was that?

548
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,294
I don't know, but it was huge!

549
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,232
I'm scared, Otis.

550
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,827
Let's you and me
get out of here.

551
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,633
You don't have to
tell me twice.

552
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,893
It's getting late, baby.

553
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,663
Don't you think you
should come to bed?

554
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,466
I'll be in there as soon
as I finish this off.

555
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,564
You go on in there
and get ready for me.

556
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,510
All right.

557
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,307
Oh.

558
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,114
You're gonna have to be strong, Jean.

559
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,212
You're gonna have
to be real strong.

560
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,122
I know I haven't
been here for you lately...

561
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,285
...but things are gonna change.

562
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,022
I promise you that.

563
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,490
I love you, Jean.

564
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:20,568
I love you.

565
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,531
Watch yourself
out there, Lyle.

566
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:28,839
This is something that
shoulda happened a long time ago...

567
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,846
...but I'm gonna make damn
certain it happens today.

568
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,115
Don't you go out of this house
now, you hear?

569
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:42,521
Put some coffee on the burner.
I should be back directly.

570
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,132
Charlie, let's get
them dogs loaded!

571
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,464
Yeah, go, we gotta hurry!

572
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,237
Who's got some
30-30 ammunition?

573
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,107
I do, I got plenty
in my truck.

574
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,703
Hey, get some goddamn dogs.

575
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,442
You got any shells
for this shotgun?

576
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,245
I ain't got nothing but birdshot left...

577
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,808
...and that ain't good for nothing
but killing rabbits and wetbacks.

578
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,184
Well, that ain't worth shit.

579
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,916
We ain't chasing wetbacks.

580
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,481
All right, we'll load up here
pretty quick.

581
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,516
You got them horses?
How many horses?

582
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,425
I brought you
fellers something to drink.

583
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,692
...in case you get thirsty
down there in the pasture.

584
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,130
Thank you.
Looks like white lightning.

585
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,497
That'll do the trick.

586
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,230
- What's shaking, Dale?
- Hey, Karl.

587
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,067
You ready to go
get that sucker?

588
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,470
Ready to get down
to the creek...

589
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:32,872
...get him right between the eyes.

590
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:36,241
Look at him.
Fat-ass peckerdick.

591
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:39,145
That's what I like
about you, boy.

592
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,376
Got him a new boy.

593
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,113
I don't give a shit.

594
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,178
Take the truck if you want to.

595
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,882
I'm gonna go get me a beer.

596
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,414
Blow his guts out
is all I wanna do.

597
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,427
Got enough to work
both sides of the river?

598
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,455
Just like old times.

599
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,658
Get him by the scrote bag...

600
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:01,226
...cut that son of a bitch off
and tan it for a tobacco pouch.

601
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,760
Well, suit yourself.

602
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,397
You're gonna need
something out there.

603
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,998
Here comes the sheriff.

604
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,901
Everybody get out the way.

605
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,911
...and let this man
get in here and speak.

606
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,977
All right, let's get
this thing moving.

607
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,607
Billy, you got a full tank?

608
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,618
Just got her filled up
this morning, boss.

609
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,744
We're ready to go.

610
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,311
Dale, you got your gate unlocked?

611
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,982
- Yeah.
- Good.

612
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,421
They found Fred and Darleen murdered
in their bed this morning!

613
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,022
Fred had an antler through his ribcage...

614
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,032
Darleen was ripped to shreds!

615
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,931
Said they couldn't even
recognize her!

616
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,198
Had to be that wildman.

617
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,603
Let's lynch that
son of a bitch!

618
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,204
Let's gut him like we did
that hog last week.

619
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,945
- Run him down, boys.
- Let's get him.

620
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,654
Jack him up!

621
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,350
Let's go!

622
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,708
We're gonna go out yonder,
make our way back west.

623
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,837
The boys are gonna
head south on the bank...

624
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,507
...see what they can stir up.

625
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:23,006
Somewhere between there,
we oughta bring it down.

626
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:29,146
And Dale, just so you know,
none of us blame you for any of this.

627
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,587
You and I both know

628
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,754
...that those weren't bullet holes
in your daddy.

629
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:38,257
We know that you're clean
as a hen's tooth, Dale...

630
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,792
...and the truth is all coming out
this afternoon.

631
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,675
Yeah. When the buzzards
start circling.

632
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,006
Let's get him!

633
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,744
Let's make a rug
out of that son of a bitch!

634
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,686
Come on, boys!

635
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:35,849
Let's go, let's go!

636
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,859
Unload! Come on, boys!

637
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,886
Come on, come on!

638
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,397
Come on.

639
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:12,091
All right, fellers,
I'm gonna go in here...

640
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,594
...circle through this bottom.

641
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,359
You hear a bunch of shooting,
run around to the flats.

642
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,366
...as fast as you can and cut him off.

643
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,097
What if I hear you screaming?

644
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,936
God, don't say that,
you ignorant son of a bitch.

645
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,643
Good luck.

646
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,187
Look like he's been eating.

647
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,123
Sure has, 'bout all gone.

648
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,389
He'll do the same thing to us
if he gets a chance.

649
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,775
I think I heard something.

650
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,876
I bet he travels this creek.

651
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,990
I knew you went this way.

652
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,998
I got you now,
you son of a bitch.

653
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,210
He's headed down to the river, boys!
Get him!

654
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,845
There it is!

655
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,183
It's heading south!

656
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:57,849
Can't get a shot.

657
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,293
Earl, I'm gonna cut him off
at the river bottom!

658
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,693
Come on, boy!

659
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,565
There he is, there he is!

660
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,132
He's making for the river!

661
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,839
All right, I got, I got
a sight on him right now!

662
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,559
Ride him down, ride him down!

663
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:39,799
Can you get a shot at him?

664
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,325
No, I can't see him.

665
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:43,166
I need six horses, go on!

666
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:44,365
Get on in there!

667
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:45,395
Shoot him down!

668
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,307
Get across that river bottom
to that other side and cut him off.

669
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,311
Don't you dare let that
son of a bitch get away.

670
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,108
I'll get him, I'll get him!

671
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,115
- Kill him! Kill him! Get him!
- Where'd he go?

672
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,320
If you can't kill him, wound him...

673
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,121
...cripple the son of a bitch.

674
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,289
There he is.

675
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,660
- Christ almighty.
- Is it dead?

676
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,633
I've never seen anything
like that before in my life.

677
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,906
Dang, I can't tell what it is
from right here.

678
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,242
I don't know whether
it's a man or an animal.

679
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,147
It don't look natural.

680
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,827
Look at them tusks
on that son of a gun.

681
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,776
Preacher, I want you just to stand
up close next to Dale there.

682
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:38,085
I'll get a picture of all three of you
right in front of this guy.

683
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,417
Why don't y'all get together
and take a picture together?

684
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,496
- It's over.
- Finally.

685
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,592
They say he's eaten horses?

686
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,102
Yeah, he's been
eating horses.

687
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,763
God almighty.

688
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,670
Sure is ugly.

689
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,441
Smells like they killed him
three days ago.

690
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,883
Can we get one more
of you and that gun?

691
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,513
At least he's dead, dead, dead.

692
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,182
Good riddance.

693
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,055
God damn!
Good riddance to bad rubbish!

694
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,532
Preacher can't save him...

695
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,865
...maybe the devil can.

696
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,267
Amen.

697
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:34,235
# I went down to the river,
said a little prayer #

698
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:37,830
# Lord, something
got a hold on me #

699
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,808
# I went down to the river,
said a little prayer #

700
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:45,506
# And something
got a hold on me #

701
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:49,210
# And something got a hold
on me, sweet Jesus #

702
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,344
# Something got a hold on me #
