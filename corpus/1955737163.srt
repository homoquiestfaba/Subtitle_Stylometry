00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,808
<i>Its new course is set

<i>Like the great explorer Magellan,</i>

the Alpha Station
will journey into the unknown.

37
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,859
A symbol of our values and knowledge.

38
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,446

39

Ah...

43
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,984
Let us give back to nature,

44
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,069
that which she gave to us.

45
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:14,871
Give this pearl

46
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,873
to my daughter, Princess Lïho.

47
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,579
Dad?!

48
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,913
It's broken!

49
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,250
Lïho!

50
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,802
Lïho!

51
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,692
Lïho!

52
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,452
Lïho!

53
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,563
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just a...

54
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,564
bad dream.

55
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,524
No.

56
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,779
- Hey!
- But I feel better now.

57
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,882
Don't you think we should run
through our assignment?

58
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,616
That's the last thing I feel like doing.

59
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,161
Not very professional, Major.

60
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,790
Look, I scored a perfect 200
on my last memory test.

61
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:13,502
Impressive. Unfortunately you've forgotten
something rather important today.

62
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,463
- What's that?
- My birthday.

63
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,756
Hey!

64
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,161
What can I do to make it up to you?

65
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,015
<i>Beginning descent in three minutes.</i>

66
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,065
Nothing that you can get done
in three minutes.

67
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:33,898
Come on.

68
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,900
Don't start what you can't finish.

69
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,028
<i>Landing
on planet Kyrian in five minutes.</i>

70
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,405
Sorry. Hey, look.

71
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,050
I know you're attracted to me.
Why deny the obvious?

72
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,618
- It's obvious?
- Yeah, sure.

73
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,786
Little Goody Two-shoes
with an Ivy League education

74
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,122
are always attracted to galaxy-hopping
bad boys like me.

75
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:54,293
My Ivy League education taught me
to steer clear from bad boys like you.

76
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,976
Yeah, well, you're not going to find
better than me on the market.

77
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,881
Straight up. Take a good look.

78
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,466
Handsome, intelligent...

79
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,176
- Modest.
- Brave.

80
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,594
- Suicidal.
- Determined.

81
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,429
- Pig-headed.
- Faithful.

82
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,806
- To yourself.
- Yeah, and to you.

83
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,975
- You're my partner.
- Yeah, don't forget it.

84
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,772
Look, why don't you think with your heart
and not your head for once?

85
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,315
I don't wanna be another name

86
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,238
on your list of conquests,
thank you very much.

87
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,193
What are you talking about? What list?

88
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,070
Alex, can we see the playlist, please?

89
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,155
No, no. No, no, no. Hey.

90
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,407
Most of those are coworkers,
and that's it.

91
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,659
Coworkers?

92
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,203
Right, where's my picture then?

93
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,664
They mean nothing to me. Okay?

94
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,266
I took a few detours when I was younger.

95
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,833
Your last detour was not so long ago.

96
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,061
Yeah, but with you it's different.

97
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,085
And you know it.

98
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,005
I want my heart to belong
to you and no one else.

99
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:44,259
My heart will belong to a man
who will erase his playlist for me.

100
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,129
That's what I'm talking about.

101
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,391
I'm that man.

102
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,063
Look, we both know
you're quite a ladykiller.

103
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,525
So why do you lose interest in a girl
as soon as you win her heart?

104
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,415
'Cause I'm looking for the perfect woman.

105
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,029
But you've never stopped to look.

106
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,656
That's not a crime.

107
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,616
No, it's not a crime.

108
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,534
But just admit it,

109
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,246
you're scared of commitment.

110
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,956
Me? Scared of commitment?

111
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:15,707
Are you kidding me?

112
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,459
Nine years in the service.

113
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,461
Impeccable record.

114
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,380
Seven medals of honor.

115
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,298
Never lost a partner.

116
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,382
Yeah, until now.

117
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,009
<i>Refuel complete.</i>

118
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,432
Alex, did you enter the coordinates?

119
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,100
<i>I took that liberty,
so you could both</i>

120
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,852
<i>enjoy the beach a while longer.</i>

121
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,104
- Oh, thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

122
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,481
<i>You will be leaving exospace
in 30 seconds.</i>

123
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,209
- You wanna take us down?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,628
Alex, will you pull up my brain charts
for the past 10 minutes?

125
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,778
I had a weird dream.

126
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,490
See anything abnormal?

127
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,036
<i>Your cerebral activity
is a little more intense than usual.</i>

128
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,039
<i>- You received external waves.</i>
- Explain.

129
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,332
<i>These waves
don't come from your memory.</i>

130
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,501
<i>Somebody is sending you the images.</i>

131
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,879
- Do you know who? Where they come from?
<i>- Negative.</i>

132
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,173
<i>They could come from the present or past.</i>

133
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,216
<i>And from anywhere in the universe.</i>

134
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,342
Leaving exospace.

135
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,430
<i>Three, two, one... exit.</i>

136
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,445
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

137
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,547
- Easy, easy.
- We're late.

138
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,989
Yeah, well, better late than dead.

139
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,074
Do you wanna drive?

140
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,284
Whoa! Put your hand back on the joystick.

141
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
Laureline, put your hands
back on the joystick.

142
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,683
Laureline, will you please put your hand
back on the joystick?

143
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,310
Will you stop complaining
about my driving?

144
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,853
Yes, I'm sorry. You're a great driver.

145
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,521
You're the best driver
in the entire universe.

146
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,297
Aw. Thank you.

147
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,810
- <i>Intercom activated.
- Thanks.</i>

148
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,312
Touchdown on Kyrian in two minutes.

149
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,314
<i>Minister on line.</i>

150
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,401
- Sir?
<i>- Agents Valerian and Laureline,</i>

151
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,154
<i>I trust you've studied the assignment.
So as soon as you land,</i>

152
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,031
<i>recover the Converter
and bring it to Alpha</i>

153
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,741
<i>for a top-secret operation.</i>

154
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,285
<i>The Converter is the last
creature of his species,</i>

155
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,995
<i>- so we're counting on you.
- Yes, sir.</i>

156
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,956
<i>Captain Gibson has further details.</i>

157
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,333
<i>And please, put on some
more appropriate clothing.</i>

158
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,627
Good idea. Leaving manual.

159
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,212
<i>Manual disarmed.</i>

160
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,007
<i>Intercom activated.</i>

161
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,886
Here they come. Intruder 980.

162
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,805
Check parameters.

163
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,766
Two people on board. No parasites.

164
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:58,828
Where's the band?

165
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,083
You plan on going on a mission
dressed like that?

166
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,250
We're supposed to mingle
with tourists, aren't we?

167
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,137
What do you expect us to wear?
A panda suit?

168
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,377
Nice hat.

169
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,708
Major, this mission is in-and-out.

170
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,977
You enter Big Market,
you find the suspect's store,

171
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,496
and you team up with Sergeant Cooper.

172
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,314
- I only work with my partner.
- Hi.

173
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,397
We're a team.

174
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,418
Sergeant Laureline will arrive at the drop

175
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,322
in exactly 20 minutes, and you will have
10 seconds to make the transfer.

176
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,905
Didn't you read the memo?

177
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,366
Yeah. Of course.

178
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,450
You better have.

179
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,666
How about we look at the memo
one last time?

180
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,626
Can't hurt.

181
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,943
Think you can survive
20 minutes without me?

182
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,444
How could I possibly?

183
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,905
Go on. Be careful.

184
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,616
Oh, you must be right.

185
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,161
I completely forgot,
I have a question for you.

186
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,329
Shoot.

187
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,706
What?

188
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,418
Will you marry me?

189
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,798
- Not funny.
- Laureline, I'm serious.

190
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,361
I've been thinking about what you said
earlier and you're right.

191
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,612
I need to move onward and upward.

192
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,720
I need to commit.

193
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,514
Here? Just like that?

194
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,325
Yeah. Why not?
They sell a zillion things here.

195
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,601
I'm sure we can find a priest
who'd be happy to oblige.

196
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,354
Go.

197
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:53,776
Okay, let's go.

198
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,512
<i>We remind you
that if you want to enjoy</i>

199
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,888
<i>the experience of Big Market,</i>

200
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,349
<i>you must put on equipment
available to you.</i>

201
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,641
<i>Thank you.</i>

202
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,192
Welcome, everybody. Welcome.

203
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,111
Please gather around, gather around.

204
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,904
Now, my name is Thaziit,

205
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,324
and I am your guide for today, okay?

206
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,784
Now, whose first time
is this at Big Market?

207
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,037
Lovely, lovely. Wonderful, wonderful.

208
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,915
Now, let me remind you
that Big Market is in another dimension.

209
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,084
You won't be able to see it
without your helmet,

210
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,587
or touch it without your gloves.

211
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,926
For there are nearly a million stores
in Big Market.

212
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,095
Yes, okay, we have one hour.

213
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,265
Now, please watch the letters at the top,

214
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,895
and verify that the "U"
for Human is full green, okay?

215
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,647
So, everybody please, get together,

216
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,816
right behind your guide, whose name is?

217
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,778
- Thaziit!
- Thaziit! Come on, let's go!

218
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,323
Okay, follow me.
Please, put your helmets on.

219
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,700
Come through the gates. Okay?

220
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,744
Activate your system. Wonderful.

221
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,205
<i>Do not leave your helmet.</i>

222
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,623
<i>System activated.</i>

223
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,213
Whoa...

224
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,592
Welcome to Big Market.

225
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,285
Hi.

226
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,870
Yes, sure, of course. Bill?

227
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,039
Can I have my camera, please? Thank you.

228
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,999
Say cheese.

229
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Thank you, Bill.

230
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,515
- You're good.
- Thanks.

231
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,730
Hey, Hey.

232
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,404
<i>♪ Come with me ♪</i>

233
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,991
<i>♪ Stand by me ♪</i>

234
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,410
<i>- ♪ Stars are sweet ♪</i>
- Good luck.

235
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,573
- What the hell are you doing, soldier?
- Sorry, sir.

236
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:51,848
Keep an eye on the guy, all right?

237
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,872
Yes, sir.

238
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,580
Please be careful
down the stairs.

239
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,332
Come on, everyone.

240
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,793
- Just think baby a million stores.
- Yeah.

241
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,338
Only stuff that we can carry, okay?

242
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,923
- I promise.
- All right.

243
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,068
All right, drop in 12 minutes.

244
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,151
Copy that.

245
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,760
I found the suspect's store.

246
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,681
<i>Good. Sergeant Cooper will help you
get in and recover the stolen property.</i>

247
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,951
- Major Valerian.
- Sergeant Cooper.

248
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,454
As you read in the memo, you need glasses
to see the other dimension,

249
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,665
and a trans-matter box
to bring anything there.

250
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,377
- Especially a gun.
<i>- Authorized.</i>

251
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,628
Put this on.

252
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,633
Enter your genetic code
on the front keypad.

253
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,511
To come back, enter your genetic code
on the back keypad.

254
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,971
- Clear?
- Crystal.

255
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,442
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

256
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,537
Hey, Tsûuri. Good to see you again.

257
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,205
Please, sit down.

258
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,167
Do you have what we asked for?

259
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,250
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,003
But it was a toughie.

261
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,557
I lost a lot of personnel
getting this for you.

262
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,603
But this thing is priceless.

263
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,813
What can you give me in exchange?

264
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,787
Amazing.

265
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,167
I never thought
I'd see one in my lifetime.

266
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,710
You'll have hundreds of them.

267
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,004
Just as soon as
you give us what we came for.

268
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,088
Oh...

269
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,217
That's where I have
a slight problem, my friends.

270
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,761
If you're going to knock out
copies of this baby for me,

271
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,429
why shouldn't I do it for myself?

272
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,810
Hey, hey. Easy, my little lambs.

273
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,773
We absolutely need this Converter.

274
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,858
You know we are fighting
for a noble cause.

275
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,945
I know. And I'm fighting
for a noble cause, too.

276
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,654
Mine.

277
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,616
You have 10 seconds to drop your guns.

278
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,534
Hmm?

279
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,411
Showtime.

280
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,168
Five...

281
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,548
Four...

282
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:15,968
Three...

283
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:18,887
Two...

284
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:21,765
One...

285
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,144
Federal Agent Valerian.

286
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,522
Sorry to interrupt this great deal,
but I'm also here for a noble cause.

287
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:28,856
It's called the law.

288
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,087
Hey, haven't I seen you guys
somewhere before?

289
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,322
Hey, I'm not running a tearoom here.
What do you want from me?

290
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,116
Igon Siruss, you stand accused of stealing

291
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,201
a Mül Converter
belonging to the Federation.

292
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,036
But before I drag your ass in,

293
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,748
I have to recover the stolen property.

294
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,375
<i>- All right, how we doing?</i>
- Almost there.

295
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,502
Valerian, I'll be to your left
at 3 o'clock.

296
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,296
- Three meters away.
- Got you.

297
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,340
Guys, don't move.

298
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,101
Now, take it nice and easy
and push it into the box.

299
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,773
- Converter in the box.
- Copy.

300
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,822
Undetected. Back to base.

301
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:18,948
<i>- Good job.</i>
- Copy that.

302
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,326
- Valerian, get out of here.
- I'm on my way.

303
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,882
I'll find you, Federal Agent Valerian.

304
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,259
Wherever you are in the universe,

305
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,843
I'll find you.

306
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,305
And I will kill you.

307
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,015
Good luck.

308
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,534
Valerian's in trouble.

309
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,101
Mission takes priority. Keep going.

310
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,621
- Cooper, cover him.
- Copy that.

311
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,897
<i>Seek and destroy. Top priority.</i>

312
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,941
<i>Target's photograph to follow.</i>

313
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,446
- Valerian, how we doing?
- Good.

314
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,156
I think I lost them.

315
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
- Are you thirsty?
- No, thank you.

316
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,243
I'm to your left, 200 feet away.

317
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,870
My keypad's broken.

318
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,621
- You need some energy?
- No, thank you.

319
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,790
The box is broken.
I can't get my arm back.

320
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,959
Hey, you need a lawyer?

321
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,504
Federal agent on duty. Leave me alone.

322
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,428
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:27,861
Valerian, what are you doing?

324
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:04,947
Da!

325
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,742
Very funny.

326
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,743
What's your name?

327
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,704
- Da.
- Da?

328
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,251
Come here. Come here. Try this.

329
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,212
It's way more fun.

330
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:22,839
Da.

331
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,052
So long.

332
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,688
Da! Da! Da! Da!

333
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,690
Yeah, yeah, there's a time
for everything, kid.

334
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,108
Don't you have homework to do?

335
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,698
All right, go get yourself
cleaned up, run to Mommy.

336
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,120
- Mommy?
- Da.

337
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,164
Watch out!

338
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Sorry!

339
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,777
<i>To retrieve
your purchases, please place your items</i>

340
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:28,906
<i>in the transmatter box
and enter your DNA code. Thank you.</i>

341
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,452
Amazing. And so practical.

342
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,536
Useless, you mean.

343
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,723
You don't even know what
you'll do with the darn thing.

344
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,166
Don't be such a grouch. It's decorative.

345
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,793
Try to be civilized for once.

346
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,339
Civilized. Yeah, sure.

347
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:51,929
- Watch out!
- Sorry!

348
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,265
Hey!

349
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,029
Hey!

350
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,573
Hey! Hey! Hey, thanks a lot!

351
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,656
Sorry!

352
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,625
- I didn't see the wall.
- Need some help?

353
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,335
I just need you to fix my arm, thanks.

354
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,450
I suppose, since you asked for my hand,

355
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,185
you should probably get yours back first.

356
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,937
- Is that a yes?
- Don't move.

357
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,608
How can I help you if you keep moving?

358
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,931
Will you just hurry up, please?

359
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,695
Please keep still.

360
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,574
You've been detected.

361
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,079
Uh... Sorry to bother you.

362
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,081
I'm out of ammo and there's
three headed my way.

363
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,332
Give me one second.

364
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,669
I don't have a second.

365
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,212
- Okay, you're good.
- Thanks!

366
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,392
I don't know what I'd do without you.

367
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:35,116
<i>To retrieve
your purchases, please place your items</i>

368
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,870
<i>in the transmatter box,
and enter your DNA code.</i>

369
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,245
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,254
Fetch.

371
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,047
<i>You've been detected.</i>

372
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,465
<i>Keep moving, don't change course.</i>

373
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,551
- What are we supposed to do?
- Run.

374
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,973
- Zito, cover them.
- Yes, sir!

375
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,078
Get! Get in!

376
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,788
Come on, let's go! Go, go, go!

377
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,272
I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm coming!

378
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,847
Zito, get that thing off our backs.

379
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,559
I got it.

380
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,608
Guys, take it out! Take it out!

381
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,101
Alex, we need you right now!

382
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,067
Let's go!

383
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,941
Shoot. He ruined my dress.

384
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,484
Alex, I'm gonna take over on manual.

385
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,319
Prepare to enter exospace.

386
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,302
You know the coordinates
for the rendezvous?

387
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,162
Yeah, I'm just deciphering them.

388
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,081
- Alex, what was that?
<i>- We have a stowaway.</i>

389
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,210
Oh, great. Hold on.

390
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,884
<i>Major Valerian, you're running
nearly 20 minutes late.</i>

391
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,767
Yeah, well, time flies
when you're having fun.

392
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,512
- We have the Mül Converter.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

393
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,807
<i>Now perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing 17 light-years</i>

394
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,827
<i>- from your rendezvous?</i>
- Yeah. It sounds pretty grim

395
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,121
when you put it like that.
But when I say we'll be there in

396
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,814
- nine minutes, does that sound better?
<i>- I'll inform the Commander</i>

397
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,067
<i>that you're behind schedule,
and pass on your apology.</i>

398
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,193
Yeah, you do that.

399
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,531
Leaving exospace in five seconds.

400
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,742
Somebody's gonna land with a bang.

401
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,302
Okay, let's have a look at you.

402
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,139
Not at me, tiger. Come on.

403
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,601
Don't be scared. I'll look after you.

404
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,770
Come on.

405
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:35,355
Hello.

406
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:37,982
Wow.

407
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,820
You have the most incredible eyes.

408
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,066
Okay, you're a little scabby.

409
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:48,661
So why don't we get you a nice treatment
so you can get your mojo back?

410
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,955
Sound good?

411
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,624
Come on.

412
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,759
Some high-grade uranium
and you'll be good as new.

413
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:09,973
Hang on, tiger.

414
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,359
Alex?

415
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,029
Analyze this, please.

416
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,741
Power, 20 megatons?

417
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:32,371
<i>Indeed. There's 10 times more power
in that pearl than in our entire ship.</i>

418
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,330
Where's it come from?

419
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:37,251
<i>From Mül, a planet that was
in the constellation QN34.</i>

420
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,836
- Was?
<i>- Yes.</i>

421
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,214
<i>The planet no longer exists,
and hasn't for 30 years.</i>

422
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:43,956
Let's see what it looked like.

423
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,135
<i>Abundant vegetation,</i>

424
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,430
<i>a few primal species,
but of no particular interest.</i>

425
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,225
The one in my dream
was pretty... interesting.

426
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,476
Zoom in.

427
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,940
- Use our access codes.
<i>- I'm afraid that won't be enough, Major.</i>

428
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,483
<i>Access is restricted.</i>

429
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:02,775
To what rank?

430
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,112
<i>General. Five stars.</i>

431
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,201
The creature in my dream, she had a pearl
just like that on her neck.

432
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,285
<i>Noted, Major.</i>

433
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:15,706
<i>Leaving exospace in one minute.</i>

434
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,168
He's very cute, you know.
And a real charmer.

435
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:20,836
You may have some competition.

436
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,255
I'm fine with competition.

437
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,218
Hey, I'm still waiting for your answer.

438
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:33,682
I know I can be full of myself sometimes,
but I'm dead serious about my proposal.

439
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,726
We have to complete the mission, Major.

440
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,853
There's still the top secret
part to attend to.

441
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,397
Or is your perfect memory
failing you again?

442
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,190
<i>Seat belt.</i>

443
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,735
You know what?

444
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,864
I'm gonna ask for 10 days'
leave right now,

445
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,828
and I'm gonna take you to the most
beautiful beach in the whole universe.

446
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,078
A real beach this time.

447
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,206
The perfect place for a honeymoon.

448
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,834
- <i>Ten seconds.</i>
- The honeymoon comes after the wedding.

449
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:01,918
You know that, right?

450
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,713
- Really?
- Yup.

451
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:08,217
<i>Three, two, one. Decelerating.</i>

452
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,762
Whoa!

453
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,305
Alex, what are you doing?

454
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,391
<i>Sorry, too much traffic.</i>

455
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:19,061
- Do you want me to drive?
- Nope. No, no. No, thank you.

456
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,945
<i>Welcome to Alpha,</i>

457
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,155
<i>the City of a Thousand Planets.</i>

458
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,119
Alex, can you update us?

459
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,412
<i>I'd be delighted to.</i>

460
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:39,665
<i>The Alpha Station has grown 7% this year,</i>

461
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:45,587
<i>and since it left the terrestrial orbit,
it has traveled almost 700 million miles.</i>

462
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,340
Population?

463
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:52,720
<i>Almost 30 million. 3,236 species</i>

464
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:55,222
<i>from the four corners
of the universe live on board,</i>

465
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,433
<i>pooling their knowledge and cultures.</i>

466
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,646
<i>Over 5,000 languages spoken, not counting
the various computer languages.</i>

467
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,147
Demographics?

468
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,275
<i>To the south are the submerged parts,</i>

469
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,611
<i>with 800 species living
in all kinds of liquids.</i>

470
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,240
<i>Such as the peaceful Poulong farmers
who grow cobalt.</i>

471
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:18,662
<i>To the north, we have gaseous lands
dominated by the Azin Mö,</i>

472
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,290
<i>whose extreme sensitivity
makes them specialists</i>

473
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,334
<i>in neurosciences and molecular components.</i>

474
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,587
<i>They can build cells of any kind.</i>

475
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,049
<i>To the east of them,
the large colony of Omelites.</i>

476
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:34,011
<i>They control information technology,
finance, and banking.</i>

477
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,681
<i>Finally, to the west,
in a pressurized atmosphere,</i>

478
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:40,809
<i>we have 9 million humans
and compatible species.</i>

479
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:41,893
Home sweet home.

480
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,438
<i>The economy has been
in shambles for a year.</i>

481
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:48,525
<i>- Do you want a quick summary?</i>
- No. That's enough excitement for one day.

482
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,742
Intruder XB982.

483
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,744
Authorization to dock in Section 1.

484
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,370
- VIP access.
- Oh.

485
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,498
We're famous.

486
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,557
You're late, Major.

487
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:23,560
Sorry, sir. Things got a bit
more complicated than we expected.

488
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,872
Prepare for the worst
and you won't be disappointed.

489
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:26,897
And neither will I.

490
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,400
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

491
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,655
And you, have you checked the Converter?

492
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:35,948
He's in great shape.

493
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,199
May I ask what's going on?

494
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,492
Follow me.

495
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:45,290
Declassify.

496
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,712
A year ago, we discovered
a radioactive zone

497
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,339
right in the middle of the station.

498
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,134
No signal of any kind
could get through it.

499
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,427
We sent several probes, none came back.

500
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,888
So we sent in a special unit.

501
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,599
<i>Its mission was to get as close
to the zone as possible,</i>

502
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,852
and define the nature of the threat.

503
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,229
And?

504
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,438
No one came back alive.

505
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,650
- Any idea who attacked them?
- No.

506
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:14,361
This is the situation today.

507
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,075
The air in the zone is unbreathable,
highly contaminated.

508
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:24,037
And it continues to grow. Like a tumor.

509
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,540
A tumor we have to cut out
as soon as we can.

510
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,500
If we don't, and this cancer
keeps spreading,

511
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,377
it will destroy Alpha in less than a week.

512
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,290
Commander, who would have
any reason to destroy Alpha?

513
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,418
Practically every living
species is represented here.

514
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,653
This is a weapon of mass destruction, and
behind every weapon, there is a killer.

515
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:42,264
It doesn't matter who it is. It's a threat
to us all. It must be eliminated.

516
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,347
Through here.

517
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:52,274
<i>- Commander.</i>
- Minister.

518
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,037
<i>The Council has given you the green light.</i>

519
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:57,154
<i>But we strongly recommend
that international law</i>

520
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,674
<i>and the civil rights
of all concerned should be respected.</i>

521
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,408
Of course. I shall see to it personally.

522
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,660
<i>Agents Valerian and Laureline
will be responsible</i>

523
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,912
<i>for your personal protection.</i>

524
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,788
Sir, that won't be necessary.

525
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,416
I have a unit of K-tron
that I personally trained...

526
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,710
<i>It's a direct order from
the government, Commander.</i>

527
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,088
<i>The two agents need to report
on the outcome of the operations.</i>

528
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:18,925
As you wish.

529
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,262
<i>Gentlemen, lady, good luck.</i>

530
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,619
Since we have to be on the same team,

531
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:29,686
you mind giving us an update
on the operation?

532
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,023
I'll be speaking to the Security Council
in a few minutes.

533
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,651
You'll have all the details
you need to know.

534
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,655
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

535
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,793
Hey, handsome.
You're looking a lot better.

536
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,380
You know, I remember learning
about you guys at school.

537
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,133
I'm dying to find out
if what they say is true.

538
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:02,468
Okay.

539
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:09,976
Wow.

540
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,896
I need to take you shopping with me.

541
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,740
Wait for me here.

542
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,174
- Anything?
- Not yet.

543
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:44,845
We haven't got a peep out of him,
but I'm trying something new.

544
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,184
One more hour.

545
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:55,063
If he hasn't talked, finish him off.

546
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes, sir.

547
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,910
If anything goes wrong
with this operation,

548
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,790
you know what you have to do.

549
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,641
Wow.

550
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:35,228
Looks like you're taking
my protection very seriously.

551
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:37,439
His protection, actually.
He's one of a kind.

552
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,334
You're sure he needs to come along
on such a dangerous mission?

553
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,485
The Mül Converter is capable
of reproducing

554
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,321
any conceivable product in record time.

555
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,632
It will come in very handy
if we have to negotiate.

556
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,217
With the army of K-trons
under your command,

557
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,910
I'm surprised negotiating's on the table.

558
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,954
You take care of my security, Major.

559
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,749
I'll take care of any negotiations.

560
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,852
- Give it to me.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

561
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,337
For your personal security,
why don't you let Agent Laureline

562
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,100
look after the little guy for safekeeping?

563
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,841
I don't think so, Major.
It's against protocol.

564
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,093
I am the highest ranking...

565
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,553
That animal is the last living specimen
of its species.

566
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,930
The whole universe is after it.

567
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:12,265
That's why Major Valerian
would rather I held onto it.

568
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,228
All right.

569
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,439
Just don't leave my side.

570
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,031
Commander, the Council is waiting.

571
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,036
Okay, let's do this.

572
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:38,749
Stay here.

573
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,048
<i>En route to the meeting.</i>

574
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:46,507
Received, General.

575
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,893
You stay on backup.
I'll take the front line.

576
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,355
Yes, sir.

577
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:11,032
Delegates, thank you
for answering the call so quickly.

578
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,744
As the elected representative
of the Human Federation,

579
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:17,028
I have called this meeting
of the Alpha Security Council

580
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,292
to update you regarding the state
of emergency we find ourselves in.

581
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,169
As you all know,

582
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,339
the heart of historic Alpha Station
has been contaminated by a force

583
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:28,633
whose power we do not know the origins of.

584
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,679
The Human Federation has launched
several small military attacks

585
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,973
in order to ascertain
the severity of the threat,

586
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,642
but these have all ended in failure.

587
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,729
And with some significant
losses among our troops.

588
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,607
In light of this alarming
and growing threat to us all,

589
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,108
the Human Federation is seeking...

590
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:46,276
Everything okay?

591
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,738
You're missing out.
I'm having a lot of fun.

592
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,616
Yeah. Don't worry,
we'll be on the beach soon.

593
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,094
I can now answer
any questions you may have

594
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,745
about the details of the operation.

595
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,669
13th Battalion, Special Assaults Division.

596
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,714
- There she is.
- I told you she was there.

597
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,007
That's all I need.

598
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,383
Agent Laureline.

599
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,010
- <i>What?</i>
- Doghan Daguis.

600
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,093
Oh.

601
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,555
- Nice to see you again.
- Agent Laureline.

602
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:16,473
As resplendent as ever.

603
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,933
Just tell me what you want.

604
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,100
We go where work calls.

605
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:20,519
We speak over 5,000 languages.

606
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,312
Which can be handy in a party like this.

607
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,772
Need our services?

608
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,484
I have my own personal translator.
Now move.

609
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,486
Ask them if they have intel on Mül.

610
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,615
Planet Mül, ring any bells?

611
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,075
A highly sensitive matter.

612
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:36,358
The best person to speak to...

613
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,536
Would be Major Samk.

614
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,869
Alex?

615
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,206
Major Samk died a year ago.

616
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,291
Well, yes, a most curious demise.

617
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,419
- That was not fully explained.
- Murder some might call it.

618
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:49,548
Major Samk was an expert on Planet Mül.

619
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,258
He took all
that precious information...

620
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,425
To the grave with him.

621
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:53,343
What a waste.

622
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,387
If you receive any intel on this planet,

623
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,989
- we're interested.
- It would be a pleasure

624
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,015
- to work for you, Laureline.
- Before we go...

625
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,779
- We would like to give you...
- Some info.

626
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,850
For free.

627
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,270
- For free?
- Mmm-hmm.

628
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
You guys must be sick.

629
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,832
- The Converter is precious.
- And highly sought-after.

630
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,417
- Mercenaries will come...
- To retrieve it...

631
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,378
- Sooner than you think.
- What kind of mercenaries?

632
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,571
- The first tip was free.
- You must pay for more.

633
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,239
But you get a discount, of course.

634
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,328
General, we have an alert on Section B.

635
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:23,290
- Alex, what's that?
<i>- A dozen individuals approaching.</i>

636
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:26,001
- What kind of individuals?
<i>- Undetectable for now.</i>

637
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:28,295
It appears your info just lost its value.

638
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,171
Now get out of my face.

639
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,633
- Move, pigeons.
- She just called us pigeons.

640
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,037
- What's a pigeon?
- I don't know.

641
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:39,657
- Where are they coming from?
<i>- Everywhere.</i>

642
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,974
<i>They're going through the walls.</i>

643
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,892
Alex, I need to know
the attackers' identity.

644
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:44,811
Everyone, please evacuate.

645
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,022
<i>I cannot read their DNA.</i>

646
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,397
What?

647
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,820
Sir, the door's locked. We can't get out.

648
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:55,572
- Laureline.
- I'm coming.

649
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,119
- Evacuate the Commander.
- Copy that.

650
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,371
General, secure that door.

651
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,113
- Commander.
- What's going on?

652
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,875
- We need to evacuate.
- Let's go.

653
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,839
- It's not working.
- What? Alex, open the door.

654
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,749
- What was that?
- The Pearls.

655
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,294
They took the Commander.
Here, take this. Free the General.

656
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,272
Go to the command room
and track them from there.

657
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,296
Okay.

658
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,288
- Are we back to full power?
- Yes, sir, just now.

659
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:33,730
Everybody, back to your posts!

660
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,863
Status on Major Valerian?
Level 5 emergency.

661
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:42,946
Confirmed.

662
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,242
Valerian, I've got you on visual.

663
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,386
<i>Okay,
but I've lost track of them.</i>

664
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,661
<i>Try to locate the Commander.</i>

665
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:58,004
Okay, I've got him.
He's near the docking bay,

666
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,687
so he must be headed towards the vessel.

667
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:04,219
Okay, what's the shortest way there?

668
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,971
North-northeast, 113 degrees.

669
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:11,434
Sixty, 70, 80, 90.

670
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,941
That leads me straight into a wall.
You said you wanted the shortest way.

671
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,316
It may be the shortest way,
but it's not the easiest.

672
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,411
Keep going. You're almost there.

673
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,426
They've reached another ship.
No tags, unknown model.

674
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,888
Valerian, they've boarded. Change of plan.
A hundred and forty degrees east.

675
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,055
Alex will pick you up.

676
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,605
- <i>81?</i>
- That's it. 81, straight.

677
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

678
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,818
- 81? You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

679
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:46,321
Because I just went through
and I'm falling in space.

680
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,243
Sorry, my mistake. It was number 18.

681
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:54,787
That's okay. We all make mistakes.

682
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,581
Any idea to get me out of here?

683
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,291
Alex, pick him up on 81.

684
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,513
I'm in. Close it.

685
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:23,524
Bring on the beach.

686
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:36,412
I'm not sure where you come from,
but I know where I'm gonna send you.

687
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,556
<i>Valerian, hold still.
We're analyzing its system of defense.</i>

688
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:01,729
Major, their protective shield

689
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,374
is too sophisticated.
You won't get through.

690
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,899
I'm gonna try something bigger.

691
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,238
Shit!

692
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:17,874
Laureline, which one
has the Commander on board?

693
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,206
<i>Nine o'clock,
lower level. Hurry up.</i>

694
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:23,960
<i>That's the one. Don't lose it.</i>

695
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,682
Valerian, be careful.

696
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:58,536
The Intruder's too big to follow them.
I'm gonna take the SkyJet.

697
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:00,537
Okay.

698
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,057
Okay, Valerian, you're near the Dead Zone.

699
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,225
Reel them in before I lose you.

700
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:22,560
I'm working on it.

701
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:41,329
<i>Valerian, you need to go faster.</i>

702
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,465
Valerian, you've got 10 seconds
before I lose you.

703
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,633
Take that.

704
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:58,846
Who's the clever one now?

705
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,057
Valerian, you've got five seconds.

706
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,229
Oh, no. Not me.

707
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,360
- <i>Valerian?</i>
- I can't slow 'em down.

708
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:15,196
Come on. Come on.

709
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:17,448
<i>Entering Red Zone.</i>

710
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,033
<i>Entering Red Zone.</i>

711
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:20,409
Valerian, do you hear me?

712
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,539
Laureline! I'm losing control!

713
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,082
Laureline!

714
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:31,420
Valerian, answer me. Valerian, answer me.

715
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,840
- Major, respond.
- Alex, can you help?

716
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,299
<i>There's too much interference.</i>

717
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,093
<i>I've lost the Major's signal.</i>

718
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:43,850
Valerian? Valerian?

719
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:47,979
Valerian, do you copy?

720
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,397
We've lost him.

721
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,667
Sergeant, where are you going?

722
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:52,900
To grab my SkyJet.

723
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,903
- You won't be going after him.
- Why not?

724
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,072
That zone is under enemy
control. It's too dangerous.

725
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,365
An enemy that we don't know!

726
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,033
An enemy that's just attacked us!

727
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:03,303
By putting us to sleep
and not hurting a single one of us!

728
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,621
Why would they spare our lives?
Give me one good reason.

729
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:07,748
I don't know.

730
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,918
Valerian has seen these creatures before.
They are from Planet Mül.

731
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,588
Planet Mül was destroyed 30 years ago.

732
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,250
You're not making any sense.

733
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,133
It's our mission
that doesn't make sense, sir!

734
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,301
Someone is lying to us,

735
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,387
and while you find out who,
I'm going to go save my partner.

736
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,357
General, Major Valerian
is an invaluable agent.

737
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:35,359
You cannot afford to lose him.

738
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,987
No, I can't afford to lose
both of you in one day.

739
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:40,155
Restrain her.

740
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:46,787
Put us on high alert,

741
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,290
and find me the Commander.

742
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:50,749
Yes, sir.

743
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:12,355
Listen, I don't wanna tell you guys
how to do your jobs,

744
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,106
but don't you think you should cuff me?

745
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:16,359
Firstly, because it's protocol,
but secondly,

746
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,611
because I'm very tempted to escape.

747
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,543
Good job, boys.

748
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,927
We need to talk.

749
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,471
Oh, it's dark in here.

750
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:49,809
- Ow!
- Sorry.

751
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:52,937
If you don't help me find Valerian,
then this bullet's gonna find you.

752
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,106
- You're up first.
- No, no, no, no.

753
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,501
- It's to avoid such situations...
- That all of our information...

754
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,777
- Is divided three ways.
- Kill one of us...

755
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,220
- And you kill the information.
- What a pity that would be.

756
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,299
Okay. You're gonna have to
give me credit, though,

757
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,409
- 'cause I don't have much on me.
- Oh, how tiresome.

758
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,179
- If the Commander were here...
- He could use the Converter to pay us.

759
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,121
But he's been abducted...

760
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,081
Precisely because he had the Converter
on him.

761
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,499
Unless, for security reasons...

762
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,167
Someone else was carrying it on them.

763
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,087
How in space did you get that info?

764
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:19,824
- It's not info.
- Just deduction.

765
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,175
- We know how humans work.
- They're all so predictable.

766
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:25,511
Clearly you've never met a woman.

767
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,138
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Calm down.

768
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,431
What do you want to know?

769
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,016
Valerian's exact location.

770
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,267
Hard to tell.

771
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,536
But we know how to track him down...

772
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,560
With complete precision.

773
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,147
- How much?
- One hundred baduls.

774
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,982
- Each.
- Forget about it.

775
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,108
This is all I have.

776
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,821
Diamonds are less valuable than baduls.

777
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:44,947
The negotiation is over.

778
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:46,949
- We trust you.
- And under the circumstances...

779
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,659
- We accept the deal.
- Good.

780
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,995
Now take me to Valerian. Now.

781
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,204
Follow us.

782
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,789
Philips, head to the location

783
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:55,082
where the Major disappeared.

784
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,585
Milo, track down Agent Laureline
and bring her in.

785
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:00,588
- Neza, inform the Minister.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,049
Just give me a few minutes, please.

787
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,511
Declassify.

788
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,724
I need all information on the Planet Mül.

789
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:16,687
Well, who has authority over this file?

790
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:28,449
Here we are.

791
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,159
I do not like this place.

792
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:34,537
Here.

793
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:43,381
I've got a bad feeling
about this idea of yours.

794
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:51,429
Bingo.

795
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,478
What do you want?

796
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,664
- We'd like to go fishing...
- For a cortex jellyfish.

797
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:00,940
Male, if possible.

798
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:05,945
Nah, it's not the season.

799
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,570
Here.

800
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,326
- Males are harder to catch.
- And here.

801
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,288
Welcome aboard.

802
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,963
Uh...

803
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,131
The thing, down.

804
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,217
- The... Down. The thing, down.
- This one?

805
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:42,857
There. Bromosaurs.

806
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:51,031
- Are they dangerous?
- Not really.

807
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,075
You just have to be careful
they don't inhale you.

808
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,048
There, that one is a male.

809
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,181
How can you tell?

810
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:17,892
Oh, they're much smaller than the females.

811
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,740
How do you know that that one
has a jellyfish on it?

812
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:33,823
All males do.

813
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,035
The Bromosaurs blow out pure water,

814
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,537
<i>which the jellyfish can't do without.</i>

815
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,664
That's why they live
on them all year round,

816
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:43,876
and that's where they get
their hypersensitivity from.

817
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:54,220
Soft as silk.

818
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:55,554
Can I help? I'm a good driver.

819
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:16,325
- Seat belt.
- What?

820
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,550
Seat belt.

821
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,194
I thought you said
they weren't aggressive.

822
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,818
Except when you take their little buddy.

823
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,512
Great.

824
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,546
I'm Bob, by the way.

825
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:12,922
Hi.

826
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,053
There's no time to lose.

827
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,265
The cortex jellyfish
is extremely fragile.

828
01:08:21,724 --> 01:08:23,017
Show it images of Valerian...

829
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,620
And it will show you what it has seen.

830
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,562
Sure, but how?

831
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:27,831
- You have to put it...
- On your head...

832
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:28,897
Down to your shoulders.

833
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,084
- You're kidding?
- Never when we're working.

834
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,086
- Through a kind of osmosis...
- You'll be able to communicate.

835
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,171
- But be very careful...
- Not to stay under there...

836
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,363
Longer than a minute.

837
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:37,507
Because then it starts to feed...

838
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,574
On your memory.

839
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:42,995
Great. Anything else I should know before

840
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,997
I voluntarily stick my head on his mouth?

841
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:46,832
Actually, it's not his mouth.

842
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:48,035
- You can begin.
- Good luck.

843
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,465
- Don't forget.
- One minute.

844
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,548
Not a second more.

845
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:01,055
I knew I had it in here somewhere.
There we are. Aha!

846
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,433
Pe-ew!

847
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,188
There we go.

848
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:11,857
This is so exciting.

849
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,151
Valerian?

850
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,116
I only work with my partner.

851
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,327
Valerian, answer me!

852
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,898
What can I do
to make it up to you?

853
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:35,506
Thirty seconds.

854
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:37,007
Valerian, answer me!

855
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:38,758
Take that.

856
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,432
Laureline! I'm losing control!

857
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,101
Valerian!

858
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,606
- Valerian!
<i>- Laureline!</i>

859
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,774
Forty seconds.

860
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:56,818
Valerian!

861
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,536
- Fifty seconds! Get out!
- Now!

862
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,912
Fifty-five seconds!

863
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,498
Valerian!

864
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:11,916
Valerian.

865
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:16,213
Valerian!

866
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,843
- Beautiful.
- Incredible.

867
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:23,178
- One minute...
- And 10 seconds.

868
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,262
A record.

869
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:29,434
Okay...

870
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:37,192
"L.630.E-S-U-L deactivated."

871
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:39,153
Any idea what that means, guys?

872
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:41,655
- Level 630 East.
- Most likely a sulfate pipe.

873
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:43,282
Deactivated, apparently.

874
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,784
Okay. Okay, thanks.

875
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:48,120
You need a detailed map?

876
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,166
We biologically traced
Sergeant Laureline to here.

877
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,834
What's she doing out by the Galana Sea?

878
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,087
No idea, sir. She stole a vehicle.

879
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,923
She headed into the Red Zone,
and we lost track of her.

880
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,594
She must have located the Major.

881
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,888
<i>General, there are three civilians here</i>

882
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,091
<i>who claim to have information
that might interest you.</i>

883
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,474
Show them in.

884
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:12,478
Ah...

885
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,146
It's you three.

886
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,901
- Our humble respects, General.
- May you be healthy...

887
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,652
- And prosperous.
- What do you want?

888
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:22,380
We have information
of the utmost importance.

889
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,448
- That we're ready to sell.
- 100 baduls.

890
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:27,826
- Each.
- Shoot.

891
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:40,798
Valerian!

892
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,266
Move, lizard.

893
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,947
Valerian? Valerian, do you hear me?

894
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:12,412
Valerian, wake up. Valerian, please.

895
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,374
Stay with me, Valerian. Come on. Come on.

896
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:30,097
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

897
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,723
You totaled your SkyJet, remember?

898
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:36,687
Yeah. I lost it in a curve.

899
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,398
You mean you almost died.
You're lucky I found you.

900
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,334
What about the Commander?
Do we know where he is?

901
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:42,358
There's no sign of him.

902
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:44,173
Their spaceship went into a Red Zone.

903
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:46,696
We gotta find him.

904
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:49,199
- Let's go.
- Wait.

905
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,830
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

906
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,957
No "Thank you?" No "Well done?"

907
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,525
I would have done the same for you.

908
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:08,302
- You little prick.
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, chill.

909
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:10,679
I trusted you more than I trusted myself.

910
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,122
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No.

911
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,225
You are an amazing woman, Laureline.

912
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,203
It's no wonder I wanna marry you.

913
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,022
Why would I wanna marry
an ungrateful, conceited...

914
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,505
Because you can't live without him.

915
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,585
I mean, look, whenever he wanders off,
you go chasing after him.

916
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,239
I was just doing my job, Major.

917
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:32,034
Now will you please let me
get back to the mission?

918
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,244
Yeah, sure.

919
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:35,662
Good.

920
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:36,746
Sergeant.

921
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,689
Captain, what's going on here?

922
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:47,341
I report directly
to the Commander Arun Filitt.

923
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:49,184
- I don't have to...
- I am General Okto-Bar!

924
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,887
In the absence of the Commander,
I am in command on Alpha!

925
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:53,638
Arrest this man!

926
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:55,765
And release that one.

927
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,481
I apologize for your mistreatment.

928
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,109
We will take you to a jail
but our doctors will take care of you.

929
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:11,072
Help us.

930
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:13,866
If you need my help,

931
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,426
you have to tell me everything you know.

932
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,052
But first of all,
why are you attacking us?

933
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:25,128
Because you have...
what we need.

934
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:40,662
Didn't you say that the girl in your dream

935
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:43,397
- had a Converter just like mine?
- That's right.

936
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,416
So if the animals are native
on their planet then,

937
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,610
surely it's understandable that they want
to retrieve the last living specimen.

938
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:50,570
Yeah, and they probably
kidnapped the Commander

939
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,048
because they thought he was carrying it.

940
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:53,424
Yeah, once they find out he's not,

941
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,848
then I'll be the top of their list.

942
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,960
Don't worry, I'm not letting
you go anywhere.

943
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:59,079
No, I'm not letting you go anywhere.

944
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,042
Wow.

945
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,305
Pretty butterfly.

946
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,225
Sure, but whatever you do,
don't touch them.

947
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:22,769
- Why?
- Because some of them are...

948
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,022
No!

949
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,189
Valerian!

950
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:29,567
Laureline!

951
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,739
I'm coming! I'm coming. I'm coming.

952
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,599
Let me go, fatty. Come on, put me down.

953
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:05,062
Sorry, I'm inedible.

954
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:08,522
Valerian!

955
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,990
<i>Major, I can read your signal now.</i>

956
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,950
Valerian!

957
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:33,131
Alex, any ideas?

958
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,634
<i>The only way
to get in without creating</i>

959
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,804
<i>a severe diplomatic incident
is to pass for one of them.</i>

960
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,515
<i>I suggest you try to find a glamopod.</i>

961
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:45,143
Thanks, Alex.

962
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:56,780
Have you run a DNA search?

963
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:01,284
Yes, but it didn't match
any of the 800 million species

964
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:03,471
- we have in that database.
- Well, how's that possible?

965
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,872
Either it belongs to a
completely unknown species...

966
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:07,165
Or?

967
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:09,709
Or this species was deliberately deleted
from the database.

968
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,507
General, the Major has resurfaced

969
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,710
at the edge of the Red Zone.

970
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:18,135
Which district is he in?

971
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:19,635
Paradise Alley.

972
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:23,139
Notify all units.

973
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:29,271
<i>All units.
Search alert. Major Valerian.</i>

974
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:32,357
<i>Not dangerous. Find and assist.</i>

975
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:37,154
- Can I help you?
- Sure you can. Move.

976
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,160
Good. Now slide your gun into my holster.

977
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:46,496
Hold still.

978
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:09,728
Hi, sugar.

979
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:12,439
Do you wanna ride?

980
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,361
Hey.

981
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,198
Hey, you wanna fly?

982
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,450
I'm allergic to feathers.

983
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:25,952
My hero.

984
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,662
You got the wrong guy.

985
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:36,796
Huh. I...

986
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,880
I don't speak French.

987
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,136
Hello.

988
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:48,642
Come on, out. Pervert.

989
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,020
Hey, cowboy.
You've come to the right spot.

990
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,189
It's the best damn club
on the whole space station.

991
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,233
- Hey, Jolly.
- I'll be with you in a second.

992
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,361
I'm looking for something special.

993
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:01,947
Well, of course you are.
Whatever it is you want,

994
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,407
I got it.

995
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,159
- I'm not so sure about...
- Well, I am.

996
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:08,095
Tell me, what is it you want?
What are you looking for?

997
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,372
- A glamopod.
- You are so lucky.

998
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:12,999
I got the best one
in the whole universe. Come on!

999
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,585
Jolly.

1000
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:18,254
Come on.

1001
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:32,060
Hey, I work for the government.

1002
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:39,567
If you want to avoid a diplomatic incident
you better let me go right now.

1003
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,992
Look, listen. I didn't come
here to get a makeover.

1004
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:49,494
I need to leave. Do you understand?

1005
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,334
I can't believe it.

1006
01:19:57,002 --> 01:19:59,337
I'm not here to try on a stupid dress!

1007
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:00,755
Call your chief or a translator

1008
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,173
so we can at least communicate.

1009
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,053
Do you understand what I am saying?

1010
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:17,730
Hmm.

1011
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,607
Okay.

1012
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,783
This is where you lose
the hardware, soldier boy.

1013
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,618
I'd rather hold onto it. I'm on duty.

1014
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:32,871
Yeah, well, unfortunately rules are rules,

1015
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,498
and this is a place where
we make love, not war.

1016
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:39,919
Here's your ticket.

1017
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,340
Don't lose it.

1018
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:44,423
Can we make a deal?

1019
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,844
Let's not talk about business, can we?

1020
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:49,553
Let's talk pleasure.

1021
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:51,639
What kinda music are you into, huh?

1022
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:54,517
You like techno? Macro? Bio? Nano?

1023
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,311
- I'm more retro.
- Oh. Me, too.

1024
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:57,395
Oldies are goodies.

1025
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:03,568
Sit down. Relax. And enjoy the show.

1026
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,342
Ha!

1027
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,432
I don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

1028
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:49,901
So what'll it be, soldier?

1029
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:52,737
Look, that was really cool,

1030
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,590
but not exactly what
I'm looking for right now.

1031
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:57,676
Well I have a whole lot more in stock
if you just tell me what you have in mind.

1032
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,701
I have a lot in mind.

1033
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,037
And no time for this. I'll pass.

1034
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,541
Listen, I have a problem
and I really need your help.

1035
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:05,976
You didn't like my performance?

1036
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,126
No, no, yeah. I...

1037
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:12,257
- I loved it. Absolutely.
- I started at age four.

1038
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,009
Learning my trade in all the top schools.

1039
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,680
- I can play anyone or anything.
- I'm sure you can.

1040
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,603
I know all of Shakespeare
by heart if you want.

1041
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,183
Poetry maybe? You like poetry?

1042
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,061
- Sure.
- Rimbaud? Verlaine?

1043
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,396
Tough choice.

1044
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:33,111
"I'm afraid of a kiss...

1045
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:38,116
Like the kiss of a bee...

1046
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:41,077
I suffer like this...

1047
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:44,038
And wake endlessly...

1048
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,875
I'm afraid of a kiss."

1049
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:56,718
How about I tell you
what I really have in mind?

1050
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:01,347
- No, quit screaming.
- How'd you get a gun?

1051
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,226
Hey...

1052
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,521
Major Valerian, I advise you
to put that gun down.

1053
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:14,027
- And I advise you to sit down.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1054
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,821
- Please! No! Don't shoot me!
- What the hell is that?

1055
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,656
That is you, when you were 10.

1056
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,700
You're not going to
shoot yourself, are you?

1057
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,785
- Will you go back to normal, please?
- Okay, okay.

1058
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,248
No. Not this normal. The other one.

1059
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:28,332
Okay, okay.

1060
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:33,588
Thank you. What's your name?

1061
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:34,982
Whatever you want it to be, sweetie.

1062
01:25:35,006 --> 01:25:38,086
I don't have time for your games, sweetie.
Come on, tell me, what's your name?

1063
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,138
Bubble.

1064
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:46,059
Look, Bubble, I lost my partner.

1065
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:47,977
If you help me find her,
I'll set you free.

1066
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,773
What good is freedom when
you're an illegal immigrant

1067
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:54,359
- far away from home?
- I work for the government.

1068
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,277
I'll get you an ID pass. You have my word.

1069
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,990
If I leave, Jolly will kill me.

1070
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,867
No, Jolly won't kill anybody ever again.

1071
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:11,042
So what do you say, Bubble?

1072
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,337
You really liked my performance?

1073
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,506
Best I ever saw.

1074
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,636
Thank you.

1075
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:24,138
You're welcome.

1076
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,605
So, I'm gonna take 10.

1077
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,274
You two keep an eye on old soldier boy.

1078
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,777
He seems like a real freak to me.

1079
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,991
Okay, Bubble, get off me.

1080
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,723
All right, all right,
I'm doing this.

1081
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:52,999
Hey, you good?

1082
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,751
Thanks.

1083
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:02,218
- You wanna go in there?
- Yeah, but no foreigners are allowed.

1084
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:04,021
The only way in
is to look like one of them.

1085
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,973
Oh, no, no, no! I've never played
a Boulan Bathor before.

1086
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,725
What? Are you an artist or not?

1087
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:14,105
Yes, but I need time to get into my role,
and capture my movements and behaviors,

1088
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:15,606
and character's arc.

1089
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,817
We do a couple rehearsals,
you give me some notes...

1090
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,361
Well, a little improv never hurt anyone.
Let's go.

1091
01:27:23,281 --> 01:27:24,281
All right.

1092
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:26,575
Turn around.

1093
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:34,833
Ugh.

1094
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,335
This is not right.

1095
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:38,546
I need a manicure.

1096
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:49,265
Don't you think the hat
might be a little bit over the top?

1097
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,392
Uh... Uh...

1098
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,185
Never mind.

1099
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:58,316
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

1100
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,234
Give me a second
to get the hang of it.

1101
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:02,236
Hurry, people are staring at us.

1102
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,155
I told you I needed rehearsals.

1103
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:05,698
This is a heavy role.

1104
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:07,824
Much better.

1105
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,159
You're doing good.

1106
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:17,335
General, we've picked up
the Major's trail again.

1107
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,629
Finally. Where is he?

1108
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:21,839
In Boulan Bathor territory.

1109
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:22,965
In the...

1110
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,052
Nobody gets in there.

1111
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:27,553
And definitely not out of there.

1112
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,117
We'll need reinforcements.
Inform the Minister.

1113
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:33,141
Yes, sir.

1114
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,904
So how did you come
to lose your partner?

1115
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,656
- Because I'm stupid.
- What do you mean?

1116
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:47,949
All I do is flirt and joke.

1117
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,302
Oh, trying to be cool
rather than being honest?

1118
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:51,160
Story of my life.

1119
01:28:51,244 --> 01:28:53,162
How young were you
when you lost your mom?

1120
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:54,580
Please don't go there right now.

1121
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:56,624
It's okay to be
vulnerable sometimes.

1122
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,310
Can we stop this and get back
to the mission, please?

1123
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:59,334
And don't touch anything.

1124
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,797
Well, it wouldn't
hurt you to show some weakness.

1125
01:29:01,879 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm not good at that.

1126
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:04,465
It will make her feel important.

1127
01:29:04,549 --> 01:29:07,552
Yeah, believe me, she's already
the most important thing in my life.

1128
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,578
I think he wants us
to join the group.

1129
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,312
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1130
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,148
It doesn't look like
he's giving us much choice.

1131
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:35,872
What's going on?

1132
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,708
I guess it's lunchtime
for Emperor Boulan Ill.

1133
01:29:50,428 --> 01:29:52,889
Bussing tables,
every artist's worst nightmare.

1134
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:54,640
Never mention this to anyone, okay?

1135
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:56,934
Thank your lucky stars
we're not the main course.

1136
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:03,773
Oh...

1137
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:16,787
I'm going to be sick.

1138
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:39,602
There she is.

1139
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,646
Wow. You're right, she's a 10.

1140
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:49,070
Hmm?

1141
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,717
Hi.

1142
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,523
- Something's wrong.
- How about I do a little dance,

1143
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,108
- to create a diversion?
- No, thanks.

1144
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:40,746
- You guys are in big trouble!
- I think we should go.

1145
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,498
I think you should
let me handle this.

1146
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:47,420
- Valerian!
- I'm in here!

1147
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:11,776
Hey.

1148
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,698
You're gonna be a good boy, okay?

1149
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,575
Down! Stay!

1150
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:19,744
Laureline, it's me. Valerian.

1151
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:20,827
What?

1152
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,417
Oh!

1153
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:29,794
Bubble, get off me.

1154
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:30,897
Yes, you're right, let's go.

1155
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:31,921
Whoo!

1156
01:32:33,174 --> 01:32:34,341
Excuse me, Your Highness.

1157
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,393
Hey, baby.

1158
01:32:51,901 --> 01:32:52,901
I deserved that.

1159
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:58,490
Watch out!

1160
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,285
This is a lady. You can't fight her.

1161
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,672
Let's talk about this.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

1162
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:16,966
I warned you.

1163
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:38,572
Well, that's what I call a partner.

1164
01:33:39,657 --> 01:33:40,657
Whoo-hoo!

1165
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:45,913
Bravo. That was amazing.
I'm very impressed.

1166
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,540
Hey.

1167
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,750
Hey.

1168
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:05,723
Trust me on this.

1169
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,295
Third Regiment approaching, sir.

1170
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:37,464
- Any news from our agents?
- None.

1171
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:40,634
And the Commander?
Any ransom demands?

1172
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:42,887
Negative. Minister on line.

1173
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:43,970
Okay.

1174
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:48,517
My respects, Minister.

1175
01:34:48,601 --> 01:34:50,811
<i>General, you've been
authorized by the council</i>

1176
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:52,646
<i>to assume command of this operation.</i>

1177
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,231
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

1178
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,277
But to fulfill my mission, I will need
full access to Commander Filitt's data.

1179
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,407
<i>According to regulations, that is
impossible without his explicit agreement.</i>

1180
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:04,909
The Commander may well be dead.

1181
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:10,581
If I am to succeed in my new assignment,
I need to know everything.

1182
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:16,337
<i>- Access granted.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

1183
01:35:22,468 --> 01:35:23,468
Declassify.

1184
01:35:26,013 --> 01:35:27,640
Request file on the Planet Mül.

1185
01:35:28,182 --> 01:35:29,934
<i>Request authorized.</i>

1186
01:35:31,518 --> 01:35:34,063
Huh. "The Conflict
with the Southern Territories."

1187
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:39,693
"The war against the Azien Korn
led to the destruction of Planet Mül."

1188
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:41,654
Tell me more about the planet.

1189
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:43,989
"The planet was uninhabited."

1190
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,826
Who's in charge of this operation?

1191
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:53,624
This does not smell good.

1192
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:14,311
Told you there was a door.

1193
01:36:14,395 --> 01:36:17,898
Someone didn't look over the plans
before they came rushing in. As usual.

1194
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:20,609
What, you'd rather I'd showed up
after the main event?

1195
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:24,113
I'd rather you took me someplace
other than a giant trash can.

1196
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:26,072
Bubble?

1197
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:31,829
Bubble, where are you? Where is she?

1198
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:32,912
She was right behind us.

1199
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:34,289
I'm here.

1200
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:42,588
What's wrong?

1201
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:44,442
I must've been injured during the fight.

1202
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:47,428
Bubble, tell me what to do.

1203
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,806
Nothing you can do.

1204
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:56,270
Anyway, where I'm from,
life is more painful than death.

1205
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:57,353
Don't say that.

1206
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,316
Unfortunately, it's true.

1207
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:05,612
Life's a drag when you don't have
an identity to call your own.

1208
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:07,990
You do have an identity.

1209
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:11,660
You're the greatest artist I've ever seen.

1210
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:17,750
I thank you.

1211
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,675
It was my pleasure performing for you.

1212
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,762
I leave you my kingdom.

1213
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:32,847
Take good care of it.

1214
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,390
I will.

1215
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:36,101
But most importantly...

1216
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:38,019
Yeah?

1217
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:39,730
Take good care of her.

1218
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,778
Love her without measure.

1219
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:50,491
"There's beggary in love
that can be reckoned."

1220
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:15,890
Let's go.

1221
01:38:33,742 --> 01:38:35,411
All the battleships have docked, General.

1222
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:38,122
Good. I want Section 1
operative as soon as possible.

1223
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:39,706
What are those K-tron doing there?

1224
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,931
The Commander programmed them personally.

1225
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,587
- They can't be deactivated.
- Great.

1226
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,673
That's all we need.

1227
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:56,324
Do you have any idea where we're going?

1228
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,016
Yeah, sure. I mean...

1229
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:03,397
- I guess.
- You're sure or you guess?

1230
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,080
Look, I know it sounds strange but it...

1231
01:39:07,443 --> 01:39:09,820
The Princess, she's guiding me.

1232
01:39:10,404 --> 01:39:13,115
The Princess? She's guiding you?

1233
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,076
Yeah. Look, it's hard to explain,

1234
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:20,956
but it's like she's been
with me the whole time.

1235
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:22,623
Wait.

1236
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:26,462
You mean to tell me
that you've had a woman

1237
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:30,090
inside of you since the beginning?

1238
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,010
Laureline, can we just keep going, please?

1239
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:34,093
Sure.

1240
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:38,307
- Ladies first.
- Ha! Hilarious.

1241
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:46,231
Go, fill it in! Fill it in!

1242
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:48,649
Over there!

1243
01:39:49,276 --> 01:39:51,487
Captain Kris. Section 1 operational.
General?

1244
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:54,406
Proceed. A unit of K-trons will join you.

1245
01:39:55,616 --> 01:39:58,535
- That won't be necessary.
- Commander's orders, not mine.

1246
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:01,246
Copy that. Move on!

1247
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:20,766
We've been manipulated from the start.

1248
01:40:21,517 --> 01:40:22,392
What do you mean?

1249
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:25,036
We're in the middle of the Dead Zone
and we can breathe properly.

1250
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:27,397
It seems there's no sign of contamination.

1251
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:34,655
The Commander's fully aware of what's
behind this so-called absolute evil.

1252
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:37,657
What?

1253
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:45,082
Pearls.

1254
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:48,335
My name is Tsûuri. I am the Emperor's son.

1255
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:50,396
Great. How about
you introduce us to Daddy?

1256
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,755
He is expecting you.

1257
01:40:54,925 --> 01:40:56,925
Try to contact the General.
Get everyone down here.

1258
01:40:57,094 --> 01:40:58,094
I'll buy us some time.

1259
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:01,306
How about you run for backup for a change?

1260
01:41:07,104 --> 01:41:08,104
Unbelievable.

1261
01:41:35,299 --> 01:41:36,299
Follow me.

1262
01:42:17,299 --> 01:42:20,260
I'd like you to meet
my father, the Emperor.

1263
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:35,734
My name is Haban-Limaï
and this is my wife, Aloi.

1264
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:39,613
We're pleased to welcome you here.

1265
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,283
My son sensed the presence of his sister,

1266
01:42:43,367 --> 01:42:45,786
Princess Lïhio-Minaa, in you.

1267
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:51,625
It seems she chose you.

1268
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:54,585
What do you mean?

1269
01:42:58,006 --> 01:42:59,341
At the moment of passing,

1270
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:02,386
Pearls release all the energy
left in their body

1271
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:04,304
in the form of a wave,

1272
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:07,057
which travels through space and time.

1273
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,267
Sometimes it finds a benevolent host.

1274
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,603
Lïho-Minaa chose you

1275
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:14,439
to be the guardian of her soul.

1276
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:18,734
Told you.

1277
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:28,912
My daughter.

1278
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,253
I'm so happy to see you.

1279
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:38,003
Same here.

1280
01:43:39,756 --> 01:43:42,509
I mean, she is, too.

1281
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:50,100
What exactly happened
to you and your people?

1282
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:56,189
Our planet was a true paradise, on which
we lived in harmony with the elements.

1283
01:43:57,232 --> 01:44:01,987
<i>Our main activity was fishing for the
pearls who possessed phenomenal energy.</i>

1284
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:06,199
<i>They fertilized our lands,
controlled the winds and tides.</i>

1285
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:10,954
<i>Three times a year we gave to the earth,
what the sea had given us.</i>

1286
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:15,876
<i>We lived like this, in harmony,</i>
for centuries and centuries.

1287
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,546
Until the day of the apocalypse.

1288
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:25,677
<i>In the sky over our planet,</i>

1289
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:29,556
<i>other people blindly
fought out a brutal war.</i>

1290
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:32,601
<i>A war between people we didn't even know.</i>

1291
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:21,398
Missiles loaded, sir.

1292
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,527
Engage fusio-missiles.

1293
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:26,362
Do you confirm, sir?

1294
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,865
Yes, I do.

1295
01:45:30,826 --> 01:45:31,826
At your command.

1296
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:38,792
By the grace of God.

1297
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:06,027
Your daughter died during the battle.

1298
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,822
Yes, like six million others.

1299
01:46:13,827 --> 01:46:15,412
What happened after the explosion?

1300
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:18,248
We drifted in space for many years.

1301
01:46:18,582 --> 01:46:21,418
<i>Aboard a vessel we salvaged
from the wreckage,</i>

1302
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,920
<i>and that was half-destroyed.</i>

1303
01:46:30,385 --> 01:46:33,597
<i>This new environment was
quite different from ours.</i>

1304
01:46:33,847 --> 01:46:37,142
<i>And at first, we needed time
to understand it,</i>

1305
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:41,563
<i>absorbing the vast knowledge
stored in its database.</i>

1306
01:46:50,196 --> 01:46:52,782
<i>We learned languages and mathematics,</i>

1307
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:55,577
<i>physics, chemistry,</i>

1308
01:46:56,036 --> 01:46:58,997
<i>and philosophy.</i>

1309
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:02,751
<i>We learned about the millions of planets
and stars and moons</i>

1310
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,045
<i>in a universe we never knew existed.</i>

1311
01:47:08,256 --> 01:47:12,135
<i>And we learned of the countless species
who inhabit this universe.</i>

1312
01:47:13,178 --> 01:47:17,515
<i>Including humans, the ones
who destroyed our planet.</i>

1313
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:22,729
<i>Time has not dimmed
the memories of our loss,</i>

1314
01:47:24,064 --> 01:47:28,193
<i>but it has allowed us to let go
of our anger toward those responsible.</i>

1315
01:47:35,283 --> 01:47:40,664
<i>Then, one day, we were picked up
by scrap dealers traveling the galaxy.</i>

1316
01:47:41,331 --> 01:47:44,000
After a few years, their hold was full.

1317
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:51,341
<i>And they went off to sell their cargo
on a huge construction site.</i>

1318
01:47:53,927 --> 01:47:55,929
- Alpha.
- Yes.

1319
01:47:56,012 --> 01:48:00,809
<i>The City of a Thousand Planets,
where for hundreds of years,</i>

1320
01:48:01,226 --> 01:48:03,770
<i>so many species
have shared their knowledge</i>

1321
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,897
<i>and intelligence with each other.</i>

1322
01:48:07,774 --> 01:48:10,568
<i>In the shadows of Alpha,
we lived undetected,</i>

1323
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,905
<i>all the while watching and learning
from each of them.</i>

1324
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:19,953
<i>Until we acquired both the knowledge,</i>

1325
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:23,289
<i>and the materials
to build a vessel of our own.</i>

1326
01:48:36,094 --> 01:48:39,889
Our planet is gone forever,
but with what we have learned,

1327
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:44,102
we are now able to replicate
and restore our lost world.

1328
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,730
Amazing.

1329
01:48:46,813 --> 01:48:48,773
There are only two things that we lack.

1330
01:48:49,065 --> 01:48:50,358
A Mül Converter.

1331
01:48:51,735 --> 01:48:52,735
And a pearl.

1332
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:56,114
The only one Tsûuri managed to salvage.

1333
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:15,800
We are survivors,
but that makes us witnesses.

1334
01:49:16,384 --> 01:49:20,680
Witnesses of a past that humans want to
erase and forget forever.

1335
01:49:22,515 --> 01:49:26,144
We can forgive, but how can we forget?

1336
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,981
So we left you no choice
but to steal the Converter,

1337
01:49:30,607 --> 01:49:32,108
and Tsûuri hired a professional.

1338
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:33,193
Igon Siruss.

1339
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,490
But Major Valerian intervenes
and retrieves the Converter.

1340
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:40,033
Which left you with only one choice.

1341
01:49:40,116 --> 01:49:42,577
Kidnap the Commander
and force him to tell you the truth.

1342
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,037
You know our story now.

1343
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:47,373
Our destiny is in your hands.

1344
01:50:04,224 --> 01:50:07,519
Major, arrest these creatures immediately.

1345
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:10,331
They kidnapped me.
They're extremely dangerous.

1346
01:50:10,355 --> 01:50:12,398
They're Pearls from the Planet Mül.

1347
01:50:12,982 --> 01:50:14,317
I heard their ridiculous story.

1348
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:15,400
That's impossible.

1349
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:17,153
Mül was uninhabited.

1350
01:50:17,529 --> 01:50:19,906
Their existence proves
the contrary, doesn't it?

1351
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:22,450
I am telling you
there was no life on the planet.

1352
01:50:22,534 --> 01:50:25,120
The detectors were categorical.
Arrest them.

1353
01:50:25,203 --> 01:50:26,496
How can you be so sure?

1354
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:29,082
Because I read the reports and...

1355
01:50:29,165 --> 01:50:30,165
And you were on board.

1356
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:35,505
Yes. Yes, I was on board.

1357
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,467
And we had much more
serious things to worry about.

1358
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:44,514
Our cruisers were being decimated.
We lost 500,000 soldiers in a day.

1359
01:50:46,015 --> 01:50:47,225
It was complete carnage!

1360
01:50:47,934 --> 01:50:49,644
You were so preoccupied you didn't see

1361
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:52,063
the detectors indicating
signs of life on the planet.

1362
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:56,818
Or even worse. Perhaps you knew the planet
was inhabited and you sacrificed it.

1363
01:50:57,402 --> 01:50:59,404
Commander, the planet is inhabited.

1364
01:51:00,155 --> 01:51:02,448
- By primitive life forms.
- No, Commander.

1365
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:05,994
I have detected a complex language
and huge cerebral energy.

1366
01:51:06,077 --> 01:51:07,077
Major.

1367
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,540
History is on the march and neither you

1368
01:51:10,623 --> 01:51:13,543
nor a bunch of savages
are gonna stand in its way.

1369
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:19,340
So when you realized survivors from Planet
Mül were living in the heart of Alpha,

1370
01:51:19,883 --> 01:51:21,968
you decided to erase
any trace of your mistake,

1371
01:51:23,636 --> 01:51:25,305
rather than accept the consequences.

1372
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:28,641
I want no survivors.

1373
01:51:28,725 --> 01:51:32,228
And you destroyed all the evidence
that Major Samk had against you.

1374
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:46,409
What did you expect me to do?
It was the only way!

1375
01:51:52,624 --> 01:51:54,417
Admitting to an error on this scale

1376
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,437
would have exposed our
government to colossal damages

1377
01:51:56,461 --> 01:51:59,088
and compensation claims.
Our economy would never recover.

1378
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:03,426
In one instance, we would have lost
our supremacy and our leadership.

1379
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:05,220
There would have been immediate sanctions,

1380
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:08,556
and it's a pretty good bet that
we would have been banished from Alpha

1381
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,410
and denied access to the greatest
market of knowledge and intelligence.

1382
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:14,187
Is that what you would have wanted
for your fellow citizens?

1383
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:21,778
Leading them into ruin and degradation?
Forcing them to go backwards 1,000 years?

1384
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:26,991
Our Council saw fit to protect
our citizens first and foremost.

1385
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:29,494
Is that not its duty? And mine?

1386
01:52:30,203 --> 01:52:31,412
And yours?

1387
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:43,049
Or would you rather risk wrecking
our economy for the sake of a bunch of...

1388
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,132
Savages?

1389
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:47,178
You are totally under the
influence of these creatures.

1390
01:52:47,262 --> 01:52:48,972
Do not confuse the issue.

1391
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:50,306
He's the threat!

1392
01:52:51,099 --> 01:52:52,100
He's the enemy!

1393
01:52:59,315 --> 01:53:02,986
You are your own worst enemy, Commander.

1394
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:08,074
Unless you make peace with your past,
you won't have a future.

1395
01:53:15,248 --> 01:53:19,585
Major, I order you to arrest this man.

1396
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:22,797
Can we talk man-to-man for a second?

1397
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,303
Major, what are you doing?

1398
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,008
I taught him how to do that.

1399
01:53:32,765 --> 01:53:33,765
Whew!

1400
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,350
Nice talk.

1401
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:42,942
Move on, move on, move on!

1402
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:51,826
Section 1 is entering the Red Zone.

1403
01:53:51,909 --> 01:53:53,786
Prepare Section 2 for an advance also.

1404
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:55,872
Look, this was a lot of fun,

1405
01:53:55,955 --> 01:53:57,515
but we gotta report back to our people.

1406
01:53:58,082 --> 01:54:00,335
Here. That's yours.

1407
01:54:02,295 --> 01:54:03,629
We'll make this right, I promise.

1408
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:06,425
Let's get this guy out.
Whoa, what are you doing?

1409
01:54:06,716 --> 01:54:08,027
I'm giving them back the Converter.

1410
01:54:08,051 --> 01:54:09,260
No.

1411
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:10,762
The pearl is useless without this.

1412
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:11,845
Yeah, but...

1413
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:15,117
Will you give us a second, please?

1414
01:54:15,141 --> 01:54:16,184
What?

1415
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:20,355
That Converter is government property.

1416
01:54:20,438 --> 01:54:22,318
Most likely, the last one
in the whole universe.

1417
01:54:22,357 --> 01:54:24,567
Oh. So you buy into the Commander's

1418
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:27,445
"What's mine is mine
and what's yours is mine" philosophy?

1419
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:30,990
No, I buy into my oath of allegiance.
We have no authority to hand it over.

1420
01:54:31,074 --> 01:54:33,242
The Federation messed up
and must make amends.

1421
01:54:33,326 --> 01:54:35,286
Yeah, I agree, but that's not
for us to decide.

1422
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,873
- Leave it to the courts.
- They're 18 light years away, Valerian.

1423
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:40,083
Only we can make this right.

1424
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:43,211
Laureline, I'm a soldier.

1425
01:54:43,836 --> 01:54:45,004
I play by the rules.

1426
01:54:46,172 --> 01:54:47,507
It's what makes me who I am.

1427
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,180
You see?

1428
01:54:57,225 --> 01:54:58,768
That's why I don't want to marry you,

1429
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:00,686
because you really don't know
what love is.

1430
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,605
Come on, this has nothing to do with love.

1431
01:55:02,688 --> 01:55:04,273
That's where you're wrong.

1432
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:08,444
Love is more powerful
than anything else, Valerian.

1433
01:55:09,654 --> 01:55:14,158
It breaks all rules and laws,
and overpowers any army or government.

1434
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:15,951
Just look at her.

1435
01:55:17,537 --> 01:55:19,705
For one second,
put yourself in her position.

1436
01:55:20,206 --> 01:55:24,544
She lost all of her people and her child,
and she's willing to forgive.

1437
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:26,921
That's real love.

1438
01:55:27,547 --> 01:55:29,382
It's the trust you place in someone else,

1439
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:33,175
and I thought I could be
that someone else for you.

1440
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:36,848
- But clearly...
- You can.

1441
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:40,058
You are.

1442
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,229
I'd die for you.

1443
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:46,149
I'm not asking you to die for me.

1444
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:50,111
I'm asking you to trust me.

1445
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,842
All right, give it to 'em.

1446
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:20,056
Thank you.

1447
01:56:30,276 --> 01:56:32,528
We are to blame
for the loss of your planet,

1448
01:56:32,612 --> 01:56:35,364
and we'd be honored
to help you get it back.

1449
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:37,991
Here.

1450
01:56:52,298 --> 01:56:53,299
It means, "Thank you."

1451
01:57:02,308 --> 01:57:04,143
Spread out. Spread out.

1452
01:57:30,086 --> 01:57:31,366
Captain, we're locked on to you.

1453
01:57:32,004 --> 01:57:33,631
Any sign of contamination or radiation?

1454
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:35,007
Zero trace of either.

1455
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:37,802
It doesn't make any sense.

1456
01:59:10,102 --> 01:59:11,862
Didn't you say
you wanted to go to the beach?

1457
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,654
Our daughter made a good choice.

1458
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:22,573
She can rest in peace now.

1459
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,625
We must leave now.

1460
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,669
May you and your people live in peace

1461
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:37,380
wherever you may venture
in space and time.

1462
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:51,519
Explosives in place, General.
We are operational.

1463
01:59:52,395 --> 01:59:54,980
Received. Evacuate the zone.
You have four minutes.

1464
01:59:57,692 --> 01:59:58,692
Copy that.

1465
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:04,240
Father, there are hundreds of soldiers

1466
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:06,784
- all around the spaceship.
- We will be gone in a minute.

1467
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:08,762
The troops are in position,
you don't have a minute.

1468
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,722
You have no means of communication
with the outside world?

1469
02:00:10,746 --> 02:00:12,707
If we stop jamming signals,
we are defenseless.

1470
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:15,830
If you don't allow me to communicate
with them you'll be defenseless forever.

1471
02:00:22,383 --> 02:00:23,383
Just one call.

1472
02:00:26,721 --> 02:00:28,139
- Disarm the signal.
- Thank you!

1473
02:00:35,396 --> 02:00:38,065
The wall stopped moving.
Something's going on.

1474
02:00:38,983 --> 02:00:40,943
Maintain your position.
We're analyzing the data.

1475
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:44,256
I can't believe they'd do that.

1476
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,531
The General followed procedure.

1477
02:00:45,614 --> 02:00:46,866
Yeah, I hate procedure.

1478
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:50,202
<i>Captain, the data shows
that they have built some kind of vessel</i>

1479
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:51,286
<i>beyond the wall.</i>

1480
02:00:57,209 --> 02:00:58,209
Contact with the enemy.

1481
02:01:00,254 --> 02:01:01,589
Give me a physical description.

1482
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,674
Same creatures
who kidnapped the Commander.

1483
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:11,599
They showing any signs of hostility?

1484
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:16,936
Not really.

1485
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:20,399
- Are they armed?
<i>- No.</i>

1486
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:28,365
General, we're picking up a signal
from the 2005 Destiny module.

1487
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:31,118
- What?
- Sounds like Major Valerian.

1488
02:01:35,748 --> 02:01:38,018
- Patch him through.
- Major, you're on line with the General.

1489
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:39,126
- <i>Major?</i>
- Yeah.

1490
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:42,272
Major Valerian and Sergeant Laureline.
We're alive and on the inside of the wall.

1491
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:43,714
<i>Call off the assault immediately.</i>

1492
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:45,382
Major, I can't read your DNA codes.

1493
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:47,885
You know the procedure.
I have to be certain it's you.

1494
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:51,639
There is no time for dumbass procedures!
We are here with a whole species of people

1495
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:54,350
you've already wiped out once!
The Pearls of Planet Mül!

1496
02:01:54,433 --> 02:01:57,853
<i>So tell your men to back off
before you commit a second genocide!</i>

1497
02:01:57,937 --> 02:02:00,648
- That's definitely her temper.
- Planet Mül was uninhabited.

1498
02:02:00,731 --> 02:02:02,858
Come on. You know that's not true.

1499
02:02:02,942 --> 02:02:04,902
The Commander was there.
He gave the orders.

1500
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:08,239
And then he organized this whole procedure
to eliminate any survivors,

1501
02:02:08,948 --> 02:02:10,228
the living proof of his mistake.

1502
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,552
- Stop the procedure.
- Maybe that would explain

1503
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:14,745
why the Commander was
interrogating that creature.

1504
02:02:20,626 --> 02:02:21,666
Is the Commander with you?

1505
02:02:26,215 --> 02:02:28,217
Come on! Wakey, wakey.

1506
02:02:29,969 --> 02:02:31,428
- You've got a call.
- What?

1507
02:02:33,681 --> 02:02:35,975
Let's go, my friend. Time to confess.

1508
02:02:37,393 --> 02:02:38,393
Hello?

1509
02:02:38,435 --> 02:02:41,105
No DNA code, but voice waves match.

1510
02:02:41,772 --> 02:02:44,024
This is General Okto-Bar.
Do you read me, Commander?

1511
02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:46,944
What's going on?

1512
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:49,947
<i>We are ready to activate
the explosive device</i>

1513
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:52,616
in accordance with the orders you gave.

1514
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:55,786
Do you confirm those orders,

1515
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,330
or do you have anything to tell me,

1516
02:02:58,873 --> 02:03:01,667
<i>that would enable me
to suspend the assault?</i>

1517
02:03:06,255 --> 02:03:07,298
I am a soldier.

1518
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:14,597
A soldier will always choose
death over humiliation.

1519
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:20,853
Annihilate them all.

1520
02:03:43,626 --> 02:03:46,045
- What the hell are you doing?
- I didn't give the orders!

1521
02:03:46,378 --> 02:03:48,047
Captain, cease fire immediately!

1522
02:03:48,339 --> 02:03:50,966
It's not us, it's the K-trons.
They're shooting at us!

1523
02:03:52,927 --> 02:03:53,927
Come on, you...

1524
02:03:58,057 --> 02:04:00,297
I'm gonna go give Tsûuri some backup.
Keep an eye on him.

1525
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:03,228
Oh, he's not going anywhere.

1526
02:04:06,148 --> 02:04:07,733
Get down! Take cover!

1527
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,299
Alex, load me up with all you've got!

1528
02:04:12,363 --> 02:04:13,363
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Thanks.

1529
02:04:30,673 --> 02:04:33,550
- Neza, stop this countdown now!
- Yes, sir!

1530
02:04:56,407 --> 02:04:57,533
Hurry, Neza!

1531
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,604
Hurry, Neza!

1532
02:05:42,411 --> 02:05:44,872
- How much time left?
- Ten seconds!

1533
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:50,002
Hurry!

1534
02:06:24,036 --> 02:06:25,036
Neza.

1535
02:06:33,545 --> 02:06:34,630
Check for survivors.

1536
02:07:00,906 --> 02:07:02,074
Captain, status report?

1537
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:04,243
Nothing's left. Just a gaping hole.

1538
02:07:05,035 --> 02:07:07,955
They left with their spaceship.
Everything's vanished.

1539
02:07:08,038 --> 02:07:10,499
And our agents? Valerian and Laureline?

1540
02:07:10,582 --> 02:07:12,459
- No, nothing.
<i>- And the Commander?</i>

1541
02:07:12,543 --> 02:07:13,627
Is anyone there?

1542
02:07:14,086 --> 02:07:15,504
Wait, I hear something.

1543
02:07:20,134 --> 02:07:21,134
There's a body!

1544
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:24,680
Get me down from here, you children!

1545
02:07:26,557 --> 02:07:27,558
It's the Commander.

1546
02:07:28,392 --> 02:07:29,226
Is he alive?

1547
02:07:29,309 --> 02:07:31,603
Affirmative. Alive and kicking!

1548
02:07:31,687 --> 02:07:32,687
Good.

1549
02:07:36,024 --> 02:07:37,024
Arrest him.

1550
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,363
Help!

1551
02:07:59,923 --> 02:08:01,717
Do you have
any idea where they left us?

1552
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,052
We're two hours away
from vacation.

1553
02:08:04,136 --> 02:08:05,971
I fired the distress beacons.

1554
02:08:06,054 --> 02:08:08,056
- Two hours?
- Yeah, I know.

1555
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:10,475
- Two hours alone with me, what a drag.
- Hmm.

1556
02:08:11,143 --> 02:08:13,103
No kidding. It's basically an eternity.

1557
02:08:14,605 --> 02:08:15,605
Hey.

1558
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:20,485
Now that our mission's over
maybe we can finish our conversation.

1559
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:21,820
What conversation?

1560
02:08:21,904 --> 02:08:23,572
We were talking about the future.

1561
02:08:24,406 --> 02:08:26,825
Really? And what does the future hold?

1562
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:32,830
You.

1563
02:08:33,582 --> 02:08:34,582
Me.

1564
02:08:36,835 --> 02:08:37,835
Us.

1565
02:08:42,257 --> 02:08:43,258
Happy birthday.

1566
02:08:47,179 --> 02:08:48,597
Thank you, Valerian.

1567
02:08:50,098 --> 02:08:51,558
That is so romantic.

1568
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:53,996
Did you really think of this yourself?

1569
02:08:54,061 --> 02:08:56,897
Yeah. You mean so much to me, you know?

1570
02:08:58,649 --> 02:08:59,649
Laureline...

1571
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,946
will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

1572
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:08,033
For better or worse?

1573
02:09:09,243 --> 02:09:11,662
Uh, worse? Is that negotiable?

1574
02:09:11,954 --> 02:09:12,954
No.

1575
02:09:14,498 --> 02:09:15,498
All right, then.

1576
02:09:27,302 --> 02:09:29,763
Is that a yes?

1577
02:09:29,846 --> 02:09:31,098
It's a maybe.

1578
02:09:32,933 --> 02:09:35,018
I'm confused. Is this how love works?

1579
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:37,521
No, this is how I work.

1580
02:09:38,146 --> 02:09:40,691
You spent a day in a woman's body,
did you not learn anything?

1581
02:09:41,316 --> 02:09:42,316
Yeah.

1582
02:09:44,236 --> 02:09:45,320
I did learn something.

1583
02:09:46,363 --> 02:09:47,363
What?

1584
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:50,951
