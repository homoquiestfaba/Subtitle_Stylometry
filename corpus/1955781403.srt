I've given you months.

00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:09,118
So, you don't want to die?

772
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:19,590
It was multiple choice,
and you said you wanted to die.

773
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,129
Was that a lie?

774
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,266

-Could I go there?
-Look, the problem is,

781
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,731
is the Army doesn't have record
of you participating

782
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:03,566
in this incident
that caused your TBI,

783
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,535
and so I can't get you
service-connected.

784
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,438
-What, there's no record?
-You didn't report an injury

785
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,273
at the time of the incident.

786
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,408
Doster was dead.

787
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:14,143
I dragged him out.

788
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,445
They're denying benefits

789
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,147
until we prove that you
were in the Humvee.

790
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:21,517
We need to go back to your COs
and get written testimony.

791
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,719
What, they didn't believe
I was there?

792
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:26,293
We just need to go back
and get proof.

795
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:38,401
on the planet?
Well, I'll tell you.

796
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,869
It's because,
with a click of a finger,

797
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:43,272
I can order 20 pounds of beef
and have it

798
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:45,241
delivered to my door
in 24 hours.

799
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:46,576
The terrorists cannot do that,

800
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:49,579
and that is why
they will never win.

801
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,247
(sighing):
So...

802
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:53,182
sounds like you got
some bad paper.

803
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,517
Yes, sir.

804
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:56,786
I'm glad that you're
seeking treatment,

805
00:50:56,786 --> 00:51:00,356
because we got 22 veterans
a day killing themselves.

806
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:01,858
And I don't get it.

807
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,459
Warriors get stressed.

808
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,727
We know this.

809
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:09,165
But this obsession
to end your own life?

810
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,200
I can't wrap my head around it.

811
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,770
We don't want you to be
a statistic, though, do we?

812
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,339
No, sir.

813
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,208
You signed up during wartime.

814
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,244
You got yourself a war.

815
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,746
But they don't believe
that I was there, sir.

816
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:25,648
They're as wrong as two boys
fucking in church.

817
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:28,318
Give me that file.
Let me see what you got.

818
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:30,786
(sighs)

819
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:33,623
I just need a statement saying
that I was driving the rig

820
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,292
when Doster was hit, sir.

821
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:37,860
American Samoa?

822
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,495
Where is that?

823
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:41,197
South Pacific, sir.

824
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:42,732
It's a territory.

825
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,368
So, does that make you a...

826
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,936
a citizen or...?

827
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:48,304
How's that work?

828
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,506
I was able to apply
for citizenship

829
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:53,847
after basic training, sir.

830
00:51:57,847 --> 00:52:00,650
I'm going for the New Yorks.
(sighs)

831
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,652
Fuck it, you know?

832
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:06,769
Yeah. Boom, boom, boom.

833
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,940
Why are you braking? Why?!

834
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,444
(tires squealing)

835
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:29,712
(tires squeak)

836
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:32,615
You'd have done great
in Iraq, babe.

837
00:52:32,615 --> 00:52:35,952
We never slowed down.
We just ran 'em over.

838
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,454
Did you drive?

839
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:41,891
I rode shotgun
and looked for the IEDs.

840
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:45,428
They'd hide 'em
in trash like that, or...

841
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:46,696
once they got smarter,

842
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,998
they just started
cementing 'em in curbs.

843
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:52,735
So, when you see trash
on the road here...?

844
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:54,806
I look.

845
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:01,410
That's the first real thing
you've told me about the war.

846
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,579
I feel so much better now.

847
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,282
SASKIA:
Hey, don't be an asshole.

848
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:09,419
Two Army Commendation Medals.

849
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:12,555
An Army Achievement Medal.

850
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:14,857
Impressive.

851
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:17,962
You never told me about those.

852
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:22,474
Is there a specific incident
that troubles you?

853
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,478
Maybe a name?

854
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,647
Emory.

855
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,884
What happened with Emory?

856
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,021
I dropped him.

857
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,958
I was carrying him.

858
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:49,025
I dropped him.

859
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:53,337
And they had to cut
two inches of his brain out.

860
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:03,406
And then Doster happened.

861
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,881
What happened to Doster?

862
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:14,850
Why don't you tell us
our options?

863
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,887
There is no cure for trauma,

864
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,088
but we can learn to manage it.

865
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:22,491
Long-term care
has the best results,

866
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,393
but every facility
is different.

867
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:26,729
Some are four weeks.
Some are nine months.

868
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,932
What works for one person
may not work for another.

869
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:33,903
But all these places are
equally difficult to get into,

870
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,707
so the smartest thing to do
would be to apply everywhere

871
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,542
and cross our fingers.

872
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,544
Cross our fingers?

873
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:44,380
There are hundreds of thousands
of men and women seeking help.

874
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,081
SASKIA:
But he's a veteran.

875
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,283
That's what I mean.

876
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,688
There are hundreds of thousands
of veterans seeking help.

877
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:56,092
Will we get priority
to places closest to us?

878
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,827
I'm afraid not.

879
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,496
What do we do in the meantime?

880
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,866
What if I had a job?

881
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:06,702
-I think a job would help.
-A job is good.

882
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:08,637
Your benefits
won't be kicking in

883
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:10,139
for another couple
of months, so...

884
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:11,974
Another couple months?

885
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:15,778
Wow. I mean, what the fuck
is going on around here?

886
00:55:15,778 --> 00:55:19,415
-(papers rustling)
-(sighs)

887
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:23,853
I have a position
at a heavy-ordnance range.

888
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,021
Okay, he wants to kill himself,

889
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,726
and you want him to work
at a gun range?

890
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:32,996
It's a tank range.

891
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:36,432
You think I could kill myself
with a tank?

892
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:37,000
Maybe.

893
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,869
Well, it would take
some serious planning.

894
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,142
Well, you're pretty
fucking resourceful.

895
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,576
(Saskia chuckles)

896
00:55:47,576 --> 00:55:49,412
I used to be good at that.

897
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,147
At what?

898
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,616
Making you laugh.

899
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,185

-fucking thing on all morning.
-Yeah, man, let's go.

1158

It is physically impossible
to put that on by yourself.

He didn't say shit,
either, man,

1185
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,957
so we had no idea, you know?

1186

1187
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,564
So you come down here
to save me?

1188
01:13:56,564 --> 01:13:58,867
No, man.

1189
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,203
Came down to see you.

1190
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:04,776

1197
01:14:26,227 --> 01:14:27,595
One night, I woke up,

1198
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:29,063
I had my hands around her neck.

1199
01:14:29,063 --> 01:14:31,633

Hey, let me ask you--
what's with all this trash?

1211
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:58,563
Oh, you still looking
for the bomb, huh?

1212
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,233
Why didn't you look me up
sooner, dude?

1213
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:07,705
I should have.

1214
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:12,108
I dropped my kid last night.

1215
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:17,045
My baby boy, man-- I...
was supposed to hold him.

1216
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,881
Saskia gave him to me.
I fell asleep like a shitbag.

1217
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:21,184
Fell right off.

1218
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:27,188
So, you know, I dropped him,
started thinking about you.

1219
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:29,357
He's gonna be all right,
you know, but...

1220
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:30,959
I dropped you, and...

1221
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,932
What, and I'm not all right?
Hmm?

1222
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:40,669
Why don't you help me piss?

1223
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:44,758
(grunting)

1224
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:06,228
That fall took out
my left side.

1225
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:09,799
Know that, dude?

1226
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:15,236
Wasn't the sniper round
they took out of my head or...

1227
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:17,672
that two inches
they cut out of my brain.

1228
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:19,011
It was you fucking dropping me.

1229
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:25,680
Is that what you think, dude?

1230
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,684
(laughing): That the shit
you told yourself?

1231
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:32,320
You didn't drop me
off a fucking building, dude.

1232
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,890
Well, you were alive,
and then you weren't.

1233
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,992
I'm alive now, motherfucker.

1234
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:40,030
(grunting)

1235
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,332
Hey, you need another one,
buddy?

1236
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:47,835
Hell yeah, I need another one.
Fuck you think?

1237
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,337
You don't think
I need another one?

1238
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:50,674
I got you.

1239
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,376
All right.

1240
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:57,912
They're fucked up, dude.

1241
01:16:57,912 --> 01:17:01,249
Hey, you see
where the shot came from?

1242
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,818
Someone did.

1243
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:05,887
Solo? Solo did.

1244
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,423
Yeah, you couldn't get
the bastards?

1245
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:11,759
No, I was
carrying you down, man.

1246
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:13,428
You were.

1247
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,296
Fuck, I should have
went after him.

1248
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:19,167
Me and you were the tallest
ones on that rooftop, dude.

1249
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,269
They go for the tall ones.

1250
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,837
Yep.

1251
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:23,005
You know, I think about that.

1252
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,406
What if I was short?

1253
01:17:25,406 --> 01:17:28,209
I wonder if I'd still
