FERlA OF PHENOMENA:
Man without members - bearded Woman

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,708
Oh Sammy, the heart breaks me.

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,708
We are the whole circus that you need boy.

6
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,875
But they have atracciónes!

10
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:08,083
Good boys, it is hour of consguirme an appointment
with the bearded woman. Who is with me?

11
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:22,833
A lot of wealth comes him/her... Feel and I count him/her everything
on their destination... a lot of wealth comes him/her...

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,958
Ladies and gentlemen enter to the best show
of phenomena of the whole town.

13
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,542
Everything is here inside.
Alone he/she has to enter to see.

14
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,708
We only go ladies and gentlemen
enter and admire everything.

15
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:47,917
Ladies and gentlemen enter, enter!
We have the best show in the town.

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,750
Here they come to a woman that he loves to eat.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,333

18
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,833

00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,542
Now, they come here.

20
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,417
The colored man.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,625
He/she can see their trips for the world in each
inch of their body, from the head until the feet.

22
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,500
And now... ladies and gentlemen...

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,167
Acercense!

24
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,833
A perversion of the nature.

25
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:42,458
A man... if I can call this way it...
to who has given him/her the back until God.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,667
I present them...

27
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,542
The man without members!

28
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,083
Look that!

29
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,917
How sad... Look at it...

30
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,792
Move children.

31
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,375
You are I magnify.

32
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,833
Hey, take away from the one.
- What does it pass with you?

33
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,083
It is well.

34
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,833
Not it passes anything, it is my blame.

35
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,125
Perhaps do come closer too much, he/she is not this way friend?

36
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,458
Have a good one late.

37
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:22,708
God willing you control yourself for the next one
show, stupid invalid.

38
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,250
Very beautiful, Will.

39
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:40,708
It seems that you changed to seem on
to make one of those pretty shows.

40
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,375
What are you saying?
- Seriously you don't know anything?

41
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,708
That was Méndez.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,750
You come from spitting to the owner of the Circus Butterfly.

43
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,542
Butterfly... butterfly...

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,333
You kill me Will.

45
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,667
I am hungry. I will get sweet cotton.

46
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:14,750
A man... if he/she can call this way it...
to who has given him/her the back until God.

47
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,417
The man without members!

48
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,333
Does it grant me this dance?

49
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,833
Thank you.
Poppy.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,417
Can you bring me mimaleta?
It is so heavy...

51
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,792
It is easier for you for that you are so strong...

52
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,292
Be a dead in the van!

53
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,792
What?

54
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:29,250
Good...
Look at this, it is wonderful.

55
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,583
They come and warm a little next to the fire, man.

56
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,833
I am Sammy. Your how you call yourself?
- I am Will.

57
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,667
Where are your arms and your legs?
- Sammy!

58
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,667
What?
Will part of our circus be now?

59
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,417
He/she can that yes.

60
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,458
He/she waits a minúto...
Not we have a secondary amusement here.

61
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,792
What does he/she mean? All the circuses have one.

62
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,083
People come from all parts to see us.

63
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,833
And does reason come, Will?

64
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,125
But their show can be different.
- No!

65
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,625
Not there is anything inspiring in
to exhibit perfect phenomena.

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,958
You See Will. We are happier here and your you can yourself
to be the time that you want.

67
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,167
But I won't direct a different show.

68
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,708
And now. The best contorosión sample
human that the world has never seen...

69
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:57,125
It is my pleasure you introduce to Anna... the queen of the air.

70
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,375
And the strongest man that you/they have seen...

71
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,583
The teacher of the trapeze flyer
and the oldest artist in the air...

72
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,792
POPPY!

73
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,875
We see them in the lands of the fair.
Alone we are two days.

74
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,667
Visit one another! The Circus Butterfly!
Alone we are two days!

75
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:20,167
Hello, how's it going? My son, wanted to greet
to the strongest man in the town.

76
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,667
Good, for sure your dad is stronger
but I come in second place.

77
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,375
Are you also in the show, Mister?

78
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,583
No, not exactly.

79
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,958
It will be better than we already leave. Thank you.
- Not there is that.

80
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,542
Did you dress that, dad?

81
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,542
Some day I will be the strongest man in the world.

82
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:58,542
I will be as that man and all that I want will rise.
- He/she is this way son, your you can make all that that your you want.

83
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,458
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children and girls.

84
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,792
What this world needs
it is a small marvel.

85
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,375
Mom, tickets looks!

86
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,958
Don't you find splendid?

87
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,542
The way in lacual moves...

88
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:31,500
full with vigor, color and grace...

89
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,542
They are surprising.

90
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,667
But your...

91
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,792
Damned from your birth.

92
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,167
A man, if he/she can call this way it.

93
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,708
To the one who until God him dió the back.
- Give birth to!

94
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,125
Reason that says?

95
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,958
Because your you believe it.

96
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,875
But if you could see...

97
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,958
the beauty that can arise of the ashes...

98
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,167
I say that they allowed to leave before time.

99
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:32,292
Good luck there out. Now it is your problem.
To my you no longer serve me as anything. Release you!

100
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,583
You are quite good for my, doll face.
Here you have.

101
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,667
But they are different to my.

102
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,792
If, your you have an advantage.

103
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:58,417
While bigger it is the fight,
bigger it will be the victory.

104
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,417
It is exactly there... in the bud, do you see?

105
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,917
It will be well.

106
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,167
You won't recognize it when it leaves.

107
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,958
Hey George, Poppy...

108
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,667
I need help to cross!

109
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,292
Can Algiuen help me?

110
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,417
Hey George!

111
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,458
Can you help me?

112
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,583
To where does Hey, go?

113
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,667
What does it pass with you?

114
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,958
Will he/she leave me here?

115
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,917
I believe that you can manage it.
- What?

116
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,167
I suppose that magically
will I get up, hey?

117
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,792
Hey George, Poppy, how is the water?
It is hour of swiming...

118
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,458
Look!

119
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,167
Hey Will, will you come?

120
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,458
Will?

121
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,250
Hey, I believe that Will fell to the water!

122
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,458
I can swim!

123
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,458
Fleets as a barrel of beer!

124
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,292
Come here, your!

125
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,458
How did you make that?

126
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,333
Their eyes rot to be witness...

127
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,875
this beautiful one late...

128
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,458
of the most valiant soul...

129
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,958
while it challenges to the death,
ascending to an altitude of 50 feet

130
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,000
And falling...

131
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,083
In this tub of water.

132
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,792
We will see what has to say.

133
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,667
Thank you.

134
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,792
Wow, how did that make, Mister?

135
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,875
Was he/she afraid? It was very high...

136
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,875
Sky, the one can make any thing.

137
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,792
Did it hurt him/her when you dió against the water?

138
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,292
There he/she left, Sammy.

139
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,917
