1
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,713
(pager beeping)

2
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,352
- How's my mother doing?
- Not so good today.

3
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:49,612
(woman on PA)

4
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,877
Why weren't you in here before?

5
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,296
- (man) The doctor said...
- Screw the doctor.

6
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,549
Mom.

7
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:14,137
- You should save your strength.
- Jack, if I go...

8
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,472
Mom, you're not going to go.

9
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:19,892
If I go, I want you
to make me a promise.

10
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,399
- Say, "I promise."
- I promise.

11
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,067
That you'll always love me.

12
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,070
Of course, Mom.

13
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:33,447
And you'll never get married.

14
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:37,410
Mom, no, no.

15
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:39,787
I can't promise that.

16
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:44,292
No girl could love you like I did, Jack.
You'll be unhappy. Don't do it.

17
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,170
- Mom, don't say that.
- (knuckles crack)

18
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,922
Promise me, Jack. Never.

19
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:52,592
Mom, that's a huge thing to ask.

20
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:55,595
Mom... Mom!

21
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,930
Mom! Mom!

22
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:02,268
Mom, come back!
I promise I won't get married!

23
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,688
(musical medley plays)

24
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:14,025
(Jack) That's Mrs. Lupo
with the cable installer.

25
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:17,820
I'm Jack Singer, and I was hired
by Mrs. Lupo's paranoid husband,

26
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:20,156
who turned out
not to be so paranoid.

27
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,034
I feel for the guy. I really do.

28
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,369
I feel for all these people,
men and women,

29
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:28,831
the cheaters and cheated on,
sneaking around hotel lobbies

30
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:30,916
looking over their shoulders.

31
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,588
I'm sorry, but they only confirm what
my crazy mother said about marriage:

32
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,257
That it's a disaster waiting to happen.

33
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:40,259
Although my job can get depressing,

34
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,094
at least it's not dangerous,

35
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,430
and I do hear some great stories.

36
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,933
My wife is having an affair
with Mike Tyson.

37
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,688
"Mike Tyson" Mike Tyson?

38
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,774
Yeah.

39
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:59,111
That's her. That's Millie.

40
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,992
Well, she's a beautiful girl.

41
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:09,205
- When I think of the two of 'em!
- All right. Calm down. Calm down.

42
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's just think this through.

43
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,336
Now, my first question, obviously:

44
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,630
- You've seen them together?
- What?

45
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:21,175
You've seen them together?
Your wife and Mr. Tyson?

46
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,136
- You don't believe me either!
- Of course I believe you.

47
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:27,139
- I just need a place to start.
- Everybody thinks I'm nuts!

48
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:29,475
The guys at the plant. Everybody.

49
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:33,020
They tell me she's sneaking with
Freddy Ramirez at the Sunrise Motel,

50
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,147
but I know it's the champ.

51
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,690
She wouldn't cheat with a piece of shit

52
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:39,276
like Freddy Ramirez,
beautiful girl like that.

53
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,489
I'm sure you're right.
Don't get me wrong, OK?

54
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,826
But, hey, for openers, let's say
I follow this Ramirez around...

55
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,161
Make sure it's not him.

56
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,372
- You're all the same.
- Mr. Tomashefsky.

57
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,583
- Nobody believes me.
- Don't just take off.

58
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:59,547
I'm sure it's hard to talk about,
but I'm a good listener!

59
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,006
Mr. Tomashefsky!

60
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,260
- Leave me alone!
- Hi, Bob.

61
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,972
(Jack) It's not glamorous work,
that's the bottom line.

62
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,640
So why am I
telling you all of this?

63
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,977
Because I do have
an amazing story to tell

64
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:16,021
about me and my girlfriend,
Betsy Nolan.

65
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,567
She teaches second grade
at the Skelton School in Manhattan,

66
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,569
and she's the love of my life.

67
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,197
- I just haven't been able to marry her.
- Milton moved out?

68
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,199
(woman) Thursday.

69
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,077
I had ordered Chinese,
and he says, "Chinese again?"

70
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,038
Then he comes out
with his suitcase already packed!

71
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:37,001
I know David's been very quiet.
I thought that something was wrong.

72
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:41,088
Listen, Judy, if there's
anything that I can do...

73
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:44,091
Thanks. I thought it was important
that you know.

74
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,426
I'm so sorry.

75
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,263
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

76
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,307
- (Betsy) See you tomorrow, OK?
- OK.

77
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,476
- Bye.
- Come on, sweetie.

78
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:57,188
- (Jack) I was in the neighborhood.
- What a nice surprise.

79
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:02,735
Oh. Forgot about that.
Tough day, huh?

80
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:06,530
It's so awful. And besides David,
they have a two-year old.

81
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,782
- That's my point.
- About what?

82
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,576
People get married, and then they do

83
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:13,078
the most hideous,
unbelievable things to each other.

84
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,957
Not all people. Come on, Jack.
That's your mother talking.

85
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:22,379
- I dreamt about her again last night.
- Was she naked again?

86
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:25,174
Hey, I only had one dream
where she was naked.

87
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,468
- She was vacuuming.
- Still...

88
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,011
It wasn't sexual.

89
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,680
- It was about cleanliness.
- (Betsy laughs)

90
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,058
(Jack) She's so great.
When I play poker,

91
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,186
she helps with the food,
and she's funny with the guys.

92
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:42,399
Now, the ones with those pretty crowns,
they're called kings?

93
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,610
Kidding!

94
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:46,612
- Is she the best?
- She's the best.

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,739
Now shut up already. Let's play.

96
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:50,574
(Jack) And sometimes,
if she's off from school,

97
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,952
she'll go out with me on a tail job.

98
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:57,122
OK, Rolexes, 35 dollars.
Downtown, they're 45.

99
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,874
Bada-bing, bada-bang.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,961
- There he is.
- That's him?

101
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:05,673
- (woman, indistinct)
- That fat pig? And he has four kids?

102
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,133
Just a little louder.
They might not have heard you.

103
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,886
- I'm hungry. How about you?
- (Jack) Wait a beat.

104
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,014
Now.

105
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:21,522
This is very hard being inconspicuous.

106
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,818
It's a gift. Your problem is you're much
too beautiful for this kind of work.

107
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:29,196
Me? I'm everyman.

108
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,656
Here we go.

109
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,826
Oh, God.

110
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,249
Ugh! This is so depressing.

111
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,002
But it doesn't mean that we'd
wind up like this, Jack, it doesn't.

112
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,503
No. It doesn't.

113
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,842
Jack, stop with your mother already.

114
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,969
I try, but I can't.

115
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,763
So why don't you go see a shrink?

116
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:59,643
It's too much money,
and I prefer to work it out myself.

117
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,190
- As long as you wait for me.
- Of course I'll wait for you.

118
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,445
Sometimes I'm afraid to go to sleep.

119
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,197
Maybe you won't dream about her.

120
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:18,245
- Maybe I'll just read.
- Come here, you big lug.

121
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,385
(Jack) A year later,
things with Betsy and me...

122
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:37,389
Well, they just started
to get very shaky.

123
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,393
(Betsy on machine) I feel as if
I might be coming down with something.

124
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,521
She was finding excuses
not to come over,

125
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:47,441
and when she did,
things weren't the same.

126
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:50,194
I'm losing her.

127
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,530
Speaking of losing, you owe me 50
from the Notre Dame game.

128
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:57,284
- Sally, I love her.
- Love her or not, that's a different...

129
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,495
Sally. Villanova-Georgetown.

130
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:00,954
You want Georgetown,
you gotta give three.

131
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:04,583
- Uptown, it's two and a half.
- Cha Cha, do me a favor. Bet uptown.

132
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,710
Jack, if you love her, then marry her.

133
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:10,255
It's not the end of the world.
The decline, yes, but not the end.

134
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,841
- Thanks very much.
- Ask anybody.

135
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:17,221
- She's different.
- I repeat... Ask anybody.

136
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,225
(ltalian music plays)

137
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,862
- This isn't good, Jack.
- Order something else.

138
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,198
I'm talking about us.

139
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:42,705
- We're just going through a down phase.
- No, it's bigger than that.

140
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:47,459
I feel like I'm counting on something
that may never happen.

141
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,963
Jack, we have to go to the next step.

142
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,634
Is this, like, an ultimatum?

143
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,138
No, I'm just telling you
that I won't be a girlfriend forever.

144
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:02,891
There's too much that I want.
I want kids and a family.

145
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:06,311
Jack, I've got to know
what the deal is with us.

146
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:10,107
- I'm in love with you.
- And I'm in love with you.

147
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:13,360
But I need a commitment.
Life's too short.

148
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,572
I want to be married.

149
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,539
(thunder cracks)

150
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,334
(Betsy) Light's green.

151
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,044
(Jack) Let's get married tomorrow.

152
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,257
Let's just do it... get on a plane,
go to Vegas and do it.

153
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:37,217
- Now.
- (cars honking)

154
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:41,555
- You're serious?
- I must be. My legs are paralyzed.

155
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,599
Oh, sweetie!

156
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:45,684
(Jack) The die was cast.

157
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:49,188
If I had just said "city hall,"
the story would end here,

158
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:53,108
but I didn't, and Betsy and I
took our fateful trip to Vegas.

159
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,234
(♪ Bruce Springsteen: Viva! Las Vegas)

160
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,168
(car honks)

161
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,739
(Jack) The man in the limo
was Tommy Korman, the gambler,

162
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,450
and he was about
to enter my life.

163
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,372
Yep. Home, sweet home.

164
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,377
How you doin'?

165
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:56,046
(Elvises chattering)

166
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,425
I was with two fine-looking
women last night.

167
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:02,886
One was so fine.
She reminded me of Debra Paget.

168
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,138
She made Debra Paget
look like a boy.

169
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,723
What?

170
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,394
Look at all these Elvises here.
It looks like a friggin' zoo.

171
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,771
- It's a freakin' zoo.
- (man) Mr. Korman!

172
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:17,943
Mr. Korman, Mr. Sandwich,
Buddy Walker. Welcome to Bally's.

173
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:21,572
I've replaced Tony Carmelo.
I didn't know if you'd heard.

174
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:24,908
It escaped my attention.

175
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,702
I wondered if I could
have a word with you.

176
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:28,579
It's all right.

177
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:30,956
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.

178
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:36,295
- Tommy, we have a small problem.
- Oh, yeah?

179
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,882
Penthouse A is not available, but...

180
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:42,009
- Oh?
- (Buddy groans)

181
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:45,220
Buddy? I would like Penthouse A,

182
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,640
where I've stayed for 15 years,
made up for me now.

183
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:49,850
(machines chiming)

184
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,978
The president of Brazil is in there.

185
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,648
I don't care if Ming the Friggin'
Merciless is in there. Get him out.

186
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:57,816
OK?

187
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,861
- Will do.
- Good.

188
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:05,741
Now I shake your hand.
That's great, Buddy.

189
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,294
(woman on PA) Welcome to McCarran
Field, Las Vegas, Nevada...

190
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,380
the family fun capital of America.

191
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,133
- Good luck.
- We just got here!

192
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,637
Oh, my God!

193
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,764
(swimmers chattering)

194
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:36,355
Oof! This is some heat.
It's got to be 110, easy.

195
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,065
No, but it's dry.

196
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,691
That's what these schmucks say.

197
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,318
- "150, but it's dry."
- Yeah.

198
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:43,570
So hot you friggin' can't see straight.

199
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,281
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would you like chaises?

200
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:47,950
- What?
- Chaises.

201
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,285
- Chaises?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:53,789
- What's your name?
- Gary, sir.

203
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:57,292
Well, "Gary sir," do you understand
that there's no more ozone layer left?

204
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,378
That you could get arrested
for friggin' manslaughter,

205
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,672
lettin' people lay out here?

206
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,757
- You find that funny?
- No, sir.

207
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,717
(woman on PA) May I have
your attention...

208
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,344
Here. Remember that, all right?

209
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,180
(Gary) Thank you, sir.

210
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:12,557
(exhales deeply)

211
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:16,812
- Remember Donna and her sunbaths?
- Yeah. Who knew back then?

212
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,856
Yeah. Who knew?

213
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:30,325
Vegas. Miami. Wherever.

214
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:34,287
She'd lay out there all day
with them Sidney Sheldon books...

215
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:36,373
and her coconut oil.

216
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,087
Doctor said they never saw skin
like that, like a saddlebag.

217
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,722
- We got a game tonight?
- No. Not yet.

218
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,350
- It's OK.
- Tommy...

219
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,896
- She was a great girl, Donna.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,107
I should've got her out of the sun.

221
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,778
Twelve bucks!
No air-conditioning either.

222
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:09,656
- I ain't going to tip him.
- Hound dog can't even speak English.

223
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,284
(Betsy and Jack chuckling)

224
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,619
I gotta get a suit like that.

225
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,043
- That was some fighter.
- Yeah, that was some fighter.

226
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,129
He knocked down Holmes twice.

227
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:26,923
Twice. Hey, Tommy,
let's go say "hi," no?

228
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,593
- Go ahead.
- Hey, champ, how you doing?

229
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,470
- You look great. How you doing?
- Real good.

230
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,388
What about that Holmes fight
the other day? What happened?

231
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,682
When Holmes went...
What'd he do?

232
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,142
Wham.

233
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,498
What, what, what?

234
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,709
Look over there.

235
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,798
- It's unbelievable.
- Everything.

236
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:11,176
Her legs. It's Donna.

237
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,181
Look at all those Indian Elvises.

238
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,683
Yeah, they loved
his movie Blue Calcutta.

239
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,268
Come here.

240
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:23,271
This is unbelievable.

241
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,606
You're unbelievable.

242
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:27,776
I want to get you in that room,
tear the bedspread off...

243
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:30,237
Yoo-hoo! Can I get a room?

244
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,448
This is God
giving me a second chance.

245
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,158
There is no doubt about it.

246
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,286
- What if they're married?
- Look at them.

247
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:41,039
There's no way they're married.

248
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,550
- (Betsy) Yikes.
- (both chuckle)

249
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:58,056
Oh, my God. Jack!

250
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:01,017
- We can't afford this!
- I got a deal through Sally Molars.

251
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,521
120 bucks a night.
Is this great or what?

252
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,459
(Betsy sighs)

253
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:36,303
What'd you think of that mirror?

254
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,097
I liked it.

255
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:43,185
I never realized
I had such a beautiful, round behind.

256
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,646
Or was that you?

257
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,440
That might've been me.

258
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:56,281
It's 2:30 already.

259
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:04,915
Well, maybe we should get some lunch,
do a little gambling...

260
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,084
...and then get...

261
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:13,381
I'm very happy.
I want you to know that.

262
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,051
And I love you so, so much.

263
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,637
Oh, I'm glad.

264
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,057
- (water running)
- (slider opens)

265
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:32,025
Yeah. Hi. This is Jack Singer
in the Ali Baba Suite.

266
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:35,487
Yeah, you can take the "Do Not Disturb"
off my phone now. Thanks.

267
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:58,677
(woman on PA) May I have your attention,
please. Bally's is happy to introduce...

268
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,554
There's a poker game
for new guests, 4:00 to 6:00.

269
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:05,225
That could be fun.
You could get a swim. I play.

270
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,936
- And then we're off.
- Where should we go?

271
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,690
They have all these chapels.
We'll just pick the most outrageous one.

272
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,401
Your hand is wet.

273
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:17,070
I'm nervous, but I'm OK.

274
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:19,322
I want to do this.

275
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:23,201
- Maybe we should go now.
- In this heat? It's 108 degrees.

276
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,539
Come on. No, no, no, we waited
this long, we should do it right.

277
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,083
Wait till the sun sets.
Get dressed up.

278
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:34,379
- Jack, please.
- It's not just another excuse.

279
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:36,631
Hey.

280
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:40,468
- We're here to get married.
- And to be together.

281
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,220
Absolutely.

282
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,889
So why do you have to play poker?

283
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:47,225
Let's just hang out together.

284
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,728
It'll relax me.
It's a fast game with some yokels.

285
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,771
I'll probably make enough
to pay for the whole trip.

286
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,649
Listen. It's right here,
$1,000 dollars in credits,

287
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,694
so you're, like, covered
if you get murdered on a hand.

288
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,990
This is just a promotional thing,
basically. Relax.

289
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,495
It's two hours.
Then we get married. End of story.

290
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:11,041
I don't know.

291
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,795
Really glad you could make it...
Jack, right?

292
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,006
Yeah. It's my pleasure.

293
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:19,924
You know, with all these Elvises...

294
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,343
- Excuse me...
- (clears throat)

295
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:23,762
Excuse me, Elvises running around, no?

296
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:26,639
I haven't seen so many sideburns
since West Side Story.

297
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:34,189
That's very funny. Wait.
That's New York wit. Am I right?

298
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,274
New York wit?

299
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,405
So, Tommy, you organize this
for the hotel? The game?

300
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,909
Right. I'm...

301
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,995
I'm retired from the dress business,
and I basically play for fun.

302
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,458
And the hotel asked me
to help make the guests feel at home.

303
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:56,419
- So a two-hour card game.
- Nobody gets too badly hurt.

304
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:59,589
- Sure.
- Come on, come on. Let's play.

305
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:03,885
The natives are getting restless.
So we'd better get going.

306
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:14,938
(woman on PA) Telephone call
for Betsy Nolan. Betsy Nolan.

307
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:25,407
Excuse... Jack, would you like me
to turn up the air-conditioning?

308
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,159
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

309
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:29,577
(Jack) Yeah. I'm fine.

310
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,832
See the raise.

311
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,251
Bump 20.

312
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:39,504
Can't catch a break here.

313
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,507
- Get me a sandwich or something.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,386
- I see it.
- (Tommy) Well, boys...

315
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,847
the good Lord was kind enough
to bless me with a full boat.

316
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:50,849
Fives overjacks.

317
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:55,270
- Shit.
- Well, the King is out, boys.

318
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,026
I have $20 left.
I probably should go.

319
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:06,865
Personally, I think you're playing
very well. It's just some bad luck.

320
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:10,034
You're playing perfect.
Just some bad luck.

321
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,871
Look, guys,
I don't have this kind of money to lose.

322
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:15,707
What really concerns me here,
Jack, is you're gonna go back

323
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,960
to New York
with a bad feeling about Vegas.

324
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:22,964
- That concerns me.
- I really won't.

325
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,175
He's scared. That's natural.

326
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:27,719
(Jack) Hey, look, it's not a matter
of being scared, OK?

327
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,890
What? It's just money?

328
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:35,894
- Yeah. It's just money.
- Well.

329
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:39,481
Tell you what. Here.
You just activated your line of credit.

330
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,817
Here's a thousand.

331
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:46,613
You lose it, it's on the hotel.
You win it, you pay it back. Fair?

332
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,407
Well, this afternoon
he wanted to play in this poker game...

333
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,743
that they have for new guests.

334
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:54,579
Mom, I can't hear you.
Oh, thanks.

335
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,917
You know,
it's like an introductory game.

336
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,919
I'll bet 200.

337
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,256
See it.

338
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,226
- See it.
- Well, I'm out.

339
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,065
See the 200 and...
Oh, God...

340
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,568
...raise a hundred.

341
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,613
Too rich for my blood.

342
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,615
See your hundred.

343
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:39,624
Raise you... a thousand.

344
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,463
This is out of control.

345
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,550
I'm out.

346
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:51,719
See the thousand.

347
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,976
- We're it, huh?
- Just us chickens.

348
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,189
Both.

349
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:04,816
Aces over eights.

350
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:08,444
- Shit!
- Excellent!

351
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:09,904
This is terrific.

352
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,617
You played that hand like,
"Forget about it," huh?

353
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,328
Thanks. I'm in a regular game
in the city.

354
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:20,748
Really? You got to tell me that.

355
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:29,007
I'll call you
right before the ceremony.

356
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:32,176
Like 10:30 your time.

357
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,886
Of course I'm excited.
What do you think?

358
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,774

361
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:56,159
Tony, there's absolutely no need
for that type of language here.

362
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:59,579
All right. Oh...

363
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:03,499
I raise... 500.

364
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,171
I fold.

365
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:12,717
Well, baby, the King must fold.

366
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:17,889
I'll see the 500...

367
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,891
...and I'll raise 2,000.

368
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:24,979
- You must have tremendous confidence.
- I have tremendous confidence.

369
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:28,107
Say "good night," Gracie.

370
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,486
A little confidence
ain't going to get it, kid.

371
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:37,200
I see the 2,500
and raise you three grand.

372
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,911
I think you got nothin'.

373
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:43,164
That's your constitutional right.

374
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,376
OK. That's the kind of game
we're going to play...

375
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:50,505
That's five to me...

376
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:55,760
...and...

377
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:58,930
I raise you 8,000.

378
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:02,308
(man) Tommy, I thought
we were playing for fun.

379
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,268
This is fun.

Eddie, please.

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,114
We may have to institute
a ban on singing here.

384
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:19,450
I'll see the eight grand.
I'll raise you ten.

385
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:23,996
Can I borrow 21 grand, please?

386
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:27,166
Twenty-one grand?

387
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:32,171
You know you can buy
a friggin' Volvo for 21 grand? Turbo?

388
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:35,633
I know what I'm doin'.

389
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:42,849
- You got some guts, kid.
- It's not guts. It's realism.

(chatter)

391
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,989
There's 83 grand in there.

392
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:03,870
Jackson, what's the word?

393
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,584
I'll see it...

394
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:13,796

This kid's got some set of balls.
Am I right?

397
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:23,556
My hat's off to you, kid.

398
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,184
My shirt too, probably,
the way you play.

399
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,152
To you.

400
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:43,451
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

401
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,539
Well, might as well
go down in flames.

402
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,339
What do you got?

403
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:01,219
Sorry, man.
Straight flush to the jack.

404
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,602
That's... That's one for the books.

405
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:12,772
(sighs)

406
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:19,612
To the queen.

407
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:22,240
(gasping)

408
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,909
That's a tough break.

409
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:28,830
Would you like a fruit plate?

410
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:30,456
(woman on PA, indistinct)

411
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:39,257
I'm not assessing any blame here.

412
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:45,096
But the reality is that you're
in a tremendous amount of trouble.

413
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,307
- If I go to a loan shark...
- Loan shark?

414
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,852
What loan shark's
going to give you 65,000?

415
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:52,812
If you haven't got it,
there's no way you can pay it back.

416
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:54,605
If you can, give it to me.

417
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,444
- I can't.
- Nonpayment of debts.

418
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,864
That's extremely serious everywhere.

419
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,950
I mean, among people. Among countries,
governments... They don't give a shit.

420
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,160
Am I right? They stiff everybody.

421
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:13,332
But... (clears throat)
...individuals...

422
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:18,796
They are expected to pay debts.

423
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,299
Especially gambling debts.

424
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:25,845
That's the essence of gambling.

425
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,388
You risk something.

426
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:31,642
If you put up money
you haven't got and can't get...

427
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,354
That's the lowest.

428
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:40,985
People...

429
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,405
People can get badly injured.

430
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,657
Jack, I'm talking physically.

431
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:51,787
Maybe we could work out something
over a period of a couple years.

432
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:55,708
Hey, what do you think?
You're buying a damn washer and dryer?

433
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,669
You owe Tommy Korman $65,000,
you understand?

434
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:01,756
Look, I'll rack my brain.

435
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:04,967
It's all right. I already racked mine.

436
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:07,970
- Do you have a solution?
- I do.

437
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,938
I want...

438
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:23,027
...your girlfriend for the weekend.

439
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,615
Betsy?
How do you know Betsy?

440
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:30,284
I don't... I don't know Betsy.

441
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,081
I don't know her.
I saw her over there in the lobby.

442
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:40,002
See, my wife Donna...
May she rest in peace...

443
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:43,255
They look identical.
I mean, they could be twins.

444
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:46,801
Now, I'm willing
to wipe out the 65 bills...

445
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:50,513
...if you let me
spend the weekend with her.

446
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:54,016
We're getting married tonight.

447
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:58,354
No, no, no, not tonight.
After the weekend.

448
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:04,151
And, Jack,
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

449
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,614
I just want company.

450
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:13,077
She won't agree to this.

451
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:15,788
If she loves you,
she'll agree to this.

452
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:21,836
(up-tempo music over PA)

453
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,546
(woman on PA) May I have
your attention, please.

454
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:24,672
Hi!

455
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,425
Bally's Casino Resort
is pleased to announce...

456
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:30,052
another $12,000 winner...

457
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:35,099
on one of Bally's
hot 97 percent dollar slot machines.

458
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:37,518
Congratulations to the winner.

459
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:53,451
What happened?

460
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:57,788
We, uh...

461
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:02,334
We have to have a serious talk.

462
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:05,504
(crowd cheering)

463
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,215
- (Betsy) Are you out of your mind?
- I said you wouldn't do it.

464
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:10,301
- Is that what you really said?
- Of course. What do you think?

465
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:14,180
And he actually said, "If she
spends the weekend with me,

466
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,057
you owe me nothing?"

467
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:18,434
- Yes.
- I am so nauseous.

468
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,311
You don't think
this is totally killing me?

469
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:23,606
You know, I had this feeling when you
left, then I talked myself out of it.

470
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:28,152
- Something about this is not right.
- Listen. Just forget I mentioned it.

471
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,362
- There's options.
- Like what?

472
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,698
Neither of us has any money.

473
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:35,826
God, Jack! What did he say?

474
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:38,120
He wants me to walk around
in her clothes?

475
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,667
- He wasn't that specific.
- How could you put me in this position?

476
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:47,838
What do you think? I knew it was coming?
I wanted this to happen?

477
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:50,758
- I was completely blindsided.
- I still don't understand this.

478
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:54,512
You went in there with $500.
We had this whole discussion.

479
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:57,056
I had a straight flush!

480
00:33:57,182 --> 00:34:01,519
Do you know what a straight flush is?
It's, like, unbeatable.

481
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:04,021
"Like unbeatable" is not "unbeatable."

482
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:06,190
Hey, I know that now, OK?

483
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:09,568
Don't yell at me! I hate this place!

484
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:11,695
I won't sleep with him,
no matter who he is.

485
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:14,406
Are you crazy? Of course not.
That's not even a consideration.

486
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:15,616
- No?
- No!

487
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:16,826
What if he holds a gun to my head?

488
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:18,869
Betsy, he's a gambler,
he's not a gangster.

489
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,913
He was a garment center guy
originally.

490
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,624
Oh, he was a garment center guy.
Well, that's a relief.

491
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,170
- I'm not saying it's great.
- Look at all these families here.

492
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:30,589
Happy families.

493
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:35,261
I'm a whore, Jack.
You've made me into a whore.

494
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:38,222
Honey, you don't think this is
destroying me? I don't know what to do.

495
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:42,643
You brought me to Las Vegas,
and you turned me into a whore, Jack!

496
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,770
(Jack) Shh! Let's just
forget about this, all right?

497
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,189
This is insanity,
and somehow I'll get the money.

498
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:50,276
From whom?
My parents don't have it.

499
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:54,572
"One weekend," he said.

500
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,074
Yes.

501
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:01,954
- I can't.
- And I don't want you to.

502
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,581
This is nuts!

503
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:06,750
(man sings along to opera music)

504

I don't believe this.

675
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:44,030
This... This'll be your room.

676
00:46:44,156 --> 00:46:47,951
God, this is breathtaking.

677
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:51,830
I... (clears throat)
I rebuilt it about a year ago.

678
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,625
(speaks Hawaiian)

679
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:59,296
My home by the sea.

680
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:01,798
You can probably
knock off the Hawaiian now.

681
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:02,924
Oh?

682
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,595
- I've impressed you enough, then?
- More than enough.

683
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:10,348
God. I've been to the Caribbean...

684
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:13,560
The Caribbean? You know who goes
to the Caribbean? Dentists.

685
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:16,104
That's who goes to the Caribbean.

686
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,482
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

687
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:23,403
You know, we have a...

688
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:28,158
We have a name
for this time of day here.

689
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:30,035
Waka-waka?

690
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:32,162
It's close.

691
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,080
(speaks Hawaiian)

692
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,001
Time of enchantment.

693
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,379
What did I tell you?

694
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,677
- You got this in the mail?
- Under my door at home.

695
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,682
Mr. Tomashefsky, it's a joke!

696
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:55,018
I mean, it's not even close.

697
00:47:55,144 --> 00:47:59,731
Of course you'd say that. You thought I
was nuts when I come in here originally.

698
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:01,900
Now, I got hard evidence.

699
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:04,277
Here.
Look for yourself.

700
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:08,281
Believe me.
I have no ax to grind here.

701
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:12,953
I think your pals at work
are having a little fun with you.

702
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,247
You don't know what it's like.
You don't know what it's like...

703
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,458
...to have the woman you love
off with someone,

704
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,086
and you can't do
a goddamn thing about it!

705
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:25,966
Some smooth talker
with his greasy hands all over her!

706
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:30,887
Coming up behind, grabbing her.
Her, laughing and laughing...

707
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:32,430
Her head thrown back!

708
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:36,226
Him... leaning against her...

709
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:38,728
...this creepy smile on his face.

710
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:40,647
A smile she can't even see!

711
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:46,027
Soon, he starts moving his hands
around her...

712
00:48:46,821 --> 00:48:48,196
...grabbing her...

713
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:50,240
...touching her...

714
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:54,744
...fondling her, groping...

715
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:56,496
- Shut up!
- (gasps)

716
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:59,082
Are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

717
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,086
(♪ Elvis Presley: Surrender)

718
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,967
Yeah, hi, operator. I need
a listing for a Tommy Korman

719
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:35,720
or a T. Korman in Kauai.

720
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:38,348
"Where in Kauai?"
I have no idea.

721
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:40,600
There are sections of Kauai?

722
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:41,726
Uh-huh.

723
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:43,812
Well, no. Not off the top of my head.

724
00:50:43,938 --> 00:50:45,939
What about near where
Don Ho or Jack Lord lives?

725
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:48,358
That must be
a pretty good neighborhood.

726
00:50:48,526 --> 00:50:52,320
Yeah. OK. I see. Well, thank you!

727
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:00,829
It's not just because
you look like Donna.

728
00:51:00,955 --> 00:51:03,414
- Oh, it has to be.
- No. It was.

729
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,375
I mean, it was.

730
00:51:06,502 --> 00:51:08,211
But it's not anymore.

731
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:13,424
I mean, for one thing,
you're a lot smarter than she was.

732
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,844
God forgive me for saying that.

733
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,554
Look. I've got to say
something else too.

734
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:19,472
You're pissin' your life away

735
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:21,724
on a guy that can't pull the trigger
on marrying you.

736
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,144
We were gonna get married.

737
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,230
With me, I'd have gone right from the
airport to the chapel to marry you.

738
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,274
- What did he do?
- You have to understand Jack.

739
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,152
This man, he decided to play poker.
That's what this man did.

740
00:51:32,278 --> 00:51:34,612
- He had a very strange mother.
- He played poker.

741
00:51:34,738 --> 00:51:36,531
He's a...

742
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:40,410
He's a great... a great guy, I'm sure.

743
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:42,412
I'm just sayin'...

744
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:46,082
I'm just sayin' think about it
before you marry him.

745
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,626
- Just...
- (man) Hey, Dad! Dad!

746
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:52,422
- There are the kids.
- How far is Mount Kilauea from here?

747
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:55,049
- It's on the other island. Why?
- (baby crying)

748
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,302
We heard it's erupting.

749
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:00,763
We gotta go. We gotta go.

750
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,348
Listen.

751
00:52:03,851 --> 00:52:06,477
Did I upset you?
Because if I did, I...

752
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:08,897
No. I mean, you touched a nerve.

753
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:12,400
Look. It's just,
Jack is very complicated.

754
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:14,777
Yeah.

755
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:18,156
You see, I've known guys
like him my whole life.

756
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,450
Decent, good guys.
They're real good guys.

757
00:52:20,618 --> 00:52:23,828
But they cause a lot of heartache.

758
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,624
I don't think you deserve that.

759
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,418
I think you deserve a lot better.

760
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,381
(man on TV) Winds out of the northwest
at seven miles per hour.

761
00:52:35,507 --> 00:52:37,508
It's currently cloudy
with a chance of...

762
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:47,060
(woman 1) Take a look, everybody.
The Oleg Cassini men's...

763
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:49,229
(woman 2) Mother Nature
put on a show yesterday...

764
00:52:49,355 --> 00:52:51,397
as Hawaii's Mount Kilauea erupted.

765
00:52:51,523 --> 00:52:53,691
We have a report from Connie Wong.

766
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:58,905
Mount Kilauea,
dormant for the past eight years...

767
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:01,991
erupted last night
with spectacular force.

768
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,662
Rivers of fire streamed down from
the volcano beginning around midnight,

769
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:07,997
and word spread quickly
throughout the islands.

770
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:09,707
Natives and tourists alike

771
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,834
thronged to the base of Mount Kilauea

772
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:15,672
to watch nature's fury unleashed...
with awe-inspiring force.

773
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,343
Government officials stress no one was
in immediate danger from the eruption.

774
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:23,888
If I take the 7:00pm,
I get to Milwaukee when?

775
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:27,350
- 8:35.
- 8:35. And that's Central Time?

776
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:29,143
Yes, sir.

777
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,689
Now, would it be any cheaper
if I stop in Nashville?

778
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,275
- Same price, sir.
- I hold an AAdvantage card.

779
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,443
That won't make any difference
in the price.

780
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:39,821
Sir, there seems
to be a very long line.

781
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:45,285
- Tell me again about the Super Saver.
- There are several restrictions.

782
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,704
What's this guy doing?
Around the world in 80 days?

783
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:49,580
- Lighten up.
- You lighten up.

784
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:52,208
You can only fly on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday...

785
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:55,753
That's it. Look. Look.
I've got a major problem.

786
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:58,715
OK? My fiancée was kidnapped
and taken to Hawaii.

787
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:00,925
I've got to get there now.

788
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:03,720
Well, I'm trying to make arrangements
to get to Milwaukee...

789
00:54:03,846 --> 00:54:06,556
for my nephew Douglas's wedding
on the 21st.

790
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:09,559
You're not even flying today?

791
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:11,728
No. Consumer Reports said

792
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:14,772
if you make your travel arrangements
two weeks in advance at...

793
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:18,443
You see this line?
We're all flying today.

794
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,987
- Sir, if you don't get back in line...
- Then what?

795
00:54:21,113 --> 00:54:23,740
I'll be arrested? Put in airport jail?

796
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:27,994
Just get your ticket and move on.
Get your goddamn ticket and move on!

797
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,579
(man) Yeah!

798
00:54:38,464 --> 00:54:41,591
(Betsy) The whole point of the game
was me? Getting me here?

799
00:54:42,843 --> 00:54:46,054
(Tommy) All right.
Why keep it a secret any longer?

800
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,306
My heart's on my sleeve.

801
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,644
From the minute I saw you
in that lobby, I knew...

802
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:56,773
- So you sort of lied to me.
- How's that?

803
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,692
I understood that this was like
a settlement of the game,

804
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:01,944
when, in fact, it was
the whole reason for the game.

805
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:04,781
Yeah. So? Aren't you flattered?

806
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:07,116
You told me
the game was legitimate.

807
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:09,619
The game was legitimate.

808
00:55:09,787 --> 00:55:11,954
But, I mean,
I play cards professionally,

809
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:14,457
and no amateur's gonna beat me.

810
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,959
That's what I had to do to get you.

811
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:21,464
If I was a medieval knight,
I'd have jostled for you.

812
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,424
Jousted. That's jousted.

813
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,259
Jousted. Whatever the hell they did.

814
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:28,346
Look, if that is
your preoccupation here...

815
00:55:28,472 --> 00:55:31,557
If you want to leave tomorrow

816
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:34,602
instead of Wednesday,
believe me, I understand.

817
00:55:34,728 --> 00:55:37,105
I'll call and make reservations.

818
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:40,149
- No.
- "No?" No calls?

819
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,902
No. No, I'm having a wonderful time.

820
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:44,904
It's just, you know, this is...

821
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,658
It's just a little overwhelming
to be pursued like this.

822
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:50,034
Well, no one ever...

823
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:54,288
...ever was as crazy
about you as I am.

824
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,126
I mean, it's up there with...

825
00:55:58,252 --> 00:56:02,922
...Romeo and Juliet,
George and Gracie... All the big ones.

826
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,299
(sighs)

827
00:56:05,426 --> 00:56:07,427
I'll take care of you forever.

828
00:56:07,553 --> 00:56:09,929
I would throw myself
in front of a train for you.

829
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:19,772
Just stop me at any time.

830
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:33,703
Was that wrong?
It didn't feel wrong to me.

831
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:39,959
I don't know.

832
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:44,255
It's OK, honey.
Let me see here.

833
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:46,883
- What are you doing?
- She's got a great spitball.

834
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,219
- (telephone ringing)
- That's a tremendous natural athlete.

835
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:51,846
- Yeah?
- (Niko) Telephone, Mr. K.

836
00:56:51,972 --> 00:56:53,848
- Do you want to hold her?
- Yes.

837
00:56:53,974 --> 00:56:55,850
- Can I hold you?
- Yes.

838
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:59,061
Oh, hey. That's great
how she goes to you like that.

839
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:01,606
I can't believe it. She doesn't
go to people like that.

840
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:02,982
Gimme.

841
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:10,072
What's the story?

842
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:13,910
Bad news.
He's on the morning flight in.

843
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:17,663
I'm surprised
and I'm not surprised.

844
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:23,878
Look. All right. We gotta keep him
away from here for at least a day.

845
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:26,130
How 'bout a nice hit-and-run?

846
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:29,759
Look, no violence.

847
00:57:29,885 --> 00:57:32,345
Unless it's absolutely
necessary, all right?

848
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:35,515
(Tommy) Just stall,
and get the chief. Get Mahi.

849
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,433
Just take care of it.

850
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:42,063
Look, I'm getting very close
with her, you know?

851
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:45,107
And if he shows up over here,
it's over, and...

852
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:47,944
- (crunching sounds)
- Are you goddamn eating again?

853
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:51,739
No, I swear, I'm not eatin'.

854
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,373
He checked out Sunday?

855
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:02,500
(man) At 8:07.

856
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:04,502
Can I help you
with any future reservations?

857
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:06,671
- No, thank you.
- Thank you for calling Bally's.

858
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:22,061
Come on, come on, come on.

859
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:24,689
(Jack on machine)
Hi, this is Jack Singer.

860
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,440
Sorry I can't take your call now,

861
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:31,153
but if you'd leave your name
and number, I'll get right back to you.

862
00:58:33,282 --> 00:58:34,448
Shit!

863
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:54,677
Hey, Mahi,
will you pay some attention?

864
00:58:56,013 --> 00:58:57,888
This guy, Jack Singer's
six-one, about 180.

865
00:58:58,015 --> 00:58:59,390
He's coming out of that terminal.

866
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:01,225
Keep him away from Tommy's all right?

867
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:04,228
I don't care where you take him.
Just keep him away from Tommy's.

868
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:06,355
- Sure.
- All right, Mahi.

869
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:10,776
(woman on PA)

870
00:59:14,906 --> 00:59:17,533
Hey, brother, you like ride?

871
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:20,369
Yeah, I need a ride,
but I don't know where yet.

872
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:21,912
- I take your bag.
- Thanks.

873
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:24,206
My name Mahi.
Mahi Mahi.

874
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,876
- Like the fish?
- Yeah. My father was a fisherman.

875
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:29,837
My father left home when I was five.
That's why I'm named Jack.

876
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:32,506
As in "Jack, tell your mother
I'm going to get the paper."

877
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,343
- I gotta make a couple calls.
- Hey, Jack, Jack.

878
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:37,386
Where you like go?
Tell me. I take you anywhere.

879
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:41,557
Do you have any idea where a guy
named Tommy Korman lives?

880
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:44,310
Sure. Everybody know that.

881
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:45,728
You're kidding?

882
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:49,398
- No, it's a small island.
- This is great.

883
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:52,318
Thought I was going to have
to go through a whole number.

884
00:59:52,444 --> 00:59:54,153
- Cab's over here.
- All right.

885
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:55,655
Welcome to Kauai.

886
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:02,828
You like this, Jack?

887
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:06,624
Beautiful, huh? So romantic.

888
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,377
The women, when they come here,
oh, they get crazy.

889
01:00:09,503 --> 01:00:11,504
They like "freaky-freaky"
all night long.

890
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,589
That's really great news.
We almost there?

891
01:00:13,715 --> 01:00:16,634
Yeah. Right up here
about a mile and a half.

892
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:38,572
This can't be it.
Tommy Korman lives here?

893
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,032
Korman?

894
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:42,702
I thought you said "Orman."
You know, Chief Orman.

895
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:44,704
I didn't say Chief Orman.

896
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,957
I said Tommy Korman,
loud and clear. Come on!

897
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:51,711
I fly for two goddamn days,
I haven't slept, I can barely walk!

898
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,756
(speaking Hawaiian)

899
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:04,140
That goes double for me, chief.
There was a little mix-up here.

900
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:06,851
(speaking Hawaiian)

901
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:11,230
(repeats Hawaiian word)

902
01:01:11,356 --> 01:01:12,398
Listen, Mahi.

903
01:01:12,524 --> 01:01:14,692
I don't have time
for this horseshit!

904
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:18,988
Hey, Jack, no make insult
for the chief, OK?

905
01:01:19,114 --> 01:01:21,073
This man get plenty influence
in this place.

906
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:23,534
"Influence"?
He lives in a shack!

907
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,496
He's a man of great simplicity.

908
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:31,751
Come on. You spend
ten minutes with the guy, OK?

909
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:35,421
If you don't do that, the word
gonna get around Kauai so fast.

910
01:01:35,547 --> 01:01:38,799
Next thing you know,
ain't nobody gonna help you, brother.

911
01:01:43,597 --> 01:01:46,599
- Parakeet brandy.
- Are you serious?

912
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,480

913
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:56,150

915
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:02,865
- You are from mainland?
- That's right.

916
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:06,035
Do you find Chief Orman attractive?

917
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:13,709
Uh... You're
a striking-looking figure.

918
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:16,170
If by "attractive"...

919
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:17,630
(Mahi) Hey, chief.

920
01:02:17,756 --> 01:02:20,716

Grand Hotel?

923
01:02:27,432 --> 01:02:29,850
I... I don't go
to the theater that often.

924
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:32,394
Do you know if it
will come to Kauai?

925
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:36,482
I don't, really, but I'll
ask around when I get back.

926
01:02:36,608 --> 01:02:38,317
Now, could you tell me...

927
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:40,402
Did you hear me before
about Tommy Korman?

928
01:02:42,364 --> 01:02:46,075
Chief Orman favorite is,
of course, South Pacific.

929
01:02:48,912 --> 01:02:51,747

Is it "Kapa-a-a" or "Kapa-a-a-a"?

982
01:05:42,127 --> 01:05:45,504
Is it two "A"s?
Is it A-A-A or A-A?

for me to handle.

- Betsy, I love you.
- Tommy...

988
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:03,188
Oh. I want you in my life.
I want to be married.

989
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:07,192
- I can't marry you like this.
- Like what?

990
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:09,945
Like this.
Like just jumping into it.

991
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:12,573
It just doesn't make any sense,
and there's Jack, too.

992
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:15,617
I can't just turn around
and marry someone else.

993
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:18,203
There's stuff to work out with him.
There's feelings there.

994
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,083
What?

995
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:28,213
The man put you up
in a card game.

996
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:31,383
No, not really.
You made an arrangement.

997
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,261
I wanted cash. He put you up.

998
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,806
What are you talking about?

999
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,560
(Jack) Mr. Korman and Miss Nolan
are where exactly?

1000
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:44,354
The Kauai Club.
It's about 20 miles down this road.

1001
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:47,649
- Thanks very much.
- Are you a friend of Dad's or Betsy's?

1002
01:06:47,776 --> 01:06:49,318
Both, actually.

1003
01:06:49,486 --> 01:06:51,403
They're really great together.

1004
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,322
It's so good to see Chris's dad in love.

1005
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,158
Yeah, well, that's just
so wonderful to hear.

1006
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:58,619
- OK.
- Goodbye.

1007
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:01,997
I thought that it was your idea.
You told me that you arranged a game.

1008
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:05,501
- You saw me in the lobby...
- Yes, honey. Listen.

1009
01:07:05,668 --> 01:07:08,170
I told you that to protect you.

1010
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,673
Because I love you so very much.

1011
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:15,761
Honey, and the truth was so...

1012
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:18,472
...horrible!

1013
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:20,766
It embarrassed me.

1014
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:23,018
He put you up like a...

1015
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:25,687
...like a ring, like a watch.

1016
01:07:25,814 --> 01:07:27,606
That's how cold it was.

1017
01:07:27,732 --> 01:07:29,608
I can't believe it.
Maybe he was frantic.

1018
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:32,861
Listen, people get frightened.
They do crazy things.

1019
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:35,364
He was so terrified
of marrying you.

1020
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,909
Come on, that's unfair.
He didn't have $65,000.

1021
01:07:39,035 --> 01:07:40,577
What...

1022
01:07:41,538 --> 01:07:43,539
That's what he owed you.

1023
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:48,210
He owed me $3,000.

1024
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,047
What?

1025
01:07:53,883 --> 01:07:55,342
Honey, look.

1026
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:59,096
The man's a head case. He's a head case.

1027
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:01,765
But we all make mistakes.
Life goes on.

1028
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:04,059
He did this for $3,000?

1029
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:06,895
Honey, don't. Please, darling.

1030
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:08,981
Don't torture yourself like this.

1031
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:11,316
Let's just fly to Vegas and...

1032
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:13,944
...get married
and go on with our lives.

1033
01:08:14,863 --> 01:08:16,864
I need to be alone for awhile.

1034
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,920
Keep it close by.

1035
01:08:43,808 --> 01:08:45,267
(Jack) Betsy!

1036
01:08:48,146 --> 01:08:50,272
- Betsy!
- (waves crashing loudly)

1037
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:52,608
Betsy!

1038
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,194
(grunts)

1039
01:08:58,323 --> 01:08:59,615
Get off!

1040
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:02,034
Get off me!

1041
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,952
What the hell are you doing here?
We had a deal.

1042
01:09:04,078 --> 01:09:06,205
We never said Hawaii.
Get off me.

1043
01:09:06,331 --> 01:09:08,415
We never didn't say Hawaii.

1044
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,500
Look, you want to stay
on the island, fine.

1045
01:09:10,627 --> 01:09:13,587
But you stay the hell away
from her or give me 65 thousand.

1046
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:14,713
I've got it.

1047
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:16,340
I brought it with me.

1048
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:18,634
No. That's bullshit.

1049
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,303
You never wanted the money.
You wanted her!

1050
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:25,307
Get off me! Somebody!

1051
01:09:25,433 --> 01:09:27,142
Help! Get off me!

1052
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:29,102
- (Jack) Betsy!
- (Tommy) He's crazy!

1053
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:31,396
Betsy!

1054
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,983
- Get him out of here!
- Betsy!

1055
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:37,152
(faint) Betsy!

1056
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:42,032
(grunting)

1057
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:48,789
Come on. Don't.
You're making a big mistake.

1058
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:53,001
Listen to me.
My girl's out there. My wife!

1059
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:04,221
You OK?

1060
01:10:05,306 --> 01:10:07,474
- That was the weirdest thing.
- What?

1061
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,268
It was like Wuthering Heights.

1062
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:11,645
I thought I heard my name
being called in the wind.

1063
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:13,647
It sounded like Jack.
Can you believe that?

1064
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:18,568
Yeah. I used to think
that I heard Donna calling...

1065
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,404
Almost shouting.

1066
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:22,823
It's very spooky.

1067
01:10:23,908 --> 01:10:27,119
It's the shape of the rocks
or something. It echoes.

1068
01:10:27,245 --> 01:10:29,329
- It's so strange.
- Yeah.

1069
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,627
So what do you think?

1070
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:39,506
I'm gonna want children very soon.

1071
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:47,389
You just tell me when, sweetheart.

1072
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:51,643
Having children
with you would be heaven.

1073
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:54,896
Then let's do it. I want to.

1074
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:59,026
Are you sure this is not
a reaction to what I told you?

1075
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:01,987
No, no, I want
to get on with my life, Tommy.

1076
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:03,530
I want to get married.

1077
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:05,949
To me?

1078
01:11:07,493 --> 01:11:09,077
Yes.

1079
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:13,290
(sighs)

1080
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,294

Look, I have to make
a phone call now!

1084
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,783
You're kidding me!
You're in a Hawaiian clink?

1085
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:51,703
- Vito, you believe that?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1086
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:53,580
(Sally) Vito's in the chair.
He can't believe it.

1087
01:11:53,706 --> 01:11:56,249
Listen. The bail is five grand.

1088
01:11:56,376 --> 01:11:58,251
OK, let me work on it.

1089
01:11:58,378 --> 01:11:59,628
But, Jack, listen to me.

1090
01:11:59,754 --> 01:12:02,130
Make sure you ask approval
to leave the state.

1091
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:04,299
Otherwise you'll be stuck there
even if you make bail.

1092
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:08,053
OK, but, Sally,
as fast as you can, please.

1093
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:10,639
Just seeing her there,
staring at the ocean...

1094
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,100
I know that look, man.

1095
01:12:13,226 --> 01:12:15,310
She's doing some serious thinking.

1096
01:12:15,436 --> 01:12:17,187
Well? Ready?

1097
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,731
This is really such a great spot.

1098
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,858
We'll be back real soon.

1099
01:12:30,118 --> 01:12:33,078
- Thanks.
- I want to say one thing, ma'am.

1100
01:12:33,204 --> 01:12:35,330
Anybody who would put you up
for $3,000...

1101
01:12:35,456 --> 01:12:37,624
Hey, Niko,
what's the matter with you?

1102
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,460
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Really.

1103
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:42,587
- (Niko) Sorry.
- Jesus.

1104
01:12:46,008 --> 01:12:47,008
Perfect.

Don't tell me
you still want the cab fare.

01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:12,284
Nah. I dropped the charges.
I feel sorry for you, man.

1108
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:16,037
I don't want your pity.
Just take me to Korman's house. Korman.

1109
01:13:17,748 --> 01:13:19,624
No do you any good.

1110

Him, your girlfriend,
both went back Vegas.

1111
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:22,961
Gonna get married.

1112
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,547
Married?

1113
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:27,299
(mouthing) Married.

1114
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:33,680
(Mahi) Hey, Jack.

1115
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,558
Jack, Jack.

1116
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:39,269

- Thanks.

Always remember:

come out of your mouth."

01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:53,575
That just doesn't help me at all,
but I appreciate the thought.

1120

I gotta get on
the next flight out of here.

1124
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:08,256
The next flight out of here
goes nonstop to...

1125
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:09,716
Auckland, New Zealand.

1126
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:12,719
New Zealand?
No, I gotta get to the States.

1127
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:14,262
We are a state.

1128
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:17,933
The mainland, OK?
I gotta get to Vegas.

1129
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:22,604
Well, the Los Angeles flight
left Honolulu 20 minutes ago.

1130
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,939
Shit!

1131
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:27,859
- When's the next flight out of here?
- Tonight at 8:30.

(exhales deeply)

1133
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:32,739
Ma'am, I'll be sucking
on an exhaust pipe by then.

1134
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:37,077
Just get me anywhere where I can get
a connecting flight to Las Vegas.

I don't think that's fair.

in Westchester or Connecticut.

I can't think about that yet.

01:17:10,147 --> 01:17:12,065
I don't know and I can't
speak to you direc...

1180
01:17:12,191 --> 01:17:13,608
(machine beeps)

1181
01:17:14,985 --> 01:17:16,903
(woman on PA) Ladies and gentlemen.
For your convenience,

1182
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:19,280
we have immediate seating available...

1183
01:17:20,783 --> 01:17:22,951
I'll go crack open the champagne.

1184
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:25,286
Are you always
going to keep me waiting?

1185
01:17:25,413 --> 01:17:26,913
That's a joke.

1186
01:17:27,998 --> 01:17:29,958
You can keep me waiting anytime.

1187
01:17:31,752 --> 01:17:34,754
Vegas! Anybody going to Vegas?

1188
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,965
Las Vegas! Anybody!

1189
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:38,925
Anybody, Vegas!

1190
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:42,178
Are you guys going to Vegas
by any chance?

1191
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:44,305
Yeah! We sure are. You need a lift?

1192
01:17:44,432 --> 01:17:47,100
- Oh, desperately.
- You done this before, son?

1193
01:17:48,227 --> 01:17:50,145
Yeah, yeah, sure. I love
these little planes. They're great.

1194
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:53,064
Oh, come on. Hop aboard.
You'll have a good time.

1195
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,899
We got a new one, boys.

1196
01:17:55,025 --> 01:17:57,152
Come on in there.
Let's go. Let's go!

1197
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:01,322
Could we talk?

1198
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:03,950
- Sure, we could talk.
- No, back inside.

1199
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:06,661
Please?

1200
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,666
(woman on PA)

1201
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:27,974
- (excited chatter)
- You ready, Zeke?

1202
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,059
- Ready!
- (all shouting)

1203
01:18:30,186 --> 01:18:33,354
Hey, all right.
What's your cape size, son?

1204
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:36,566
- What's my cape size?
- Uh-huh.

1205
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:37,692
Forty regular.

1206
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,652
What's with the parachutes?

1207
01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:44,282
You're gonna find out as soon as
you strap one on, I guarantee you.

1208
01:18:44,408 --> 01:18:47,869
For such a short flight, it seems
like you're being overcautious.

1209
01:18:48,037 --> 01:18:50,413
I don't know. It's just a hunch, but...

1210
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:52,707
Son, we're skydivin'.

1211
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,210
You're skydiving?

1212
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:58,213
We're the Flying Elvises,
Utah chapter.

1213
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,924
Roy Bacon, director, at your service.

1214
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,926
Listen, if you could just drop me.

1215
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:05,178
- (all laughing)
- Oh, yeah, we'll sure drop you!

1216
01:19:11,101 --> 01:19:12,727
This is a panic attack.

1217
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,230
Why does it have to be so soon?

1218
01:19:15,397 --> 01:19:20,068
(stammers) Well, honey, you know,
I told you there comes a time when...

1219
01:19:20,236 --> 01:19:21,986
I'm not ready.

1220
01:19:22,112 --> 01:19:24,489
Nah. You just think you're not ready.

1221
01:19:24,615 --> 01:19:26,741
No, I'm not ready.

1222
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:30,537
I say we wait a few weeks.
You know? A month.

1223
01:19:30,663 --> 01:19:33,081
We, we get to know each other better.

1224
01:19:37,586 --> 01:19:41,089
OK... Look, I'll give you
half a million dollars

1225
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:42,423
if you marry me today. Cash.

1226
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:46,803
And if things don't work out,
we split up, you keep the money.

1227
01:19:48,264 --> 01:19:49,430
You're joking.

1228
01:19:49,598 --> 01:19:52,100
About money, I, I neverjoke.

1229
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:54,936
Screw you.

1230
01:19:57,523 --> 01:20:02,068
Please. Don't ever turn
your back on me. Ever.

1231
01:20:02,194 --> 01:20:03,778
Weekend is over.

1232
01:20:04,864 --> 01:20:06,865
Don't grab me like that.

1233
01:20:08,284 --> 01:20:10,994
You are being rude to me.

1234
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:16,207
In the lobby of the Bally Hotel,
you are being rude.

1235
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:18,960
Get out of my sight.

1236
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:20,670
(Tommy) Hey!

1237
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:24,966
A million. Now, be a realist.

1238
01:20:25,092 --> 01:20:27,093
This is a no-lose deal for you.

1239
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:29,220
I get a million dollars?

1240
01:20:29,972 --> 01:20:31,472
Yeah. That's correct.

1241
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:33,766
You're unbelievable.

1242
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:37,270
It would be very irresponsible
of you to turn this down.

1243
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:39,063
- Tommy...
- Hey.

1244
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,066
Your answer...

1245
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:43,484
...is yes.

1246
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:47,989
I have to go to the bathroom.

1247
01:20:50,034 --> 01:20:52,160
OK, come on.
I'll go with you.

1248
01:20:52,286 --> 01:20:54,537
I need to be alone
for a couple of minutes.

1249
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:02,420
OK. You got five minutes,
and then we get married.

1250
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:03,838
Listen.

1251
01:21:06,884 --> 01:21:10,053
You said, "Yes, I will marry you."

1252
01:21:11,513 --> 01:21:12,805
That's a promise.

1253
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:18,269
When people make promises
to Tommy Korman, they keep 'em.

1254
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,813
You understand?

1255
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:24,108
- Yes, I do. Yes.
- Hmm?

1256
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:31,157
You got five minutes.

1257
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:43,920
She's comin' up here?

1258
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:46,714
I thought you left already.

1259
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:49,175
No. Just stay close to her,
all right?

1260
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,348
Where is he?

1261
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,477
(♪ Travis Tritt: Burning Love)

1262
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:08,069
(mouthing words to Elvis song)

1263
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:20,289
Ooh, boy, that music
gets the adrenaline going, don't it?

1264
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:22,792
- We jump out at what altitude?
- Three thousand feet.

1265
01:22:23,877 --> 01:22:26,421
And these chutes are foolproof, right?

1266
01:22:26,588 --> 01:22:28,506
Well, as the King his own self said...

1267
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:30,633
they ain't nothin' in this
whole wide world foolproof,

1268
01:22:30,759 --> 01:22:33,553
exceptin' Coupe DeVilles and hookers!

1269
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:38,099
Let me get this straight.
I pull this?

1270
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:40,768
No, boy, you pull
the other one first,

1271
01:22:40,894 --> 01:22:42,437
that being your main chute.

1272
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:46,107
Then if that chute don't open,
you reach over and pull the red one,

1273
01:22:46,275 --> 01:22:48,568
that there being your auxiliary chute.

1274
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:50,278
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.

1275
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:52,822
- (impersonator) You got it.
- (Jack) OK, OK. Now...

1276
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:56,451
lf, by any chance, I get flustered
when I'm hurtling through space...

1277
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:58,536
and I pull the red one first?

1278
01:22:58,662 --> 01:23:01,581
Oh! Then you gonna wind up
lookin' like a well-done chili burger.

1279
01:23:01,707 --> 01:23:04,000
They gonna have to
shovel you into a coffin.

1280
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:09,464
But you can do it, son. You can do it!

1281
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:13,342
All right, fellers.
It's just about show time!

1282
01:23:13,469 --> 01:23:15,470
Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red.

1283
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:42,663
She never came up.

1284
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,376
- Go find her.
- Where?

1285
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:50,922
I don't know. Try outside.

1286
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:54,675
(man on PA) Six minutes until the Flying
Elvises make their historic jump.

1287
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,975
- Elvises, rise!
- (all hollering)

1288
01:24:05,687 --> 01:24:07,855
(repeating) Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red.

1289
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:10,399
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.

1290
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:17,323
(alarm sounds)

1291
01:24:19,243 --> 01:24:20,952
(Buddy) Where you going?

1292
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:23,037
(shouting, pounding on door)

1293
01:24:23,747 --> 01:24:26,707
(man on PA) Ladies and gentlemen
Roy Bacon and his Flying Elvises

1294
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,209
are approaching Bally's.

1295
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,795
- All eyes to the sky!
- (crowd chanting) Elvis!

1296
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:32,547

1297
01:24:40,055 --> 01:24:41,973

1298
01:24:46,186 --> 01:24:47,812

1300
01:25:02,828 --> 01:25:05,204
She's somewhere in the basement.

1301
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:07,415
So, tell me, what are you
doing in the lobby?

1302
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:10,334
- I'm keeping you informed.
- Go get her! Go get her!

1303
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,714
Moron.

1304
01:25:16,258 --> 01:25:18,176
(man on PA) Ladies and gentlemen,
the Flying Elvises

1305
01:25:18,302 --> 01:25:22,221
have entered Las Vegas airspace
and will jump in one minute!

1306
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:23,639
One minute!

1307
01:25:33,275 --> 01:25:37,445
Elvises, light your fires!

1308
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:41,282
Betsy! Betsy! Betsy! Betsy!

1309
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,075
That's it.
Look at them up there!

1310
01:25:48,498 --> 01:25:52,960
Elvises, head 'em up
and move 'em out!

1311
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:54,587
(all shouting)

1312
01:25:54,713 --> 01:25:56,672
(♪ Elvis Presley: That's All Right)

1313
01:26:06,683 --> 01:26:08,100
(man on PA) Here they come!

1314
01:26:08,977 --> 01:26:10,978
Excuse me.

1315
01:26:11,104 --> 01:26:14,899
(man on PA) Never before have so many
Elvises been airborne!

1316
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:24,116
Let's give them
a real Las Vegas welcome

1317
01:26:24,243 --> 01:26:26,994
and pray that they make it
safely to Earth.

1318
01:26:29,206 --> 01:26:32,959
You know you pull the red one,
then the yellow one!

1319
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:35,544
No, he said yellow, then red!

1320
01:26:35,671 --> 01:26:37,171
No! He was just kidding!

1321
01:26:37,297 --> 01:26:38,506
Lyle, come on, Lyle!

1322
01:26:38,674 --> 01:26:40,758
- Good luck!
- Wait a minute!

1323
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:44,553
- I was just kidding.
- You were or Roy was?

1324
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,846
He was.

1325
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,726
(man on PA) Our brave Elvises of the sky

1326
01:26:50,852 --> 01:26:53,771
are wearing specially designed
electric jumpsuits

1327
01:26:53,897 --> 01:26:57,316
made to the King's
own specifications.

1328
01:26:57,442 --> 01:27:01,445
Each suit is valued
at over $10,000.

1329
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:05,616
Here they come!

1330
01:27:05,742 --> 01:27:07,910
They're crossing the Dunes.

1331
01:27:08,036 --> 01:27:11,038
Then they're headed home to Bally's.

1332
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,590
One last time! Yellow, then red?

1333
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:24,677

01:27:25,929 --> 01:27:27,513

Yee-haw!

1336

Roy Bacon has opened his chute.

1337
01:27:42,571 --> 01:27:44,322
Only one to go!

1338
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:48,326
Yellow! Red! Pow!

1339
01:27:49,828 --> 01:27:52,204
The last chute is open!

1340
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,294
That's good. That's great.

1341
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,212
I'm not gonna die.

1342
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:03,299
Don't look down.

God, don't let me land
on anything sharp.

01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:26,739
Left, toggle left.
Right, toggle right.

1349
01:28:28,033 --> 01:28:29,950
The wind currents are picking up!

1350
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,829
Watch it up there,
brave Elvises of the sky!

1351
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:34,955
(Jack) Steady, boy.

1352
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:37,416
Here we go.

1353
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:39,960
That's good. OK.

1354
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:43,839
Here they come.
From Tucson, Billy Braker!

1355
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:47,551
From Salt Lake City,
Lyle Davis and Vern Poole.

1356
01:28:47,677 --> 01:28:51,138
And our newest Flying Elvis
from New York City...

1357
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:54,809
making his maiden jump,
Jack Singer!

1358
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:57,937
Let's give a real
Las Vegas welcome

1359
01:28:58,063 --> 01:29:02,316
for our heroic young man,
Jack Singer!

1360
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,448
Welcome to Earth,
brave Elvises!

1361
01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:11,117
- Miss, stay back.
- Please.

1362
01:29:15,956 --> 01:29:16,956
Jack!

1363
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,084
- Betsy!
- Jack!

1364
01:29:27,759 --> 01:29:28,759
Betsy!

1365
01:29:32,514 --> 01:29:33,681
Did you marry him?

1366
01:29:33,807 --> 01:29:36,183
(♪ Elvis Presley:
Falling in Love)

1367
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:50,197
Jack! You jumped out of a plane!

1368
01:29:50,323 --> 01:29:52,700
His kid said you were gonna
marry him today.

1369
01:29:52,868 --> 01:29:54,452
Did you get a job here?

1370
01:29:54,578 --> 01:29:57,496
I couldn't find you.
I didn't know how to reach you.

1371
01:29:57,622 --> 01:30:00,166
I was flying day and night.
I was going everywhere.

1372
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:04,336
Hawaii, jail... I saw you on the beach.
I was screaming your name.

1373
01:30:04,463 --> 01:30:06,380
He said that was the wind.

1374
01:30:06,548 --> 01:30:08,215
I was so stupid.

1375
01:30:13,096 --> 01:30:14,472
I can't find her.

1376
01:30:16,808 --> 01:30:19,852
It's over. Son of a bitch
jumped out of a plane.

1377
01:30:19,978 --> 01:30:21,061
What?

1378
01:30:22,063 --> 01:30:24,690
He said you only lost 3,000.

1379
01:30:24,816 --> 01:30:26,567
- What?
- And I believed him.

1380
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:31,238
Then I realized, I said,
"What, am I nuts? I can't marry him."

1381
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:34,325
(crowd chanting) Elvis!

1382
01:30:36,286 --> 01:30:39,205
And then you jumped
out of a plane for me!

1383
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:40,748
You could've died.

1384
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:43,334
I didn't want to live
if I couldn't have you, baby.

1385
01:30:46,546 --> 01:30:48,422
Go take a hike.

1386
01:30:48,548 --> 01:30:50,466
- Now?
- No, next Thursday.

1387
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:53,052
Yeah, now. Go set up a game.

1388
01:30:53,178 --> 01:30:54,762
I'll just grab a bite.

1389
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:58,682
- Go!
- All right, all right.

1390
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:02,269
I dreamt about my mother again
last night.

1391
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:04,063
Was she vacuuming naked?

1392
01:31:04,189 --> 01:31:06,690
No. She opened her eyes, and I said,

1393
01:31:06,816 --> 01:31:11,153
"Mom, I'm gonna marry that girl,"
and she smiled.

1394
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,447
- (Betsy) Really?
- (Jack) Yeah.

1395
01:31:13,615 --> 01:31:14,949
Of course, she was naked.

1396
01:31:17,577 --> 01:31:20,454
(man) Jack and Betsy,
you have declared your desire

1397
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:23,290
to unite yourselves
with each other in marriage.

1398
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:26,085
- This is correct?
- (both) Yes.

1399
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:27,628
(minister) True matrimony is...

1400
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:29,964
(♪ Elvis Presley: It's Now orNever)

1401
01:31:39,099 --> 01:31:41,100
(sniffling) Oh.

1402
01:31:45,647 --> 01:31:48,148
Yee-haw! Whoo!

1403
01:31:48,275 --> 01:31:50,150
(all cheering)
