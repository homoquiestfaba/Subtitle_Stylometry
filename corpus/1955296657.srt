00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,233
[Voiceover] Truth
is if it's (mumbles).

00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,500
(speaking in a foreign language)

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,667
(mumbling television)

00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,233
(ominous music)

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Mr Beezly.

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,133
Mr Beezly.

12
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,633
Are you there?

13
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:40,467
(cat meowing)

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,633
There you are.

15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,133
I give you tasty food.

16
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,067
(dramatic music)

17
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,400
(cat screeching)

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,233
Mr Beezly.

19
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:08,067
Arnie.

20
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,100
I'm coming, I'm coming.

21
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,900
You okay mommy?

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,400
(cat screeching)

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,233
I'm okay,

24
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,333
it's the cat.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Mr Beezly.

26
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,667
(cat screeching)

27
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,333
It's very strange.

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,767
(cat screeching)

29
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,233
He maybe (mumbles).

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,467
Oh Mr Beezly.

31
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,067
Mr Beezly.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,633
Oh he's not breathing.

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,867
Oh Mr Beezly, oh.

34
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,433
Oh Mr Beezly.

35
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,100
Oh my god.

36
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,167
[Arnie] Mommy, mommy.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,900
Mommy, mommy.

38
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,600
(woman crying hysterically)

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,433
Mommy.

40
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,533
(upbeat music)

41
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,467
(man growling)

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,733
But Bill,

43
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm hardly putting
anything in it.

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,467
And don't you cut them
into chunks that large

45
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,400
or Mr Grizzly will get,

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,533
will get angry.

47
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,800
(upbeat cheerful music)

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Now you're angry?

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,333
(man grunting)

50
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,500
You know what?

51
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,233
Leave me alone.

52
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,667
[Voiceover] Leave me alone.

53
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,900
You're crazy (mumbles).

54
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,533
This is not my problem.

55
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,433
(mumbles)

56
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,367
You are filthy cheaters.

57
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,733
But let us see,

58
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,967
how do you know it is our fault?

59
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:07,700
It could be a case of distemper.

60
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,767
Or rabies.

61
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,600
Rabies.

62
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,900
No Mr Grizzly,

63
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,733
my mother only by this produce.

64
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,067
Me (mumbles) cat not
a (mumbles) once.

65
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,367
So do not tell me that
it's a case of rabies.

66
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:24,533
Because not even the best
vet would believe it.

67
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,967
What do you want me to do?

68
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,867
It must be indigestion?

69
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,900
Indigestion?

70
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,400
Huh look.

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,933
Look.

72
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,700
(dramatic music)

73
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,633
[Mr Grizzly] Oh my god.

74
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,067
See how Mr Beezly ended up.

75
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,700
Due (mumbles) cat food.

76
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,933
On top of that my mother,

77
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,600
(sniffling)

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,667
my mother is in hospital,

79
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,433
because of heart attack.

80
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,067
And if she happen to die,

81
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,467
I will hunt you down.

82
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,667
What's the matter Mr Grizzly?

83
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,367
Nothing, nothing boys.

84
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,633
This madman keeps saying
that our famous cat food

85
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,300
is in poor condition.

86
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,133
Go away boy and leave me alone.

87
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,767
Don't play with me.

88
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,700
Or I'll shove the
cat down your throat.

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,967
Keep it easy boy,

90
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,500
it must be a solution.

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
A solution,

92
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,800
of course there is a solution.

93
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,800
(cats meowing)

94
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,133
En,

95
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,067

Well guys this has to happen.

98
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,367
Sooner or later.

99
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,800
But Mr Grizzly,

100
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,467
what is going to be come of us?

101
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,700
I don't know guys,

102
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,400
but two handsome
young boys like you,

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,667
you'll find a job right away.

104
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,433
These times are hard,

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,967
be strong boys.

106
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,567
Guys you can still live in here

107
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,467
until I sell the factory.

108
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,067
You can keep rats away.

109
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:27,867
See you.

110
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,100
(dramatic music)

111
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,800
(bell chiming)

112
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,267
(crying)

113
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
(mumbles),

114
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,467
just yesterday we were
together (mumbles).

115
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,567
(crying)

116
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,500
And just like that brothers

117
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
concludes our goodbye
to Jose Swartz

118
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,067
known as Lokito.

119
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,167
(organ music)

120
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,133
(bell chiming)

121
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,400
Psst, psst hey.

122
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,567
Ted, my favorite butcher,

123
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,433
they told me that you get fired.

124
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,067
Ho, don't remind me about it.

125
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,567
[Undertaker] Okay no problem,

126
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,567
I guess you've come
for your stuff.

127
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,667
Yeah you have anything?

128
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Of course man.

129
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,167
The old Undertaker

130
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,433
always saves something
for his friends.

131
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,467
The usual right?

132
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,467
Do you need to ask?

133
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,667
Great harvest as I always say,

134
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,067
there's nothing
as cemetery soil.

135
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,300
It's the best fertilizer.

136
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,533
Thanks Taker.

137
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,933
Hey don't smoke
it all in one go.

138
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,133
I won't have anymore
until next month.

139
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,433
(whistling off key)

140
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,067
(birds chirping)

141
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,067
(upbeat music)

142
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:52,600
Hi Bill.

143
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,833
(Bill grunts)

144
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,833
(upbeat music)

145
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,667
I'm going to make some tea.

146
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,600
(groaning)

147
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,433
(birds chirping)

148
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,267
(hooter sounding)

149
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,100
(brakes beeping)

150
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,300
(upbeat music)

151
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,767
Hope it can help me

152
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,467
with the headache.

153
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,367
(upbeat music)

154
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,900
(bang)

155
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
[Mr Grizzly] (mumbles)

156
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,433
where are you boys?

157
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:22,067
(upbeat music)

158
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,433
You'll see they're
silly but they

159
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,333
good boys.

160
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,933
Mr Grizzly,

161
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,667
what are you doing here?

162
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,067
Uh, Bill, Ted.

163
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,533
What am I doing here?

164
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,200
My beloved ignorant fools.

165
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,067
Today I'm start
up a new business.

166
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,900
Oh did the judge
lift them by-law?

167
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,767
No you bone heads.

168
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,367
I sold the company.

169
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,767
Did you sell the company?

170
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,867
And where we will live now?

171
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,900
Do not worry you will be the

172
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,967
nutcases working in the factory.

173
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,200
I don't understand,

174
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,500
Mr Grizzly who did you
sell the factory to?

175
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Mr Morris.

176
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:16,067
Let me introduce you
to the new owner.

177
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:22,067
An American entrepreneur
who saved me from bankruptcy

178
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,733
by buying the factory.

179
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,900
Which from now on will be
called Lotus Cat Food factory.

180
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,200
A cat food factory boss?

181
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,067
That's it Bandit,

182
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,967
because of our
experience Mr Morris

183
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,533
wants us to start a new era
in cat food manufacturing.

184
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,200
Mr Morris.

185
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,233
I belong to a big family

186
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:55,300
that's been manufacturing
the best cat food in America

187
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,833
for seven decades.

188
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,067
A big company,

189
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,567
Lotus Cat Food.

190
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,167
We wanna expand

191
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,633
and offer the Spanish

So after meeting Mr Grizzly in,

194
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,333
after meeting Mr Grizzly

195
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,300
he offered me a chance
to open up a factory.

196
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,833
A (mumbles).

00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,767

Woman?

00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,633
So starting tomorrow

203
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,500

Lotus Cat Food.

207
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,400
Welcome to the big family.

208
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,133
That's it,

209
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:48,067
well boys you already knew

210
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,667
what you have to do,

211
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:51,867
Mr Morris.

212
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:54,967
But Mr Grizzly,

213
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,967
what do we do with Dorothy now?

214
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,600
Get rid of it,

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,267
now you've got Toto.

216
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,767
And as I was saying
to you Mr Morris,

217
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:12,233
I will show you where you
can eat the best paella.

218
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,333
[Mr Morris] I
don't want paella,

219
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,833
I want woman.

220
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,500
(ominous music)

221
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:21,867
Toto?

222
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,567
(grunting)

223
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,567
(groaning)

224
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:42,767
I think we have to fine
tune it a little bit.

225
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,067
(laughing)

226
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,167
[Voiceover] Extra, extra.

232
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,500
(crowd cheering)

233
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,267
Don't taste the sweets
that they give to us.

234
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:52,433
The Lord wanted the
Grizzly (mumbles).

235
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,667
What do you think about
your company Mr Morris?

236
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,067
What the fuck.

237
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,700
(banging)

238
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,733
Do you think we are done?

239
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,300
(groaning)

240
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,767
Then let's go try it.

241
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,433
(upbeat music)

242
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:17,933
You two.

243
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,367
Mrs Livingston.

244
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,900
Is there anything
wrong Mrs Livingston?

245
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,300
You've been hammering
whole night long.

246
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,333
Yes,

247
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,300
we've been working.

248
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,600
[Mrs Livingston] I had
to get up eight times.

249
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,267
Six to go to the bathroom

250
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,933
and three because you
won't let me sleep.

251
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,500
(upbeat music)

252
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,300
Friends and neighbours
of Villa Catalina

253
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,433
it's an honor to share
these words of joy

254
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,433
with all of you.

255
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:13,267
Along with affection
and warm (mumbles)

256
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:16,400
to receive this
great business man.

257
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,467
He will make our cats
lick of pleasure.

258
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,367
And of course also our pockets.

259
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,933
[Mrs Livingston] I'm
going to destroy you.

260
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,667
Look, look what I'm
doing with your machine.

261
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,500
Mrs Livingston,

262
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,333
don't do it,

263
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,500
or you will break it.

264
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,800
And Mr Grizzly will get angry.

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,967
[Mrs Livingston]
Stop my (mumbles).

266
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,233
Mrs Livingston.

267
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,133
[Mrs Livingston] Oh help me.

268
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,100
Mrs Livingston.

269
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,467
[Mrs Livingston] Oh help me.

270
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:44,867
Turn it off.

271
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:45,867
Turn it off.

272
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,333
And with no more delays

273
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,600
let me introduce to you

274
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,900
the architect of all this,

275
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
just arrived from America

276
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,533
Mr Morris.

277
00:20:58,533 --> 00:20:59,833
(upbeat music)

278
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,267
(crowd cheering)

279
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,867
(upbeat music)

280
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:25,600
The main objective
of Lotus Cat Food,

281
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,300
which comes from my
homeland is to offer all you

282
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,200
Spanish people a
stunning hew range

283
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,700
of flavor.

284
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,733
And taste of excellence.

285
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,500
Forever more it
is for me an honor

286
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,433
to announce that Lotus
Cat Food has been chosen

287
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,833
(mumbles) sponsor for
the annual cat fair.

288
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,533
Which is going to take
place in your town

289
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:48,700
within a week.

290
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,167
What have you done?

291
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:05,867
Mr Grizzly we've
had a little accident.

292
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,367
You told me that something
happened with Mrs Livingston,

293
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,167
where is she?

294
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,067
There.

295
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,333
And over there.

296
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,333
But what have you
done you animals?

297
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,267
We didn't do
anything Mr Grizzly.

298
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,467
She's (mumbles)

299
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:31,600
and, and, and, and, and, and

300
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
the machine switch on

301
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,567
and I can't understand it.

302
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,467
Let's see,

303
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,300
calm down.

304
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,267
That was an accident.

305
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,700
And the important
thing now is to get

306
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,200
rid of the pieces.

307
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:56,567
Shall we fully grind them?

308
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,100
No, (mumbles) of beast.

309
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,133
(cat meowing)

310
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,367
Mr Grizzly let go of it.

311
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:04,900
What are you saying?

312
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,667
Oh it's not you Mr Grizzly.

313
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,233
It's the cat,

314
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,900
named him after you.

315
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,067
I hope you don't mind,

316
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,433
as you are so nice to us.

317
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,100
Bunch of retarded.

318
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,767
He's eating Mrs Livingston.

319
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,500
Clean all this and
get rid of the pieces.

320
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,667
Damn,

321
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,067
I never saw you
eating so ferociously

322
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,533
my little Grizzly.

323
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
Do you like Mrs Livingston?

324
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,267
Hey, do you like Mrs Livingston?

325
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:45,533
Boys I think I have the
solution to our problem.

326
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,367
Tonight Lotus Cat Food

327
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,500
will begin his revolution.

328
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,167
(laughter)

329
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:12,167
(dog barking)

330
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,167
(ominous footsteps)

331
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:33,067
Hey howdy.

332
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,867
Do you have a black
cat calf here?

333
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:42,367
Spaniards.

334
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:58,400
(ominous music)

335
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
(crickets chirping)

336
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,300
I still can't
believe Mr Grizzly

337
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,967
asked us to do this.

338
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,967
You just had it Bill.

339
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,200
(growling)

340
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:32,533
There is the only way
to get out of poverty.

341
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:36,333
And whenever Mr
Grizzly say something,

342
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,267
he's right.

343
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,133
I know Bill but

344
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,467
do you think what
we are going to do

345
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,300
is right?

346
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,067
Now.

347
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,600
(meowing)

348
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,900
(screaming)

349
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:17,433
(bell chiming)

350
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,167
(ominous music)

351
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't worry Mr priest,

352
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,633
every problem has its solution.

353
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,900
You want us to fix the
roof of the church,

354
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,300
we'll fix it and all is okay.

355
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,233
Money fixes everything.

356
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,933
(mumbles) says
judgement day is near

357
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,400
and sinner and
corrupted one shall burn

358
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,167
in the cells of hell.

359
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,633
Oh whatever you say.

360
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:55,467
Goodbye.

361
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,100
(ominous music)

362
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,600
Mr Grizzly we are here.

363
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
[Mr Grizzly] Shh,
keep your voice down.

364
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,333
You idiots.

365
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,600
Keep your voice down.

366
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,667
What do we do with her?

367
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:36,300
Lay her on the
machine and tie her up.

368
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,833
Come on, come on.

369
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:41,933
Tie her up.

370
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,733
Tie her,

371
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,567
tie her.

372
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,133
What have you done,

373
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:52,967
you mad men.

374
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,467
It's Sophia.

375
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,400
The preachers niece.

376
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,233
Sophia.

377
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,833
It was very dark Mr Grizzly.

378
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,300
We couldn't see who she was.

379
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,633
I can't put up with you.

380
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,567
Okay Grizzly calm down,

381
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:12,933

382
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,867
But Mr Grizzly do
you think what we are

383
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,633

384
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:22,067
(groaning)

385
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,467
We'll go to hell.

386
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,400
Listen to me,

387
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,067
I am the one

388
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,067
who say what is wrong
and what is right.

389
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,733
And this is perfectly right.

390
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,167
So let's go to work.

391
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,900
There are plenty
of cats to feed.

392
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,367
(groaning)

393
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:44,100
Come on lemon heads

394
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,767
Quickly because she's awakening.

395
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,767

396
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,100

397
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,500
Shut up you stupid girl.

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,900
Shut her mouth I can't stand it.

399
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,300
Shut up, shut up.

00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,867
Look, look, look how the
machine is swallow her.

401
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,767

00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:29,100
Lotus Cat Food will
be rich and famous.

406
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:36,633
[Voiceover] Grinding complete.

407
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,300
(ominous music)

408
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,633
Stop, stop.

409
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,900
(mumbling)

410
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,167
(radio playing)

411
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,967
Mommy I'm home.

412
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,867
How are you mom?

413
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,267
[Voiceover] I'm all right son.

414
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,433
I'm all right.

415
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:42,900
Love you.

416
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:47,400
(radio playing)

417
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,233
Oops.

418
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,867
Mr Beezly the 2nd.

419
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,200
Mr Beezly.

420
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,333
Look what I have for you.

421
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,467
How hungry are you
Mr Beezly the 2nd.

422
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:10,400
Good girl.

423
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,333
(mumbles) walks in circles

424
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,133
before eating,

425
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,600
and now he's gone
straight to his plate.

426
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:35,900
(ominous music)

427
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,333
Mr Grizzly.

428
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,233
Can we come in?

429
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,800
Come in, come in.

430
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,533
What can I do for you boys?

431
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,067
Mr Grizzly

432
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,433
we need a rest.

433
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:13,667
What no rest.

434
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:17,067
More than ever we
must go on producing.

435
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:20,600
People want more food
and I want more money.

436
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,700
So we can't disappoint
anyone, right?

437
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,167
(grunting)

438
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,933
But Mr Grizzly
Bills hands hurt

439
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:36,067
and my headache is
becoming stronger.

440
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,133
What can I do?

441
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,067
We can't stop now
to keep producing.

442
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,233
But, but...

443
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,067
No buts.

444
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,867
Back to work.

445
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:45,933
[Voiceover] Machine on.

446
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,767
(laughing)

447
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,633
(upbeat music)

448
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,233
(screaming)

449
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:27,333
(upbeat music)

450
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,400
(screaming)

451
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,933
(upbeat music)

452
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,200
(thunder crashing)

453
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,767
I must congratulate you

454
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:05,700
on obtaining the best
results in the past 30 years.

455
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,233
Congratulate the
operation for me.

456
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,867
But as you know within
the next two days

457
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,400
we celebrate the
annual feline fair

458
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,267
which is a great
opportunity for us.

459
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:18,300
You see if the
judges and organizers

460
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,467
like our canned food we can
obtain a juicy fat contract.

461
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,567
Do you know what that means?

462
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:26,833
Money.

463
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,500
That's why we must
innovate the product

464
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,833
and make it something more.

465
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:31,667
New?

466
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,500
Hmm,

467
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,500
yes maybe.

468
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,833
Something more.

469
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,900
(mumbles)

470
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,267
Exactly.

471
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,233
We must ensure that all cats,

472
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,933
not only in Spain,

473
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,200
but all over the world

474
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,533
eat our product.

475
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,733
Let me handle this Mr Morris.

476
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:53,700
We will begin working on
a more addictive food.

477
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,933
The new Lotus Cat
Food golden line.

478
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:57,767
Golden.

479
00:36:58,833 --> 00:36:59,667
I like it.

480
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:01,833
Perfect.

481
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
Buy now, here's the fee.

482
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:12,333
(phone ringing)

483
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,267
[Voiceover] Mr Morris,

484
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,867
the mayors secretary has called.

485
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,167
Tell him...

486
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,500
Good morning to everybody.

487
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,733
What can I do
for you this time?

488
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:29,800
Let's see.

489
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,400
I basically came to
congratulate you.

490
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,233
I've learned about
the great success

491
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:36,300
of the new Lotus Cat Food.

492
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,100
And I said I must
visit to Mr Morris

493
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,067
in person to deeply
congratulate him.

494
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,100
Yeah we're making it big.

495
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,067
That's right see,

496
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:49,400
we've approved a new
law at the city council

497
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,100
about canned food,

498
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,433
and of course...

499
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,633
How much this time?

500
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,933
Mr Morris you offend me.

501
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,567
But a 20% would be enough.

502
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,400
Oh outstanding.

503
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,267
I didn't expect less from you.

504
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,967
It's great to see how
money fixes everything.

505
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,800
Well I'm sorry I
can't stay longer

506
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,900
but I had to meet
with the holy priest.

507
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,500
His niece has disappeared.

508
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,067
Gentlemen see you.

509
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,433
Politics.

510
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,700
Hey boys.

511
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
(mumbling)

512
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,067
(cat meowing)

513
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,967
What do you want?

514
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,933
More food?

515
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,767
You already eat.

516
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,767
I will give you no more.

517
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,367
And don't be bad.

518
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,833
(screaming)

519
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,267
(cat screeching)

520
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,867
[Arnie] Are you okay mommy?

521
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,667
Mommy.

522
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,400
(crying)

523
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,667
(groaning)

524
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,067
(groaning)

525
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,267
(cellphone ringing)

526
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,500
It's my boss.

527
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,667
You better go.

528
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,867
Mr Gualtieri can I help you?

529
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,400
Can you help me?

530
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,600
Well can you help me.

531
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,367
You were supposed to
let me know the news.

532
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,100
And you were
supposed to inform me

533
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,500
of everything daily.

534
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,400
Okay Mr Gualtieri,

535
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,100
I've been a little bit busy.

536
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,267
These Spaniards are driving
me a little bit crazy.

537
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,367
And the mayor is
enacting new laws

538
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,933
to make more money.

539
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,900
Well if the mayor's
causing a problem

540
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
you already know what to do.

541
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,067
And by the way I'm still waiting

542
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:02,333
for you to send me the
samples of the new product.

543
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,600
Okay Mr Gualtieri.

544
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,100
Okay.

545
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,867
I'm going to be sending
you something very special

546
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:09,700
very soon.

547
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,067
These red necks
(mumbles) so bad,

548
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:17,267
but they a little bit dopey.

549
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,267
But they put interest.

550
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:20,500
Yeah we'll see.

551
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,267
Hey listen I set you to Spain

552
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:24,200
to save money on
the minimum costs.

553
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,100
You understand what I'm saying?

554
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,867
And now what,

555
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,533
and now you already
spent much more

556
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:31,067
than anticipated.

557
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,367
I gotta tell you the truth,

558
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,233
I'm not very happy.

559
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:35,667
Piece of shit.

560
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,200
Well sometimes it is necessary

561
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
to cover my (mumbles).

562
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,067
Shut the hell up.

563
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,167
Hey listen I want those samples

564
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,500
and I want 'em this week.

565
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,700
You understand?

566
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,933
And I want you to
start production soon.

567
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:49,600
Any more delays
and you're going to

568
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,233
spend the rest of
your short life

569
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,500
selling encyclopedias
ya piece of shit.

570
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,333
Encyclopedias.

571
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,567
(sighs)

572
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
(mechanics beeping)

573
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,633
(grunting)

574
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:37,133
(mechanics beeping)

575
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,367
How are you boys?

576
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,467
Tired Mr Grizzly.

577
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,600
We haven't slept in days.

578
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,433
My head hurts badly.

579
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:10,967
And Billy has
broken out in a rash

580
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:12,400
on his face.

581
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,367
(grunting)

582
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,067
Come on, come on.

583
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,500
It's not that bad.

584
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,833
Here you are boys,

585
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,067
you deserve it.

586
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,900
Wow Mr Grizzly
what a nice gesture.

587
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:41,133
[Mr Grizzly] You
like sweets, huh Bill.

588
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,233
We are very grateful.

589
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:48,367
You know that I want
the best for my boys

590
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:52,067
and even more if you are
doing an excellent job

591
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,067
tell me what else
can I do for you?

592
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,500
Now that you say it,

593
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,767
we'd like a uniform.

594
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
A uniform?

595
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,267
Yes like the ones
that mechanics wear.

596
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:17,333
All right you'll have them.

597
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:20,167
Oh Mr Grizzly
thank you so much.

598
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,700
But before that,

599
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,500
you've got to do
something for me.

600
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,267
Whatever you want Mr Grizzly.

601
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,933
As you already know

602
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:31,267
in a very short time

603
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:34,233
a juicy contract
will set on the line

604
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:37,067
on you to make a
new better product.

605
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,267
Don't they like
our current one?

606
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,867
Yes it's perfect.

607
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:45,733
But I need you to press
those moronic brains

608
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,667
you have and make me a new,

609
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,533
a new mix.

610
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:50,133
A more addictive for me.

611
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:52,267
What I need is that

612
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:55,067
the more the cats
eat our product

613
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,267
the more they want it.

614
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:00,233
Do you understand?

615
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:02,833
I think so Mr Grizzly.

616
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,500
These are my boys.

617
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,400
(cat meowing)

618
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,467
Let's see how you respond.

619
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,667
(cats meowing)

620
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,233
Hey.

621
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,200
(dramatic music)

622
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,700
(cat meowing)

623
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,933
That's enough.

624
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:08,433
I won't feed you more.

625
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:10,600
Arnie whose cat is that?

626
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,767
Why is Mr Beezly
the 2nd in a cage?

627
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:21,967
(cat screeching)

628
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,833
(screaming)

629
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,567
(cat screeching)

630
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,200
(whistling)

631
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:05,067
(bell chiming)

632
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:11,633
(ominous music)

633
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:30,700
[Ted] Hi Taker.

634
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,200
Hey Ted you want your stuff?

635
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:39,067
Let me see I think it's here.

636
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:39,900
I got it.

637
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,733
Here you are.

638
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:46,233
To be honest I don't know
exactly what you want to do.

639
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,933
Whether you want to
throw a big time party

640
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:50,833
or commit suicide.

641
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:55,067
This potion will make your
soul shoot out of your body.

642
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,433
What's in it?

643
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,600
Can't you guess?

644
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,267
(ominous music)

645
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,467
Do you think it will
be addictive enough?

646
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,067
You know what,

647
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,233
you're scaring me.

648
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:19,900
(ominous music)

649
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:00,067
(upbeat music)

650
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:04,133
(cat screeching)

651
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,867
(upbeat music)

652
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,533
What's his name?

653
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:13,400
Toby.

654
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,233
Oh.

655
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:18,833
It was a cat.

656
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,067
Don't worry,

657
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:22,200
if you see that he gets worse

658
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,100
don't hesitate about
calling a doctor.

659
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,267
Here you have his
telephone number.

660
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:28,533
Okay, thanks.

661
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:31,967
Mr Arnie Beezly.

662
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,800
It's me.

663
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:39,067
[Voiceover] Dr West we are
waiting for you in the OR.

664
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:43,933
Hello.

665
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,500
Can I come in Miss?

666
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,433
Oops.

667
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:52,600
Sorry.

668
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:15,600
For god sake what is this?

669
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,700
Is that a cat,

670
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,733
or did (mumbles).

671
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,467
Yeah (mumbles).

672
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:24,133
Well and what happened to him?

673
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:27,400
Indigestion.

674
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,100
Indigestion?

675
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,933
Yes.

676
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:36,267
Well, he climbed
through the window

677
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,067
and he had eaten so much

678
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,967
he could not keep his balance

679
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,067
and fell to the floor.

680
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,533
And (mumbles) caused this?

681
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:56,700
(mumbles)

682
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,967
Well what do you want from me?

683
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,700
[Arnie] An autopsy.

684
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,667
An autopsy?

685
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,200
Yeah.

686
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,867
On what part of the cat?

687
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:10,733
Hey Doctor, what I wanna know

688
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,833
is if he ate poison food.

689
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,067
(groaning)

690
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,300
(cat meowing)

691
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:32,700
(cat screeching)

692
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,967
[Voiceover] Ah shit.

693
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:36,200
What's wrong?

694
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,467
Your stupid cat scratched me.

695
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,633
Leave the cat alone
and come here.

696
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,200
(cat screeching)

697
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,533
(screaming)

698
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:02,300
(phone ringing)

699
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,533
Hello.

700
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:08,867
[Voiceover] Hello
this is Dr (mumbles).

701
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:10,333
Oh yeah tell me.

702
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,433
Well I didn't find
poisoned (mumbles).

703
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:14,267
Are you sure?

704
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:15,500
Completely.

705
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,267
What is weird I
found human cells

706
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:19,367
in cat blood.

707
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,867
(dramatic music)

708
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,867
Hey you what are you
doing with these flags?

709
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:29,700
Put it up.

710
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,700
Mr Morris.

711
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,200
Well, well.

712
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:37,067
What a mess hey Mr Morris.

713
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,400
Well Mr Mayor,

714
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,600
what do I deserve this
honorable visit for?

715
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,300
Nothing, nothing.

716
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,767
Just wanted to see
how things are going.

717
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:49,867
And don't forget if
you need anything

718
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,267
whatever it is,

719
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:53,533
I'll be here for you.

720
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:54,833
But what's new?

721
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,067
Talking about the that.

722
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:59,233
The city council, we've
approved a new law

723
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:00,200
that says...

724
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,900
How much?

725
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,867
Not much,

726
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,367
almost nothing.

727
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:06,200
50%.

728
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:08,700
Here you are.

729
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:17,267
Hey chikas.

730
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:19,667
[Voiceover] Hey Mr Morris.

731
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:21,400
Hey girls nice to see ya.

732
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,233
[Voiceover] It's okay?

733
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:24,233
Ah Lotus Cat Food.

734
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:27,433
Yeah for the cats
who love people.

735
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:29,067
Ah chikas, oh yeah.

736
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:33,200
(ominous music)

737
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,267
Listen to me carefully

738
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,800
and I'll hope
everything's ready.

739
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,533
Tomorrow is the great day

740
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:43,200
and we need tonight the
best of you to begin

741
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:48,700
to produce this special
meat we talk about.

742
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,767
But Mr Grizzly,

743
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:51,767
we're tired.

744
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:56,867
And you promised
us work uniforms

745
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,067
and we haven't get it yet.

746
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:05,233
Yes well you see
I've ordered them but

747
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:08,233
you won't have them
until next year.

748
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,067
(grunting)

749
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:15,233
Bill said we'll wait for
the uniforms to get here.

750
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:19,133
Your stupid uniforms
will never come,

751
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:22,567
(mumbles) that you wear.

752
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:27,367
So move you're asses
and go to work now.

753
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:33,167
We will not do anything
until the uniforms get here.

754
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:35,433
Are you idiots?

755
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:39,400
I said go to work you melons.

756
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,967
What are you doing?

757
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:42,100
Go away.

758
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,267
(arguing)

759
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,067
(ominous music)

760
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:17,067
[Voiceover] Grinding complete.

761
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:33,367
(cat meowing)

762
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:40,233
(knocking)

763
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:41,433
[Arnie] Hello?

764
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:42,600
Can I come in?

765
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
Hey who are you?

766
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,300
Well,

767
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
see,

768
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,433
I...

769
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:56,200
Are you from
the public health?

770
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,900
Yes, that's it.

771
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,067
Oh.

772
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,633
Come in, come in.

773
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:09,233
(upbeat music)

774
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:14,500
May I...

775
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:18,300
Yeah come in, come in.

776
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,067
You are in your home.

777
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:22,467
So.

778
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:33,133
Where do you made
famous Lotus Cat Food?

779
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,333
(grunting)

780
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,333
What did you say?

781
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,600
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

782
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,100
Only silly things.

783
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:42,633
Shh, shut up.

784
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,867
(ominous music)

785
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,867
What kind of raw
material do you use?

786
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:52,067
Raw material?

787
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:53,333
Raw material.

788
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,500
What kind meat do you use?

789
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,267
(grunting)

790
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:02,200
That's a secret.

791
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,067
Yeah, anyway we don't have
anymore here at the moment.

792
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:12,900
But we are just
waiting for more.

793
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,567
(laughing)

794
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:22,700
(ominous music)

795
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,767
was saying,

796
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,067
better if I (mumbles).

797
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,533
Yes that's better.

798
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:33,767
See you next time.

799
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:34,600
Bye-bye.

800
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:47,333
[Voiceover] What
is the location?

801
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,400
[Voiceover] The
deputies have backed off,

802
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,367
I need you to slow down.

803
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,467
Where you at?

804
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,467
Okay are you telling me that

805
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:56,867
the famous cat food company use

806
00:59:56,867 --> 00:59:59,600
human flesh to
put in their cans?

807
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:04,167
That is something that
I was trying to tell you

808
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,133
for an hour.

809
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,733
Why do you say those things?

810
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,333
Dr (mumbles)

811
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:15,133
had human blood in his blood.

812
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,533
But this blood could be yours.

813
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:21,567
You telling me that
this cat scratched you.

814
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,800
Maybe, but there be more.

815
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,933
Inside the Lotus factory

816
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:29,300
and I see with my own eyes

817
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,400
a human head.

818
01:00:35,467 --> 01:00:39,933
Trust me Lieutenant you must
investigate this factory

819
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:42,700
because something
terrible there.

820
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,100
That's enough.

821
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,100
I warn you again Lieutenant
investigate this factory.

822
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,967
(phone ringing)

823
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,467
Yeah who's this?

824
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,233
What?

825
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:03,067
Are you ready?

826
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:05,067
No I hate cats.

827
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,700
(ominous music)

828
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,733
Morning boss.

829
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:20,667
Morning.

830
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,367
Okay tell me the story.

831
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:25,733
Well it seems the lady
here was attacked by her cat

832
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:27,867
and a neighbour had
to come to rescue her

833
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,500
or she would have been killed.

834
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,733
Okay could you tell
me the real story now

835
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,900
and only the facts please.

836
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,533
Ah excuse me Mr Colombus,

837
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:42,067
but the lady's in shock
after what happened so,

838
01:01:42,067 --> 01:01:44,533
anyway when I got here
she told me that the cat

839
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,067
was eating as usual
and suddenly got crazy

840
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:48,433
and attacked her.

841
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,333
Are you sure you
didn't hurt the animal

842
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,167
in anyway?

843
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,067
No.

844
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:57,533
Just in case what did
you give it for food?

845
01:01:57,533 --> 01:02:00,567
Hey I am the one
asking questions here.

846
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:04,133
Just in case what do
you give him for food?

847
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,067
Uh Lotus Cat Food.

848
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:08,767
She said that ever
since she started

849
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,533
to feed the animal with that

850
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:12,500
it's not exactly
acting like himself.

851
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,867
It's behaving badly.

852
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:14,800
Badly?

853
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,900
What do you mean?

854
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,967
I told you lieutenant,

855
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,533
this factory smells like death.

856
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,967
(mumbles)

857
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:26,767
the damn thing or what?

858
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:29,533
(cat screeching)

859
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:35,167
Who hires these people?

860
01:02:36,233 --> 01:02:38,800
(upbeat music)

861
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,733
(crickets chirping)

862
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,433
(upbeat music)

863
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,800
[Voiceover] What
are you trying to do?

864
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,633
What?

865
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,500
Who it is?

866
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,233
Come on,

867
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:43,500
do something useful and help me.

868
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,600
Wait.

869
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,933
Be very careful.

870
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:48,800
They can see you.

871
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:53,767
They're (mumbles) inside.

872
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:55,933
(mumbles)

873
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,100
They made cat food
with human flesh.

874
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,867
You watch too much movies huh.

875
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:12,533
Yeah, some.

876
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,867
But it's not what you think.

877
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,933
Well never mind,

878
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:19,567
I have to go catch my cat.

879
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:20,400
Wait.

880
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:23,167
Yes.

881
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,067
I...

882
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:28,067
Are you nervous because of me?

883
01:04:29,067 --> 01:04:29,833
No.

884
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:33,867
I just sweat a lot.

885
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:36,767
I like sweating.

886
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:39,300
[Woman] Disgusting.

887
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,267
So are you going
to let me go in?

888
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:43,100
Yes.

889
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:43,933
No.

890
01:04:43,933 --> 01:04:45,467
Wait,

891
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:46,567
listen to me.

892
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,367
Come back tomorrow.

893
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:56,100
All right when I
was a little girl

894
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,433
they always told me that
the fool of the town

895
01:04:58,433 --> 01:04:59,767
is always right.

896
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:02,233
What?

897
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,233
It's okay.

898
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,667
What are you doing still there?

899
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:09,833
Come here now.

900
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,467
Come closer I don't bite.

901
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:24,300
Yes.

902
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,633
You've never been
alone with a girl huh.

903
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:29,467
No.

904
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:31,900
You notice?

905
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:34,167
Well don't,

906
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:37,567
don't worry for the cat.

907
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,067
We will find him in the morning.

908
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:45,067
Well I don't love him so much,

909
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,267
he's not mine really.

910
01:05:47,267 --> 01:05:48,400
No.

911
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,900
He's from (mumbles).

912
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,867
(mumbles)

913
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,600
You'll meet him soon.

914
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,500
(upbeat music)

915
01:06:08,467 --> 01:06:12,300
Lotus Cat Food is the
ideal food for your pets.

916
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,600
Buy new Lotus Cat Food

917
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,533
because (mumbles).

918
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,933
(upbeat music)

919
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,067
Don't give him that Bill.

920
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:49,967
I tell you because I
already gave him before

921
01:06:49,967 --> 01:06:52,067
and he's going to
become too fat.

922
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:53,600
(grunting)

923
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,867
Ah gentlemen.

924
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,067
Oh, Mr Morris.

925
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:58,767
What a nice surprise.

926
01:07:00,733 --> 01:07:02,867
As Mr Grizzly has told you

927
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,733
today's a great day.

928
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:07,700
We expect a lot from
the new golden line.

929
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,067
Great family Lotus Cat Food.

930
01:07:12,067 --> 01:07:14,300
So congratulations.

931
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,067
And the best of luck.

932
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,067
By the way where's Mr Grizzly?

933
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:24,500
Mr Grizzly?

934
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,067
[Mr Morris] Yeah.

935
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:29,233
I don't know Mr Morris.

936
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:31,500
That's okay.

937
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:39,400
It is a great honor
for me to open this

938
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,667
annual cat fair.

939
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:46,433
Thanks to the cat association
of granny Rosemary

940
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:50,200
to the coordinators and
judges of the fair committee

941
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,167

943
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:55,667

Did anything
happen lieutenant?

951
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,500
We don't know anything
about Mr Grizzly.

952
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,700
Mr Grizzly?

953
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,800
I didn't say anything
about Mr Grizzly.

954
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,133
Oh didn't you?

955
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:32,600
No.

956
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:35,967
The fact is that there's
been several reports

957
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,133
against your factory

958
01:08:37,133 --> 01:08:39,333

(cat meowing)

972
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,300
Boys don't you think
it's a little bit

973
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,100
dirty to have cats
running around

974
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,733
like that?

975
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:27,167
Bunch of crazies.

976
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,300
(cat meowing)

977
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,300
What the hell is
wrong with your cat?

978
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,867
What the hell.

979
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,367

Don't move this is
getting interesting.

988
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,667
I warned you this is the end.

989
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,033
What is going on here?

990
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:44,200

Oh my god Bill we
must get out of here.

993
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:07,133
I told you (mumbles).

What's going on?

995
01:11:18,933 --> 01:11:19,767
Hello.

996
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,100
Oh Mr Gualtieri.

997
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,267
Don't say another word.

998
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:26,800
I'm doing the talking now,

999
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,067
do you understand?

1000
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:31,167
I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone.

1001
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:35,333
(mechanical beeping
drowns out speech)

1002
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:39,967
And you,

1003
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,433
you just go around playing
with these wet bags

1004
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,833
like it's a game.

1005
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,267
What is that noise?

1006
01:11:51,267 --> 01:11:52,433
Mr Morris,

1007
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,667

Mr Gualtieri I'm not
gonna have (mumbles).

01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:01,500
Yes that's right,

01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,533
and I won't be upset over this

1012
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:05,833
but you know something
it's bullshit.

1013
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:06,967
It's bullshit.

1014
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:07,933
Are you listening to me?

1015
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:09,767
I know Mr Gualtieri.

1016
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:12,767

1023
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:01,433
Move your asses

01:13:01,433 --> 01:13:02,733
