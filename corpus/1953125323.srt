about coming in here?

You're upset 'cause they
won't let you see her, huh?

But that's what your pa is here for.

And it's hard for him to do
what needs to be done...

and still be worrying about you.

You know what l think
you could do for him...

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,876

without making a payment on your loan.

651
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,947

- Yeah, that's true enough.

But I'm more interested
in what that banker said.

I mean, you told us that
you had money problems, but...
