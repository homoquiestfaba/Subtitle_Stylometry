Yeah, like Nicole Paterson
can compete with that?

00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:10,332
TEACHER: The soldiers of ancient Greece
fought in a phalanx.

711
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,738
Latin for finger.

712
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,114
A phalanx
is a rectangular mass military formation,

713
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:22,380
usually composed entirely
of heavy infantry.

714
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

715
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,783
The Spartan hoplites combined
with the narrow space of Thermopylae

716
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,985
made for
a seriously not-glamorous battle.

717
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,561
But I've got my own battles.

718
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,290
I'll never win Blossom Queen

719
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,300
TEACHER:
The persuasive qualities of the phalanx

720
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,997
were its relative simplicity and low cost,

721
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,109
as well as being a source
of political influence.

722
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,539
As well, sometimes when the phalanxes
were pushed at top speed,

723
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,808
they would ram.

724
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,477
Thus we learn
the term Greece Lightning.

725
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,049
Heh.

Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken...

727
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,342

Headless Horseman in <i>Sleepy Hollow.</i>

728

Not you. I mean...

The movie. What else?

753
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,318
I question the notion
that the protagonist didn't age.

754
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:42,359
There is no plot if he did grow older.
It's called a movie.

755
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,621
They didn't explain
that in the exposition, did they?

756
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,788
- Where's your suspension of disbelief?
- You know...

Anything to add, Dylan?

759
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,230
It's called time dilation, people.

760
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,239
As Einstein theorized
in the twin paradox,

761
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,708
the passage of time
is linked to the speed of the observer,

762
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,110
that traveling to and from the planet
Phaelon 250 times the speed of light

763
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,046
would virtually suspend aging, duh?
