1
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,881
- That's a little scary.
- Stop tying to wear me out.

2
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:45,723
I think-You know, you have a real hang-up
with the term "stalker."

3
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:50,927
No, I just fail to see how you showing up
at my museum everyday...

4
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,095
for, like, two weeks
makes me the stalker...

5
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:57,297
when clearly it makes you
the stalker.

6
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:00,501
The most important thing to remember here-
Hand, please.

7
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:03,339
These past two months...

8
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:07,247
have really, truly been
the happiest two months...

9
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:09,281
- of your life.
- [Laughs]

10
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:12,342
- I love you.
- Love you too.
- There you go.

11
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:16,289
W-Wait. Excuse me.
[Sing a song] Son of a bitch.

12
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,348
I keep telling this guy no olives...

13
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:20,517
and he keeps bringing me olives,
and that's a problem because-

14
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,792
- You hate olives.
- I hate olives! I hate olives.

15
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:26,389
Don't move. I'm on it.

16
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:32,900
There. Crisis averted.

17
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:39,439
You know, usually I would be
completely disgusted...

18
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,609
with someone sticking their fingers
into my drink, but with you, not so much.

19
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:49,123
In fact, it, uh- Mmm.
It adds a certain Melinda "zestiness" to it.

20
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,782
Well, we make a good team.

21
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:56,394
Yes, we do.

22
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,559
Well, I am going to go powder my nose.
[Clears Throat]

23
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,726
Oh. Do me a favor-
lf the waiter comes back...

24
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,966
would you make sure
there are no olives in my cake?

25
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:08,096
I like that.

26
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:17,677
Spence! Spence.
All right, man, it's time.

27
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:21,744
- Time for what?
- It's time for me to get engaged.

28
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,878
You were gonna put this
in her sundae, remember?

29
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:27,357
- [Whistles]
- Oh, yeah. Right. Nice rock.

30
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:29,484
Oh. Thanks.

31
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,956
[Groaning]
Oh, boy.

32
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,727
Oh. Sorry. It was packed.

33
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:43,432
- I just had to fight for a mirror.
- [Laughs]

34
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,271
Here we are.
A sundae for the gentleman.

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,335
And chocolate cake for the lady.

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,181
Actually, I think that she had
the sundae and I had the cake.

37
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,717
Oh, okay, yeah. Got it.

38
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,982
Mmm.

39
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,219
So, Mel...

40
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,352
I'm glad you stalked me...

41
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:09,263
Cause, Um...

42
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,598
I never met anyone
like you before...

43
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,864
and I, uh- I know that...

44
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:19,375
we've only been dating
a little while, but...

45
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,570
I just feel like
I have known you my-

46
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:25,705
my-my whole- my whole life.

47
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,216
Are you chewing that?

48
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:32,117
[Woman]
Oh, my God! Praise Jesus!

49
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:37,423
Praise Jesus! Oh, Calvin!
I knew you’d do it.

50
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,827
Excuse me one second. Just wanna take that-
[Chuckles]

51
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:44,126
Just a little quick
search for something.

52
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:46,929
All right. Be right back.

53
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,992
- [Woman] I'm calling Mama.
- Hi. Hi.

54
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:52,098
- I'm sorry. I think there's been a mistake.
- Mama!

55
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,404
I'm getting married, Mama.

56
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:58,070
Ma'am? Ma'am? Pardon me. Pardon me.
That's my ring.

57
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:01,344
Hang on, Mama.

58
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,475
May I help you?

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,575
Yes.

60
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,087
I'm so sorry,
but I think the waiter...

61
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,521
mistakenly brought you
the wrong sundae.

62
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:13,492
You see, that-that's
my grandmother's ring.

63
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:17,999
I think you better go sit over there
before my fiancé here...

64
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:21,331
"whups" your ass.

65
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,963
Okay, how about
I buy both of your dinners?

66
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:28,804
Good? Yes. Except I'm gonna
need that back though, so-

67
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:31,504
- Ow!
- Okay, baby, "whup" his ass!

68
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,707
- Uh, baby, the thing is-
- The thing is...

69
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:40,551
I haven't waited 17 years
on your sorry ass...

70
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:44,489
to let this white shadow
come and spoil my engagement.

71
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,993
It's either you whup his ass,
Calvin...

72
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,085
or I'll whup yours.

73
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:56,861
Yeah.
You need to go now.

74
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:00,902
- Right.
- [Woman] Mama? Yes!

75
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,998
Um, how about-

00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,736
It's beautiful.

81
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,181
Well, this wasn't exactly
what I had planned.

[Police Radio Chatter]

83
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:29,195
Look. I know we haven't
been together long...

84
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:33,170
but you know when
something just feels right...

85
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,864
and you don't want
that feeling to end?

86
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,172
Okay, Romeo, save it
for your cell mate.

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,678
Whoa. Clancy.
Give the kid a minute.

88
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,408
- Thank you.
- No problem.

89
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,386
Long story short.
I love you.

90
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:53,516
- I love you.
- Will, uh-

91

Will you, uh-

- Will you marry me?
- Yes, I will marry you.

94
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,540
Okay. Congrats and all that.

95
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,769
You have the right to remain silent.

96
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,572
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

97

I'm gonna go now.

98

Dude, are you fuckin' with me?

99
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,615
"Congratulations" might be the more
appropriate response here, Derek.

100
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,989
You've only dated her
for two months.

101
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,118
I've had this cold sore
longer than that.

102
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,391
This coming from a guy
who's been married three times.

103
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,955
Have you learned nothing
from me, man?

104
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,056
I am a cautionary tale.

105
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,569

I have suffered for your sins.

Okay. That was definitely
not a fart.

Hey, where's, uh-
Where's Seth? He's up.

116
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,436
He's looking for a ball. Didn't have time
to stop at home and get his.

117
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,874
We're in a bowling alley.
How hard is it to find a ball?

All right! I'll take it!

I'm on the D.L. tonight.

for rec league bowling, buddy.

Ron, how can you abandon me
with these two losers?

122
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:57,203
I'm not abandoning anybody.

123
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:00,144
Just 'cause I'm getting married doesn't mean
I'm not gonna be here for bowling night...

or fishing weekend or Jason’s
biannual "porno palooza."

I was talking with the mayor...

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,381
and I put a bug in his ear about having
the reception at the opera house.

- How could I forget?
- Let's go on a second honeymoon.

Maybe make a baby.

00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:43,268
Then she'd kill both of us.

171
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:46,494
What are you doing?

172
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,629
You.

173
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:54,745
- Mmm! Baby, we're in the panty.
- Oh! That's a good point.

174
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,043
[Inhales]

175
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:59,138
[Laughing]
What are you doing?

176
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,483
- Oh, my God.
- # Sex elevator#
Ding.

177
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,820
[Laughs]
You are so stupid.

178
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:20,732
Hey. Would it kill you
to buy some groceries, man?

179
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:23,534
Yeah, if the Mystics would
cover the goddamn spread, I could.

180
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:26,736
The Mystics?
You're bettin' on the W.N.B.A.?

181
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:30,749
Mm-hmm. Well, hello.
[Chuckles]

182
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:34,683
Hi. I'm-I’m Judith.
I-I work with Mel.

183
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,878
Oh, hey, Judith.
I’m Jason.

184
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:39,513
I'm, uh, Ron's best friend-
since childhood.

185
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:43,119
Yeah. And this is Seth,
his college roommate.

186
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,458
And that's Derek.
Used to be his boss. Yeah.

187
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:50,968
- Are you all in finance?
- Actually, I'm in consumer products testing.

188
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,400
[Sniffing]

189
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,938
[Sneezes]

190
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,944
- Derek, do you still work with Ron?
- No. I, uh-

191
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:05,207
I left that company a while back...

192
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,251
but, uh, I'm still
in finance, you know.

193
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:13,052
I'm telling you, man, she had a pine tree
air freshener in her underpants. Gotta go.

194
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:18,018
- What do you do?
- I am in the advertising game.

195
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,063
- Yeah.
- Advertising?

196
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:32,004
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds exciting.

197
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:35,065
It is. Yeah, it is.

198
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,343
You know, Judith, you're a friend
of Mel's and I'm a friend of Ron's...

199
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:42,316
so I'm thinkin'
we should get together.

200
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:46,012
You know, maybe-
maybe grab a pizza, fuck.

201
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,523
No? You don't like pizza?

202
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:56,321
Seriously, who doesn't like pizza?

203
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:59,696
Hey, uh, everyone?
Everyone, um-

204
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:02,634
I don't know how to say this, but...

205
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,673
Mel and I simply could not come to
an agreement on our wedding colors...

206
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:07,762
so we are breaking up.

207
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,864
Very sorry.
Everyone drive safe.

208
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,005
- [Crowd Laughing]
- Yes! Welcome back, buddy.

209
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:17,540
He was kid- He was kidding.

210
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,675
- [Stammers, Laughs]
- Sorry, Mel.

211
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,946
It's okay.

212
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,685
Anyway, uh, two short months ago...

213
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:29,355
I wandered into the Cleveland Museum
of Modern Art.

214
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:32,123
I was, of course, lost,
um, but then...

215
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:36,796
I laid eyes on the best exhibit
in the whole joint- Mel.

216
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,736
- [Crowd Sighs]
- [Scoffs]

217
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:44,368
Uh, no, I know that two months
is an awfully short time to get engaged...

218
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:48,540
but, to be honest with you,
I was ready to propose on that first day.

219
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,912
So needless to say...

220
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,351
when Mel proposed, I said yes.

221
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,409
- [Crowd Laughs]
- I didn't want to give her time...

222
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,819
to change her mind,
so we have set a date.

223
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,016
On May 31, one month from today...

224
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,218
you are all invited
to our open bar-

225
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,663
- Which will also feature
a wedding, but, you know-
- [Laughing]

226
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,929
All right, let's get drunk.

227
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,827
Hey, uh, Derek?

228
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:16,772
Why is your kid dropping a deuce
in that plant?

229
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:22,074
Jesus! Stop it! Bah! Bah!

230
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:26,706
Mmm.
[Chuckles]

231
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:29,345
Now, Abe, I've taken a look at the numbers
for last quarters.

232
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,579
I think we’ve got some dead weight.
Here, look.

233
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,748
Take a look at this.

234
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:37,055
- Hey, hey, fellas.
- [Abe] Ron, come in.

235
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,756
- Abe, you're a whiskey man, is that right?
- Absolutely.

236
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,855
All right, I got
something here for you.

237
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,091
What have we got here?

238
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,929
Mmm.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,596
Oh, that's nice.
What is this?

240
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,730
Jameson's 30-year Private Reserve.

241
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:54,299
I'm half Irish, so I gotta support the motherland.
I brought you a bottle.

242
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:57,404
You're Irish?
My mother's from Galway.

243
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:01,247
Geez, it's gonna be great to get some
more Irish blood in the family here.

244
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:04,446
You know, Todd here is English,
but we try not to think about that.

245
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:06,611
[Laughs]

246
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:09,385
- You like Cubans?
- Uh, yes.

247
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,325
- Thank you.
- From what I understand, Ron...

248
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:15,229
you're a, uh-you're a numbers man.

249
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,459
Yes, sir.
I'm a financial consultant.

250
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,931
I started out as a numbers man.

251
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:24,064
In fact, Ron, you remind me a lot of myself
when I was a young man.

252
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:27,132
We can always use more numbers men
in the company.

253
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,666
You know, it's overrun now with
too many goddamn lawyers.

254
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:33,009
No offense, Todd.

255
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,073
After all, it is a family business.

256
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,483
Well, uh, thank you, sir.
It's a very generous offer.

257
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,612
No, no, no. Abe.
You call me Abe.

258
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:43,747
Looks like you need a refill.
Todd!

259
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,190
- Yes, sir?
- Let's go find that bottle of yours, huh?

260
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,490
- Take care of that, would you?
- [Hisses]

261
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,466
So, Ron, have you heard the one about the
horny jockey and the Venezuelan stable boy?

262
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:55,935
[Ron Laughs]
No, but it sounds painful.

263
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,263
It's been a great
couple of months...

264
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:02,504
and I can honestly say
that you are the best two interns...

265
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:05,169
we have ever had here.

266
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,542
Unfortunately, we can only
hire one of you.

267
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,278
So... let the best intern win!

268
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,616
[Crowd Cheering, Hooting]

269
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:16,178
[Bell Rings]

270
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:21,550
Get in there, Maxie!
Get in there!

271
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,558
Get angry! Get angry!

272
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,655
[Cell Phone Ringing]

273
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,893
- Oh, that's not good.
- [Grunting]

274
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:34,532
- Y'ello.
- Ronny, it's Todd.

275
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:37,236
Oh, hey, Todd.
What-What's goin' on?

276
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:41,075
Oh, just a little thing called your bachelor party.
So what's the game plan?

277
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:43,170
I, uh, don't know.

278
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:46,878
My buddies are big fans
of “Two-for-Tuesday" lap dances at Spanky's.

279
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:49,045
Listen, Ron,
this is your last hurrah.

280
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,316
We gotta do this thing in style.

281
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,983
Thinkin' we fly somewhere warm, hmm?

282
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,087
Where the drinks have umbrellas,
the hotels are five stars...

283
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,596
the vagina flows like water-

284
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,895
Sweet, sticky water.

285
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:08,032
Wow. That sounds great, but some
of the guys are on tight budgets.

286
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:10,096
That's what
the company card's for, right?

287
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:14,010
I mean, like Abe said,
this is a family business.

288
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:18,174
Look, that is very generous of you,
but I can't let you pay for all that.

289
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,912
Look, I'm really happy
that you’re marrying Mel.

290
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,714
I mean, I always wanted a brother...

291
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:29,019
but unfortunately my mother
died when I was pretty young.

292
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,061
Look, I know we're
not blood or anything...

293
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,463
but, look, I would be honoured
if you would let me...

294
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,400
throw my new brother
his bachelor party.

295
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,699
Well- Of course, Todd.
Yeah. Absolutely.

296
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,761
Awesome.

297
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:47,470
Now listen, you probably
want to get some sleep, bro-ham...

298
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,571
'cause you’re gonna need it.

299
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:53,410
Wow, Todd, l-
I'm so sorry about your mom.

300
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,780
I never knew.

301
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,081
Billy, are you fucking retarded?

302
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,213
She's not dead.
She's in Phoenix...

303
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,055
with her second husband
and her third set of tits.

304
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:06,856
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah, you are.

305
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,593
Now, look.

306
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:13,431
I need recon on this guy.
Ron Simmons.

307
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,063
I wanna know everything about him-
every little detail.

308
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:21,132
Every man has his weakness, Billy,
and I wanna know his.

309
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:26,615
The old man's steppin' down soon.
I'm next in line.

310
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:30,083
I haven't been sleeping with this cow
of a daughter for the last three years...

311
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:33,849
just so Daddy's little favourite
can come in and take it from me.

312
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,947
Uh-uh.

313
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,459
Mmm. Sadly, Billy...

314
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:43,191
I just don't think this little union's
gonna make it to the altar.

315
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,288
Mmm.

316
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:48,595
- [Horn Honking]
- Let's go! I'm still sober.

317
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,160
Come on, man. The chicks in South Beach
aren't gonna fuck themselves.

318
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:57,844
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, boys.

319
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:02,349
I love you, baby doll.
See you soon. Mmm.

320
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,849
Hey- Oh! [Chuckling]
What's that for?

321
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,716
Well, you gotta buy
the groom a lap dance.

322
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:10,449
Pick a hottie.

323
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,460
See? That's why I'm marrying you.

324
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,784
- [Tires Screeching]
- Oh, shit.

325
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,296
It's my first wife. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

326
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:24,237
- Love you.
- Go, go, go. Come on, go!

327
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:31,299
[Tires Screeching]

328
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:38,572
Nice try, asshole.

329
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,381
It's your weekend with your son.
Remember?

330
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,751
Hey, it's Ron's bachelor party.

331
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,259
That is your problem,
shit for brains.

332
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,416
Ron, congratulations.

333
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,725

00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,610
These retreats offer
a very supportive environment...

502
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:34,589
where we can focus on healing
and getting on the road to recovery.

503
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:38,923
This weekend, sex will be
the farthest thing from your mind.

504
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,895
[Chattering]

505
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,723
I can't get enough of that-

506
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:49,736
- You like guns, Pop?
- What is that?

507
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:53,467
The best day of my life was the day
they gave me my 1 O-year chip.

508
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:58,140
Oh, welcome. I'm Sue Hoover,
president of the Southeast chapter.

509
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,014
Oh, nice to meet you, Sue-
All of you.

510
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:05,952
So what chapter are you from, Tubbs?
Is that your first name?

511
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,511
- Uh-
- Actually, that's his last name.

512
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:12,254
Yeah, I'm Sonny
and that's my partner Rico.

513
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,519
Yeah. And we're from
the Midwest chapter.

514
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,618
- Welcome, Sonny and Rico.
- Yeah.

515
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:18,824
So, how long have you two been
in the program?

516
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,802
- Oh, not very.
- Well, speak for yourself. Rico...

517
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:25,965
'cause I've been a member
for, oh, gosh, like, 20 years.

518
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:28,700
- Twenty years? My goodness.
- Yeah.

519
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:31,973
- Wow.
- Yeah, I got started really young.

520
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,775
- My grandpa, he was a member,
so he started teaching me early.
- [Coughs]

521
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:37,180
Oh, careful there, Suzy.

522
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:39,547
Those things are a little tricky.
You gotta be careful.

523
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah, you know, between
my grandpa and the Boy Scouts...

524
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:45,649
- it was like I was just born to be in S.A.A.
- The Boy Scouts?

525
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,126
Oh, yeah.
I did a lot of hustling in the Scouts.

526
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,184
Yeah, with the Christmas tree lot
in the winter...

527
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,824
and then goin' door to door
in the summertime- whatever it took.

528
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,926
- My scoutmaster even said
I was the best he ever had.
- [Coughs]

529
00:30:58,201 --> 00:30:59,796
- I'm fine.
- Are you all right?

530
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,963
Okay, let's not bore
the nice people...

531
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,030
with faded childhood
glories there, Sonny.

532
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:09,676
- Hey, Rico, isn't that your kid over there?
- Hmm?

533
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:12,240
Not a lot of women are comfortable
with a male "vagina ecologist"...

534
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:15,343
but I have many,
many satisfied patients.

535
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:20,018
- I am booking appointments.
- Come on.

536
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,720
- So, uh, Betty.
- Hmm?

537
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,989
You wanna maybe grab a drink later?

538
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,194
You know, talk shop? I could always
use some pointers on my technique.

539
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:32,760
Okay?
[Chuckles] Man.

540
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,740
- I need to call my sponsor.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:43,347
[Todd] Guys, let's go!
The stripper's aren't getting any younger.

542
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:48,548
- Sonny! Sonny!
- Hey!

543
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:51,348
Betty, what's-what's goin' on?

544
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:55,519
Nothing. I just really
enjoyed talking with you earlier.

545
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,426
Oh, well, th-that's cool.
Yeah.

546
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,552
[Chuckles]

547
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,964
Maybe, uh- Maybe we should
hang out, you know?

548
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:09,566
- Grab a pizza, fuck?
- [Laughs] I thought you’d never ask.

549
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,971
- Pardon?
- Well, I don't eat pizza, but whatever.

550
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:18,871
Gentlemen, I will see you later.

551
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,212
[Laughing]

552
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,246
That line has never worked.
I mean, ever.

553
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:28,313
I'm gonna be really pissed
if she doesn't murder him...

554
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:30,951
or at least harvest a kidney, man.

555

[Chattering]

557
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:46,238
Ugh! That-That pole's
gotta be covered in crabs and herpes...

558
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:48,297
and God knows what.

559
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:51,972
I am so glad I cashed in
my 401 (k), man.

560
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:55,278
- [Groans]
- Gentlemen, this booth's us.

561
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:57,409
Come on.

562
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:04,424
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- Excuse me, ladies.

563
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:08,328
I hate to interrupt this meeting
of the minds, but I got a work question.

564
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:11,694
Who wants to make $1 O, OOO
for five minutes of work?

565
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:17,100
Oh- Back, back. Yeah.
There it is. There it is.

566
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,867
- Aaah!
- Yeah!

567
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,371
Get into position.

568
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:37,055
Oh! The conquering hero
has returned.

569
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,147
[Laughing]
Yeah.

570
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:42,456
- Hey, that didn't take long, man.
- Trust me, dude.

571
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:46,227
She couldn't take much more.
I fucking killed it- Ninja style.

572
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:50,897
- Oh, yeah? What, like fast and silent?
- You know it, brother. Yeah.

573
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:55,136
Hoo. Check it out. That chick's a dead ringer
for a young Nancy Reagan.

574
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:59,702
- [Seth] So?
- I always wanted to fuck Nancy Reagan. Yeah!

575
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:02,178
[Seth]
I was always fond of Geraldine ferraro.

576
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:04,807
- Very sexy.
- Come on, bachelor.

577
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:07,044
You've got a date
in the V.I.P. room.

578
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:09,246
Go to the V.I.P. - Oh, my God.

579
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:13,221
Whoa. Hey!

580
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:17,252
Whoa! You're-You're very nimble.

581
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:20,527
Shh. Saver your energy.
You're gonna need it.

582
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:24,160
Oh.
[Laughs]

583
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:26,328
Oh, wow.

584
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,895
I've gotta get married more often.

585
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,438
Uh- Hey. Hey.

586
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,948
Maybe the belt
should stay buckled though. No?

587
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:38,914
Robin! Your mommy's on the phone.

588
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,077
- Your grandma had a heart attack.
- Nana?

589
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,621
Uh-huh.

590
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,349
Oh, my God.
That's horrible. l-

591
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:50,861
- You're not going anywhere, baby.
- Hey. Hey-Ah!

592
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,726
[Moaning]
Okay.

593
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:56,733
Hey. Hey-That's a zipper.

594
00:34:56,798 --> 00:35:00,200
- That's happening now.
- Hey, back of_

595
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,237
- He's mine.
- You can share.

596
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,295
What? What?
Oh! Oh, Lord.

597
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,776
- Maybe we've had enough. That's my leg.
- You fucking bitch!

What is Todd's deal?

611
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,494
Is he tying to get me laid
or get me killed?

612
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,863
- Hey, man, there are worse ways to die.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,367
Dudes, that chick in the corner...

614
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,531
is throwing me signals
like she’s Johnny fuckin' Bench.

615
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:16,207
She's paying more attention...

616
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:19,679
to the floating lint than you, dude.

617
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,975
All right, let's get down
to brass tacks, okay?

618
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:25,986
- Are you ready for marriage, Ron?
- I think so. Yeah.

619
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,782
Oh. So you’re ready
to say good-bye to blowjobs?

620
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:30,846
'Cause that's
the first thing that goes.

621
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:35,625
Married women don't give blowjobs.
It's a union thing, man.

622
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,855
And then your sports
that you love...

623
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,989
that's the next thing
you can kiss good-bye.

624
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:43,400
- Mel likes sports.
- No, no, no.

625
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,492
They pretend they like sports...

626
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:48,369
the same way we pretend
we like talkin' to them.

627
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,035
The only sports you're gonna get
when you're married...

628
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:53,305
is Little League T-Ball.

629
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,845
And I've seen that stuff.
and trust me, Ron.

630
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,047
Most of those kids
really fuckin' suck, okay?

631
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:03,986
And by the time they
take away the last thing...

632
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:06,685
that gives you
any pleasure at all- booze-

633
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:10,251
you've forgotten what happiness is.

634
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,728
So now you're just walking around...

635
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,892
an empty shell
of the man you once were.

636
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,368
And that's when
they leaver you, Ron. Hmm.

637
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:22,533
Claimin' that
"You're not the man I married."

638
00:37:22,604 --> 00:37:25,872
Well, no shit, hey?

639
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,504
Thanks for playin',
and here's a parting gift.

640
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:32,607
Child support and alimony
right up the ass!

641
00:37:38,452 --> 00:37:41,357
And... that's marriage, Ron.

642
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,448
You ready for that?

643
00:37:47,095 --> 00:37:49,088
- I'm gonna go pee.
- Mmm.

644
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:51,258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

645
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:57,965
I need some pills.
[Groans]

646
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:01,272
- Oh, for God's sakes. Let me help you with that.
- Oh, thanks.

647
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:03,905
Just don't get any ideas.
I'm not gonna wipe your ass later.

648
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:05,971
Ooh. My old friend codeine.

649
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,208
- Nice. Two for me, one for you?
- No, no, no.

650
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,274
- I need that stuff. man.
- Wait a minute.

651
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,322
- Can you drink with those?
- It's way better when you drink.

652
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:16,757
One beer is not gonna be a problem.

653
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:21,492
Aw, come on, man. Marriage is outdated,
Ron. We don't need 'em.

654
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:24,727
Yeah, we never should have,
uh, given women the right to vote.

655
00:38:24,797 --> 00:38:26,824
Okay, that's it.

656
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,961
Let's take it easy, shall we?

657
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:33,066
- It's been kind of a long night,
what with the gang rape and all.
- [Snoring]

658
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:36,270
Oh, God. I'm gonna walk
Sleeping Beauty back up to his room.

659
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:39,611
- Come on.
- Okay. I gotta go to the garden party.

660
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,806
- Okay, careful. Careful.
- [Indistinct]

661
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:45,183
Okay. That's good for you.

662
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,847
You guys, uh-
You guys comin', or what?

663
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:50,756

- Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm from Cleveland,
and I was noticing your shirt.

- My father is from Cleveland,
so I was brainwashed early.

Here's what we'll do, okay? lf each of us

833
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:16,645

837
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:29,754
You think you can take care of her

00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,572
Autumn, can we do this tonight,
at, like, a club or something?

849
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:23,480
These guys are not here
to play bachelor games.

850
00:51:23,546 --> 00:51:25,573
They're here to feed
their drinking problems.

851
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,846
I have everything all set up...

852
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,409
and if you start changing things now,
it'll mess everything up...

853
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:33,857
- and we won't get home in time for your surprise-
- Okay.

854
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,086
Okay. Okay.

855
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,988
Mm-hmm.

856
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:45,561
Excuse me. Hi. Hi.

857
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:48,731
It's my bachelor party,
and, well, I was just wondering...

858
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,832
if you wanted to pay a dollar to...

859
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,570
well, suck a piece
of candy off my shirt.

860
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,111
Here's 10, but leave me
the fuck alone.

[Derek]
Hey, Tommy, it's me again.

863
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:13,194
Look. I, uh-
I want to apologize for this morning.

864
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:17,222
It's-lt's not your fault
that your dad's a fuck-up.

865
00:52:17,297 --> 00:52:22,103
Just call me when you can.
I'm worried about you and-

866
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:26,133
l- I love you, okay?

867
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:28,870
Okay. Bye.

868
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:40,647
Hey, guy!
Little help here?

869
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,928
- Oh! What the hell is wrong with you?
- Just wasted a beer.

870
00:52:57,703 --> 00:53:00,301
Hi. Can I have a Jameson
on the rocks, please?

871
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,136

Hi. I'm Ron.

877
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:22,963
So, Ron, what's going on?

878
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:25,933
I am- I am here
for my bachelor party.

879
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:29,197
Your bachelor party?
Oh, well.

880
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:33,207
That bums me out.
I thought you were cute.

881
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:40,478
Oh, um, thank you.
[Laughs] I'm, uh- I'm flattered.

God, is everyone
from Cleveland this gullible?

885
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:53,287
They have done studies.
Yeah, yeah.

886
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:56,124
So, uh, when is your big day, hmm?

887
00:53:56,193 --> 00:53:58,356
Well, we just started
dating a year ago.

888
00:53:58,429 --> 00:54:03,336
So, between you, me and Tony,
I'm not exactly in a rush.

889
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:06,895
I don't wanna make a lifelong mistake.
You know what I mean?

890
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:11,539

Where's my medication?

896
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:42,865
I think the fat boy took them.

897
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:46,001
Oh, that’s just great!

898
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,105
Maybe this will help.

899
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:51,204
Thanks.

Oh. Uh, so, you, um-
You have a really nice-

You have a really nice voice.
What was that song you were singing?

902
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:05,589
That's a song I used to sing when I was a little
girl with my great-grandfather, Adolph.

- He's so sweet. He lives in South America.
- Yeah, I bet.

907
00:55:19,473 --> 00:55:21,135
- He calls me every week.
- Oh.

908
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,908
And he wants me to go to art
school like he did in Vienna.

909
00:55:23,978 --> 00:55:27,039
- Oh, art school. That's-That's fun.
- Yes.

910
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:30,450
- But I'm not interested in art.
- No.

911
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:34,458
- I like politics.
- [Laughing]

912
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:37,788
Uh, can you- can you give me,
maybe, the whole bottle?

914
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:44,891
Two months?
I see your friend's point.

915
00:55:44,964 --> 00:55:47,402
What if she turns out to be
a serial killer or something?

916
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:50,461
I was once dated a guy for six months.
He turned out to be gay.

917
00:55:50,536 --> 00:55:53,099
- Maybe you made him gay.
- Oh, I definitely made him gay.

918
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:56,474
I used to outdistance him
on the driving range by 50 yards.

919
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,570
- Pansy.
- You golf too, huh?

920
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:02,014
- Mm-hmm.
- All right. I totally would have
gone gay for you also.

921
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,021
I mean, not without the whole man-
You know what I'm saying.

922
00:56:06,085 --> 00:56:09,149
Well, sir, flattery
will get you another drink.

923
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:13,354
Wait. No, no. I can't.
I can't. I can't. I got this, uh...

Come on. It's free booze
and drunk spring break kids.

What more could you possibly
want from an evening?

931
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:40,115
Plus, we can gab about centerpieces
and bridesmaids' dresses.

932
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:43,555
You had me at "free booze."
[Laughs]

933
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:47,354
- I'll see you there, Cleveland Ron.
- All right.

934
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:56,068
Hey, Seth.
What's goin' on, man?

Whoa!

Um, you feeling okay, Seth?

938
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:10,139
No. I am far from okay.
Okay?

939
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:12,478
I needed my medication,
only Jason took it.

940
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:15,679
So Hitler's granddaughter
gave me some of these aspirin.

941
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:19,350
Only now everything
still hurts and I have this!

942
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:21,655
Is it supposed to
curve like that, man?

943
00:57:21,725 --> 00:57:24,923
- No!
- Holy baby arm!

944
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:29,195
- This is all your fault!
- Okay, how is that my fault?

945
00:57:29,265 --> 00:57:32,761
Because you took my codeine,
so I took a bunch of your Viagra!

946
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:37,539
Okay, that's not Viagra, Captain Hook.
That's Equine XL.

947
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:39,735
Wait a minute.
What's Equine XL?

948
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:42,278
It's boner pills for horses.
I get it off this veterinary Web site.

949
00:57:42,344 --> 00:57:43,939
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

They were in an aspirin bottle,
you degenerate asshole!

952
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:53,457
- Well, excuse me for exercising a little discretion.
- "Exercising discretion"?

953
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:56,756
I can't think of two words
that have less in common with you...

954
00:57:56,825 --> 00:57:59,316
than "exercise" and "discretion"!

955
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:03,531
Ouch. That hurt, Seth.

956
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:07,299

964
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:37,591
All right, Seth, I think you
should, um-you should go and...

you know, take care
of your little... situation.

No, no, no.

I am not letting some diseased hooker
touch me down there.

to touch you down there.

So, uh, are those Capri pants?

973
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,596
They're not Capri pants.
Capri pants are for women.

974
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:15,100
Oh. So they're man-pri pants?

975
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:19,039
No. Look, they're
cropped slacks, okay?

976

They're huge in Europe. Huge.

977

Yeah, George Michael's
huge in Europe too.

Not that I'm complaining...

She went home. I told her
I'd see her tomorrow at the annulment.

You're not gonna stay

I've got a couple of very
important things back in Cleveland.

We're gonna do the long-distance thing.

Uh, Sonny's secret?

I don't know what to tell you, Rico.
It's a God-given talent.

- Wait a minute.

1355
01:28:31,756 --> 01:28:35,058
He's like Mother Teresa in the sack?

1356
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:38,031
Yeah, he is. I just wish
he was staying longer.

1357
01:28:38,096 --> 01:28:41,328
There are so many more of us
that need to be cured.

Cured? The only thing
that guy could cure is a ham!

I've been a sex addict all my life.
I have tried everything.

Even electroshock therapy.
Nothing worked... until I slept with Sonny.

Sometimes you gotta let your buddies
have their little moment in the sun, okay?

1374
01:29:42,123 --> 01:29:44,924
And besides, we're gonna be
able to hang this over him forever.

Oh, yeah.

and you were right.

01:37:01,078 --> 01:37:03,812
I do.
[Giggles]

1484
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:07,182
Way to go, Ron!

1485
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:11,693
- Sorry, Mel.
- It's okay.

1486
01:37:11,756 --> 01:37:16,391
By the power vested in me
and the state of Florida...

1487
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:18,292
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1488
01:37:18,361 --> 01:37:22,029
You may kiss your bride, Papi.

1489
01:37:29,106 --> 01:37:31,871
Oh, thank God.
I'm starving.

1490
01:37:31,941 --> 01:37:35,541
Yeah, I could really go for a pizza.

1491
01:37:35,612 --> 01:37:37,741
You like pizza?

1492
01:37:49,492 --> 01:37:52,897
- [Laughing]
- Aloha, welcome!

1493
01:37:52,963 --> 01:37:58,338
Aloha back at ya. Last name Rhodes,
checking into the honeymoon suite!

1494
01:37:58,401 --> 01:38:02,866
I'm sorry, ma'am. It appears the honeymoon
suite is booked for another party.

1495
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:05,704
Well, check again.
It's my honeymoon!

1496
01:38:05,774 --> 01:38:10,273
Calvin, tell this man you made the reservation
in the honeymoon suite.

1497
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:13,078
- Baby, the thing is-
- Don’t you "baby" me!

1498
01:38:13,148 --> 01:38:16,212
I didn't wait 17 years...

1499
01:38:16,286 --> 01:38:19,450
to not have my honeymoon
in the honeymoon suite.

1500
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,016
Hi. Checking into the honeymoon suite.
Last name Simmons.

1501
01:38:24,326 --> 01:38:26,319
You-

1502
01:38:27,797 --> 01:38:30,265
You son of a bitch!

1503
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:34,635
Hey, you. Small world, huh?

1504
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:37,732
I'm gonna kill you!
[Screaming]

1505
01:38:37,806 --> 01:38:40,277
No, get back! Get back!
You are nuts!

1506
01:38:40,342 --> 01:38:44,748
- Get over here, you son of a bitch!
- Mel! Mel!

1507
01:38:44,812 --> 01:38:48,080
Get your ass over here!

1508
01:38:48,148 --> 01:38:50,950
You son of a bitch!

1509
01:38:51,019 --> 01:38:55,790
- That's my ring!
- That was my grandmother's ring!

1510
01:38:55,856 --> 01:38:58,292
- You little shit!
- Get away from me!

1511
01:38:58,358 --> 01:39:00,419
You need some therapy, woman!

1512
01:39:00,493 --> 01:39:04,330
