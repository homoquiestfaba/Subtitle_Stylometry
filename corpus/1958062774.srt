[Tye] In the beginning
was the garden.

The streams ran clear

and the lambs of the Lord
played in the green grass

23
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,971
and were nourished and free.

24
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,682
Then came the serpent,

"You shall plant gardens

Together we can gather the lambs

- What they did to you.

They didn't do anything to me.

That is the burden I carry.

you were a kid...

That didn't happen!

It's no accident we met.

88
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,288
We were called here
to join together,

89
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:17,834
to lead the lambs of
God back to the garden.

make sure of that.

With her big brother and big

106
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,358
no serpent will come
near her to harm her

107
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,861
or turn her away from God.

- I hope my head stops itching.

River hopes. I want a bath.

00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,239
[Laura] Protecting them
is all I think about.

179
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,124
Then why are we handing
them over to the enemy

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,243
six hours a day?

181
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,362
They have to learn how to
live in the real world.

182
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,748
You promised I could have that.

183
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,199
I did not promise you could let

184
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,533
the enemy come home with them.

185
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,627
Who knows how much
damage she's done?

186
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,797
I am through going
along with you on this.

187
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,177
James 4:7. What does God say?

188
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,213
Um, uh, "Resist the devil,

189
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,715
and he will flee from you."

190
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,051
Sometimes I wonder how
good at resisting you are.

191
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,728
Tye, you know I would never...

192
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,064
I know that? How
do I know that? Hm?

193
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,318
From the sting of the lash
cometh the strength to resist.

194
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,280
- [Tye grunting]
- [whip lashing]

195
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,035
[panting]

196
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,830
[groaning]

197
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,210
Mama, you have to
go to a doctor.

198
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,578
Let them use their
poisons on me?

199
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,172
[Tye] Laura, come in here.

200
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,218
Go upstairs and do your
homework, sweetheart.

201
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,388
- [groans]
- Mom...

202
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,059
I'm okay. I'm okay.

203
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,019
It's just a practice
contraction.

204
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,771
[Tye] Laura, come here.

205
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,100
Everything papa does is
because he loves his family

206
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,436
more than anything in the world.

207
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,907
Mama made a mistake, and
papa needs to make sure

208
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,326
that mama doesn't make
that mistake again.

209
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,873
Does this mean we can't
play with Andrea anymore?

210
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,093
Come here, baby. Come on.

211
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,436
Give papa a hug. He
loves you so much.

212
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,400
Come on, baby.
Come, come to papa.

213
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,486
That's it. That's it.
Come on. Yeah, come on.

214
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,492
[church bell tolling]

215
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,160
So there's these really cool
rabbits in the classroom

216
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,495
named Hip and Hop,
and every weekend

217
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,132
someone gets to bring them
home, and Ms. Jay says

218
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,135
I can bring them home first
if my mom says it's okay.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,805
- So is it okay?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

220
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,557
All of you...

221
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,311
But you won't be
going to school today.

222
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,346
Why?

223
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,191
Because I-I realize
now that papa was right

224
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,520
and I was wrong about how
careful we need to be.

225
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,055
Yesterday proves
that all the serpent

226
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,908
has to do is put on a big smile.

227
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,369
- And we get fooled every time.
- Andrea is not the serpent.

228
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,663
She tempted you away from God.

229
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,541
She got you to open
the devil's window.

230
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,669
Can we go to school tomorrow?

231
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,589
No, honey, not
tomorrow or any day.

232
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,375
It's too dangerous.

233
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,378
But we're gonna make our
own school, right here.

234
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:34,015
We're gonna have
books and art supplies

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,975
and music and
everything we need.

236
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,052
It-it's gonna be
so-so-so much fun.

237
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,855
It's gonna be stupid.
I wanna go to school.

238
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,609
- School! School! School!
- Prairie, stop that.

239
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,236
- Okay, Prairie, enough.
- "Okay, Prairie, enough."

240
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,198
- Prairie, I'm telling you...
- "Prairie, I'm telling you..."

241
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,742
[Prairie] School!
School! School!

242
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,680
- Prairie, please stop that.
- [Rain] Cut it out!

243
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,390
You don't think mama has
enough trouble already?

244
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,915
Stop yelling at him! You're
such a bully sometimes.

245
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,917
When I was his age, I
respected my parents.

246
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,503
- Please stop!
- [screeches]

247
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,922
- [Prairie] School!
- [Laura panting]

248
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,676
[Prairie] School!
School! School!

249
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,220
School! School! School!

250
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,922
You know what's happened
here, don't you?

251
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,725
The enemy has taken possession
of our precious children.

252
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,561
- But you can drive him out.
- No.

253
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,773
- You know how.
- Oh, Tye, please.

254
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,358
When somebody won't
drive the devil

255
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,402
out of the children
they supposedly love,

256
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,937
what does that tell me?

257
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,448
- Is the devil in you, Laura?
- No.

258
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,202
- No. No.
- From the sting of the lash.

259
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,615
[Prairie] School.
School! School!

260
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,669
Prairie, go upstairs to your
room until you've calmed down.

261
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,796
- School. School!
- Proverbs 23:13, Laura.

262
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,756
- What does it say?
- Tye...

263
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,509
It says, "Do not withhold
discipline from the child,

264
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,720
for if you strike
them with the rod,

265
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,129
you save them from
eternal death."

266
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,466
And who was it that
spoke those words?

267
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,468
Prairie, go up to your
room right this second!

268
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,644
School.

269
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,189
- No.
- For the last time, Laura.

270
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,942
Who spoke the words
of Proverbs 23:13?

271
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,477
God.

272
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,922
Then will you stand
here in your house,

273
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,739
in front of the children
you say you love,

274
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,824
and disobey that command?

275
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,703
- Do you hate your children?
- No.

276
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,820
Do you want them
swallowed by darkness?

277
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,656
- [sobbing]
- Don't!

278
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,210
- Ah!
- [River screams]

279
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,047
Oh. I'm so sorry, baby.

280
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,634
- Ahh!
- Mom, are you okay?

281
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,846
I think I have to go upstairs.

282
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,639
Okay, help your
mother get to her bed.

283
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,850
I'll be right up.
Go. Go, go, go.

284
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,393
[Laura groaning]

285
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,604
Come here, sweetie. Come here.

286
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,183
It's okay, we're
fighting a great war

287
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,902
of the garden against
the wasteland.

288
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,387
You know, it's terrible that
people have to get hurt in wars,

289
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:58,025
but, but they do, and that makes
them stronger for the fight.

290
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,413
And the most important thing
is that we stand together,

291
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,165
or the wasteland wins.

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
The baby needs all
of our help now.

293
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,921
Will you join us?

294
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,093
[breathing heavily]

295
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,547
[grunting]

296
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,641
Okay. Another push,
mama. You can do this.

297
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,436
Okay. All right. Oh, your
baby wants to see the light.

298
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,190
[Laura grunting]

299
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,278
- I know you can do it, Jesus...
- [Laura screams]

300
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,200
[instrumental music]

301
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,735
[baby bawling]

302
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,081
Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

303
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,374
[baby bawling]

304
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,911
He is so beautiful.

305
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,880
[babbling]

306
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,383
[River] Look at that,
you made him smile!

307
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,720
God sent me a dream last night,
as clear as the life of day.

308
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,391
An angel came to me
and spoke the words

309
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,894
of Revelation 7:21. Rain.

310
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,263
"The lamb will be
their shepherd.

311
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,932
He will guide them to the
springs of living water

312
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,360
and keep the holy fire alive."

313
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,195
Beautiful, son.

314
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:21,108
And then the angel showed
me who the shepherd was.

315
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,327
It was your new baby brother.

316
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,115
Forest is the shepherd?

317
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,877
Yes. He has a great destiny.

318
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,045
Which puts him in
terrible danger.

319
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:37,791
From now on, nobody crosses
this threshold coming in.

320
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,627
And only mama and me going out,

321
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,795
so we can work and
bring home food.

322
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,141
When will we be able to go
outside? And go to school again?

323
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,102
When you're as strong as we are.

324
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,314
- When will that be?
- We'll know, my angel.

325
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,608
We'll know.

326
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,111
Come here. Come.
Come. Come close.

327
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,578
We've been afraid to scare
you, and that was a mistake.

328
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,788
Sometimes it's
good to be scared.

329
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,168
Just say it, Laura.
The whole real truth.

330
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,836
They need to hear it.

331
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,926
The whole real truth is that

332
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:23,012
everybody out
there is a serpent.

333
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,806
The only lambs in the world
are inside this house.

334
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,010
So I need to know

335
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:34,190
that all of you will
protect you baby brother,

336
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,442
always, with your lives.

337
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,689
Thank you. Now I
know he'll be safe.

338
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,691
I'm still a little weak,
so I need your help

339
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,359
getting breakfast on the table.

340
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,827
River, will you watch Forest?

341
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,288
- With my life.
- Yeah.

342
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,124
[clears throat]

343
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,342
[dramatic music]

344
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,810
River?

345
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,271
River, papa needs you
downstairs on the double.

346
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,732
Come on.

347
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,783
[Tye] Okay, we're all here now.

348
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,235
So...

349
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,239
Prairie's going to tell us
why what he did was wrong.

350
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,242
- Go on, son.
- You're the one who caught me.

351
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:39,213
[Prairie mumbling] I
can't, I can't find him.

352
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,342
Prairie, listen to me, not
the voice of the enemy.

353
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,553
Summer needs her big brother
to help her see the way.

354
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,305
[Prairie laughs]

355
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,310
Papa.

356
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:57,097
He-he didn't mean to
do anything bad, papa.

357
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,067
[Forest] It was just hard
to breathe in the room,

358
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,278
and he needed some air.

359
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,273
- [Laura grunts]
- [Forest groans]

360
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,992
[sobbing]

361
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,707
Forest, why was it wrong

362
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,001
that your brother
opened the window?

363
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:21,130
Because t-t-t-the devil's breath

364
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:25,092
could have gotten in
and infected all of us.

365
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,054
What do we have to do now?

366
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,630
Rain?

367
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,683
Cleanse him of the
enemy's breath,

368
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,478
to keep it from putting out
the fire of the Holy Spirit.

369
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,313
That's exactly right.

370
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,609
[River sobbing]

371
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,237
Hold on.

372
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,115
[Tye] Meadow.

373
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,952
I know you know the rule
about not closing your eyes.

374
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,766
And I know you'd only break
that rule if you caught

375
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,916
some of the infection yourself.

376
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,002
N-n-no, that's n-not...

377
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,172
- [Laura grunting]
- [Prairie groaning]

378
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,183
[groaning]

379
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,398
[Tye] No, no, no, no. Hydrangeas
are a total knock-out.

380
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,083
Absolutely. But the
water they gobble up?

381
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,069
I mean, here, check out,
check out viburnum, okay?

382
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,988
I'm sending you a
link. All right. Okay.

383
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,741
Yup, I will see you at
the site in 20. Okay.

384
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,828
- Hey. I gotta go. Okay.
- All right.

385
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,001
You be the angels
that you are, angels.

386
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,336
Goodbye, papa.

387
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,042
"The Lord will cause you to be
defeated before your enemies.

388
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,178
Because of the suffering,
you will eat the flesh

389
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:54,432
of the sons and daughters the
Lord your God has given you."

390
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,392
That's sick.

391
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,218
That's Deuteronomy.

392
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,980
"Even the most gentle among
you will have no compassion

393
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,557
on his own brother
or the wife he loves.

394
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,504
He will not give to one
of them any of the flesh

395
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,695
of his children
that he is eating."

396
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,405
Ugh.

397
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,065
That's what happens if you
don't obey the word of the Lord.

398
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,993
Just like papa says.

399
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,906
Are we gonna have a
lesson today, mama?

400
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,251
Yeah, um, sure. Uh...

401
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,178
Why don't you keep going
on history with Rain?

402
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,079
And, River, why
don't you do numbers

403
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,414
with Forest and-and Summer?

404
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,841
Uh, mama?

405
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,386
Oh.

406
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,391
So close!

407
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,894
Can you just smell
those pine boughs now?

408
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,645
Mm-mm.

409
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,599
"Christopher Columbus
was the eldest son

410
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,769
of Domenico Colombo and
Susanna Fontanarossa.

411
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,772
The family moved from
Genoa to Savona in 1470.

412
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,273
Then Christopher's
father became..."

[indistinct chatter on TV]

414
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,055
[Rain] "Three years later
Columbus embarked on a career

His interest in the sea
was born when he was young.

418
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,543
And then it's said
that by his 20s..."

419
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:08,214
Okay, time for times
tables. One times seven.

420
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,550
- I don't know.
- One times is easy.

421
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,303
- You know this.
- I'm too hungry to know it.

422
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,889
I'm gonna go ask mama to
make us more breakfast.

423
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,557
[Rain] You can't
disturb mama now.

424
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,684
She's busy learning
the ways of the demons.

425
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,853
Come on, Sum, sit down
and work on your numbers.

426
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,139
- No.
- Um, how about a song?

427
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,975
Would you like that?

428
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,143

Yeah. Enough.

Hunger is for demons.

[Forest] Yeah.

But what if

448
00:26:56,032 --> 00:27:00,233
the lambs need to eat and
to get, to get strong,

449
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,620

Meadow, would you
please come with me?

459
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,935
I know this is a heavy
burden to lay on you,

460
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,687
but we need you to tell us

461
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,064
who stole the apples
from the kitchen.

462
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,943
- What apples?
- Really?

463
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,656
You, I can always count
on for the deepest truth.

464
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,950
Who took the apples
out of the drawer?

465
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,988
I don't know.

466
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,393
So you know the
apples were taken,

467
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,541
you just don't know by who?

468
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,543
I don't know anything.

469
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,420
You love your
brothers and sisters,

470
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,329
and you think
you're helping them,

471
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,717
and we, we love you for that.

472
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,469
Just like we love
you because we know

473
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,221
in your hearts
you can never lie.

474
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,515
[Tye] But here you are, lying,

475
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,726
and somebody in this
house is stealing.

476
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,520
Which means what?

477
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,273
What does that mean, Rain?

478
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,349
That the enemy's gotten in.

479
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,318
[Laura] That's right.

480
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,821
And we need to find
out who's infected,

481
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,355
so we can stop it
from spreading,

482
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,950
or it'll put out the
holy fire inside us all.

483
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,871
Do you want that to happen?

484
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,373
[Tye] Then tell us
who stole the apples.

485
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,586
We don't know.

486
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,465
Mama and I can't
always both stay home.

487
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,875
We're gonna need help
shepherding the flock.

488
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,378
If you can prove that you're
ready to carry that flame,

489
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,681
we'll need to show you
the ways of the enemy.

490
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,369
[Laura] You'll need to
stay in touch with us

491
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,560
when we're out of the house.

492
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:36,231
Once we know we can trust you,
you'll each get one of these.

493
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,288
Who took the apples?

494
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,911
It's all right. Really. We're
just putting you to the test.

495
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,248
I've already seen the
truth through the veil.

496
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:05,085
I know it was the youngest
and weakest of you

497
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,920
who let the enemy in.

498
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,723
It's time to burn the
devil out of Summer.

499
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,517
- Wait!
- Stop!

500
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,644
[dramatic music]

501
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,598
Don't be afraid, everybody.
The danger's over.

502
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:22,269
We have found where the enemy
planted his seeds of evil.

503
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:25,105
Now we can starve the
infection out of the soil,

504
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,907
but it'll take seven days.

505
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,450
Seven?

506
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,996
You're probably right.
It's not long enough.

507
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,447
Do you think nine days?

508
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,334
No. Um, no, seven is enough.

509
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,954
I hope so. Ahem.

510
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,759
It takes a fearsome demon to
get a hold of the shepherd.

511
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,303
All right. Everybody,
down for breakfast.

512
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,557
Let's go.

513
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,853
You're tenders of the flock now.

514
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,898
Be proud that you kept
your lambs from straying.

515
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,153
Mama... untie me.

516
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,874
Just for a minute. I have
to go really, really bad.

517
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,292
[Tye] Laura!

518
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,215
It's okay, Forest.

519
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,301
If you have to go, you can go.

520
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,678
It's okay.

521
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,976
[Tye] They're yours,
as long as you promise

01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,658
Officers, we, uh...

1046
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,305
I mean, thank you so
much for your help

1047
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:12,496
from the, from the
bottom of our hearts.

1048
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,768
[Kenner] Yeah, we're gonna
need your contact information,

1049
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,833
so we can follow
up on the incident.

1050
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,668
Driver's license would do it.

1051
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:23,965
[dramatic music]

1052
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,517
Thank you.

1053
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,984
[engine starts]

1054
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,833
just get the chains...

1055
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,668
- and the ropes in the van.
- [Meadow] Why?

1056
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,369
If we leave them
behind, the enemy

1057
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,149
can use them in the lies
they'll tell about us.

1058
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,026
- Where are we going?
- Someplace deep in the desert.

1059
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,175
Where they'll never find us.

1060
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,261
Now, there will be no
blaming of River and Forest.

1061
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,379
It's not their fault that
the enemy trapped them.

1062
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,243
As soon as mama and I've driven
the infection out of them,

1063
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:17,886
we'll be on our way. Fast now!
They could be here any second.

1064
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,124
Now, you wait in your room.
Fangs are deeper into Forest.

1065
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,274
We'll free him first.

1066
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,359
[Rain] Papa.

1067
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,611
Is he gonna be all right?

1068
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,063
He's in God's hands.
He'll be perfect.

1069
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,533
Now here, go get Summer.

1070
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,402
Uh, come on in the
bathroom, honey.

1071
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,538
I'm coming with
you in here, okay?

1072
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,706
Okay.

1073
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,437
D'you think that on the way
out of town, we can stop by

1074
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,462
an emergency room? They-they
don't ask any questions.

1075
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,384
You held them too close
on the way home, Laura.

1076
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,429
The infection got you,
too, it is making you doubt

1077
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,422
the Lord's power to
heal your own children.

1078
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,425
Now you take care of the
locks in the kitchen.

1079
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,477
I will help River and Forest.

1080
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:03,523
Later, later when there is time,

1081
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:07,777
I will chase away that doubt,
so it never plagues you again.

1082
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,906
For now, help the kids
get us on our way.

1083
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,274
Okay?

1084
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,286
[Forest groaning]

1085
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,612
Baby, what happened?

1086
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:20,624
[breathing heavily]

1087
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,452
Papa was right.

1088
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,839
The serpent took his
fang out of me just now.

1089
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,425
- It's not hurting?
- Not anymore. Uh...

1090
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,095
Just a second ago it was
like the worst thing ever.

1091
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,131
But then it-it,
it was just gone.

1092
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,967
Oh, thank God! Thank you, papa.

1093
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:41,970
You can thank me in the van,
okay? We have to go! Let's go.

1094
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,625
You heard him. Fast,
fast, fast, everybody.

1095
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,482
Help me put some food
together for the drive.

1096
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,651
- On the way to our new life.
- [doorbell ringing]

1097
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,278
I-I'll get it.

1098
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,030
- [doorbell ringing]
- [groaning]

1099
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,817
[knocking on door]

1100
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,152
Mr. McGrath, I'm Gloria Sterling

1101
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,988
with the Office of
Family and Child Welfare.

1102
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:01,831
Officer Kenner and I are here

1103
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,158
to do a welfare check
on minor children.

1104
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:05,827
Everybody is sleeping.

1105
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,997
Um, can you give us
a minute, please?

1106
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:10,173
Sure.

1107
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,601
This is the greatest
danger we have ever faced.

1108
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,889
But if you do everything we
talked about, it will be fine,

1109
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,725
and we'll find our garden, okay?

1110
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,438
- [Forest groans]
- [Laura] Come in. Come in.

1111
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,849
- We're all in the living room.
- Is it hurting again?

1112
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,025
[door opens]

1113
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:35,365
[Tye] Everybody, this is Ms.
Sterling and Officer Kenner.

1114
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,360
What do we all say, children?

1115
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,288
[all] Hello, Ms. Sterling
and Officer Kenner.

1116
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,874
Well, hello to all of you.

1117
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,869
Oh. Early start on Christmas?

1118
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:49,796
It's all so pretty.

1119
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:51,881
[clears throat]

1120
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,554
Are there bathing
facilities in the house?

1121
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,349
We had a plumbing problem,

1122
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,185
so we couldn't take
showers for a while.

1123
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,023
- But it's being fixed.
- Well, that's good.

1124
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:13,061
[Gloria] And where do the
children attend school?

1125
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:16,731
Well, right here in our licensed
and permitted home academy.

1126
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:19,325
May we take a look
in the kitchen area?

1127
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,661
Absolutely, yes. Of course.

1128
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:27,241
Mama.

1129
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,963
May I please use the
bathroom, please?

1130
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,757
Of course.

1131
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,017
[groaning]

1132
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,478
- I thought you were all better.
- [groans]

1133
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,398
Feel his skin. It's
like he's on fire.

1134
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:52,192
May we have a look
around upstairs?

1135
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:56,780
Uh, we're actually doing some,
some renovations up there.

1136
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,699
Yeah, you'd need a flashlight
and a search warrant

1137
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:02,035
to get through that mess.

1138
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,723
Do you happen to have
either of those on hand?

1139
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:06,873
Not right now, but we
can come back with both.

1140
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,377
[intense music]

1141
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:15,757
I-I have to grab some school
things from the garage, so I...

1142
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,553
I'll help you, mom.

1143
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:28,185
Well, are there any other
questions I can help you with?

1144
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,805
No, we're good for now.

1145
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,690
Then I'll, I'll walk you out.

1146
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,310
You have to drink it,
Forest. You have to drink it.

1147
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:40,031
- [groaning]
- [knocking on door]

1148
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,151
Who is it?

1149
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,304
[Laura] Mama. [Rain] And me.

1150
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:47,330
[Forest groaning]

1151
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,751
- The pain came back?
- Yeah.

1152
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,327
Worse than before.

1153
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,004
Mama, you have to
look up on your phone

1154
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,833
what someone's supposed
to do when this happens.

1155
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,844
- And papa says we need to leave.
- [River] Feel his forehead.

1156
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:08,518
My phone's in the van.
Rain, do you have yours?

1157
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,020
- I-it's okay if I do it?
- Yes.

1158
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:14,773
Oh, my...

1159
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,902
[Forest sobbing]

1160
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:21,522
[indistinct chatter]

1161
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:25,410
[Rain] It says when the appendix
bursts, the pressure stops,

1162
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:29,121
which means the pain goes away,
but it can also lead to...

1163
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:33,033
What's, uh, sepsis?

1164
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:36,211
[Laura] Poison spreading
through his body.

1165
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,540
Um, because it
burst. Which means...

1166
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,876
Wha-what was that
word from the book?

1167
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,844
- Mortality.
- [Laura] Rain.

1168
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,014
Press the phone thing
and then touch 911

1169
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,639
and they'll send
somebody to help.

1170
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:49,767
[Forest sobbing]

1171
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,185
- I'll do it.
- [door opens]

1172
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:54,272
[Forest sobbing]

1173
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,394
[Tye] The serpent made me
let this instrument of lies

1174
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:03,898
and trickery into our house.

1175
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,733
Yeah, we will take
Forest in the van

1176
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,903
and God will heal
him in the desert.

1177
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,239
He's burning up.
He's getting worse...

1178
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:15,084
He was perfect before
we were invaded!

1179
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:18,412
That is why they came here, to
bring their poison. We go now!

1180
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,380
We have to cool him
off before we go.

1181
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,383
- Mama...
- [Laura] Just an ice bath.

1182
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:26,221
For a little while.
Please. Feel his skin.

1183
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:29,514
- Tye.
- [Forest sobbing]

1184
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:32,101
All right. Three minutes,
and then we leave.

1185
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,188
[Forest sobbing]

1186
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:37,815
Mama.

1187
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:46,449
- [grunts]
- [Tye] All right. Come here.

1188
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,955
[Forest sobbing]

1189
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,039
Every second we wait,
they get closer.

1190
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:04,384
- We're going out the back.
- [Forest sobbing]

1191
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,266
[River] Papa, please call
somebody to help Forest.

1192
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,228
Now he's as cool as a
mountain stream now.

1193
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,146
What if that's
just from the ice?

1194
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,108
Do you have zero faith?

1195
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,780
We need to get help for Forest.

1196
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,700
Lamb thinks he's grown the
horns of a ram, does he?

1197
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,537
- Give me my phone.
- No.

1198
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,246
[Tye grunts]

1199
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,582
Oh!

1200
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,669
[grunting]

1201
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,089
[Rain groans]

1202
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:47,343
I think I've driven
the enemy out of him.

1203
01:11:47,429 --> 01:11:50,263
But if we don't get away
fast, we'll all be lost.

1204
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,432
So let's get into the van now.

1205
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,977
[Prairie grunting]

1206
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,103
I think you heard what I said!

1207
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,068
Laura, will you lead
the flock into the van?

1208
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:08,823
I won't.

1209
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:11,117
- I'm getting help.
- [Tye] Stop!

1210
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,040
- [Laura] No!
- Come on. Come on.

1211
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:20,618
- Tye, put the knife down.
- [Tye] Rain.

1212
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:23,755
What was God's final
command to Abraham?

1213
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:28,009
[Tye] Genesis 22.

1214
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,719
What did God command
Abraham to do?

1215
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,350
Sacrifice his son.

1216
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,803
- Let him go.
- Abraham failed the test.

1217
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:40,813
He disobeyed.

1218
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,982
But I will not let this family

1219
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,378
fall into the
hands of the enemy.

1220
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,736
So we're getting
into the van now!

01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,284
- Get the phone! Get the phone!
- Ahh!

1223
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,161
- No!
- [Laura] Prairie!

1224
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:58,289
- Prairie, no! No!
- [Tye] Stop!

- [Meadow grunting]
- [Tye grunting]

1226
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:06,923
- [Tye] No!
- [Meadow breathing heavily]

1227
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:10,050
- It's ringing, mom!
- River, there's no time.

1228
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,136
- Run! Go get help! Go!
- [Meadow] Run!

Help!

1232
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:26,183
Help!

[indistinct chatter on TV]

1234
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,841
[man on TV] We're learning
more about this harrowing tale

1235
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,949
of children held prisoner
in their own home

1236
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,526
for more than a decade
in appalling conditions.

1237
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,746
Police are reporting evidence
of chains and restraints.

1238
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:41,582
One dangerously sick
child denied medical care

1239
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,210
is now in hospital in
critical condition.

1240
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,417
Neighbors report thatthe
parents were quiet and kept

1241
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,371
to themselves, some were unaware

1242
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,049
that there were
children in the house...

1243
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,384
[remote clicks]

1244
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:52,969
Your brother's alive.

1245
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:56,222
But he's gone into a coma

1246
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,716
that the doctors haven't
been able to get him out of.

1247
01:13:58,809 --> 01:13:59,892
Coma?

1248
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,219
It's like, um, being asleep,

1249
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,439
but deeper and...

1250
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,731
And you don't wake up?

1251
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:08,818
No, no. Uh, sometimes you do.

1252
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,653
But sometimes you don't?

1253
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:12,989
Sometimes.

1254
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,907
Which is it gonna be this time?

1255
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,289
The doctors don't know.

1256
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,498
I wanna see him.

1257
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:23,916

Hey! Just relax!
It's okay. It's okay.

1261
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,844
- [Prairie grunting]
- [Kenner] It's okay.

1262
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,255
These children are in a profound
state of fear and confusion.

1263
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,702
I'm sorry, Detective
Cortez, there's no way

1264
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,006
they're ready to
be interrogated.

1265
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:42,288
Without statements,
we can only hold

1266
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:43,761
the parents for
another 60 hours.

1267
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:45,438
With the state
these kids are in?

1268
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,023
We can make a case for neglect.

1269
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,484
But false imprisonment? Torture?

1270
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,328
Well, you should hear
the defense revving up.

1271
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,715
The windows weren't
barred, the kids

1272
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,008
could have gotten
out at any time.

1273
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:56,115
Yeah, and the ones
that did get out, ah...

1274
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,002
I mean, the boy jumped
into his mother's arms

1275
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,110
like he couldn't
wait to get home.

1276
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:02,079
I'd have to attest to
that at a deposition.

1277
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,458
You have no idea what
shape these kids are in.

1278
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,396
All they'll eat is the
stuff that was in the van

1279
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,629
'cause they're afraid
the food in the hospital

1280
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,121
will infect them with
the devil's poison.

1281
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,217
Jesus!

1282
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,884
They're fragile. This
could shatter them.

1283
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,719
If a judge makes us let them go,

1284
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:20,306
even on the shortest
possible leash,

1285
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,633
how confident are you
that they won't be smoke?

1286
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,246
You want these kids living
in fear that their parents

1287
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,636
could pop out from behind a wall

1288
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,605
and grab them at any time?

1289
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,978
My parents made mistakes,

1290
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,155
but everything they
did was to protect us.

1291
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,491
Didn't your father
pull a knife on you?

1292
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:40,326
Didn't even your
mother try to stop him?

1293
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:44,288
Papa was mad because I wanted
Forest to go to the doctor.

1294
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:47,166
But look what happened when the
doctors got their hands on him.

1295
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:50,085
Who was right, me and mama...

1296
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:52,996
or papa?

1297
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,193
[Cortez] How often
were you allowed

1298
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,883
to take baths?

1299
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,848
Tell me about the food your
parents gave you to eat.

1300
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:11,482
She's protecting herself
from the breath of the enemy

1301
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,568
that made her brother sick.

1302
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,987
[Prairie] Papa was the worst

1303
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,740
even though he didn't
do most of the hitting,

1304
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:22,285
because he's the one
who made mama do it.

1305
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,537
Sometimes they kept us in
the closet for so long,

1306
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,664
we could barely walk.

1307
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,000
They kept telling us the
world was either serpent-demon

1308
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,210
or innocent lamb.

1309
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,754
But can I tell you a secret?

1310
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,132
Something nobody else
knows in the whole world.

1311
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,800
Absolutely.

1312
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,553
There's also the goat
with the red eyes

1313
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,556
and the black-and-gold horns.

1314
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,142
That's who had told me
to use the knife on papa.

1315
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,223
I know this is hard, Meadow.

1316
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:56,068
But can you tell me what your
parents used the ropes for?

1318
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,699

We're counting on you, River.

Without a statement from you,

1324
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,198
your parents' attorneys
can compel the court

1325
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,305
to release them.

1326
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:27,758
You want them out there, free,

1327
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,812
where they can keep hurting you
and your brothers and sisters?

1328
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:34,523
I've been in the outside
world for two days now.

1329
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,320
What if I've already
breathed the poison?

1330
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:45,910
What if whatever I say to you is
what the devil wants me to say?

1331
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,579
It's no use asking me questions.
I don't know anything.

1332
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,119
Can I go now?

Hm. I get that.

1338

Well, somebody's been trying

1339
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,745
to get a hold of you real hard.

1340
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:32,156
- Me?
- Name's Tristan.

1341
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,491
Out of Kingston, Jamaica.

1342
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:37,161
- I don't wanna talk to him.
- Okay, then.

1344
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:43,925
- Gloria.
- Hm?

1345

- There you are.
- Here I am.

1346
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:53,477
I-I saw about your
brother on the news.

1347
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,013
I'm praying for him.

1348
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,314
You should be.

1349
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:04,196
If Forest dies, maybe it'll be
because I did what you said.

1350
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,968
Or maybe because I
didn't do it soon enough.

1351
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:08,534
Either way, I messed
everything up.

1352
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,327
[Tristan] It's not your fault.

1353
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:13,371
You're a great hero.
You're-you're Moses.

1354
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,875
You led your people
out of Egypt.

1355
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:18,252
You know that story.

1356
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:22,214
And then they wandered in
the desert for 40 years.

1357
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,258
They had to fight
terrible enemies,

1358
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,550
and a lot of people died.

1359
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,045
- Did you know that?
- Yes.

1360
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:31,048
How do you know pharaoh
wasn't protecting

1361
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,884
the children of God
because he loved them?

1362
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:37,146
They want me to go to court and
say bad things about my parents.

1363
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,606
Are you going to?

1364
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:41,225
Proverbs 20.

1365
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,027
"If someone curses
their father or mother,

1366
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,196
their lamp will be
snuffed out in darkness."

1367
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,116
So you're gonna
let them go free?

1368
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,577
I don't know.

1369
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,412
I don't even know how to know.

1370
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,957
They said your father was
bad to your mother, too,

1371
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,293
that she helped you escape.

1372
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,523
Yeah, well, maybe the devil
tricked her into doing that,

1373
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,380
because he wanted Forest to die.

1374
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:06,842
Your mother risked her
life to help your brother.

1375
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:11,430
No matter what, she's
still your mother.

1376
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:16,434
Do you think, maybe,
i-if you talk to her,

1377
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,730
she can help you
know how to know?

1378
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,858
I wish you could be here.

[instrumental music]

1380
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,291
How many days is
it to Christmas?

1381
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:43,629
Uh, just under three
weeks, I think.

1382
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,130
Why are you asking?

1383
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:50,219
Nothing. It's-it's just this
thing mama and I used to...

1384
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:55,391
Sweetheart, wh-what-what is it?

1385
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:57,134
Do you think if I asked,

1386
01:20:57,228 --> 01:21:00,563
they would let me
see her in jail?

1387
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:04,942
Well, they'd probably ask me if
I thought it was a good idea.

1388
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,696
Do you want to see her?

1389
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,243
What's it like being here?

1390
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,288
[Laura] It's all right.

1391
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,956
Noisy sometimes.

1392
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,166
Papa's in a different
jail, right?

1393
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,335
Why do you wanna see me?

1394
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,382
[River] Because we
needed to talk to you.

1395
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:34,013
They want us to say that
you and papa were bad,

1396
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,839
so they can keep
you in jail forever.

1397
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,309
And we don't know
what we should...

1398
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:42,563
[Laura] You're asking me?

1399
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,682
'Cause-'cause papa turned out
to be right about the doctors.

1400
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:49,987
And if what you and papa
said all along was true,

1401
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,907
about how the police and
everybody were all demons...

1402
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,970
[Meadow] A-and you only changed
your mind at the very end

1403
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,360
'cause the devil
got hold of you.

1404
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,871
And, and we should tell
them to let you go.

1405
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,351
[Rain] And we can
hide in the desert

1406
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,710
and keep the holy fire alive.

1407
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,670
Is that something you want?

1408
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,130
Revelations seven.

1409
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:12,092
"The Lamb on the throne
will be their shepherd

1410
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:17,047
and He will lead them to
springs of living water."

1411
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:20,267
And God will wipe away
every tear from their eyes.

1412
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:25,272
Oh, the things we did to you...

1413
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,150
Proverbs 12.

1414
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,904
No, um, 13.

1415
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:35,115
"He who spares his rod

1416
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,993
hates his child,

1417
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:42,039
but he who loves him,
punishes him diligently."

1418
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:57,513
What about Ezekiel 18:20?
Do you know that one?

1419
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,809
- No.
- Of course not.

1420
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,269
We made sure not
to teach it to you.

1421
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,522
[Rain] I know what it says.

1422
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:10,526
"Do not follow the rules of
your parents or their judgments,

1423
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:13,612
or defile yourselves
with their idols."

1424
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,739
I always thought the
devil snuck that in.

1425
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,616
No.

1426
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,951
The rest is the devil.

1427
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,954
That's the holy word.

1428
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,947
It can't be.

1429
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:28,168
What if what we said
all along was a lie?

1430
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:30,454
What if me and papa
were the serpents?

1431
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:32,464
- Why are you being like this?
- I know why.

1432
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,458
I know what she's trying to do.

1433
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:36,927
I'm just answering the
question you asked.

1434
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,972
Mama, is that true?

1435
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,469
[hissing]

1436
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:48,063
Take me back now.

1437
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:53,110
All right, let's go.

1438
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,320
[door shutting]

1439
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:58,449
[instrumental music]

1440
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:10,377
"Your Honor, I would like
to begin by thanking you

1441
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,162
for hearing me out today.

1442
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,841
Even with the difficult
days of the trial behind us,

1443
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,177
even with my parents
found guilty,

1444
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,679
even with the
freedom we have now,

1445
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,474
my brothers and sisters and
I know that it is still early

1446
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:27,311
in our story, and that there
will be rough water ahead.

1447
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:29,688
But we are doing well."

1448
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,690
[instrumental music]

1449
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:35,027
[River] There is a whole scary
new world for us to discover,

1450
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,355
and we are learning new
things about it every day.

1451
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,325
People have been wonderful
to us, in the hospital

1452
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:45,079
and everywhere, and we send
all of them our thanks.

1453
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:50,367
They are helping us figure
out what our dreams are,

1454
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,544
so we can work to
make them come true.

1455
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,714
[music continues]

1456
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:02,888
I know that now you have
to sentence my parents.

1457
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:09,103
And it doesn't make all the
things that my mom did okay.

1458
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,148
But I'm beginning to
realize that she was

1459
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:16,151
my father's first victim.

1460
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:20,072
I'm learning that my father...

1461
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,535
if I can even call him that...

1462
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:28,288
had parents who loved him

1463
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:30,040
and tried to help him.

1464
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,669
So he has no excuse.

1465
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:38,757
Still, I wanna thank
him for one thing.

1466
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,094
For teaching us about the
fire of the spirit within,

1467
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:45,422
because I know it's real.

1468
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:49,601
And even if he did his best
to put it out in all of us...

1469
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,772
we all feel it growing
strong in us every day.

1470
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,900
[cheering]

1471
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:00,737
That fire is burning bright,

1472
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:03,282
and no matter what
happens to any of us...

1473
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,119
I know it will never go out.

1474
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,416
[music continues]

1475
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,638
[instrumental music]

1476
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:52,789
