1
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:11,335
(peaceful, winding music)

2
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:05,486
- Hello, my name is Albert Soady,

3
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,819
and have I got a buck story for you.

4
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,786
The tale I'm about to tell
starts in November of '89

5
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:15,096
in the Soady deer camp, located just north

6
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:18,266
of Escanaba, Michigan, otherwise known

7
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:21,529
as the heart and soul
of the Upper Peninsula.

8
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:24,996
That's north of the Mackinac Bridge

9
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,743
and just south of heaven, for those of you

10
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:28,893
who don't know nothing.

11
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,966
For those that don't know
much about the Superior State,

12
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,186
there's a couple things
that need to be explained.

13
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,429
First thing is, in the U.P.,
we don't explain things.

14
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,856
Second thing is, we got some of the best

15
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,486
hunting and fishing in the whole world.

16
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,776
Bear as tall as Norway pines.

17
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:51,856
We got wolf, moose, beaver, wild turkey,

18
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:56,856
quail, rabbit, fox, and,
of course, the bucks.

19
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:02,009
Holy Wah, do we got bucks, big as Buicks!

20
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,416
You can slice the venison off

21
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,536
one Superior State buck and feed

22
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,986
the whole state of Wisconsin.

23
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,693
But there's another U.P.,

24
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,566
the one that ain't in the travel books,

25
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,259
the one that's older than
the very rocks it sits on,

26
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,876
the one only the Indians understand.

27
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:21,496
Don't get me started on them.

28
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,546
My oldest boy married one.

29
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:25,349
Strange gal, to say the least.

30
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,586
I'm getting ahead of myself.

31
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,339
As Great-Grandpa Alphonse
always used to say,

32
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,386
when you don't know where to start,

33
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:36,136
go back to the beginning.

34
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:39,436
From the loins of our union,
Big Betty Belou and me

35
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:42,349
bore two boys, Reuben and Remnar.

36
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,446
Now, I'll tell ya right up front,

37
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:46,729
they are not the sharpest
tools in the shed.

38
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,956
Remnar turned out to be pretty much

39
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:52,536
what you'd expect from somebody

40
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,193
who went by the name of Remnar.

41
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:02,551
But Reuben, well, Reuben
was a different story.

42
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:07,126
Reuben spent his whole
life without hanging

43
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:09,536
a single buck on the buck pole.

44
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,426
That ain't a big to-do
if you're just another

45
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:14,249
fudge-sucker bobbing over
the bridge, but for a Soady?

46
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:18,359
Luckily that Injun gal had a way with him.

47
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,616
- Wolf Moon Dance, will you still love me

48
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,549
if I come back without a buck?

49
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:25,780
- [Albert Voiceover] Now, some things fit

50
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,003
together better than others,

51
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,206
and it's hard to say how somebody

52
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:32,736
who was so much a part of
the natural order of things

53
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:37,479
would fall in love with
somebody who wasn't so natural.

54
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:43,899
But she did.

55
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:49,956
(gun clicks)

56
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,536
And, lucky for him, 'cause
as Great-Grandpa Alphonse

57
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:59,513
always said, behind every good
man is a woman who can hunt.

58
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:05,032
(soft Native American music)

59
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:07,032
- Forgot your lucky hat.

60
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:10,206
- Can't go without this.

61
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,596
- Boys, wave bye to Daddy, then I want

62
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,086
you to run inside, okay?

63
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,056
Go ahead.

64
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,516
- Go get a deer, Dad.

65
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,349
- Bye, boys.

66
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,646
What?

67
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,096
- Why does he never
invite me up to deer camp?

68
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:26,946
- It's deer camp.

69
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,336
- So?

70
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,156
- So, it's deer camp.

71
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,256
- Just thought maybe
if we hunted together.

72
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:34,506
- If we hunted together, I'd be known

73
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,006
as the buckless Yooper
whose wife shot him a buck.

74
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,826
Look, I know what you're doing,

75
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,136
and I love you for it, I really do,

76
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,773
but I gotta do this on my own.

77
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:51,872
(Reuben gasps)

78
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:56,872
(Wolf Moon Dance speaking
foreign language)

79
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,373
- Reuben, first, you must believe.

80
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,396
- [Albert] Despite his little problem,

81
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:32,786
Reuben hadn't missed an
opening day in over 30 years.

82
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,616
- Best bait pile?

83
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,989
Not corn, not carrots.

84
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,896
Spoiled Brussels sprouts.

85
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,676
See, deer aren't just colorblind.

86
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:42,676
They're all-blind.

87
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:43,546
And since they can't see,

88
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:46,116
they gotta rely on the olfactory.

89
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,339
Give 'em a little whiff
of the spoiled sprouts.

90
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,543
Holy Wah, there he goes.

91
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:55,626

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,083
- Hello!

130
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:19,128
- Is this the Soady deer camp?

131
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:20,126
- You found her.

132
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,866
- The world famous Soady deer camp?

133
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:22,736
- One and the same.

134
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,966
- Yeah, is that Albert
Soady's sweet sap whisky

135
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,122
over there I see?

136
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:26,955
- Might be so lucky.

137
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:29,600
- Well, better have me a snort, eh?

138
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,433
- You know it's good for ya.

139
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,689
- How ya feeling, Pop?

140
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,454
- If I felt any better, I'd be dangerous.

141
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,292
(Reuben chuckles)

142
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,125
- Oh, wow.

143
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,119
A little heavy on the sap.

144
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,827
- A little what?

145
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,616
- On the sap, it's a
little heavy on the sap.

146
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:59,446
- The sap's what's makes it.

147
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,076
- Yeah, well, that may be,
but, if I didn't know better,

148
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:03,479
I'd say I just drunk from
a bottle of maple syrup.

149
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:05,616
- [Albert] Give me the damn jar back.

150
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:06,449
- All right-

151
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,816
- A man who can't look another man

152
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,376
right in the hairy eyeball and tell him

153
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,746
he's heavy on the sap ain't much of a man.

154
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,636
Maybe it'd be better if I
took the sap out altogether.

155
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,026
Would that make you happy?

156
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,246
- Well, I wouldn't think of Aunt Jemima

157
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,166
every time I took a snort,
I can tell you that.

158
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,294
- Well, I ain't about to
do it, so put that down.

159
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:22,296
That year, camp was as
tense as a moose's butt

160
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,596
during fly season.

161
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:24,846
Remnar didn't help.

162
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:25,679
- Hello!

163
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:29,872
Is this the Soady deer camp?

164
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:30,705
- You found her!

165
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:31,916
- The world famous Soady deer camp?

166
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,413
- The one and the same.
- The one and the same.

167
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:34,246
- And is that a pint of Albert Soady's

168
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,433
sweet sap whisky I see?

169
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,816
- You like pancakes?

170
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:37,876
- A little heavy on the sap, eh?

171
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,161
- Oh yeah, no kidding.

172
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:39,994
- But that's what makes it-

173
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:40,827
- You're late.

174
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:41,660
You're supposed to be here at six, eh?

175
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,493
- Black leather, fudge-sucking-

176
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,486
- I stopped off to the porcelain bus,

177
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,319
picked up the beer,

178
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,152
thank you very much.
- I'm not talking about that

179
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:45,985
and you know that.

180
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,684
You're supposed to steer
clear of her, Remnar.

181
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:48,766
- Did you want the beer or not?

182
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,846
- I don't care about the beer.
- I don't drink nothing

183
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,416
that's already been drunk before.

184
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,776
- Pop, I got it, okay, I got it.

185
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,180
- They was playing this game, eh?

186
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,076
(people chattering)

187
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,626
They put all the guys on one side,

188
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,176
and all the girls on the other.

189
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,995
And we each got a cue stick
off of the pool table there.

190
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:06,376
(people chattering)

191
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:10,006
And the gals all got a
roll of toilet paper.

192
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:15,006
(bluesy bar music)
(people shouting)

193
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,316
First couple to jam their cue stick

194
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,126
into the toilet roll gets
a free case of Leinenkugel,

195
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:20,116
thank you very much.

196
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,436
- [Reuben] She's married, Remnar.

197
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,746
- I couldn't help myself, eh?

198
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,496
The girl's got a tongue of a trout.

199
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,916
- Your mother had the tongue of a trout.

200
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,056
- She was licking me like a dog's balls.

201
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:54,786
- Her husband filed a restraining order.

202
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,366
- Yeah, I know, I know, but she's got

203
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,146
a hot nose, hands like a logger.

204
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,936
This girl can split wood.

205
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,826
- [Albert] Your mother could split wood.

206
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,256
- Did you bring the pasties?

207
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,326
Tell me you brought the pasties.

208
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,159
- We're gonna eat like kings.

209
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,376
- You know me, you know how I am.

210
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,596
I am a creature with habits.

211
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:09,986
If things aren't just so,

212
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,280
things won't work out.
- Things won't work out.

213
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,122
- That's right.

214
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:12,955
Tell me again you brought the pasties.

215
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:13,788
- I took care of it, eh?

216
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:15,041
- Beautiful!

217
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,206
Is this heaven or is this heaven, eh?

218
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,039
- This is heaven.

219
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,456
- I think I look forward to
opening day of deer season

220
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,379
more than any other day of the year.

221
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,396
It's like Christmas, with guns.

222
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:26,656
You feeling lucky this year, Pop?

223
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,006
'Cause I'm feeling lucky.

224
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,896
- Give a man a little luck and
anything will do for brains.

225
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,836
- Yeah, toss a little over this way.

226
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,666
- I was driving up to camp tonight,

227
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,716
I swear to God I had one of those things.

228
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,886
What do you call those things
you get when you're driving?

229
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,466
- Blackouts?
- Blackouts?

230
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:43,666
- One of those things that flash

231
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,696
across your mind like a dream,
only you're not dreaming.

232
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:47,529
- A vision?

233
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,704
- I was driving up to camp, eh?

234
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,966
Thinking about what scope to use,

235
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,465
which socks to wear, how
much beer to take, you know?

236
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,298
- The essentials.

237
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,316
- Right, when all of a sudden,
right there in front of me

238
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,795
is a 50-point buck.

239
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,136
- A 50-point buck?

240
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,246
- That's what I said.

241
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:03,856
- There is no such thing
as a 50-point buck.

242
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,546
- I know, I know, I know,
I said the same thing.

243
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:06,646
I said, this can't be so.

244
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,616
I mean, you know, a 50-point buck,

245
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:12,466
but I looked again, and
there he was, as real as you.

246
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,706
And the thing was, he didn't go away.

247
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:17,748
I just kept seeing him and
seeing him and seeing him.

248
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,116
- And you're still
driving this whole time?

249
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,246
- I do not believe I was, no.

250
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,626
Somebody had their hands on the wheel,

251
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,696
but I could not tell you
for sure they was mine.

252
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,576
- Holy Wah.
- Holy Wah is right.

253
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,186
So I jump out of the truck,

254
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,466
and still he don't move a muscle.

255
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,656
It was like he was waiting for me,

256
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,566
just standing there, tall and proud,

257
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,379
like the trophy that he is.

258
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:43,566
So I bring my gun up, put
my finger on the trigger,

259
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,869
take a deep breath-
- To steady your nerves.

260
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,746
- And that's when he spoke to me.

261
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,663
- He spoke to you?

262
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,663
(Albert laughs)

263
00:14:55,663 --> 00:15:00,347
- "Take me, Remnar, take me now." (laughs)

264
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:05,347
(Albert laughs)
(Remnar laughs)

265
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,583
- You buggered him.

266
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,409
Ah, you buggered him that time. (laughs)

267
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:21,293
He swallowed it all, all of it, all of it!

268
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:24,698
- Pop, I don't know whose
hands are on the wheel, eh?

269
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:27,246
(Albert and Remnar laugh)

270
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,820
I just made that up as I was telling him.

271
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,159
(Albert and Remnar laugh)

272
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,976
A 50-point buck.

273
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,496
- [Albert] That might be the only buck

274
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:36,423
you see this year, eh?

275
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:39,956
- You're just jealous 'cause
I kicked your butt last year.

276
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:42,496
- You and all your talk put
together couldn't kick my butt.

277
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:45,296
- My 12-pointer to your
little four-point forkhorn.

278
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,576
I think that's a butt-kicking
in anybody's book.

279
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:48,996
Wouldn't you say that's
a butt-kicking, Reuben?

280
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,236
- Leave me out of it.

281
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:52,546
- I took the forkhorn and
passed on that 20-pointer.

282
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:54,956
I didn't have the clear shot.
- 20-pointer.

283
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,226
- That's right!

284
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:58,526
You can't make a clean kill,
don't make a kill at all.

285
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,136
- If you ain't gonna
pull the trigger, Pop,

286
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:01,226
than snap a picture.

287
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,306
At least then you'll have
something for the scrapbook.

288
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:05,956
- I shot the biggest buck of
anybody sitting in this room.

289
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:07,406
- When was that, Pop?

290
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:10,256
- November 15th, 1961.

291
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,546
Back when the bucks was as-

292
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,006
- Thick as mosquitoes.

293
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,836
- Thick as mosquitoes, that's right.

294
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:17,636
18-point, 15-inch thighs, 24-inch spread

295
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:20,756
with a weight of 284 pounds fully dressed,

296
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:21,916
and don't you forget it!

297
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,000
- Are you sure you didn't shoot a cow?

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,587
(Albert growls)

299
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:28,254
(Albert laughs)

300
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:30,366
- It would've been a state record

301
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,596
if I'd felt like reporting it.

302
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,756
- [Remnar] Well, it
wasn't 'cause you didn't.

303
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:34,589
- The hell it wasn't!

304
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:35,422
- You didn't report it, eh?

305
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,216
You don't report it, it
ain't a state record.

306
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:39,124
- I don't believe in state records.

307
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,079
- Oh, you don't believe in state records?

308
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,236
- I don't believe in anything
managed by the goddamned DNR.

309
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,246
- They aren't either managed by the DNR.

310
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,226
Reuben, what's the name
of that big game agency

311
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,930
down in-
- CBM?

312
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,546
- CBM, that's right, POP, CBM.

313
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,986
Stands for what, what's it stand for?

314
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,806
- Commemorative Bucks of Michigan.

315
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,406
- Commemorative Bucks of Michigan.

316
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:59,046
You gotta report it to
Commemorative Bucks of Michigan.

317
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,866
- When your great-grandpa Alphonse

318
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,956
tagged a Soady ridge buck back in 1922,

319
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,536
you think he notified the state?

320
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,369
Hell no!

321
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,586
- Probably hold the
state record if he had.

322
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,256
- He come back to the camp, pulled out

323
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,046
the Soady camp log and started writing

324
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,866
it down for all posterior.

325
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,216
Where is it?

326
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,116
- Right here, Pop.

327
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,269
1922.

328
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,716
- 28-points, with a rack spread

329
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:25,226
of 30 and three-quarter inches,

330
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:29,216
and an estimated weight of 334 pounds.

331
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,976
Boy, that ain't a state record.

332
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,276
That's a world record.

333
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:34,756
- How do you know everything
in here is on the up and up?

334
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,266
- If it's in there, it's the truth.

335
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,366
- Well, then make sure
there's a pencil handy

336
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,046
'cause when I come down
from the ridge tomorrow,

337
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,846
there's gonna be a new
Soady record holder, eh?

338
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,286
- You're hunting the ridge tomorrow?

339
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,926
- I hate to tell ya, but they ain't up

340
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,146
on the ridge this year.

341
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,226
- Big ones are on the
ridge, Pop, trust me.

342
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,806
- Big ones, eh?
- Oh, yeah, trophies.

343
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,326
I seen the tracks.

344
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:55,646
And you know what they say,
big bucks make big tracks.

345
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,616
Store that away for a rainy day.

346
00:17:57,616 --> 00:17:59,266
- You mind if I hunt it with you?

347
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,369
- I like to hunt alone.

348
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:05,146
- Well, you know, I
don't mean side-by-side.

349
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,526
I'll take the one end, you take the other.

350
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:08,796
- No, that's no good, neither,

351
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,116
'cause then when we get to the middle,

352
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:11,747
we'll be shooting each other.

353
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:12,580
- What are you talking?

354
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,556
The ridge is five miles long.

355
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:15,736
- And I plan on hunting every inch of it.

356
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:17,836
I know, why don't you hunt the swamp?

357
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,256
- I'm hunting the swamp.

358
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:20,126
- The whole swamp?

359
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,256
- You're hunting the whole ridge?

360
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:22,838
- Well, that's how I hunt, eh?

361
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:23,671
- Well, that's how I hunt.
- Okay, wait a minute.

362
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,886
- You can't the ridge the
same way you hunt the swamp.

363
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:26,726
- The hell I can't!

364
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:27,793
- They're two different terrains!

365
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,066
- Hey, hey, hey, easy.

366
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,316
You know, if you're up on the ridge

367
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,586
and Pop is down in the swamp,

368
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:33,866
where the heck am I supposed to hunt?

369
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,001
- How about out by the road?

370
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:36,834
- How about what road?

371
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:37,766
- M35.

372
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:38,896
- It's a state highway.

373
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,086
- Deer love the highway.

374
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,686
- I hit one just last week.

375
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,056
- I'm not gonna hunt the highway.

376
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:43,996
It's a highway.

377
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:44,829
- Are you sure?

378
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,606
I think you might be
missing an opportunity here.

379
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,036
- You want me to set up a blind

380
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,936
on a shoulder of M35 and wait

381
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,676
for the next 10-pointer who tries to cross

382
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,526
it in traffic?

383
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,996
- I think you're getting the
plum spot, don't you, Pop?

384
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,086
- [Albert] Position A.

385
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,256
- That's how Bob McGinnis hunts.

386
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,836
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sets up a lawn chair

387
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,396
right on the side of the road and waits.

388
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:06,146
He'll sit there a whole week if he has to.

389
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,746
People bring him food, change of clothes.

390
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,486
- Hey, he ever marry that gal?

391
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,266
You know the one I'm talking about,

392
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,646
the one with the eyebrow going
straight across her head.

393
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:16,624
- Yeah, and she combs it
with her toothbrush. (laughs)

394
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,291
(Albert laughs)

395
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,467
(twangy, bluesy music)

396
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:57,998
(Albert knocks)

397
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:58,831
- Reuben.

398
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,936
(Albert sighs)

399
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,439
Reuben, open the damn door.

400
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:17,122
Oh, Jesus crumbs.

401
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:27,880
Holy Wah.

402
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,786
I admit I'm guilty in thinking

403
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,176
that maybe my luck would be better

404
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:36,679
if you was somewheres else.

405
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:40,816
That's no way to treat your own.

406
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:45,386
You wanna hunt the swamp
tomorrow, we'll hunt the swamp.

407
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:47,496
- Yeah, well, I'll just jinx you.

408
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,646
- I'll take my chances.

409
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,916
I think your problem's
more along the lines

410
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,439
you're just a shitty shot.

411
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,366
You couldn't hit the house
if you were standing in it.

412
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,039
It's a simple thing.

413
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:01,996
You just bring the gun up,

414
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,574
you put your finger on the trigger,

415
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:04,407
you take a deep-
- Take a deep breath

416
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:05,746
to steady your nerves,

417
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:06,579
I know it.
- To steady your nerves,

418
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,412
that's right.

419
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,256
Your great-grandpa Alphonse always said,

420
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:11,566
all good things come to those-

421
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,746
- Who shoot straight.
- To those that shoot

422
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:14,579
straight.

423
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,756
That's your problem in
a nutshell, right there.

424
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,035
Been a lifelong case of the buck fever.

425
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,339
- You think I'm cursed?

426
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,126
- (sighs) You're a Soady.

427
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,813
Soadys crap so big they
gotta stand up to get off it.

428
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:37,996
I'm thinking, I'm thinking
this is gonna be your year.

429
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,709
- Yeah, well, now you sound like my wife.

430
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:43,830
(Albert chuckles)

431
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,266
(Wolf Moon Dance gasps)

432
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,429
- What, what's wrong?

433
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,949
- It's my intuition.

434
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,136
It's telling me something.

435
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:55,156
- Oh, is it, is it, really?

436
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:55,989
What is it telling you?

437
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:58,216
- It's telling me, it's telling me

438
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,829
your luck's about to change.

439
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:04,044
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah, it is.

440
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:05,409
- I'm not so sure.
- Come listen.

441
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,806
- Do you really believe
everything in here is true?

442
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,786
- It's the Soady bible.

443
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,636
- You know what happened back in '72?

444
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,206
That was the year Uncle
Alvin got his first buck.

445
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:24,513
You know how old Uncle Alvin was

446
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,289
the year he got his first buck?

447
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,616
He was 43.

448
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,486
And besides being the
family idiot that he was.

449
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:32,416
I don't think you'll
disagree me with there.

450
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,013
- Dumb as dirt.

451
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:37,133
- "On November 15th, 1972, Alvin Soady,

452
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:38,763
"during the taking of his traditional,

453
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,623
"opening day morning crap,

454
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:43,193
"shot himself a six-pointer,
which happened to be

455
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,963
"sniffing around the back of the two-holer

456
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,213
"at the time that he was in it,

457
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:51,253
"making him, at the
embarrassing late age of 43,

458
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:54,386
"the oldest Soady in the
history of the Soadys

459
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,123
"ever to bag a buck."

460
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,662
(gun bangs)

461
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:01,079
(deer thuds)

462
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:10,029
Signed, his brother Albert Soady.

463
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:21,479
How old am I, Pop?

464
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,006
Pop?

465
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:27,909
- 43.

466
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:33,406
So there it was, staring us
right in the hairy eyeball.

467
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,916
We sat there trying to figure out some way

468
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,706
we could avoid Reuben ending up

469
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:40,096
on the wrong end of the record books.

470
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,486
The crazy thing about hunting is

471
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:45,166
you can plan all you want,
but, the truth of it is,

472
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,176
it's out of your hands.

473
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,374
And November of '89 was out of
our hands more than we knew.

474
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:54,541
(mysterious whizzing)

475
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:56,833
Whoa.

476
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:01,833
(mysterious whizzing)
(Albert and Reuben groan)

477
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,164
- Was that a sighting?

478
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:15,189
- I seen a sighting!

479
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:20,186
- [Albert] You need to
know about the UFOs.

480
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:21,796
They exist up here.

481
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,966
I seen one first back in
'65 over the Bark River,

482
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:28,716
this speeding silver streak of
light flying across the sky.

483
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:31,136
Bob McGinnis claims a bright white dish

484
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,996
come over the trees one night and settled

485
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:35,866
right above his boathouse,
just hovered there.

486
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,346
He thought for sure they
was about to take him away.

487
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,636
But if you know Bob, you
understand why they passed.

488
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,886
But the Jimmer was a different story.

489
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,896
Jimmer Negamanee from Menominee seen

490
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:47,333
the safe hovering light a few years ago,

491
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,689
except he was abducted,
disappeared for a whole weekend.

492
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:50,586
It's the truth.

493
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,676
'Cause when they brought him
back the following Monday,

494
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:54,296
there was a few changes
that were in the Jimmer

495
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,466
that were hard to ignore.

496
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,956
One was he talked different.

497
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,156
- My Chevy shook a shit!

498
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:03,210
(men mumble)

499
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,043
- Try Chevy.

500
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:05,656
- Something wrong with your Chevy, Jimmer?

501
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:08,620
- My Chevy shook a shit!

502
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,076
- Shook a shit?

503
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,581
Chevy took something.

504
00:25:11,581 --> 00:25:13,044
- Shit, shit.
- Shit.

505
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:13,877
- Shit.
- Shit, took a shit.

506
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,467
Your Chevy took a shit, Jimmer?

507
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,502
- Boodabeeboop!

508
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,455
- The shotgun, he wants the shotgun!

509
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:19,330
- The shotgun, the shotgun!

510
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,330
We'll get you the shotgun, Jimmer!

511
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,206
- Okay!

512
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:27,206
(men chattering)
(Jimmer shouting)

513
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,373
- [Albert] Get your butt up there!

514
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:35,206
(Jimmer shouting)

515
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:40,989
Another was, all of a sudden,
he could drink like a fish.

516
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,539
- [Reuben] Hang on,
Jimmer, hang on, hang on.

517
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:50,704
- Look what I got, eh?

518
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:51,885
- Oh!

519
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,704
- Don't that look nice?

520
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:55,311
- [Jimmer] Boodebeeboop!

521
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,228
- It's okay, it's okay.

522
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,416
There ya go.

523
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,502
- [Albert] The Jimmer had
become a living legend,

524
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:04,576
and not because he'd been abducted.

525
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,861
We get two or three of those a year.

526
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,776
- Two, three!

527
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,346
- [Albert] It was his
capacity for drinking

528
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,046
that spread through all the
watering holes in the U.P.

529
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:19,280
(Jimmer screams)

530
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,964
- With a whisky chaser!

531
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:23,830
- With a whisky chaser!

532
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,747
- With a whisky chaser!

533
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,256
- [Albert] The regulars
up to the Porcelain Bus

534
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,476
compare him to the late, great Himel Hyman

535
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:33,416
in the Cup-o-harder,
known amongst the Injuns

536
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:36,059
as the Great White Stomach.

537
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:39,096
Himel made a nice living drinking

538
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:41,266
any and all things put in front of him,

539
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,326
including that fateful
bucket of week-old wastewater

540
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:47,536
from the bilge of a
Scandinavian oil barge,

541
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:48,716
God rest his soul.

542
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:50,626
Jimmer Negamanee from Menominee

543
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,889
was cut from the same piece of cloth.

544
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:55,771
- This tastes like sap.

545
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:59,386
- Jimmer, where's your Chevy?

546
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,666
- Shook a shit.

547
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:01,546
- I know that, eh?

548
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,826
Where'd you leave it, out on 35?

549
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,466
- I leaves it at the road.

550
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,136
- Which road, the road into camp?

551
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,106
- On the camp road!

552
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:10,029
- Okay, all right.

553
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:14,856
What do you say we climb
down, jump in the truck,

554
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:16,885
see if we can get it started, eh?

555
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,026
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

556
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,086
- Shames?

557
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:21,229
- Shames, shames, shames!

558
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,080
(Jimmer screams)

559
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,172
- Calm down, just calm down.

560
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:28,005
Calm down.

561
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:31,505
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

562
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:36,143
(car rattles)

563
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:38,255
- My Chevy shook a shit.

564
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:41,755
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

565
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,761
So, as I was walking (indistinct)

566
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,121
down the (indistinct) road.

567
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,245
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

568
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:53,635
Til all of a sudden.

569
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:55,166
(fire crackles)

570
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:58,813
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

571
00:27:58,813 --> 00:27:59,705
(car revs)

572
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:02,745
Then, the strangest thing happened.

573
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:07,745
(Jimmer screams)
(horn honks)

574
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,833
(Jimmer whimpers)

575
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:16,506
I think I shit myself.

576
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,570
(bluesy music)

577
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,086
- Remnar, get the Jimmer a towel.

578
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,536
- You get the Jimmer a towel.

579
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:25,498
- [Albert] Goddamn it!

580
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,463
Jesus Christ!
- Pop!

581
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:30,380
(Albert grumbling)

582
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,045
Pop!

583
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,125
(glass shattering)

584
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:44,569
Pop, what's wrong?

585
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,319
- It's all sap.

586
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,579
Right out of the tree, sap.

587
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:56,016
- The whole batch?

588
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:58,769
- All that's missing is the
pancakes and the butter.

589
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:05,797
- Mr. Soady, does that means?

590
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:07,509
- I'm afraid so, Jimmer.

591
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,219
We're in deer camp without whisky.

592
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:23,529
- If I didn't know better,
I'd say this camp was.

593
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,956
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

594
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:35,176
- [Albert] If we'd had had
an ounce of sense amongst us,

595
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:38,806
we'd have drove back to
Escanaba as fast as we could,

596
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:41,976
but, as Great-Grandpa
Alphonse always used to say,

597
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:43,873
if you're looking back
at the things you missed,

598
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:45,569
you won't know what hit ya.

599
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:48,696
- Let's have a pasty, eh?

600
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:49,766
- Shasties!

601
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:51,626
- Mom made the best pasties, remember?

602
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,036
Remember how Ma used to make 'em?

603
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,226
- Nobody built a pasty like your mother.

604
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,776
- They were so good I could
almost eat six of them.

605
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,819
- We ain't having pasties this year.

606
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,236
- We ain't what?

607
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,717
(gun clicks)

608
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:19,306
- I don't know, thought we
might eat something different.

609
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,196
- Not at deer camp.

610
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:22,329
- At deer camp, we eat pasties.

611
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,556
- Well, you know, I just
thought it might change

612
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,156
our luck if we ate something else.

613
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,306
- My luck's just fine the way it is,

614
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,326
thank you very much.

615
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:30,716
- Speak for yourself, eh?

616
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:32,744
- I do believe I was, eh?

617
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:33,911
- No shasties?

618
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:37,656
- Let me remind you, eh, that pasties

619
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:39,106
have been the traditional meal of choice

620
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,526
since Great-Grandpa Alphonse
first built this camp.

621
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:42,526
- Change is good.

622
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:43,676
- Reuben, listen to me.

623
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,796
We've known each other since we was kids.

624
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:47,696
- We're brothers, Remnar.

625
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:48,956
- Hear me out.

626
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:52,704
You know how I can be a
little bit superstitious?

627
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,537
(Jimmer chuckles)

628
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,696
Any change in my deer camp ritual,

629
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:01,816
big or small, directly deflects the odds

630
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,476
of me bagging a big buck.

631
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,676
Every year, I pack up
my truck the same way.

632
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:07,106
I arrive at camp at the same time.

633
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,056
I wake up opening
morning at the same time.

634
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,346
4:44 am on the dot.

635
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,386
I go to the same blind
by way of the same route

636
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:15,006
with the same gun, the same buck calls,

637
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,346
and the same Spam and mayonnaise
on Bunny bread sandwich.

638
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:21,146
Everything is exactly the same.

639
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,689
Even the shirt on my back.

640
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,606
I've worn this same
shirt every opening day

641
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,939
since the age of nine.

642
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:29,966
Does it fit?

643
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,056
No.

644
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,986
Does it keep me warm?

645
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:34,146
No.

646
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:34,979
Does it smell?

647
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:35,899
Most definitely.

648
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:39,506
But does it guarantee the
big buck for yours truly?

649
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:41,589
You betcha.

650
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:44,516
Why?

651
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,459
Because it's part of Remnar
Soady's deer camp ritual.

652
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:51,746
A ritual that includes eating pasties.

653
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,186
- You wanna know what
happens every time I eat

654
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:54,616
pasties at deer camp?
- No.

655
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:58,446
- No, three decades of meat,
potatoes, rutabagas, and lard.

656
00:31:58,446 --> 00:31:59,776
Every year, I go out to my blind,

657
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:01,356
and I'm sitting out there
waiting for first light,

658
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:02,886
and the only sound I hear is the sound

659
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:05,586
of myself farting like a
tuba at the back of the band.

660
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,516
- Pasties is a Soady tradition.

661
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:09,889
- I know that very much.

662
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:14,389
But I got a vision,
too, Remnar, a real one.

663
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:18,919
I see myself coming back from camp,

664
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,009
carrying a 10-pointer on my back,

665
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,889
and my wife looks out, and I say to her,

666
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:30,943
"Put on the lard and onions, honey,

667
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:33,186
"I'm gonna gut you a buck."

668
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:36,736
And I am happy at last,
knowing that I, Reuben Soady,

669
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:39,219
have finally put the meat
on my family's table.

670
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,753
(gentle music)

671
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:58,529
- (sighs) I'll give it
a go for you, Reuben.

672
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:01,866
Sure.

673
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,703
Remnar?

674
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:17,086
You're a deer in my headlights, Remnar.

675
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:23,969
- (sighs) For this year only.

676
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:29,577
- Thank you, Remnar, thank you very much!

677
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:31,304
- [Jimmer] This is real nice.

678
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,386
- [Reuben] You won't be sorry, I promise.

679
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,621
- Ah, you just bag that buck this year.

680
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,454
- Oh, I will, I can feel it.

681
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:37,886
Maybe I'll even bag me a state record, eh?

682
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,250
- You see anything foraging, fire away.

683
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,790
- (laughs) I'd love to go tonight.

684
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,540
(men chattering)

685
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,853
- [Jimmer] I do some of
my best huntings at night.

686
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,343
(Reuben laughs)

687
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:03,843
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

688
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,986
- I can eat slapjacks
every day of the weeks, eh?

689
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,286
- I know you could, Jimmer.

690
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:10,926
- No, not flapjacks.

691
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,166
- Y'all don't like the slapjacks?

692
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,046
- Macaroni and cheese,
thank you very much.

693
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,868
- With Spam.
- With Spam.

694
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:17,416
- How's about slapjacks with Spams?

695
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,373
- Fellas-

696
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:19,726
- Just Spam for me.

697
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,946
- Kraft macaroni and cheese.

698
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:24,866
- No flapjacks, no macaroni
and cheese, and no Spam.

699
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:25,906
- No Spam?

700
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,796
- Boys, you are not only
going to eat like kings,

701
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:29,026
but that 20 bucks you was gonna throw

702
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,116
in the kitty for pasties, keep it.

703
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:34,286
I am about to feed the whole camp all week

704
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:36,009
for absolutely free.

705
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:38,736
- [Albert Voiceover] As
Grandpa Alphonse always said,

706
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,296
anything free is worth saving up for.

707
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:42,876
- Last month, I was
sitting down to supper.

708
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:44,256
Wolf Moon Dance comes out of the kitchen.

709
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,916
She says, "Here, drink this."

710
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,136
I didn't know what the heck it was.

711
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:48,316
So I said, "What the heck is it, eh?

712
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:50,743
She said, "There is more to bagging a buck

713
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,366
"than just shooting a gun."

714
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:54,623
- No shit, Cheyenne.

715
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:55,456
- Yeah, she said that before every hunt,

716
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:57,986
the Ojibwes prepare a special recipe

717
00:34:57,986 --> 00:34:59,806
to give the hunters good luck.

718
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,116
Before they can even enter the woods,

719
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:06,166
they believe that they have to
have the right air-a around.

720
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,016
- The right what?

721
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,586
- Air-a.

722
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:10,496
- What's a air-a.

723
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,006
- It's the air around you.

724
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,436
- We all got a air-a?

725
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:18,346
- Yeah, well, you know, at
least you're supposed to.

726
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,186
- I can feels my airish.

727
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,386
- That's good, Jimmer.

728
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,309
- How do you know when the
air around ya is your air-a?

729
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,466
- Your air is your air-a.

730
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,266
- Is my air-a my air?

731
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,446
- Just do the ritual, Remnar.

732
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:31,546
- Reuben, I'm just trying

733
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,874
to be clear here.
- Wait a minute,

734
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:33,716
we ain't gonna strip down to our skivvies

735
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,913
and dance around the table
like we did last Thanksgiving?

736
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:37,792
- Involved, no-
- No offense to

737
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:39,125
your Injun wife, but if
that's what I gotta do

738
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,196
to get a piece of turkey
over to your place,

739
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:41,256
I'll see you at Christmas.

740
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:43,036
- You do not have to do any of that!

741
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,486
I promise.

742
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:46,204
- Thank you very much for that.

743
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:48,288
- All you have to do is drink this potion.

744
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:49,121
- This what?

745
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:49,954
- Follow me.

746
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:55,286
- Did he say potion.

747
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,609
- I heard him say potion.

748
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,039
They're kinda yellow, don't you think?

749
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,414
- [Remnar] I don't know what those are.

750
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:03,247
They look like cheese.

751
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,649
- [Reuben] It's not cheese.

752
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:06,481
- [Remnar] Okay, but I do enjoy cheese.

753
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:09,381
- [Albert] Oh, so do I, but
it's cold on the bottom there.

754
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:11,455
- [Reuben] Yeah, it's just like-

755
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:12,288
- [Albert] Why do you got two of them for?

756
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:13,159
- This one's Jimmer's.

757
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:15,457
- Is it tasty?

758
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:16,290
- Oh, it's definitely got a taste to it,

759
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,469
no doubt about that.

760
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,302
- Oh!

761
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,135
- Is this what we're supposed to eat?

762
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,226
- Oh yeah, yeah, that's very filling.

763
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:21,526
One glass, three times a day,

764
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:23,246
and not only will your air-a be so strong,

765
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:24,079
instead of you hunting the bucks,

766
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,383
the bucks will be hunting you.

767
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:27,996
- I likes the sounds of that, eh?

768
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,949
- I still don't like the look of it.

769
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,466
Reuben, what are these
chunky little things

770
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,236
floating around in here?

771
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,019
- Protein, just chunks of protein.

772
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:41,955
- You got them, too, huh?

773
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:44,606
That thing in there, right?
- Pretty good there.

774
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:46,699
- You can take the lids
off, if you want, now.

775
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,046
- What are we doing out here?

776
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,046
- [Reuben] I gotta do a little ceremony.

777
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,254
- Jesus!
- Like what?

778
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,996
- Okay, all right.
- Reuben.

779
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,796
- All right.
- What the hell ya doing?

780
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:01,589
- Just a second here, I
gotta read this little thing.

781
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,156
Okay, the moon is the mirror reflecting

782
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:07,776
the passion within our soul

783
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:10,249
up to the Great Spirit, that's the moon,

784
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,856
who, once received and twice removed,

785
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,486
then sends it back down, guiding our lives

786
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,549
with eternal light that lives within us.

787
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:24,746
So far so good.

788
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,430
- What's that supposed to mean?

789
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,263
- Shh!

790
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:28,456
- Okay, this next part is a little tricky.

791
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:29,289
Just bear with me.

792
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,156
I'll nod when it's your turn to join in.

793
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,372
(tuner hums)

794
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:51,904
(Reuben shouts foreign language)

795
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:12,206
(Reuben chants foreign language)

796
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:39,622
You have to say it.

797
00:39:39,622 --> 00:39:43,372
(men speak foreign language)

798
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,123
- Tasty!

799
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:49,276
- Not bad.

800
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:50,926
- This has got a kick
to it, I'll say that it.

801
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,776
What proof is this, Reuben?

802
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:55,625
- Oh, sorry to say, there's
not a drop of alcohol in it.

803
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,586
- Well, it ain't no pasty pie,

804
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:57,976
but I'll tell you what, I could drink

805
00:39:57,976 --> 00:39:58,956
a few of these without looking up

806
00:39:58,956 --> 00:39:59,996
and saying hello, eh?

807
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:02,796
Just what the heck's that old
lady of yours got in here?

808
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:03,629
- Well, like I said,

809
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:06,206
this magic potion goes back generations.

810
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,116
- Yeah, but I might
wanna steal the recipe.

811
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,529
- Yep, you and me both.

812
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:12,414
- Well, all right, let's
see, I think she's got,

813
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:13,831
yeah, here it is.

814
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,086
Fill a large bucket with fresh cow's milk.

815
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:20,169
- Well, there's your
milkshake taste right there,

816
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,010
see?
- Yep.

817
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,966
- Then blend one ounce each of parsley,

818
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:23,946
ginger, and caraway
seeds, with eight ounces

819
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,986
of sap from a mature maple.

820
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:28,586
- I thought I tasted the sweet sap.

821
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:29,706
- [Reuben] And barley and yeast.

822
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:31,043
- Yeast!

823
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:32,456
- You gotta have yeast.

824
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:35,606
- Next, take 12 large
earthworms baked on a shovel,

825
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:36,866
the gizzard of a red squirrel,

826
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,986
four ounces of strained mule tail sweat,

827
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:41,046
100 finely crushed black flies,

828
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,986
a pinch of the dirt
surrounding a buck rub,

829
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,166
and the dried and powdered left testicle

830
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,469
of a fully grown moose.

831
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:52,189
Chill, and serve.

832
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,955
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

833
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,179
(Jimmer speaks gibberish)

834
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:27,126
That just breaks the spell.

835
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:29,646
Now, we gotta protect ourselves
from the evil spirits.

836
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,826
Wolf Moon Dance says for
every tree in the forest

837
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:32,659
there is a spirit.

838
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,146
Some are good, some are evil.

839
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:36,336
According to the Ojibwes,
this lets the good spirits in,

840
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:37,636
keeps the bad spirits out.

841
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,506
- Oh, smells like porcupine piss.

842
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:42,356
- [Reuben] It is.

843
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,579
- You wants us to drink this, too?

844
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:50,446
- No, no, no, no, no.

845
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:52,979
You just splash it on, you know, like so.

846
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:56,786
See, not only does it protect
you from evil spirits,

847
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:58,116
but, when it comes to the bucks,

848
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,723
it's an aphro, aphro?

849
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:02,766
- Deshilact?
- Yeah, yeah.

850
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:04,426
She said that her father
went out last year,

851
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:06,276
covered himself from
head to toe with piss.

852
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:09,016
15 minutes later, he was
surrounded by hundreds of bucks.

853
00:42:09,016 --> 00:42:10,709
- Hundreds of bucks?

854
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,206
- That's right, she said that
if you can stand the stink,

855
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:15,916
they'll walk right up
and introduce themselves.

856
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:19,256
- I can't believe I
drank a moose testicle.

857
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,089
- You're lucky.

858
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,025
I think it's one of them chunks I chewed.

859
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,498
- Say, Rubens.
- Hmm?

860
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,457
- How does a man goes
about extractions jars

861
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:30,806
of piss froms a porcupine?

862
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,296
- Well, you know, first
thing you gotta do, Jimmer,

863
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,286
is catch one, which I
did about a month back.

864
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:35,986
Nice 30-pounder.

865
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,928
- That's a good size quill cushion.

866
00:42:37,928 --> 00:42:39,599
- [Reuben] Oh, that's
a real good size, yeah.

867
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:43,226
- Say, you don't grabs him, dids yous?

868
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,955
- Oh, no, no.

869
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:45,836
- 'Cause if you grabs a porcupine,

870
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:47,076
you'll get stuck with his schtickers.

871
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:48,516
- Oh, no, no, you're right there, Jimmer.

872
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:50,046
No, no, I seen one down the Soady Creek.

873
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:51,346
He was sitting out on
a rock sunning himself-

874
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:53,536
- Right down Soady Creek, yeah.

875
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:54,656
- I snuck up behind him, you know.

876
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,263
I threw a blanket over the top of him

877
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:58,094
and took him home.

878
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,316
- No schtickers?
- No schtickers.

879
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:00,299
Stickers, stickers.

880
00:43:01,136 --> 00:43:02,659
Yeah.

881
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:03,859
- [Albert] Where's Jack?

882
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,066
- Yeah, so anyway, you
know, I took him home,

883
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:08,872
and I put him out in this cage out back

884
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:09,705
that I made special.

885
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,956
Had a little wire floor of a
top with this pan underneath.

886
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,466
Then I spent the whole entire next week

887
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,066
making that quill pen drink
all the water he could stand.

888
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,196
Come Saturday, the pan was overflowing.

889
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,236
- Reuben-
- So then it was just

890
00:43:21,236 --> 00:43:22,446
a matter of pouring some of the piss

891
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,086
into the wife's spare
pickle jars, you know,

892
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:25,316
and letting them sit out
in the sun, you know,

893
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,166
so they could ripen up-

894
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,836
- Reuben!
- A day, what?

895
00:43:27,836 --> 00:43:29,306
- Between your moose-ball milkshakes

896
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,426
and your pickle jars
full of porcupine piss,

897
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:32,556
I think you got us covered, eh?

898
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,096
- I was explaining to the Jimmer-

899
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:35,846
- Let me ask you this,
is there a magic potion

900
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,056
for dealing out loaner hands,

901
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:38,585
'cause that would be helpful.

902
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:39,419
- I don't think-

903
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:40,252
(Albert speaks indistinctly)

904
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:41,176
- I was talking to my partner,

905
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:42,779
thank you very much.
- Yeah.

906
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:44,866
- Jimmer, as always,

907
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,456
take no prisoners.
- Take no prisoners.

908
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:49,415
- Do me a favor, will ya?

909
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,396
Try to remember what trump is.

910
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,586
You cost us the championship last year.

911
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:54,419
- What cost us the championship

912
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,026
was when somebody I won't mention

913
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,303
called for a loaner and then got

914
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,466
ukered for three tricks.

915
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:00,851
That's what cost us the-

916
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,498
- I was two-suited with eights
high, thank you very much.

917
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,331
- Two-suited with the eights high

918
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:05,440
is not a loaner hand, Remnar.

919
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,329
- Reuben, listen to me-
- Look, I got five cards.

920
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:08,606
Five cards, I am sitting
right across the table.

921
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:10,579
- But you don't know how
to use the card, all right?

922
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:11,806
- I am your partner.

923
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:13,086
- What is trump?
- I am here to-

924
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,116
- What's trump?

925
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,288
What's trump?

926
00:44:15,288 --> 00:44:16,121
- Ladies!

927
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:20,500
(Albert laughs)

928
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,430
- [Reuben] Think that'll work.

929
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,097
(Remnar laughs)

930
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,067
Take that, little boy.

931
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,727
- Here's to one, here's to one.

932
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:34,561
- [Albert] I'm damn sick and
tired of cleaning up after you.

933
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:39,561
(men chatter)
(twangy music)

934
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:43,917
- Sometimes it's deer season, Remnar,

935
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,581
sometimes it's deer season.

936
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:47,778
(Reuben laughs)

937
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:49,044
(twangy music)
(men chattering)

938
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:51,023
- Are you drunk?
- Oh, yeah.

939
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,163
- You're drunk now?

940
00:44:52,163 --> 00:44:55,339
(men chattering)

941
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,416
- Have another hit of sweet sap.

942
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:02,170
(twangy music)
(men chattering)

943
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,753
(twangy music)

944
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:19,616
- Oh, Reuben, I swear to God.

945
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,200
- You can't tell him.

946
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,319
- Camp's rules, the camp's rules!

947
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:25,986
- If he forgot, he forgot, he's
gotta play without knowing.

948
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:28,336
- Reuben, you forgot what
trump is again, haven't ya?

949
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:30,076
Haven't you, Reuben?

950
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:31,479
- I can't finish this hand.

951
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:34,059
- Nothing but nines and 10s?

952
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,509
- More like twos, threes, and fours.

953
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:47,236
- There ain't no twos, threes,
and fours in a uker hand.

954
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:50,626
- Maybe when he shuffled, he
picked up the wrong cards.

955
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:52,116
- The only decks in this
camp are uker decks.

956
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,566
Ain't no twos, threes,
and fours within 20 miles.

957
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,637
(Albert whimpers)

958
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:03,386
The Jimmer's Impala
catching fire was one thing,

959
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,736
and the best backwoods whisky in the U.P.

960
00:46:05,736 --> 00:46:08,429
curdling like milk right
under our nose was another,

961
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:11,096
but when the cards changed face

962
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:15,386
right in our very own hands,
we thought we'd seen it all.

963
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:17,886
(tense music)

964
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:25,568
(men panting)
(tense music)

965
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:31,932
(mysterious knocking)

966
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:38,365
(mysterious howling)

967
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,663
(mysterious knocking)

968
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:48,978
(mysterious chittering)

969
00:46:55,308 --> 00:46:58,391
(mysterious banging)

970
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,915
(mysterious growling)

971
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:49,069
And then, just when we thought
it couldn't get any worse.

972
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:50,747
(Reuben shouts)

973
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:55,169
- Ranger Tom T. Treado,
Department of Natural Resources!

974
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:03,949
- Pop, no!

975
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:07,466
- Welcome to Soady deer
camp, Officer Treado.

976
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:09,456
- Please, call me Ranger Tom.

977
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:10,716
- [Men] Ranger Tom.

978
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:12,941
- I'm Reuben Soady, this
is my pop Albert Soady,

979
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,873
that's my big baby brother Remnar Soady,

980
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:16,136
and the living legend you
got right next to you there

981
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:18,246
is the one only Jimmer
Negamanee from Menominee.

982
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,636
- My Chevy shook a shit.

983
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:21,766
- I got a ticket from every DNR officer

984
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:22,966
who ever set foot in these woods.

985
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,473
I sure don't remember seeing you.

986
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:26,836
- I just got transferred up
to this part of the state.

987
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:27,796
- Oh, where from?

988
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:30,081
- Detroit.

989
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:32,513
- Oh, yeah.
- Detroit.

990
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:34,313
- What a shity, that's a nice place.

991
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,047
I been there once.
(men chatter)

992
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,486
- I rode on this thing.

993
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,026
It took all the people around.
- You are not gonna believe

994
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:42,336
the night we had, Ranger Tom.

995
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,248
- It all started with Jimmer's Impala.

996
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:45,081
- My Chevy shook a shit.

997
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:45,914
- Brand new used Impala.

998
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:46,747
- Burst into flames.

999
00:48:46,747 --> 00:48:47,580
- Yeah, yeah.
- No reason, eh?

1000
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,916
- Then the sweet sap, right, Pop?

1001
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:49,914
- Sap!

1002
00:48:49,914 --> 00:48:51,141
- The slapjacks!
- The flapjacks.

1003
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:53,641
(men chatter)

1004
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:08,836

- [Albert] He sung the whole damn song.

1013
00:49:53,886 --> 00:49:56,956
Him being from the DNR,
we didn't wanna interrupt

1014
00:49:56,956 --> 00:50:00,156
for fear he might take
away our hunting licenses.

1015
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:02,356
You gotta remember, this time of year,

1016
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:05,226
the DNR is more powerful than God.

1017
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:07,836
In fact, some of them think they are God.

1018
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:09,619
Or, in Ranger Tom's case.

1019
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:13,119
- I just saw God up on your ridge.

1020
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,546
- Huh, well, it's a beautiful ridge.

1021
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:22,399
- No, I saw God up on your ridge.

1022
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:24,581
- God?
- God?

1023
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,414
- The one with the angels?

1024
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:28,086
- With heaven and the angels
and the manager, that's right.

1025
00:50:28,086 --> 00:50:29,419
- You saw the manager?

1026
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:32,846
- Are you sure it wasn't a spaceship?

1027
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:34,413
- No, he's right, you know.

1028
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:35,246
It might have been just a UFO.

1029
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:37,136
- Jimmer was abducted by aliens.

1030
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,176
- [Jimmer] I spent the whole
weekend in a spaceship.

1031
00:50:39,176 --> 00:50:41,066
- There was a light.

1032
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:42,106
- [Albert] You saw a light?

1033
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,119
- We seen the light, too, right, Pop?

1034
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,542
- Yeah.
- We seen a light.

1035
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,375
- Was it hovering?

1036
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,126
'Cause mine was hovering right above me,

1037
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:48,636
right before they sucked me up in a chute.

1038
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:49,469
- No.

1039
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:55,286
This was the light, the light you see

1040
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:59,249
right before you see God.

1041
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:07,839
I was out combing the area
for irregularities, you know?

1042
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:10,919
We got a lot of orange coming up

1043
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:13,006
over that ridge tonight.

1044
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,879
Gotta go out there, establish a presence.

1045
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:19,640
(mysterious music)

1046
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:23,776
At first, I thought it was the moon

1047
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:26,536
coming out from behind a cloud.

1048
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:31,536
But then, words started
falling out of my mouth,

1049
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:34,659
words I'd never said before,

1050
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:39,679
words I didn't know the meaning of.

1051
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:45,006
I lost all sense of time and place

1052
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:47,349
and my place in time.

1053
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:53,816
I began questioning the
futility of my existence,

1054
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:57,146
my mind racing with a never-ending stream

1055
00:51:57,146 --> 00:52:01,226
of ceaseless, incessant contemplation,

1056
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:04,976
examining, reexamining the relevance

1057
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:08,866
of my sad excuse for a life,

1058
00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:11,196
clinging to a deeply-seated faith

1059
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:14,396
versus modern society's insistence

1060
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:19,396
that if mankind cannot explain
it it can't possibly exist.

1061
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:27,411
Or

1062
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,539
is that simply a reflection
of the world we live in,

1063
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:44,716
or I live in, or the way I
choose to live in the world,

1064
00:52:46,326 --> 00:52:48,689
if I even live in a world.

1065
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:51,662
Is this a world?

1066
00:52:55,176 --> 00:52:56,859
And, if it is, am I in it?

1067
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,409
And if I am, why?

1068
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:09,136
For what purpose, for what reason,

1069
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:14,136
for what possible reason
is my being, being.

1070
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:21,506
There's no method behind whatever madness

1071
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:23,836
was orchestrated on my behalf.

1072
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:27,276
They'd spent the time, energy,
and spiritual wherewithal

1073
00:53:27,276 --> 00:53:31,066
to make sure that, damn it,
at least this mass of flesh,

1074
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:35,276
blood, and bones is,
this carcass with a pulse

1075
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:38,556
gets to breath the air, drink the water,

1076
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:41,496
and eat the food like I'd never eat again.

1077
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:45,708
- I've been thinking.
- Damn it!

1078
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,541
- What?

1079
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,924
- What is this mass of flesh?
- You know, with everything

1080
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:49,836
that's happened, maybe it'd be better

1081
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:50,926
if we just jumped in our trucks,

1082
00:53:50,926 --> 00:53:52,256
drove back to Escanaba.

1083
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:53,576
- No deer season?

1084
00:53:53,576 --> 00:53:55,796
- If you think after I
just got done drinking

1085
00:53:55,796 --> 00:53:58,183
the left testicle of a
full grown moose that I'm-

1086
00:53:58,183 --> 00:54:00,346
- I'm just saying maybe
we should come back

1087
00:54:00,346 --> 00:54:02,159
when things aren't so weird.

1088
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:06,796
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪

1089
00:54:06,796 --> 00:54:09,916
- Nobody leaves this camp til I say so.

1090
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:13,136
Last time I checked,
tomorrow's still opening day,

1091
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:16,690
and we are gonna hunt it.
♪ Swing low ♪

1092
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,479
Now hit the sack, all of ya.

1093
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:24,476
You, too.

1094
00:54:27,922 --> 00:54:31,505
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪

1095
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:39,806
Now, the night in the U.P.
is a whole different animal.

1096
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,949
There's a stillness to it, like black ice.

1097
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:47,264
You can't see it.

1098
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:49,879
You can't touch it.

1099
00:54:51,076 --> 00:54:53,456
And, if you're not careful, it'll wrap

1100
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,966
its arms around you and squeeze

1101
00:54:56,966 --> 00:55:00,206
til the only sound you hear
is your own heart beating

1102
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,719
and your own breath breathing.

1103
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:16,896
Reuben said later he wasn't sure

1104
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,696
what it was that woke him.

1105
00:55:18,696 --> 00:55:20,676
Might've been a dream.

1106
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,196
Might've been the moonlight coming out

1107
00:55:22,196 --> 00:55:25,296
from behind a cloud, or it might have been

1108
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:29,319
the sound of all those deer.

1109
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,206
(mysterious snorting)

1110
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,386
Put your finger on the trigger.

1111
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,286
- Just bring your gun up.
- Steady your nerves.

1112
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,546
- Just bring your gun up.
- Put your finger

1113
00:55:53,546 --> 00:55:56,143
on the trigger.
- Just bring your gun up.

1114
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:59,873
- Steady your nerves!
- Just bring your gun up.

1115
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:01,373
- [Albert] Put your finger on the trigger.

1116
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:03,956
(Reuben gasps)

1117
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,633
Do it.

1118
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:20,216
(mysterious snorting)

1119
00:56:41,288 --> 00:56:45,288
(mysterious, whispering voices)

1120
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:59,203
(Reuben panting)

1121
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:02,786
(mysterious voice rumbles)

1122
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:19,373
(Reuben gasps)

1123
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:37,037
(mysterious voice rumbles)
(voices shout)

1124
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:50,558
(people shout)
(low rock music)

1125
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,368
(low rock music)

1126
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:53,664
(Reuben panting)

1127
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:15,706
- [Wolf Moon Dance] Be-ah-ee.

1128
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:26,921
Be-ah-ee, be-ah-ee, be-ah-ee.

1129
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,960
(Remnar snores)

1130
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:58,654
(Remnar gags)

1131
01:00:15,823 --> 01:00:18,406
(Jimmer farts)

1132
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:26,569
- Well, now we know why the
aliens brought him back.

1133
01:00:31,084 --> 01:00:33,667
(Remnar sighs)

1134
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:40,743
Keeping a lookout, eh?

1135
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:43,249
Good idea.

1136
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,539
I gotta go to the two-holer.

1137
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,476
If I'm not back in five minutes,

1138
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,076
you might wanna come and get me.

1139
01:00:57,546 --> 01:01:00,299
I mean, who knows what's out there?

1140
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:05,473
Could be anything, aliens, bears.

1141
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:12,889
Alien bears.

1142
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:20,426
Might even be God himself,
just like Ranger Tom said.

1143
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:25,699
Chances are, though,
that if God is out there,

1144
01:01:26,536 --> 01:01:28,386
I gotta believe the last place he'd be

1145
01:01:28,386 --> 01:01:30,676
would be the Soady two-holer, eh?

1146
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:37,386
I tell ya what.

1147
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:40,799
If I happen to run into God
out there, hold your fire.

1148
01:01:42,016 --> 01:01:43,779
In fact, if you see me doing this,

1149
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,709
that means hold your fire,
I'm with God, okay, Reuben?

1150
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:07,246
Reuben?

1151
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:08,079
- Be-ah-ee.

1152
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:12,289
(Remnar gasps)

1153
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:16,580
- Pop, wake up!

1154
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,896
(Albert shout)

1155
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:21,129
There's something wrong with Reuben.

1156
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:24,918
I was on my way out to the two-holer, eh?

1157
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:27,519
- You smell like you didn't make it.

1158
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,955
- I'm on my way out there.

1159
01:02:28,955 --> 01:02:30,086
I was just talking to him,

1160
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:31,786
and, all of a sudden.
- Be-ah-ee.

1161
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:36,376
- Give me some of the porcupine piss.

1162
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:43,371
- It's the curse, ain't it?

1163
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:45,156
- Don't give me that curse crap.

1164
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:46,756
This'll do it even if he's dead.

1165
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:53,308
- Holy Mary, Mother of God,
Father and Son, Holy Ghost.

1166
01:02:53,308 --> 01:02:54,997
Mother of Mary, Mother of God.

1167
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:56,639
- Be-ah-ee!

1168
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,479
- All right, that's it.

1169
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:00,856
Stand back.

1170
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:02,502
I don't wanna hit ya.

1171
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:03,336
- Pop, what are you doing?

1172
01:03:03,336 --> 01:03:05,956
- I'm gonna fire a round off
next to his head, wake him up.

1173
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:07,656
- You can't do that, he'll go deaf.

1174
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:09,076
- He's already deaf, look at him.

1175
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:09,909
- Wait.

1176
01:03:09,909 --> 01:03:11,126
I got a better idea.

1177
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:13,226
I got some 100 foot jumper
cables out in my truck.

1178
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:14,736
I'll pull it up close, hook the one

1179
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:16,306
up to my Diehard, the other to Reuben.

1180
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,946
Count of three, I'll start it up.

1181
01:03:17,946 --> 01:03:19,096
- Are you out of your mind?

1182
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:21,196
- I seen Bob McGinnis do it once.

1183
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:23,216
- Oh, well, that would
explain a lot, wouldn't it?

1184
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,346
Think of something else!

1185
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,656
- I can't think of nothing else.

1186
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:26,726
I'm thought out.

1187
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:28,266
- [Albert] And then it happened.

1188
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:31,348
Like a vice from heaven, it called to us.

1189
01:03:31,348 --> 01:03:33,931
(Jimmer farts)

1190
01:03:45,816 --> 01:03:46,649
- Get closer.

1191
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,393
Look out!

1192
01:03:50,616 --> 01:03:51,816
Here, hold on to Reuben.

1193
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,769
- Wait a minute.

1194
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:57,085
I got him.

1195
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:16,166
- Get him in there.

1196
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:29,916
- Got him in there good?

1197
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:32,259
- If he was any closer, he'd be attached.

1198
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,496
- If the Jimmer cuts loose on a big one,

1199
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:42,666
he's liable to come shooting
back this way, so get ready.

1200
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:44,416
- If he cuts loose with a big one,

1201
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:46,329
he'll blow his head right off.

1202
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,660
- What's he looking for?

1203
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:14,656
- Reuben's froze up.

1204
01:05:14,656 --> 01:05:16,039
- We think maybe he's cursed.

1205
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:17,826
- He's not wither cursed, he's just-

1206
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,256
- Cursed, look at him!

1207
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:21,736
- [Albert] We must've stood
there for a good 30 minutes.

1208
01:05:21,736 --> 01:05:23,516
Nobody moved a muscle.

1209
01:05:23,516 --> 01:05:26,526
Unfortunately, that included the Jimmer.

1210
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:29,986
Finally, Ranger Tom suggested
some basic DNR training

1211
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:32,676
he thought might be
useful in this situation.

1212
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:33,919
- Pump his legs.

1213
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:46,429
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

1214
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:51,429
- [Men] Five potato, six
potato, seven potato, more.

1215
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:55,164
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

1216
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:58,836
- Must be clogged, keep pumping.

1217
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:04,943
- [Albert And Remnar]
One potato, two potato,

1218
01:06:04,943 --> 01:06:06,526
three potato, four.

1219
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:12,536
- [Men] Five potato, six
potato, seven potato, more.

1220
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:17,203
One potato, two potato, three
potato, four, five potato.

1221
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:22,328
(twangy music)

1222
01:07:02,082 --> 01:07:05,656
- Well, that explains my dream.

1223
01:07:05,656 --> 01:07:07,116
- Reuben's froze up.
- This ain't what

1224
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:09,476
it looks like.
- I was on my way out

1225
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:10,309
to the two-holer, and I said,

1226
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:12,206
"Reuben, cover me, I'm
going to the two-holer,"

1227
01:07:12,206 --> 01:07:13,966
'cause all the goings-on around here,

1228
01:07:13,966 --> 01:07:15,176
and we didn't have no smelling salts.

1229
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:16,836
- Up on the lake.
- Yeah, down at the lake.

1230
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:18,410
So we tried the porcupine piss.

1231
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,406
(Jimmer farts)
We even almost hooked

1232
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:21,454
him up to my Sears Diehard, eh?

1233
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,287
But then you let go of a good one

1234
01:07:22,287 --> 01:07:24,414
right as we were about
to fire up the truck,

1235
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:25,446
so we said, hey, what better way to snap

1236
01:07:25,446 --> 01:07:26,966
someone out of Looneyville

1237
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:28,626
than with one of your good old, you know.

1238
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:29,916
Right, right, so that's why Reuben

1239
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:34,207
is, you know, where he is.
(Jimmer screams)

1240
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:39,207
Look out!
(Jimmer farts)

1241
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,932
(Jimmer howls)

1242
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:12,914
- Reuben. (coughs)

1243
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:14,742
Reuben, where are ya?

1244
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:17,242
(Albert gags)

1245
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:22,343
Reuben, Reuben, Reuben!

1246
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:29,019
I got ya, Reuben!

1247
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,122
(Reuben screams)

1248
01:08:35,618 --> 01:08:37,830
- I can do it again if he needs it!

1249
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:38,663
- [Men] No!

1250
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:39,646
- Take care of Ranger Tom!

1251
01:08:39,646 --> 01:08:41,788
I think he's a little discombobulated.

1252
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:42,621
- [Jimmer] I got you!

1253
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,291
- Pop, help me get him to the couch.

1254
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,749
- Get him to the couch.
- He's crazy!

1255
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:47,193
- [Albert] Get him on the
couch, get him on the couch.

1256
01:08:48,127 --> 01:08:50,460
(men shout)

1257
01:08:51,963 --> 01:08:55,446
- Where is it, where is it, where is it?

1258
01:08:55,446 --> 01:08:56,700
- Where's what?

1259
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,579
- I seen a light.

1260
01:08:57,579 --> 01:08:58,423
- Light, did you say a light?

1261
01:08:58,423 --> 01:08:59,263
- I seen a light.
- Where?

1262
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,316
- I seen it in the
window, right over there.

1263
01:09:00,316 --> 01:09:01,846
- I saw a light up on the ridge.

1264
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,126
- I seen mine at the window.

1265
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,963
- You sure it wasn't a spaceship?

1266
01:09:04,963 --> 01:09:06,804
- Did it call to you?

1267
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:07,637
- What?
- Mine hovered.

1268
01:09:07,637 --> 01:09:09,846
- I'm not talking to you,
sir, I'm talking to him!

1269
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,849
Please, wait over there by your vehicle.

1270
01:09:12,726 --> 01:09:14,666
Did you walk towards it like I did?

1271
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:15,966
- No, I tried to shoot it.

1272
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:18,047
- You don't shoot God.

1273
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:18,880
- That was God?

1274
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,876
- Of course it was God!

1275
01:09:19,876 --> 01:09:21,830
- I almost shot God.

1276
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,307
- Going to the light was people.

1277
01:09:23,307 --> 01:09:24,557
- Listen to me!

1278
01:09:25,646 --> 01:09:28,346
As an officer of the Department
of Natural Resources,

1279
01:09:28,346 --> 01:09:31,766
I hereby command you to release and reveal

1280
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:36,066
any and all information
pertaining to said disturbance.

1281
01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:38,166
Leave nothing out.

1282
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:39,866
Can you do that?

1283
01:09:39,866 --> 01:09:40,787
- Well, it's a little fuzzy.

1284
01:09:40,787 --> 01:09:42,306
(hand smacks)

1285
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:44,096
- Sit down.

1286
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,389
The man's about to speak.

1287
01:09:49,826 --> 01:09:50,659
- There were these people.

1288
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:51,966
- The people, how do you mean people?

1289
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:53,986
- Well, these people
that I knew weren't there

1290
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,006
'cause they couldn't have been there

1291
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:57,186
'cause they weren't
real, except they were.

1292
01:09:57,186 --> 01:09:58,039
- Ghosts?

1293
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:01,176
- You was one of them.

1294
01:10:02,296 --> 01:10:04,196
You, too, Pop.

1295
01:10:04,196 --> 01:10:05,196
And the Jimmer.

1296
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:06,896
- Yeah, well, how about me?

1297
01:10:06,896 --> 01:10:07,729
- No.

1298
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:09,816
But I was.

1299
01:10:09,816 --> 01:10:11,936
I was there, I seen me.

1300
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:13,236
I was looking right at me.

1301
01:10:15,406 --> 01:10:20,156
And then I looked up, and
a long, long way of pines,

1302
01:10:20,156 --> 01:10:21,559
you know, there she was.

1303
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,566
I wanted to run to her so bad.

1304
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:25,596
She was so beautiful.

1305
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,663
That's when Wolf Moon
Dance, she looked up.

1306
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:29,496
- [Albert Voiceover] For
those of you planning

1307
01:10:29,496 --> 01:10:31,759
on traveling to the U.P. any time soon,

1308
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:34,709
you need to know about the bear walks.

1309
01:10:35,996 --> 01:10:39,232
- Head of a buck and a body of a man.

1310
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:40,065
- [Albert Voiceover] You
won't find them listed

1311
01:10:40,065 --> 01:10:42,376
in the travel books they
pass out at the bridge,

1312
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:46,206
but they're as much a
part of the Superior State

1313
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:47,539
as the pictured rocks.

1314
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:51,006
The Indians are scared to death of them.

1315
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:54,656
They say it starts out as a light.

1316
01:10:54,656 --> 01:10:55,986
Then it changes,

1317
01:10:55,986 --> 01:11:00,986
usually into a bear, a
raccoon, wolf, even a buck.

1318
01:11:02,636 --> 01:11:05,916
The human part, that's the
spirit that it come from

1319
01:11:06,866 --> 01:11:10,569
come back looking for
something, or somebody.

1320
01:11:15,736 --> 01:11:18,546
- That's why the sweet
sap turned to syrup.

1321
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:20,696
- And the uker cards
changed their numbers.

1322
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:23,266
- And Jimmer's Chevy took a shit.

1323
01:11:24,806 --> 01:11:26,489
- Be-ah-ee, that's his name.

1324
01:11:27,736 --> 01:11:29,999
Be-ah-ee, the bear walk.

1325
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,196
- What's happening to me, Pop?

1326
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:40,685
What's happening to me?

1327
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:47,621
(jars rattle)

1328
01:11:56,795 --> 01:12:00,206
(mysterious growling)

1329
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,706
(lights buzz)

1330
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:09,081
(wind whistles)

1331
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:14,755
(lights buzz)

1332
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:32,621
(Jimmer shouts gibberish)
(lights buzz)

1333
01:12:54,456 --> 01:12:56,706
Jimmer, Jimmer, easy, easy.

1334
01:13:06,997 --> 01:13:07,914
Easy, easy.

1335
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:13,581
(Jimmer shouts gibberish)

1336
01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:19,966
Come on, come on, come on.

1337
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:25,212
- [Jimmer] Sacrafish,
sacrafish, sacrafish!

1338
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:26,329
- Sacrafish?

1339
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,458
- Sacrifice!

1340
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:28,291
- What?

1341
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,006
- Sacrifice, the bear
walk wants a sacrifice.

1342
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:32,856
- What the hell are we gonna give it?

It's the bear walk!
- No, it's not him.

1379

- I'm trying to kill the bear walk.

1380
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:23,600
- It's me, it's me.
- What are you talking about?

1381

- I've seen the light,

1382
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:25,266
I've seen the light.
- No, no, that's the

1383
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,881
northern lights, just northern lights

1384
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:27,727
coming over the ridge.

1385
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:28,963
They bounce off the
water, that's all it is.

1386
01:17:28,963 --> 01:17:30,363
- I'm cursed, don't you see?

1387
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:32,409
I'm cursed.

1388
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:36,689
There's only one way to break
a curse like the one I got.

1389
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:40,733
Every year, you tell me,

1390
01:17:40,733 --> 01:17:43,222
"This is gonna be your year, Reuben.

1391
01:17:43,222 --> 01:17:44,511
"This is gonna be your year."

1392
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:46,436
Well, you know what, you're right.

1393
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:49,116
Either way, it's gonna stop.

1394
01:17:49,116 --> 01:17:50,526
Either I'm gonna get eat bear walk

1395
01:17:50,526 --> 01:17:52,926
or that bear walk's gonna eat me.

1396
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:56,509
But somebody is gonna be putting
