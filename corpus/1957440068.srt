- Yeah.

that you were still here.

Oh.

00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm happy.

Um, okay, I'm gonna run.

Uh, next time you're in
town, uh, give me a ring.

51
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,283
Three grand.

52
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,280
Three grand to stay the rest of the day.

back to my roommate.

Um.

56
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,423
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,258
Um.

58
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:00,794
Am I being offensive?

59
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,650
I haven't done this before.

60
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,235
I just, I like you.

61
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,474
And I thought with last night,

62
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,143
you seemed pretty...

63
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,023
[chuckles]

64
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,942
Um, let me start again.

65
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:16,573
Are you around today?

66
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,714
Because I would really like to spend

67
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,413
the rest of the day with you.

68
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,783
And I know that you're probably busy,

69
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:26,148
so I could give you
something for your time.

70
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,354
$4,000 be enough?

71
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,189
Um.

72
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:34,743
I don't know, it still
feels kind of weird.

73
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,983
You know what I do with my paintings?

74
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,333
I um, I detach myself from them.

75
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,168
I...

76
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,245
I don't know, I think of
them as a lump of coal,

77
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:45,970
or, or a barrel of oil,

78
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,951
the furthest thing from which they are.

79
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,125
And I give them a price

80
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,782
and then I let the market do its dance,

81
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,873
free and unfettered from
any emotional reaction.

82
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,685
But what if it was
you and not a painting?

83
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:01,554
[Man] Let me get what I can get.

84
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:04,320
Everything has a number
and that number is its price.

85
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,493
[Man] Simple.

86
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:06,949
What if there is no number?

87
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,783
[scoffs] Then it's known as worthless.

88
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:10,789
Or priceless.

89
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,234
[Man laughs]

90
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:13,973
You don't think things
are priceless, do you?

91
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,808
I don't.

92
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:18,543
- Everything has a price?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,535
What about God?

94
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:26,103
What uh, what number
would you give for God?

95
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,172
[Man laughs]

96
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,007
Um.

97
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:34,202
Okay, uh, just so I can
play correctly here,

98
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,572
God in this scenario
is you, or God is God?

99
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:38,482
God is God.

100
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:39,823
Zero.

101
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,303
- God is worthless.
- There is no God.

102
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:44,887
I'm talking in the market, right?

103
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:45,914
In the real world.

104
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,354
God has no bearing on the price of things,

105
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,201
therefore, God has no value.

106
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,711
But what if I say there is a God,

107
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,727
and honoring him costs money.

108
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,772
Well, then God has a number for you,

109
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:58,782
but to me, God is a zero.

110
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:00,322
So everyone has their own numbers

111
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:01,842
and can make up their own numbers.

112
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:05,150
And thus a market is created.

113
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,892
And those with more numbers to spend

114
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,207
can make up higher numbers
and take whatever they want.

115
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,852
Yes, and those with
lower numbers must adapt

116
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:14,269
and make higher numbers and acquire power.

117
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,772
- Except for God?
- Except for God,

118
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,274
who doesn't exist.

119
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:26,506
5,000.

120
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:32,951
And your real name.

121
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:36,402
Clarissa is my real
name, and no anal sex.

122
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,211
[Man] Make up another name then.

123
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,045
Why?

124
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:41,291
Because Clarissa's not your real name.

125
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,372
It was engineered to sound

126
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:44,983
vaguely like a part of your sexual anatomy

127
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,862
and kickstart my subconscious libido.

128
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:50,351
It's a brilliant piece
of subliminal marketing,

129
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:51,972
if you knew it or not.

130
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,869
[Clarissa laughs]

131
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,132
What do you really do for a living?

132
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,134
I really am a painter.

133
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,781
A painter?

In the penthouse suite
with a bunch of bros

135
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:05,339

bottles of Grey Goose?

136
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,091
I'm a really good painter,

137
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,101
here for my brother's bachelor party,

138
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:11,435
and those were his friends.

143
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,149
So you're a painter in L.A.

144
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,131
No, New York City.

145
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,214
You said L.A. last night.

146
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:25,520
[Man] I said I used to live in L.A.

147
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,748
and now I live in New York City,

148
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,629
and you don't trust me.

149
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:29,949
Why do you care what my name is?

150
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:30,926
'Cause I want the real thing.

151
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:31,761

Well, where I'm from

the church is one of the

380

Business of God.

381
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,684
I bet God's worth a lot
more than zero out there.

384
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,406
It's a hell of a business model.

385
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:28,575
When you realize you've
been ripped off, too late.

386

Are you a Jew?

387
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,936
You ever made love to a Jew before?

You're gone?

390
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,906
That's sad.

391

Mm.

392

[groans] Is it?

393
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,706
Isn't it all just a metaphor anyway?

394
00:23:55,708 --> 00:24:00,159
Some self-help book to deal
with oppressive Romans.

395
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,625
You shut down your mind and its desires

396
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:07,053
and its greed and its doubt,
and you go towards the light,

397

and you go towards the truth,

398
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,615
and then ye shall be set free

399

- Oh, she's not dead.
- What?

405
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,055
Yeah, it says here she lives

406
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,592
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

407

Oh, tomato tomato.

408

Say something really mean to me.

409

Why?

410
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:46,642
Just indulge me.

411
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:48,951
- Mean?
- Mean.

412
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:54,132
Why can't I say something really nice?

413
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:56,192
You know the origin of the word nice?

414
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,134
Simple.

415
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:58,752
Nice is always a lie.

416
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:02,613
- Mean, always the truth.
- That's not true.

417
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:03,698
Okay, okay.

418
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,409
Nice then.

No, that's true.

- Wonderful?
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:18,930
Good, maybe.

425

for sure, but wonderful?

Mm.

Now you just want out of this game

428

overdo the compliment

429
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:32,730

and retreat on my part.

Tell me something I can't
see from the inside.

I thought that this
was supposed to be Eden?

436
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:48,788
What, Eden can't be mean?

437
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,606
I'm happy right now, all right? [laughs]

438
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:51,657
I am.

439
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,909
So just go with me on this.

00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,964

That's an observation
I make every morning.

Mm.

446
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:20,599
You don't have enough hair on your chest.

Okay, I like it that way.

448
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,451
You have bags under your eyes.

00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:28,472
You're hiding something.

- Okay.
- Mm.

452
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:32,112
You aren't that slick, charming, or smart.

453
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,800
- You're acting at it.
- Good.

454
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,427
You're going off a picture
you saw in a magazine.

- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

456

You're a wannabe.

Okay, go.

458
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:42,653
You took your idea of Ben Affleck,

459
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:45,232
and you smashed him together with...

460
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,843
Fuck, I don't know who, but somebody who,

they're better than they are.

No, no, um.

You're better at this than I thought,

and I thought you were
gonna be pretty good.

470
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:18,995
So.

No.

478
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:36,243
No, no, this was from my dad.

479
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:40,123
You ever play this game with your dad?

480

That'll end your childhood real quick.

was self-improvement.

484
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:49,912
And in order to keep improving,

485
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:52,541
you had to keep ripping yourself apart,

486

00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:03,592
and you wanted to hang out

554
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:05,592
with a fellow artist while you were here.

555
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:07,182
- A fellow artist?
- Yeah,

556
00:32:07,184 --> 00:32:09,851
because you, studying sculpture.

557
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,003
- You told them all that?
- No.

558
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,338
But I can if you want me to.

559
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:18,451
You worry too much.

560
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,072
Oh, well, are you gonna fix that too?

561
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:21,241
[Man] Maybe.

562
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:28,811
I'm gonna be a scientist,
studying the brain.

563
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:29,931
Sure you don't wanna be an astronaut?

564
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:31,300
I mean, if you're gonna do it

565
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:32,326
you may as well go for broke.

566
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:34,245
- No, the brain.
- Okay.

567
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:39,126
Brain researcher from Arizona University

568
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:43,272
here to study one of the finest
minds of this generation.

569
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:44,107
Yeah?

570
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:49,445
Now, shape up and let's
have a nice, normal day.

571
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,311
And on that note,

572
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,896
I am going to um...

573
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:00,245
You know what?

574
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,380
I'm paying partly for the pleasure

575
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:03,351
of saying everything right,

576
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,031
I'm gonna take a nice morning deuce,

577
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,071
and when I come back, light as a feather,

578
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:08,573
to the pool, Jane.

579
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:11,251
Aye aye, captain.

580
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:44,738
[Man] Why aren't you dressed?

581
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,678
Just daydreaming.

582
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,568
[Man] Well, less dreaming,

583
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,098
more action. [claps]

584
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,715
What about Buenos Aires?

585
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:55,550
Huh?

586
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:59,385
Paris is so cliche.

587
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:01,725
Buenos Aires is, it's romantic.

588
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,936
It's like the Paris of South America

589
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:06,208
but without all the tourists.

590
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,637
I don't know, just a
suggestion, just riffing here.

591
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,837
Thanks, but it's uh,
Paris or bust for me.

592
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,309
- Why?
- It's a secret.

593
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:17,228
[Man] Mm.

594
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,749
You're feeling better.

595
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:23,240
I am.

596
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:26,389
[Jennifer] From when we
first met you're happier.

597
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,568
Maybe.

598
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,402
Good.

599
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,509
- What about you?
- Well, it's no Paris,

600
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:32,594
but it'll do.

601
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,749
Do you mind if I skip the pool?

602
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:40,920
- Why?
- I'm just,

603
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:42,713
I'm not feeling it.

604
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:46,083
I don't really do so
well around other people.

605
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,512
- Want a Klonopin?
- What's it do?

606
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:53,523
One is like having two glasses of wine.

607
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,371
[Jennifer] Why don't you
just have two glasses of wine?

608
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:58,812
Because then I'd be an alcoholic.

609
00:34:58,814 --> 00:34:59,814
I'll pass.

610
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:05,065
Uh, I should give you that back.

611
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:08,883
Oh, [scoffs] please.

612
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:10,468
Don't embarrass me.

613
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,418
What?

614
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,003
[Man] You are a curious case.

615
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,588
You're a person that deals
with people but hates people.

616
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,878
Well, I don't hate people,

617
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,547
I hate more than three people
together at any one place.

618
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,317
I am, by the way.

619
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:32,863
Happier.

620
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:36,182
I like you, even though you're weird.

621
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:40,267
I think I actually like
you because you're weird.

622
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:42,754
Thank you.

623
00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:47,314
So, [claps]

624
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:48,988
what now?

625
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:52,576

[inhaling sharply]

661
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:18,461
Mm, [exhales] to God and to country.

662
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:21,355
Mm, bad luck not to drink on a toast.

663
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,776
Mm, and I only look at champagne.

664
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:24,686
- Why?
- The bubbles.

665
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:25,772
They don' bring out the devil

666
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:27,441
and make me feel somethin'
awful in the mornin'.

667
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,274
Wow.

668
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:30,365
No champagne and no anal sex.

669
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:33,256
You are uh, you're missing
out on all the fun.

670
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:34,758
We should go to dinner.

671
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,044
It's midnight.

672
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,645
Oh fuck, really?

673
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:38,480
Bonzai!

674
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,347
[inhaling sharply]

675
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:44,599
Bonzai, Daniel-San, banzai.

676
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,205
No?

677
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,172
"Karate Kid"? No?

678
00:37:50,174 --> 00:37:51,579
Oh, vaguely.

679
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:52,414
Fuck.

680
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:54,469
Okay.

681
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,494
- Do you have a pimp?
- Yeah.

682
00:37:58,496 --> 00:37:59,899
He has as scar and a cane,

683
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:03,315
and uh, well, he beats me when I'm short.

684
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,817
His name's Bobcat.

685
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,702
[laughs] I think that
maybe I should become a pimp.

686
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,955
Well, I'm not hiring.

687
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:12,456
I'm a sole proprietorship.

688
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,507
- That's smart.
- Very.

689
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:15,340
I think you would be

690
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:18,175
an excellent investment
opportunity, though.

691
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:20,238
There's very little
overhead, it's all cash,

692
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,401
and there's no taxes, and you just,

693
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:24,566
you hire the best and you
let them do their thing,

694
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,679
you just let it rip.

695
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,790
It, it's, it's the oldest profession

696
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,771
but it's also the oldest
investment opportunity.

697
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,155
Mm.

698
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:32,240
- Baker.
- What?

699
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:34,910
Uh, [clears throat]

700
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,419
were there prostitutes or
bakers first? [sniffles]

701
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:41,400
[Man] People were having
sex before they invented fire.

702
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,848
Yeah, but were they selling it?

703
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,219
Undoubtedly.

704
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,470
But I think [sniffles] now,

705
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:50,829
never have you been, like,

706
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,819
more vital than you are
at the present moment?

707
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:53,795
- Vital?
- Vital.

708
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,185
[sniffles] What does that mean?

709
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:56,018
Vital?

710
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,226
- It means-
- No, no, no,

711
00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:58,510
yeah, I know what vital means.

712
00:38:58,512 --> 00:38:59,750
Please do not explain it to me

713
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:02,171
like I'm some desert bunny trash.

714
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,826
I wouldn't think of it, that was-

715
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:05,245
- Why am I vital?

716
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:11,896
Every guy should

717
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:15,435
feel, I don't know, as
free as I feel right now.

718
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,179
I can say whatever I wanna say,

719
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:20,098
I can be who I am, who I really am.

720
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:24,268
Nobody loves anybody and nobody's trying

721
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,389
to manipulate anybody's emotions,

722
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:28,806
and I don't know, there's no like,

723
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:32,560
buried resentments or hidden maneuvers

724
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:33,899
and tactics and shit.

725
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:35,737
I think the French have this right,

726
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,800
and that's probably the only
time I'll ever say that.

727
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:42,653
But I think that sex should be
separate from a relationship.

728
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:45,598
If I wanna fuck my wife, great.

729
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,152
But if I fuck somebody else

730
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,587
then I can just be with my wife

731
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:49,816
instead of being miserable

732
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:51,524
trying to bag the old
ball and chain for like,

733
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:52,732
the 2,000th time.

734
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:56,076
I think it's, it's more natural...

735
00:39:56,078 --> 00:40:00,896
No, scratch that, it's more
monogamous than monogamy.

736
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,818
Seeing a prostitute's like,
the first class of monogamy.

737
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,378
- You're married?
- Fuck no.

738
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,004
No, this is in theory.

739
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:08,970
In theory.

740
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:10,453
What about you not in theory?

741
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,059
Wow, okay.

742
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,265
Jesus, doctor.

743
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,100
Um.

744
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:18,943
It's not just I who is frustrated,

745
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:22,407
it's the whole current epoch
of my male brethren, right?

746
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:25,773
These, these are
confusing times right now.

747
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:27,858
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?

748
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,027
Controlling.

749
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:32,381
Just bad genes.

750
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Well, I don't mind it.

751
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,789
Ugh, sorry.

752
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,708
Okay, I'm taking notes.

753
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:47,282
Um. [groans]

754
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:51,659
Where was I?

755
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:55,693
Prostitute, monogamy,
first class. [sniffles]

756
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:56,684
Uh, okay.

757
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,853
How, what I...

758
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,070
I think that...

759
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,200
Okay.

760
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,946
I'm a nice guy,

761
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:08,916
and I think that I'm pretty
fairly well adjusted,

762
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,585
et cetera, et cetera, all that.

763
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:13,729
And on some level, I wanna fall in love.

764
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,185
That knock you down, pound you out,

765
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,535
wake up in Paris kinda love,

766
00:41:16,537 --> 00:41:19,436
but let's face it, that's not real.

767
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,727
Not really.

768
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,589
And more on that later.

769
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:25,162
The point is that that idea

770
00:41:25,164 --> 00:41:27,007
makes me what some people would call

771
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,922
as like, a bit of a playboy.

772
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:31,610
But the problem is, I have taste, right?

773
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,866
- Mm-hmm.
- I like and enjoy

774
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,151
a very particular type of woman.

775
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:37,775
I like somebody who's beautiful

776
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:40,479
and intelligent and ambitious.

777
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,314
...and...

778
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:47,525
Those type of women require
energy and attention and money,

779
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,358
and they wanna know

780
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,815
that there's an endgame
to the whole thing.

781
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:51,648
You know what I'm saying?

782
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,786
Yeah, yeah, sex is more than sex

783
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:54,396
or else it's empty and shallow

784
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:58,007
and brings out the worst,
animalistic part of ourselves.

785
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:01,259
- You are very quick.
- Oh, for a woman?

786
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:03,669
Wow.

787
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:06,716
And next we're gonna talk
about your defensiveness.

788
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:08,695
Well you know, I run
in very smart circles

789
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:09,705
and memorize a few things.

790
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,676
Now back to your modern
male bullshit, whatever.

791
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:12,792
Um,

792
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:14,235
okay.

793
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,068
I... it's...

794
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,063
There's probably a...

795
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:16,896
No, there's like,

796
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:21,346
probably 100 million in this
very country alone, right?

797
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:23,515
Like poor, just nice guys,

798
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:27,484
nice guys who wanna get
laid on a regular basis

799
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:28,319
but who don't...

800
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,279
want to engage

801
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:33,610
in the dark arts of like,

802
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:37,029
emotional forgery and passive sociopathy.

803
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:42,426
What happens is, porn,
masturbation, aloneness,

804
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:45,652
and it's a closed loop that
begins to cave in on itself

805
00:42:45,654 --> 00:42:49,465
and it's like a journey to
the center of your mind.

806
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:54,467
And my entire generation are
a bunch of frustrated dudes

807
00:42:54,718 --> 00:42:57,146
that are just jerking off
and talking to themselves

808
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:58,687
and we need you.

809
00:42:58,689 --> 00:42:59,927
We need you.

810
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:03,405
We need you to tell us that
it's okay to pay for sex.

811
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,289
That, that, that it's just sex,

812
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,674
and that you're happy to take the payment.

813
00:43:07,676 --> 00:43:10,626
Don't feel guilty, it's
only supply and demand.

814
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:14,066
But the demand side needs
to know that it's moral

815
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:16,618
in order for it to thrive in this country.

816
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,111
It's a very Christian nation,

817
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:22,991
and so we need, we need, you know, like a,

818
00:43:22,993 --> 00:43:26,160
we need an ad campaign, we need, um...

819
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:29,866
We need, we need George Clooney staring

820
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,586
straight down the barrel of the camera

821
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:35,607
in black and white, very
serious, very classy,

822
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:39,391
saying, "I would argue at this point

823
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:44,335
that seeing a prostitute is
more moral than burning coal,

824
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:47,250
and it's definitely more moral

825
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,746
than buying anything from China.

826
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:52,875
And it's definitely, certainly more moral

827
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:57,835
than our first-world bourgeois
addiction to the cocaine."

828
00:43:57,837 --> 00:43:58,668
Get George Clooney

829
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,796
to single handedly legalize prostitution.

830
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:02,670
[Man] Mm, set us free, my brother.

Let the market decide.

832
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:06,423
Let your heart decide.

833
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,895
Let yourself loose, and,
and, and love, you know?

834
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,304
Love yourself.

835
00:44:12,306 --> 00:44:14,185
Love yourself and love your wife

836
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:16,332
and love your prostitute.

Hi.

858
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:37,305
Yeah, can we get um, two
scoops of vanilla ice cream?

859
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:38,140
Thank you.

[Jennifer] Sure.

What are their, what
are their middle names?

879

[Jennifer] Why?

[door opening]

917
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:32,824
[door closing]

918
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:50,733
[spoon clanking]

919
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:17,659
Mm-mm.

920
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:32,480
Leigh.

921
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:07,723
What do you see?

922
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,790
The truth?

923
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:19,114
[Man] If not now, when?

924
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:26,045
Sadness.

925
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,502
- All men my age are sad.
- Why?

926
00:51:33,482 --> 00:51:36,530
'Cause their dreams are done.

927
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:38,365
[Jennifer] Says who?

928
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:46,290
What do you really see though,

929
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:47,959
when you look at me?

930
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:56,720
Um, I see a man

931
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,122
surrounded by things.

932
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:06,385
Uh, a man who's made the
acquisition of these things

933
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:08,969
his main goal.

934
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:15,099
And I think he's just starting to realize

935
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:19,149
that these things are only making it worse

936
00:52:19,151 --> 00:52:22,398
because now he's tricked himself

937
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,329
into thinking that these
things are a part of him,

938
00:52:25,331 --> 00:52:29,498
the same as his kidneys
or his liver or his heart.

939
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:35,821
And I think it's his heart

940
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:40,050
that he's almost convinced
himself that he's forgotten.

941
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:42,885
But he can still feel it, hear it.

942
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:47,330
Like a faint echo in
the back of a dark cave,

943
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,499
not quite sure where it's coming from.

944
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:58,909
And I think that this is
really the root of his sadness.

945
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,003
That he decided long ago
to go against his heart,

946
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,435
against what God has given him,

947
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:15,810
in order to force himself into a system

948
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:20,729
whose sole goal is the acquisition
of more and more things.

949
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:26,990
[Man] Why does he do it?

950
00:53:28,346 --> 00:53:30,429
Because he fears death.

951
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:37,549
What's gonna happen to him?

952
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,382
[Jennifer] It's easy.

953
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:41,217
He dies the same as everyone else.

954
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:43,864
And what about all my things?

955
00:53:43,866 --> 00:53:45,116
Mm, they die.

956
00:53:48,346 --> 00:53:49,453
That's impossible.

957
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:53,024
No, even your paintings in the end die.

958
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:56,607
Gone in the next great flood when this

959
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,359
sand turns back into ocean floor.

960
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:06,152
[Man] Well, then what
hope is there for any of us?

961
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:06,987
Now.

962
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:31,425
[silverware clanking]

963
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:35,497
Oh.

964
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:41,001
Hey, are you still alive in there?

965
00:54:41,003 --> 00:54:42,253
[Man] Barely.

966
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:04,552
Hey, when's your birthday?

967
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:07,132
[Man] January 9th.

968
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:10,218
- What year?
- '80.

969
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:15,220
[safe beeping]
[water running]

970
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:22,792
You're a Capricorn, huh?

971
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:26,338
Figures.

972
00:55:31,702 --> 00:55:32,535
Mm.

973
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:35,451
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

974
00:55:49,142 --> 00:55:51,892
[Jennifer sighs]

975
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,486
Remind me never to put
anything up my nose again.

976
00:56:17,488 --> 00:56:18,321
Jesus.

977
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,373
Oh, no.

978
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:26,788
You gotta get up.

979
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:27,621
[Man] Why?

980
00:56:27,623 --> 00:56:29,348
Because if you stay down,

981
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,116
you'll think you belong there.

982
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:33,268
We'll never get out of here.

983
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,914
My dad used to say that.

984
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:35,887
Come on.

985
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:36,794
[Man] Did he ever consume

986
00:56:36,796 --> 00:56:39,388
massive amounts of cocaine and champagne?

987
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,788
Well, then you just gotta get higher.

988
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:41,621
Let's go.

989
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:43,756
[groans] I don't wanna do any drugs.

990
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:45,828
I know what you need.

991
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,738
- How do you have-
- Excitement.

992
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,571
Adventure.

993
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,188
How do you, how do you
have all this energy?

994
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,076
[Jennifer] I don't know.

995
00:56:52,078 --> 00:56:53,756
[silverware clanking]

996
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:57,675
Don't you just wanna
stay in the bed all day?

997
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,298
[Jennifer] Do you trust me?

998
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,693
Do you trust me?

999
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,508
With what?

1000
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,927
With your life.

1001
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:09,618
Yeah.

1002
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,953
- Fuckin', yes.
- Right answer.

1003
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:14,696
Okay, come on.

1004
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:17,831
- Let's go.
- Mm.

1005
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,124
[Jennifer] I have to
get out of here, please.

1006
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:19,959
Mm.

1007
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,463
Mm.

1008
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:25,215
[Jennifer sighs]

1009
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:32,257
- Come on.
- It's Sunday?

1010
00:57:34,105 --> 00:57:34,938
Yeah.

1011
00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:38,135
- The 22nd?
- Sure.

1012
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,502
[Man] You wanna have some real fun?

1013
00:57:41,504 --> 00:57:42,335
Please!

1014
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:44,290
Please, please, please, please, please.

1015
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:45,558
Okay.

1016
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,893
All right, move.

1017
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,002
Okay.

1018
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,476

[safe chiming]

1024
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,576
There.

1025
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,301
What's this?

1026
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:20,220
10 grand.

1027
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:23,261
And in return?

1028
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:25,513
We watch a movie tonight.

1029
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:28,141
No deal.

1030
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:30,763
I fucking hate movies.

1031
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:33,015
You didn't let me finish.

1032
00:58:35,605 --> 00:58:39,083
After we have an afternoon full of action,

1033
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:42,923
adventure, and international intrigue,

1034
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:44,925
and I double your money.

1035
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:48,710
Okay, I'm listening.

1036
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:51,563
[Man] We are gonna day trade the yen.

1037
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:52,811
What the what?

1038
00:58:52,813 --> 00:58:55,872
- It's the Japanese currency.
- How?

1039
00:58:55,874 --> 00:58:59,016
- Broker in Hong Kong.
- But it's Sunday.

1040
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:01,435
It's Monday in Tokyo.

1041
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,604
Are you ready?

1042
00:59:03,463 --> 00:59:05,380
What do I have to do?

1043
00:59:08,202 --> 00:59:09,901
How many of those can you take?

1044
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:10,736
37.

1045
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:20,021
And these little guys, two
of those and a cocktail

1046
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,131
and it is lights out, bucko.

1047
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:25,140
- A regular pharmacist.
- Mm, call me doctor.

1048
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:27,272
And don't try to control me.

1049
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:28,105
Okay.

1050
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:31,032
Take out your phone and type in

1051
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,451
"The value of the yen versus the dollar."

1052
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:46,971
- 120 to one.
- Okay.

1053
00:59:48,663 --> 00:59:51,146
So if you think it's going to go up,

1054
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:53,536
meaning that you think one dollar

1055
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:56,565
is gonna buy more than 120 yen,

1056
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:58,346
then you wanna buy long.

1057
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,575
Or the call, if you
think it's gonna go down

1058
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,016
then you wanna buy short.

1059
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:05,476
What's the price of the call option?

1060
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,236
I'm completely lost.

1061
01:00:07,238 --> 01:00:11,416
Okay, the call will buy you
100 yen for the price of one.

1062
01:00:11,418 --> 01:00:15,386
So if you buy at 120
and it goes down to 118,

1063
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:17,965
how much did you just lose?

1064
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:19,877
- Two cents?
- Two dollars.

1065
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:20,710
What?

1066
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:22,245
How does two cents become two dollars?

1067
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:25,845
[Man] Because you just bought
100 but only paid for one.

1068
01:00:25,847 --> 01:00:26,905
That's...

1069
01:00:26,907 --> 01:00:29,896
- That's fucked.
- Not if you win.

1070
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:31,065
Are you ready?

1071
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:33,776
For what?

1072
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:35,666
Okay, grab the phone.

1073
01:00:35,668 --> 01:00:37,195
You wanna get in at the open

1074
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:40,216
before everything goes to shit.

1075
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:41,385
Are you ready?

1076
01:00:42,663 --> 01:00:45,330
[water running]

1077
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:50,976
What's the worst that could happen?

1078
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:53,472
You lose my 10 grand.

1079
01:00:53,474 --> 01:00:55,873
Mm, I'd have to watch a movie for free.

1080
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,958
Well, there are risks in this life.

1081
01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:02,795
Time's a wastin'.

1082
01:01:08,116 --> 01:01:10,533
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

1083
01:01:13,047 --> 01:01:16,214
Ask for an outside international line.

1084
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,931
Can I have an outside
international line?

1085
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:33,325
Okay.

1086
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:34,160

1087
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:37,160

1088
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:42,106
3, 679, 2284.

1089
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:46,701
- 679?
- 2284.

1090
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:52,288
Okay, it's ringing.

1091
01:01:54,103 --> 01:01:54,936
Hello.

1092
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:57,957
- It's a bank?
- Okay.

1093
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:02,959
Ask for Maxwell Kane, and when
he picks up call him Max-Max.

1094
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,527
Maxwell Kane, please.

1095
01:02:08,898 --> 01:02:10,481
Okay, it's ringing.

1096
01:02:12,764 --> 01:02:13,764

One of those little desert towns

1276
01:13:22,462 --> 01:13:24,962
you pass on your way from L.A.

1277
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:29,339
[David] How old are you?

1278
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,464
25.

1279
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:37,801
It was nice.

1280
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:40,636
How much longer can you do this?

1281
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:42,539
10 years.

1282
01:13:44,672 --> 01:13:46,670
- And then what?
- And then I'll own

1283
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,200
two apartments in Phoenix
and live off the rent.

1284
01:13:49,202 --> 01:13:50,851
What is that?

1285
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:52,187
50 grand a year?

1286
01:13:53,243 --> 01:13:55,493
My dad didn't own a fund.

1287
01:14:01,302 --> 01:14:04,635
You know, the day that my father died,

1288
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:12,817
there were screams of joy
in his office building.

1289
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:15,851
And I just sat there,

1290
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:16,685
having just learned

1291
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:19,761
that my father's atrial wall had exploded,

1292
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:23,180
and I listened to adults scream with joy.

1293
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:30,230
One day he ruled over 1,000
people and the next he didn't,

1294
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,148
because it wasn't real.

1295
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:34,899
I mean, how could something real

1296
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:37,401
fall apart in just one second?

1297
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:44,893
His whole life was just some hologram

1298
01:14:44,895 --> 01:14:48,372
that was created by lots and lots of cash,

1299
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:50,619
and the only thing real
that he might've experienced

1300
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:52,955
in his whole life was dying.

1301
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,824
That's a good story.

1302
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:01,940
But the truth is, that while he was alive

1303
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:03,938
he did everything he wanted to,

1304
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,681
because he could,
because he had more money

1305
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:09,280
and more power than anyone.

1306
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:10,378
They'll hate you for it,

1307
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,572
but who cares what they think?

1308
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,700
Because at the end of
the day, everyone's dead,

1309
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:16,740
and the only thing that
matters is how you live.

1310
01:15:16,742 --> 01:15:19,900
Your father won and they lost.

1311
01:15:19,902 --> 01:15:21,140
Jesus died penniless

1312
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,860
and he still gets top billing
in every drawer in this town.

1313
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:26,332
Jesus died hung by nails for days.

1314
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:29,052
The rest is a fairytale they tell the poor

1315
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:33,304
to keep them happy and poor
and away from the rich.

1316
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:47,639
Melissa Price,

1317
01:15:49,318 --> 01:15:50,152
25,

1318
01:15:51,889 --> 01:15:53,223
there is no God,

1319
01:15:55,487 --> 01:16:00,464
there is no love, there is
no joy, just cold hard cash.

1320
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:02,941
David Carthridge, poor little rich kid

1321
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,575
who gives a hooker 50k so he
can pretend he has a soul,

1322
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:09,864
pretend like this whole
weekend wasn't about one thing.

1323
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:10,782
Fucking me.

1324
01:16:14,641 --> 01:16:16,141
That's not true.

1325
01:16:28,807 --> 01:16:33,494
I didn't ask for any of
this money, I just have it.

1326
01:16:33,496 --> 01:16:36,285
And it attracts people,
they're obsessed with it.

1327
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:41,045
All around me are people that
will devote their entire lives

1328
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:44,296
to making as much money as I was given.

1329
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:46,307
They'll destroy themselves,
they'll destroy each other,

1330
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:48,503
they'll destroy anything to get it.

1331
01:16:48,505 --> 01:16:52,394
I didn't have to destroy myself
for it, I already had it,

1332
01:16:52,396 --> 01:16:54,274
so I got to keep my soul.

1333
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,526
It's unfair, but it's true.

1334
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:03,061
How long have you been up here?

1335
01:17:04,514 --> 01:17:05,347
What?

1336
01:17:06,876 --> 01:17:11,293
You've been up here thinking
long before I arrived.

1337
01:17:12,447 --> 01:17:13,280
20 days.

1338
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:14,971
Why?

1339
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,049
- Because my dad died.
- And?

1340
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:24,976
I realized that my life is
the same hologram that his was.

1341
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:25,811
Oh.

1342
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,896
So this was a spiritual journey.

1343
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:34,544
Holed up above Las Vegas
to find something real

1344
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:36,379
with a woman you paid.

1345
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,416
This was a consume everything,

1346
01:17:40,418 --> 01:17:44,325
I came to ease the pain the
only way I know how for 20 days,

1347
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,733
but the pain was still there

1348
01:17:45,735 --> 01:17:49,605
so you had to consume something else, me.

1349
01:17:49,607 --> 01:17:51,082
But you fucked up.

1350
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,354
You decided to feel something

1351
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,856
rather than consume something.

1352
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:07,077
Tell me your story.

1353
01:18:09,938 --> 01:18:11,438
I'm paying for it.

1354
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:26,110
You were what, 23
when we went into Iraq?

1355
01:18:26,951 --> 01:18:29,701
- Yeah.
- Working for your father?

1356
01:18:30,796 --> 01:18:32,074
[David] Mm-hmm.

1357
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:34,194
Just out of some fancy school.

1358
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:35,446
[David] Yeah.

1359
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:39,677
You wore $2,000 suits, had a secretary,

1360
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,664
ate stake dinners twice a week.

1361
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:47,666
But deep down you felt like
an artist, a painter. [laughs]

1362
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,293
Maybe.

1363
01:18:57,174 --> 01:19:02,174
What happened to the price
of oil after we went in?

1364
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:05,106
- It tripled.
- Did you celebrate?

1365
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,092
- I was 25.
- Be brave.

1366
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:08,512
If not now, when?

1367
01:19:09,975 --> 01:19:11,225
I bought a...

1368
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,162
Bought an apartment,

1369
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:19,773
uh, in South Beach.

1370
01:19:19,775 --> 01:19:22,304
Did you wait a week?

1371
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:25,139
Or was it the very day we invaded?

1372
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,416
You had the guys down for the weekend,

1373
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,085
sun, cocaine, women.

1374
01:19:33,674 --> 01:19:35,003
Hundreds of thousands of people

1375
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:37,588
were gonna die and you knew it.

1376
01:19:39,654 --> 01:19:43,792
But not you, and not any of your friends.

1377
01:19:43,794 --> 01:19:48,377
Just the poor fuckers living
on the wrong kind of sand.

1378
01:20:16,073 --> 01:20:18,906
I was 10 when my dad died in Iraq.

1379
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:24,206
I was 16 when my mom finally gave in.

1380
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:28,492
I never was very good at school.

1381
01:20:28,494 --> 01:20:31,494
I met a man, came to Vegas with him.

1382
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,168
I wanted to be a singer,

1383
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:37,144
I was gonna have my own show at Caesars

1384
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:39,978
and then a record contract in L.A.

1385
01:20:43,866 --> 01:20:45,532
But things get hard.

1386
01:20:48,455 --> 01:20:52,788
And someone gives you $300
one night and away you go.

1387
01:20:55,228 --> 01:20:58,228
[breathing heavily]

1388
01:21:25,034 --> 01:21:28,534
Up here you get to make up your own story.

1389
01:21:29,735 --> 01:21:31,863
But down there, your
story gets branded on you

1390
01:21:31,865 --> 01:21:33,191
the moment you're born.

1391
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,361
There is no power in that,

1392
01:21:36,523 --> 01:21:37,691
only struggle.

1393
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:44,048
[breathing heavily]

1394
01:21:45,773 --> 01:21:46,941
