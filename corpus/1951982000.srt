1
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,609
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:28,450
Private Miller...

3
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:31,653
...you've been smoking ltem 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,764
We're going to ask you
several questions.

5
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:34,956
How do you feel?

6
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,367
Well, sir...

7
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,265
...I feel like a...

8
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,504
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:49,078
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:52,707
Yeah.

11
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:56,245
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,289
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,960
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:12,627
Is this normal?

15
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:14,465
Okay, Private...

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,405
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:19,168
Private Miller.

18
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,205
Answer the question.

19
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,515
This went out, sir.

20
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,352
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,118
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,456
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:48,004
Private Miller, answer the question.

24
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:49,731
What was the question again, sir?

25
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:54,339
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,271
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:59,781
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,318
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

29
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,921
Where are the boobies?

30
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,526
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

31
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:11,890
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,363
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know ltem 9 exists?

33
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,094
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,764
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, ltem 9!"

35
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,602
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:28,507
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

37
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,346
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,651
Fuck you!

39
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,492
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,261
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:52,733
This never happened.

42
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:54,531
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,765
Hello.

44
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,106
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:02,144
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

46
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:05,078
We've reached
a final conclusion on ltem 9.

47
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:07,347
Illegal!

48
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,543
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.</i>

49
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:10,314
<i>Welcome to KRAD.</i>

50
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,424
<i>You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.</i>

51
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:16,288
<i>Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.</i>

52
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,361
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

53
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,857
<i>- Here's my piece.
- All right.</i>

54
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,763
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

55
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:28,030
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

56
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:30,037
Everyone likes smoking weed.

57
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,644
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

58
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,973
<i>It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.</i>

59
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,446
<i>It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.</i>

60
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,484
<i>It makes shitty movies better,
you know?</i>

61
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:52,761
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

62
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:53,955
Yeah.

63
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:58,762
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

64
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:00,199
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

65
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,567
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

66
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,537
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

67
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:09,202
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

68
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,941
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

69
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:15,314
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

70
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,455
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

71
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,021
I'm dating a high-school girl.

72
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,922
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

73
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:26,461
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

74
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,690
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

75
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,961
<i>- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.</i>

76
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:35,102
Yo, you been served.

77
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:38,709
You've been served.
You've been served.

78
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,936
You've been served.

79
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:50,016
Walter Wadska the third.

80
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,554
You here to fix the fax machine?

81
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:55,955
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

82
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,493
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

83
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,528
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

84
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:16,941
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

85
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:21,313
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

86
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:35,359
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

87
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,024
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

88
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,262
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

89
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,998
And now because of that,
you've been served.

90
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:44,232
You're a jerk.

91
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,434
All this current system is doing...

92
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,841
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

93
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:52,711
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

94
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:56,342
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

95
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:58,512
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

96
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,649
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

97
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:17,070
I can't come.

98
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,432
What?

99
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,643
Why the fuck not, Dale?

100
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,110
I just... Look, I can't come.

101
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:26,045
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

102
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:29,380
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When were you gonna tell me?

103
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,078
My mom has been shopping all day.

104
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,156
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

105
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,294
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

106
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:38,452
- Now I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

107
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,360
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

108
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,966
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

109
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,601
Don't come. I don't care.

110
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,068
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

111
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,503
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

112
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:54,270
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

113
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,937
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

114
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:59,276
You're great, and you're funny...

115
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,351
...and you're sexy.

116
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,948
I just want them to see that.

117
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,784
- You want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

118
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,516
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

119
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,684
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

120
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,854
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

121
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,001
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

122
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,467
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

123
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,970
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

125
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,913
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,638
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

127
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,874
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

128
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,815
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

129
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,614
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

130
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,654
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

131
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:42,384
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

132
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,052
I wish.

133
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,794
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

134
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,490
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

135
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,032
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:52,635
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,203
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

138
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,839
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,066
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

140
00:08:58,243 --> 00:08:59,505
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

141
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,144
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

142
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,439
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

143
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,845
- I mean, you're great. Yeah.
- Yeah, awesome.

144
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:09,817
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.
Next year college, man. College.

145
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,252
Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

146
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:16,360
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

147
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,428
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

148
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,223
You got her ass? Perfect.

149
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:23,265
- I'll watch her ass for...
- He's trying to be nice.

150
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,528
- I'll catch you at Home Ec.
- Okay.

151
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,830
You guys got Home Ec
together too. That's cool.

152
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:30,270
- We got a few classes together.
- Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:34,276
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm talking about. See you guys later.

154
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,346
- All right, Clark.
- Clark's a great guy.

155
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,573
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

156
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,913
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

157
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,350
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

158
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,615
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

159
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,055
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

160
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,491
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

161
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:54,427
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

162
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,294
...or I call the liaison officer.

163
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:59,596
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

164
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:00,795
What a jerk.

165
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,701
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

166
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:05,900
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

167
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:09,069
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

168
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,114
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

169
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:14,183
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

170
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,718
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

171
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,617
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

172
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,621
That means so much to me
and my parents.

173
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,784
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

174
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,988
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?</i>

175
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,158
<i>- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.</i>

176
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,031
<i>- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.</i>

177
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,798
<i>I thought the hurricane season
was over.</i>

178
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,635
I thought hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,606
<i>I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.</i>

180
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:42,143
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.</i>

181
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,016
Hello? Hey, man.

182
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:48,948
What the fuck, man?

183
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,748
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

184
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:55,086
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when l...

185
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,353
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

186
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,156
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

187
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,389
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

188
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:05,024
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocol yet.

189
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:07,467
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

190
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,608
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

191
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,766
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

192
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:15,139
Yo, check this out.

193
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,212
Satellite radio.

194
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,354
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

195
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,818
That's home entertainment.

196
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:28,186
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

197
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,486
<i>Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.</i>

198
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,554
Hey, let me ask you something.

199
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,061
Yeah?

200
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:38,458
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

201
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,695
Like, euthanasia?

202
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,865
Like, on her?

203
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:46,874
If I needed to.

204
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:52,846
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

205
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:55,679
I don't know if we should
start going down that road.

206
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,822
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

207
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,514
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

208
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,024
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

209
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,627
Business for the businessman.

210
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,889
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

211
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,498
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

212
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,067
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,101
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:17,366
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

215
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:22,206
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

216
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,847
...and they had a baby.

217
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,848
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

218
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:30,681
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

219
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:34,291
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

220
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,690
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

221
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:40,194
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

222
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,662
- Smell it.
- Okay.

223
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,131
Smell it. Enjoy.

224
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:47,499
It's like God's vagina.

225
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,472
What, you wanna bathe in it?

226
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:52,542
- I wanna live in here.
- You wanna be it?

227
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,838
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

228
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,073
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

229
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,546
Beautiful. What's it called?

230
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:01,810
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

231
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,977
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

232
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:07,147
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

233
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:10,226
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

234
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:12,727
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

235
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,559
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

236
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,291
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

237
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,163
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

238
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,328
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:22,837
Let me get my scale.

240
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:26,408
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

241
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,379
I thought hurricane season
was over.

242
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,614
Oh, crow.

243
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,754
Where are you, you little fucker?

244
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:43,389
What the fuck is this thing?

245
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,028
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,563
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

247
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:49,791
- Yeah, man.
- No.

248
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,060
This is the future.

249
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:57,037
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

250
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,473
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

251
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,205
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

252
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,645
My second favorite civil engineer...

253
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,685
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

254
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:13,654
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

255
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:17,090
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

256
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:21,322
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

257
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,730
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

258
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:26,893
Future. The future.

259
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

260
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,708
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

261
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:36,813
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

262
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,744
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

263
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,713
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

264
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,012
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

265
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,916
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

266
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,920
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

267
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,218
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

268
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:52,327
I need your help, man.

269
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,761
- I'm in.
- Come on!

270
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:57,730
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

271
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,767
Why not? What do I do?

272
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,097
Okay, here's what you do.

273
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:03,001
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

274
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,573
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

275
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,606
You are going to light these two ends
while I light this end.

276
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,544
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

277
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:14,583
- Ready.
- Blast off.

278
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:33,295
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

279
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,845
It's better to cough.

280
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,542
It's like...

281
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,311
Makes you 10 times more higher...

282
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,752
...than the cross weed
and the Pineapple Express.

283
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:56,724
<i>You're like,
totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.</i>

284
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,073
Oh, fuck.

285
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:12,709
Hang on one second, man.

286
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:13,901
Oh, you fucker.

287
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,078
Who is it?

288
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,082
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

289
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,447
Shit.

290
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,186
What's a Gebert?

291
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:26,948
Come on up.

292
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:30,457
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

293
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:34,997
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

294
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,300
Hey.

295
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:40,460
So listen, man.

296
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:43,038
I gotta ask you. So...

297
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:47,166
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, two months, right?

298
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,643
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

299
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,338
What's up with the suit?

300
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:54,313
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

301
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:58,854
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

302
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:02,254
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

303
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:05,486
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

304
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,153
- I like...
- In process.

305
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,299
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

306
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,458
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

307
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,763
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

308
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:17,738
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

309
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,173
...so I can serve them the papers.

310
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:21,368
Disguise.

311
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:22,671
Kind of, I guess.

312
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,872
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

313
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,213
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

314
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,854
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

315
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:33,513
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

316
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,318
Nice.

317
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,927
What? You sucked on her titties?

318
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,155
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

319
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:43,823
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

320
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,094
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

321
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,034
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

322
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:51,037
She's cool as hell, actually.

323
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,937
- You'd get along with her.
- Really?

324
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,840
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

325
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:59,744
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

326
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,351
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

327
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,387
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

328
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:10,550
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

329
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,923
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

330
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,463
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

331
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,329
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

332
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,902
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

333
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,199
You get to smoke weed all day.

334
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:24,739
I wish I had that.

335
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,242
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

336
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:31,472
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

337
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,117
You didn't think of that.

338
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:36,344
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

339
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,748
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

340
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:39,549
Thank you.

341
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,852
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

342
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,826
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,487
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

344
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,099
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

345
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,460
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

346
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:54,968
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

347
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,436
All right, homes. Good.

348
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,734
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

349
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,877
You got the dough? There you go.

350
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,172
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

351
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,740
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

352
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,248
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

353
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:09,443
- Chris.
- Chris.

354
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,383
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

355
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:14,046
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

356
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,420
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

357
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,494
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

358
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:21,529
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

359
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:22,961
- Thank...
- God.

360
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,125
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,133
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

362
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,669
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

363
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,329
Fuck.

364
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,072
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

365
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:36,839
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

366
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,710
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:43,149
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

368
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,379
...and process and service?

369
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:48,081
I don't know. It's always
something different, I guess.

370
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,521
This guy...

371
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:52,389
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

372
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:54,827
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

373
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:58,799
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

374
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,869
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

375
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:02,062
That'd be weird.

376
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,799
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

377
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,502
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

378
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,011
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

379
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,810
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

380
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:17,078
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

381
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:20,382
That sounds appealing,
but you know what? I'll tell... Here...

382
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,493
I'm gonna run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

383
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:26,425
<i>- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.</i>

384
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,497
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

385
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,826
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

386
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,490
One love.

387
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:32,069
<i>When you got behind
on the mortgage...</i>

388
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,730
<i>When you got behind
on the mortgage...</i>

389
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,701
<i>... someone finally
made you a loan?</i>

390
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:36,965
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

391
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,735
<i>Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you got?</i>

392
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,506
<i>- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.</i>

393
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,022
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

394
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:57,820
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

395
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,453
<i>I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.</i>

396
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:04,760
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.</i>

397
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:05,959
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

398
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:08,469
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

399
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:12,302
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

400
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,178
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

401
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:20,249
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

402
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,351
Fucking cops. Shit.

403
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,257
Jesus.

404
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,458
What an adorable little cop.

405
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,561
Weird.

406
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:46,966
Jesus. Fuck.

407
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:49,169
What the fuck was that?

408
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,608
Oh, shit.

409
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:54,446
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

410
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:55,642
Oh, no!

411
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,790
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

412
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:12,959
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

413
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,892
Pineapple Express.

414
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,998
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

415
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,663
I saw brains and blood!

416
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,308
Come on! Come on!

417
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,534
Where do I go?

418
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,984
Hello?

419
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:12,890
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

420
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:15,531
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

421
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:18,497
<i>- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.
- Dale?</i>

422
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:21,297
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

423
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:23,531
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

424
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,705
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

425
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,711
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

426
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:34,350
One, two...

427
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,543
- Did it work?
- On three!

428
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,553
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

429
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:41,486
<i>Just on three.</i>

430
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:54,067
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

431
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:55,705
He fucking killed him.

432
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,842
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

433
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,103
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

434
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,304
No, it was just a guy.

435
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,142
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

436
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:10,981
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

437
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:14,147
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

438
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,883
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

439
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,153
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

440
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,058
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

441
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,165
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

442
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,767
What?

443
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,235
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

444
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:29,804
You threw up on my printer.

445
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:31,338
- I did.
- Did you break it?

446
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,408
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

447
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,067
I think the guy was Ted.

448
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:37,076
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

449
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,181
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

450
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,147
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

451
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:42,979
What? They saw you?

452
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,518
And you fucking came here?

453
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:46,656
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

454
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:51,090
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

455
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:53,960
I saw them kill him.

456
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,861
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

457
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,161
I tossed my roach.

458
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,804
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

459
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:05,100
So they must have heard...
They know someone was out there.

460
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,402
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

461
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:10,206
They don't know it was you. Right?

462
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:13,782
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

463
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,509
- Yes.
- I hope not.

464
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:16,744
Relax.

465
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,687
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

466
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:25,719
Is it really that rare?

467
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:28,222
It's, like, the rarest.

468
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,860
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

469
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:35,002
It's like killing a unicorn...

470
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:36,901
...with, like, a bomb.

471
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,337
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

472
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,639
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

473
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:47,409
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

474
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,644
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

475
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:53,915
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

476
00:25:54,091 --> 00:25:55,888
And Red got this from Ted?

477
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,390
Ted's the man.

478
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,121
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

479
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,630
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

480
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,792
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

481
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:09,370
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

482
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,735
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

483
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,002
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

484
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:15,611
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

485
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,577
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

486
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:21,946
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

487
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,212
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

488
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:45,468
Red said he'd be here.

489
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,415
Them some drugs.

490
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:59,146
Smells like vomit in this house.

491
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:01,223
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

492
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,552
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

493
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,388
Smell it on my sweater.

494
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:06,995
For real?

495
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:08,461
Yeah, for real.

496
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:11,430
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

497
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:12,660
Not my style.

498
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:15,202
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

499
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,806
<i>You have reached
the voice mailbox of...</i>

500
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,602
<i>- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.</i>

501
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:22,574
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

502
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:26,776
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew we were coming.

503
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,076
They not here, Ted.

504
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:29,947
Hi, Ted.

505
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,818
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

506
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,753
I think he's crazy about murdering.

507
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,120
Well, that's not good.
Where are we gonna go?

508
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:41,162
Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel
and just hide out.

509
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:44,926
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

510
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,097
Shit. I wish we could
just go nowhere.

511
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,435
Okay.

512
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:58,309
Even if he found that roach,
how could he know where you are?

513
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:01,614
Heat-seeking missiles.

514
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,446
Bloodhounds.

515
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:07,046
Foxes.

516
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,851
Barracudas.

517
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:12,223
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's weird.

518
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:13,420
Thank you.

519
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,622
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

520
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,733
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

521
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:22,099
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

522
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:25,605
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

523
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,641
Only Red knows, man.

524
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:29,244
Who is Red?

525
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:33,076
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

526
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,309
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

527
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:37,578
One time, he got this girl...

528
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:41,155
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

529
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:45,887
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

530
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:51,223
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

531
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:53,528
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

532
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:56,332
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

533
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:59,202
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

534
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:02,971
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

535
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,980
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

536
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,618
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

537
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:15,388
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

538
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:18,684
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

539
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:22,821
You know? Just ignore what I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

540
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,627
See what the dealio is.

541
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,135
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

542
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:33,401
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.
I just stubbed my toe.</i>

543
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:36,569
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

544
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:39,773
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

545
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,441
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

546
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:45,247
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

547
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,719
I'd never talk to anyone...

548
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,122
...about the stuff that I do with you
involving drugs.

549
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:53,785
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

550
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:55,795
I gotta lay some shit on you.

551
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,558
There is a fly in the ointment.

552
00:29:57,734 --> 00:30:00,294
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

553
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,768
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

554
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,430
<i>- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.</i>

555
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:08,601
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

556
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,247
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

557
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:13,849
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

558
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:15,041
- Who?
- I don't know.

559
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:16,845
He's whispering to another man.

560
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,853
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

561
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:23,515
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

562
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:26,094
<i>- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?</i>

563
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,321
How'd you know that?

564
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:31,365
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

565
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:34,231
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

566
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:37,134
<i>...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.</i>

567
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:39,832
<i>Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?</i>

568
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,410
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

569
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,207
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

570
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:48,480
<i>- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- Nice.</i>

571
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,348
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

572
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,183
<i>Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

573
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:57,622
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

574
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:03,492
I should call Angie soon.

575
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,693
Make up some bullshit.

576
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,962
I'm cold.

577
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:11,198
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

578
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:12,398
I run hot.

579
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,873
- Really?
- Yeah.

580
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:17,343
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

581
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:20,745
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

582
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:23,142
I'm gonna call Angie.

583
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,387
Space.

584
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:34,996
Dale, wait. Wait.

585
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,767
The phones. The phones.

586
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:41,199
- You said they were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

587
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,929
I was thinking, maybe they can...

588
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:45,836
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

589
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,909
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

590
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,943
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

591
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,774
Maybe they can even trace them...

592
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,382
...like, when we're not even
on them, you know?

593
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:58,043
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

594
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:00,189
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

595
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:01,824
We'll never catch an animal.

596
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:04,460
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

597
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:06,220
No, no, no.

598
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:08,762
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

599
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,331
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

600
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,899
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

601
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:15,003
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

602
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:17,367
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

603
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:22,205
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

604
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:24,574
- What tree?
- That one.

605
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:27,273
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

606
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,317
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

607
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,421
Did you at least see
where it landed?

608
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:34,216
I don't know. Call it.

609
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:38,089
Call it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

610
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,890
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

611
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,523
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

612
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,296
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

613
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:50,598
- Do you see it?
- See what?

614
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:53,038
The phone, you idiot.

615
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,974
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

616
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,444
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

617
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:01,379
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

618
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:03,542
- What?
- What was that?

619
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,778
- What?
- What is that?

620
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:07,856
- What?
- I hear something.

621
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:09,048
What?

622
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,091
I don't know. Do you hear that?

623
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,627
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

624
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:15,555
Oh, fuck!

625
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,099
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

626
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:22,662
Help me!

627
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,163
Tell him to get away from me!

628
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:27,537
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

629
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:29,542
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

630
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:33,349
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

631
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:35,279
- Fall back!
- Save me!

632
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,462
Oh, shit.

633
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:52,492
Car.

634
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:02,845
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

635
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:05,277
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

636
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:07,746
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

637
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:11,581
- Go! I saw something!
- No! What did you see? Shut up!

638
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:15,247
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

639
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,689
I heard something,
then I saw something.

640
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:19,556
You didn't hear anything, man.

641
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:21,594
Well, I saw something.

642
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:28,769
<i>And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...</i>

643
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,304
<i>- ... broke your nose?
- Right.</i>

644
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:34,375
<i>The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?</i>

645
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:51,391
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

646
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:54,358
How did I get on you?

647
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:56,793
I wonder.

648
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,668
Watch finally broke.

649
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,431
Crazy. What time is it?

650
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,575
That can't be right.

651
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,906
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

652
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,176
It's 3:00 right now?

653
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,876
Holy shit, man!

654
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:20,545
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

655
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:22,191
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

656
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:25,351
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

657
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:29,828
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

658
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:33,158
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

659
00:35:33,336 --> 00:35:35,861
<i>My bubbe...
Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.</i>

660
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,097
Shit.

661
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,104
We gotta call Red.

662
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,869
Okay. How?

663
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,070
We'll go to a pay phone.

664
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:47,512
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

665
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,675
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

666
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:51,150
Yeah, I know where he lives.

667
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:53,448
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

668
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,056
"Insinuating." Good word.

669
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:56,522
Do you know what that means?

670
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:59,685
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

671
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,626
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

672
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,792
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

673
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,872
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

674
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,668
Wait.

675
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:14,974
What do you mean, it's dead?

676
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:18,672
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

677
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:20,509
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

678
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:23,174
How can I explain this
to you differently?

679
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:26,345
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

680
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:30,050
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

681
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:32,954
How did this happen?

682
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:35,893
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

683
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, man. To talk radio?

684
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:40,568
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

685
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:43,501
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

686
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,800
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

687
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:47,237
We're gonna go.

688
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,106
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

689
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,214
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

690
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,613
Red will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

691
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,047
How does that sound? Good?

692
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,051
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

693
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,816
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

694
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:04,016
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

695
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:14,869
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

696
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:17,438
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,507
Thanks for taking care of it.

698
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,548
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

699
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:08,222
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

700
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,228
Here's good.

701
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:24,837
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

702
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:26,566
You're welcome.

703
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:34,080
- You're sure we can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

704
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:35,876
Who is it?

705
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:39,715
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

706
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:43,052
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

707
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:44,250
Who's this?

708
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:46,395
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

709
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,587
Dale who?

710
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:49,732
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

711
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:51,161
Dale Denton. He's with me.

712
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:53,666
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

713
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:56,566
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

714
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:59,037
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

715
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,905
- Y'all wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

716
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,137
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

717
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:06,248
Look at that, huh?

718
00:39:07,116 --> 00:39:09,641
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

719
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:14,449
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

720
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:16,057
What's up with the clothes?

721
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,091
We were camping.

722
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:20,695
- Camping?
- Yeah.

723
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:23,957
Is your lip okay, man?

724
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,158
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

725
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,296
It's a cold sore.

726
00:39:28,471 --> 00:39:31,907
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

727
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:35,272
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

728
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:38,005
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

729
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:40,675
Yeah. Yes, it does.

730
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,683
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

731
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:46,583
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

732
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:48,246
Herpes is for life, bro.

733
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:51,882
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

734
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,689
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

735
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,593
It's from that time. I told you, man.

736
00:39:56,766 --> 00:40:00,133
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

737
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:02,965
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

738
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:06,404
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

739
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:10,034
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

740
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:12,875
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

741
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:17,281
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

742
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:19,182
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

743
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,617
Can I have a piece of that?

744
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,054
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

745
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,716
No, you can't. This is private.

746
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:26,657
Do you know what today is?

747
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,764
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

748
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:33,095
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

749
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,237
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

750
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,736
So now who's the funny guy?

751
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,064
Sorry.

752
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:39,333
Today is his birthday...

753
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:42,842
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

754
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:46,277
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

755
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,775
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

756
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,646
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

757
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,913
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

758
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:54,283
What are we talk...? Guys...

759
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:55,981
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

760
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,252
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

761
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:00,419
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

762
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,564
We need to know...

763
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:04,461
We need to know
about your source.

764
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:05,965
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

765
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:09,798
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

766
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:11,439
I'm not. That's not what I am.

767
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:14,735
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

768
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:19,905
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

769
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,847
You don't want any trouble.
We don't wanna give you trouble.

770
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,419
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

771
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:28,455
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

772
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:30,524
- You can.
- I totally can.

773
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:32,456
And for you
to come into my house...

774
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:35,859
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

775
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:38,728
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

776
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:40,129
Look at this. See this?

777
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,100
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

778
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,739
What's the significance of that?

779
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,705
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

780
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:51,574
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

781
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:54,216
That's all we need to know.

782
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,844
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

783
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:01,012
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

784
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,125
Cleared. Over.

785
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:06,261
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

786
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:08,090
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

787
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,892
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

788
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,160
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

789
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:14,803
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

790
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:16,302
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

791
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:16,539
Yes.

792
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,166
Yes.

793
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:19,870
There you go.

794
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:22,067
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

795
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:24,338
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

796
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:27,074
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

797
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,478
You're more chill than me?

798
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,176
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

799
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:33,254
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

800
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:36,620
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I like you.

801
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:38,920
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

802
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:41,427
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

803
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:44,327
<i>I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?</i>

804
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,660
- Give her a call.
- I will.

805
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:48,167
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

806
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:49,861
Oh, I won't.

807
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:52,232
Bullshit.

808
00:42:52,975 --> 00:42:54,772
No, no, no.

809
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:56,411
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

810
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,047
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

811
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:00,204
No, he's not.

812
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:02,283
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

813
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,386
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

814
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:07,022
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

815
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,418
I do not trust you, sir.

816
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,354
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

817
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:12,517
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

818
00:43:12,695 --> 00:43:14,253
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

819
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,590
Fuck you!

820
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:17,460
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

821
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:18,895
Oh, Jesus.

822
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,999
Herpes!

823
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,307
I don't wanna have to do this.

824
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:26,635
Red, you're crazy, man.

825
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:28,777
You brought the devil
into my house.

826
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:30,674
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

827
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:32,906
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

828
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:37,075
Dale, he's hurting me!

829
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:38,777
Toilet.

830
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:40,445
Flush.

831
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:43,854
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

832
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:46,358
True!

833
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:02,472
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

834
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,012
Stay out of here!

835
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,250
Red, don't do it!

836
00:44:12,288 --> 00:44:14,017
- Red!
- You assholes.

837
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,748
You ruined my portable phone.

838
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:18,120
- Teamwork.
- Yes.

839
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:21,521
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

840
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:26,826
Fuck.

841
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:28,402
Phone.

842
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,935
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

843
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:35,634
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

844
00:44:35,811 --> 00:44:37,301
Tell us everything, now!

845
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,811
Said they were gonna kill me.

846
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:40,972
What did you tell Ted?

847
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,084
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

848
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:44,719
Smash them.

849
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:45,911
Fuck!

850
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:47,487
Time out. Time out.

851
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:48,851
Time out. Time out.

852
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:50,788
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

853
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,757
- Stop!
- Cheater!

854
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:54,692
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

855
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:57,298
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

856
00:44:58,534 --> 00:44:59,558
Fuck.

857
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,537
God...

858
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,002
Fuck!

859
00:45:04,173 --> 00:45:06,164
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

860
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,103
Fuck!

861
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:14,948
No! No, no, no!

862
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:16,982
Where you going, huh?

863
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:19,212
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

864
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:22,152
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

865
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:23,724
He's punching my bum!

866
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:26,657
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

867
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:30,492
Use words! No! No! No!

868
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:35,068
You okay, man?

869
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:37,728
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

870
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:40,803
Happy birthday.

871
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,334
- All right?
- Thank you.

872
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:44,809
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

873
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:47,040
This ends now!

874
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:52,554
Oh, shit.

875
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,519
Was that too much?

876
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:58,360
Can't get the edge.

877
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:00,794
Wait. Got it. Got it.

878
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,089
Hey, Dale.

879
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:05,597
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

880
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:06,996
I don't think I am either.

881
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,933
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

882
00:46:10,106 --> 00:46:12,540
Or, just not say anything.

883
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:16,907
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

884
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,339
Wake up.

885
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:21,008
Hey, what's up, dudes?

886
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,243
What's up? Tell us everything now.

887
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,444
Talk, Red.

888
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:27,987
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

889
00:46:32,194 --> 00:46:33,388
Trapped.

890
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:34,824
Not happening, Red.

891
00:46:34,997 --> 00:46:37,488
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

892
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:42,161
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

893
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:45,307
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

894
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:47,806
Two real big son of a bitches.

895
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:49,740
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

896
00:46:49,912 --> 00:46:52,540
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

897
00:46:52,715 --> 00:46:54,546
So you guys are basically fucked.

898
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:57,311
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

899
00:46:57,486 --> 00:47:00,284
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

900
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:03,721
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

901
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:06,862
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

902
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,587
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

903
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:10,959
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

904
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:12,600
They're in a drug war right now.

905
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:15,100
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

906
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:16,863
- It's true.
- What Asians?

907
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,839
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

908
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,034
Vietcong?

909
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:24,873
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

910
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:30,644
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

911
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,844
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

912
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:33,352
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

913
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:34,887
They're here to kill me.

914
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:38,925
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

915
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:41,495
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a new friend.

916
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:43,859
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

917
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,501
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

918
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:48,034
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

919
00:47:48,204 --> 00:47:49,967
No sweat.

920
00:47:54,443 --> 00:47:56,343
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

921
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:59,675
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

922
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:03,943
Hey. In here.

923
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,111
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

924
00:48:06,288 --> 00:48:07,880
- We should hide.
- Why?

925
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:09,991
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

926
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:11,922
...then they'll go to my apartment.

927
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:15,791
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

928
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:17,455
No. I think we should stay.

929
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:19,965
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

930
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:23,196
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

931
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:27,665
<i>- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.</i>

932
00:48:27,843 --> 00:48:29,333
Red, it's your last chance, man.

933
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:31,309
You gonna give us something
we can use?

934
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,881
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

935
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,143
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

936
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,946
He's obviously working with Saul.

937
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:41,089
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

938
00:48:41,257 --> 00:48:42,918
They kicked the hell out of me...

939
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,287
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

940
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,929
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

941
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:51,794
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

942
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,458
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

943
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,696
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

944
00:48:56,872 --> 00:48:59,033
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

945
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,574
Obviously. We're friends.

946
00:49:01,744 --> 00:49:03,041
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

947
00:49:03,212 --> 00:49:07,114
Dale Denton: not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

948
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:10,810
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

949
00:49:10,986 --> 00:49:13,477
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

950
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:15,317
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

951
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:17,482
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

952
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:20,924
What the hell are you doing?

953
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:22,825
Ted told me to kill him.

954
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:25,796
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

955
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:27,868
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

956
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:29,163
- You catch it?
- See what?

957
00:49:29,338 --> 00:49:32,398
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

958
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:35,601
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

959
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:37,878
You was ruthless.

960
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,413
You was ruthless, man.

961
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:43,643
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

962
00:49:44,353 --> 00:49:46,048
I'm gonna die now probably.

963
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:49,623
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

964
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,316
This how you do me?

965
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:56,728
So, what did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

966
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:58,526
I don't know.

967
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:01,934
There's this guy, Saul...

968
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:05,439
...something, selling weed who works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

969
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:06,973
That's all he got out of him.

970
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:10,578
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

971
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,611
Well, did he say anything else?

972
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:16,046
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

973
00:50:16,218 --> 00:50:18,345
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

974
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,613
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

975
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:24,225
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

976
00:50:24,727 --> 00:50:28,128
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

977
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:30,458
What's his name? Denton?
- to finish the job.

978
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:31,957
<i>Maybe.</i>

979
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:35,262
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

980
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:38,929
<i>I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

981
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:42,509
<i>Who he's screwing,
who's his mother, everything.</i>

982
00:50:42,745 --> 00:50:44,303
I have to take a shit.

983
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:48,313
Wait. Where are we going?

984
00:50:48,484 --> 00:50:52,784
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

985
00:50:52,955 --> 00:50:55,423
<i>What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.</i>

986
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:58,151
I mean, she has
a different last name.

987
00:50:58,327 --> 00:50:59,658
Belogus.

988
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:03,161
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

989
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:21,146
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

990
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:25,048
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

991
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,121
And you can call it rude.
You can call it whatever you want.

992
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:31,691
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

993
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,884
Dad, he'll be here.

994
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:36,122
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

995
00:51:36,298 --> 00:51:39,290
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

996
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:44,829
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

997
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:46,599
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

998
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:48,834
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

999
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,878
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

1000
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,607
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

1001
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,546
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1002
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,846
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1003
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:00,716
I'll keep guard.

1004
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:02,815
Hey.

1005
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:05,784
Shit.

1006
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:07,519
Oh, no.

1007
00:52:07,696 --> 00:52:08,720
Hey, Dale.

1008
00:52:08,897 --> 00:52:11,832
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

1009
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:13,025
Dinner.

1010
00:52:13,836 --> 00:52:18,102
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1011
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:19,570
Sit. Please.

1012
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:22,040
Of course. Hi.

1013
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:23,803
- Hi.
- Shannon.

1014
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:25,606
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

1015
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:28,511
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so we can eat.

1016
00:52:28,684 --> 00:52:31,118
- Hi, Dale.
- Hey. Okay.

1017
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:32,776
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1018
00:52:32,955 --> 00:52:34,820
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1019
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,116
So I'm here.

1020
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,454
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1021
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:43,462
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

1022
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:46,294
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1023
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:49,631
- In the woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1024
00:52:49,805 --> 00:52:51,705
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1025
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:54,206
I bird-watch. I don't.

1026
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:57,277
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1027
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:01,109
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1028
00:53:01,283 --> 00:53:03,183
I saw someone
murder someone else...

1029
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:05,877
...and I think
they've been following me.

1030
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:08,319
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1031
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,185
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1032
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:13,328
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

1033
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:14,792
...and it's on my fridge.

1034
00:53:14,963 --> 00:53:17,591
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1035
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:19,461
We should call the police
right away.

1036
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,728
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1037
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:24,429
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1038
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:27,268
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

1039
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:29,502
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1040
00:53:29,678 --> 00:53:33,205
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1041
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:36,010
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1042
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,676
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1043
00:53:38,854 --> 00:53:40,685
You are high as a fucking kite.

1044
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:42,323
I'm not high. Let's go.

1045
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:44,584
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1046
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,990
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1047
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:49,392
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1048
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:51,556
Your gun? His gun?

1049
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:54,201
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1050
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:58,362
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1051
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:16,152
<i>- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.</i>

1052
00:54:16,325 --> 00:54:18,452
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1053
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:20,026
Who is after you, after Angie?

1054
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:23,596
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1055
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:26,233
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1056
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,835
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1057
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:32,405
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1058
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:33,870
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1059
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:35,771
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1060
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:39,209
- Angie, what did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1061
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,508
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1062
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:42,809
- I got it.
- Get it.

1063
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,720
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

1064
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,882
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1065
00:54:55,597 --> 00:54:56,859
What was that?

1066
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:59,091
That was a gunshot.

1067
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:05,005
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1068
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:07,108
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1069
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:09,676
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1070
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:11,574
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1071
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,580
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1072
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,479
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1073
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:29,931
Anybody out there?

1074
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,369
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1075
00:55:35,537 --> 00:55:37,164
Say, now.

1076
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:42,041
Hey, the food's still warm.

1077
00:55:45,113 --> 00:55:46,307
Love it.

1078
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:48,472
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1079
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,118
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1080
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:52,617
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1081
00:55:52,788 --> 00:55:55,518
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1082
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,818
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1083
00:55:57,993 --> 00:56:00,086
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1084
00:56:00,262 --> 00:56:03,698
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

1085
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:06,197
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1086
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:08,495
Use a fake name.

1087
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:10,995
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1088
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:14,142
I don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of...

1089
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:17,005
...but I will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1090
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,476
Fuck off, loser.

1091
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:24,044
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with love.

1092
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,511
So get this:

1093
00:56:26,688 --> 00:56:28,280
We triangulated the cells.

1094
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:32,018
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1095
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:34,219
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1096
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:37,092
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1097
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:39,632
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1098
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:43,066
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

1099
00:56:43,238 --> 00:56:45,069
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

1100
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,731
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1101
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,207
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1102
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:02,720
Hello?

1103
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:03,948
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

1104
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:05,525
Record this conversation.

1105
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:09,894
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1106
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:14,058
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

1107
00:57:14,236 --> 00:57:18,138
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1108
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:22,300
<i>... hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...</i>

1109
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:25,640
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1110
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:29,181
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.</i>

1111
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:33,014
And now this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1112
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:36,783
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1113
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:38,216
Bring it on.

1114
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:40,827
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

1115
00:57:40,996 --> 00:57:43,464
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1116
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:46,157
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1117
00:57:46,335 --> 00:57:47,996
...and be ready for everything!

1118
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,035
You are fucking dead!

1119
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:52,299
You are so dumb.

1120
00:57:52,474 --> 00:57:55,966
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us look?

1121
00:57:57,446 --> 00:58:00,506
Goddamn it!

1122
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,180
Totally sweet.

1123
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:04,882
Ted Jones is slipping.

1124
00:58:05,053 --> 00:58:08,682
We shall strike now with full force.

1125
00:58:09,858 --> 00:58:12,588
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1126
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:18,759
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1127
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:21,528
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1128
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:24,194
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

1129
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:26,807
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1130
00:58:26,975 --> 00:58:30,775
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1131
00:58:30,946 --> 00:58:34,848
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1132
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:38,008
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1133
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:40,744
Yeah.

1134
00:58:43,392 --> 00:58:46,020
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1135
00:58:46,194 --> 00:58:47,855
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1136
00:58:48,764 --> 00:58:50,061
Get bus tickets.

1137
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:53,668
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

1138
00:58:53,835 --> 00:58:56,099
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1139
00:58:56,271 --> 00:58:58,205
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1140
00:58:58,373 --> 00:59:00,568
But we should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1141
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:01,936
What?

1142
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,238
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1143
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:08,747
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1144
00:59:09,317 --> 00:59:10,614
What about your sack?

1145
00:59:10,786 --> 00:59:13,653
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1146
00:59:14,856 --> 00:59:17,791
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1147
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:19,426
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1148
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,653
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1149
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,491
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1150
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:27,692
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1151
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:28,603
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1152
00:59:28,603 --> 00:59:30,662
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1153
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,431
These guys are amazing.

1154
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:34,306
What the fuck do you want?

1155
00:59:34,476 --> 00:59:36,637
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1156
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:44,919
What's this stuff called again?

1157
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:47,111
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1158
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:50,486
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1159
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:53,526
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at weed too.

1160
00:59:53,695 --> 00:59:56,630
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1161
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,266
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1162
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:03,495
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1163
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:05,071
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1164
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:25,050
- How much money you guys got?
- Come on.

1165
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:27,593
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1166
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:30,060
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1167
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:33,895
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1168
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:38,233
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1169
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:41,239
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

1170
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:44,403
You fucking did it, man.

1171
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:47,241
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1172
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:49,849
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1173
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:51,508
Get some burritos or something.

1174
01:00:51,686 --> 01:00:53,654
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1175
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:56,256
See you, man. Nice.

1176
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:05,865
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1177
01:01:06,034 --> 01:01:07,626
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1178
01:01:07,802 --> 01:01:09,565
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1179
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:11,433
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1180
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:14,131
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

1181
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:18,575
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1182
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:23,514
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1183
01:01:23,685 --> 01:01:26,677
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1184
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:29,949
And guess what? I just saw three
students walking from back here...

1185
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:33,458
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1186
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:41,533
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1187
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:43,432
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1188
01:01:43,605 --> 01:01:46,369
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1189
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:50,272
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1190
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:53,278
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1191
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:59,420
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1192
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:05,182
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1193
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,888
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1194
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:12,090
425, 425, what's your location?

1195
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:14,897
You going down.

1196
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:17,163
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1197
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:19,603
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1198
01:02:19,774 --> 01:02:22,004
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1199
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:24,668
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1200
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:27,280
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1201
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:28,916
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1202
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:31,143
One of them was actually
a police cruiser.

1203
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:34,186
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1204
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:37,223
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1205
01:02:37,392 --> 01:02:39,292
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

1206
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:41,224
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

1207
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:42,886
- Exactly.
- And you saw it?

1208
01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:45,055
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

1209
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:48,066
- It was a woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

1210
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:53,139
- I think I know who that bitch was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1211
01:02:55,076 --> 01:02:57,510
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma'am. Thank you.

1212
01:02:57,679 --> 01:02:59,738
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1213
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:02,178
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1214
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,511
I don't work for the law.
The law works for me.

1215
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,779
I been smelling something
in this department.

1216
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:08,320
Keep your eyes on the road.

1217
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,720
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

1218
01:03:11,926 --> 01:03:13,291
Son of a bitch!

1219
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:17,329
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1220
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:27,070
No, no, no.

1221
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:30,234
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

1222
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:33,672
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1223
01:03:33,848 --> 01:03:36,408
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1224
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:38,381
Stop this car!

1225
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:44,481
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1226
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,092
Oh, shit!

1227
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,666
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1228
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,425
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

1229
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:56,627
I don't know. They're shooting!

1230
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,545
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1231
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:06,010
Fuck.

1232
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:12,509
Dude!

1233
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,848
I can't see! The Slushee!

1234
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:19,186
- Turn on the wipers!
- It's not working!

1235
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,021
Well, kick out the window!

1236
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:23,960
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1237
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:27,832
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1238
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:32,536
Get your foot out of there.

1239
01:04:33,274 --> 01:04:35,367
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1240
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:36,601
Her car's better.

1241
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:39,178
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1242
01:04:39,347 --> 01:04:42,248
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1243
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:46,812
Oh, no, no, no!

1244
01:04:48,857 --> 01:04:50,154
Oh, shit!

1245
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:52,020
Get it out!

1246
01:04:54,462 --> 01:04:56,054
I can't see!

1247
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:05,839
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1248
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,335
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1249
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,241
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1250
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:16,883
You did it, man.

1251
01:05:18,186 --> 01:05:19,676
All right! Look out!

1252
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:21,913
Oh, shit!

1253
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,524
Turn around! Turn around!

1254
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:34,598
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1255
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:37,101
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1256
01:05:37,272 --> 01:05:39,536
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1257
01:05:43,044 --> 01:05:46,377
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1258
01:05:47,282 --> 01:05:48,772
Sorry!

1259
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,676
What the fuck was that?

1260
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:54,083
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1261
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:56,155
- Why?
- I don't know.

1262
01:06:13,141 --> 01:06:14,631
Oh, my.

1263
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:21,547
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1264
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,412
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1265
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:27,350
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1266
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:30,389
Come back! Saul!

1267
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:31,923
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

1268
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:36,029
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1269
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:41,397
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1270
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:43,298
...l'm moving on.

1271
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:49,167
Okay.

1272
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:50,902
All right.

1273
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:55,171
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1274
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,612
As sure as shit you will.

1275
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:58,581
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1276
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:02,245
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1277
01:07:02,423 --> 01:07:05,017
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1278
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:07,684
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1279
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,989
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1280
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:12,227
So smile.

1281
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,958
Shut up.

1282
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:20,738
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1283
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,907
All right. Are you using protection?

1284
01:07:24,078 --> 01:07:25,136
<i>- Days Inn.
- Yes.</i>

1285
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,178
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1286
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:29,950
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?</i>

1287
01:07:30,118 --> 01:07:31,949
<i>- Dale.
- Angie?</i>

1288
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,816
<i>- My God, are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

1289
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:36,320
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.</i>

1290
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:38,083
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

1291
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:40,420
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1292
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:43,462
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1293
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:48,534
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1294
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:51,604
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...</i>

1295
01:07:51,773 --> 01:07:54,640
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1296
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,333
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

1297
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:59,674
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1298
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:02,714
<i>B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

1299
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,181
And now I'm dealing with it.

1300
01:08:04,352 --> 01:08:06,843
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1301
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:09,512
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1302
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:11,181
<i>- We have to work through it.
- No.</i>

1303
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,826
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1304
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:15,462
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1305
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,927
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

1306
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:19,623
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1307
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:23,134
Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1308
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:24,635
What the fuck does that mean?

1309
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:27,434
<i>It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.</i>

1310
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,701
<i>You'll get into
Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

1311
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:31,037
<i>... and the fucking Shins.</i>

1312
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:33,772
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...</i>

1313
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,678
<i>... and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

1314
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:39,251
<i>You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

1315
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,513
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1316
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:43,418
<i>You never did like me anyway,
did you?</i>

1317
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:45,115
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

1318
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:47,887
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1319
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:49,290
I always care about you.

1320
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:51,295
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1321
01:08:51,466 --> 01:08:53,900
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1322
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:58,198
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1323
01:08:58,373 --> 01:09:00,398
Call me when I can go home.

1324
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:05,803
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1325
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,211
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1326
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:12,079
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1327
01:09:12,253 --> 01:09:16,383
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1328
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:18,081
I love you.

1329
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:20,420
You wise-ass.

1330
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:24,026
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1331
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:26,598
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1332
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:27,860
First things first.

1333
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:33,240
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1334
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:35,569
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1335
01:09:35,743 --> 01:09:37,176
That clearly just happened...

1336
01:09:37,345 --> 01:09:39,711
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1337
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,849
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1338
01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:44,177
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1339
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:47,219
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1340
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:49,856
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1341
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:53,391
- we are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1342
01:09:53,561 --> 01:09:56,291
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1343
01:09:56,464 --> 01:09:59,297
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1344
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:00,900
What do you gotta say to that?

1345
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:03,629
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

1346
01:10:03,805 --> 01:10:04,931
But you didn't save me.

1347
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:07,006
She was gonna help,
you made things worse.

1348
01:10:07,175 --> 01:10:09,040
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1349
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,201
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

1350
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:13,040
Only reason I started selling pot...

1351
01:10:13,214 --> 01:10:15,808
<i>...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.</i>

1352
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:18,144
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1353
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:19,650
I'm gonna become something.

1354
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,346
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1355
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:24,855
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1356
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:26,516
Little kids can take shits.

1357
01:10:26,694 --> 01:10:28,321
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1358
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,589
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1359
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:33,325
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1360
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:36,698
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1361
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:39,305
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1362
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:41,965
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1363
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:43,974
Boring people to death on the radio.

1364
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:47,740
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1365
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:49,780
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1366
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:52,920
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1367
01:10:53,087 --> 01:10:54,714
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1368
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:57,380
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1369
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:59,355
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1370
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:01,859
You were cold and I clothed you.

1371
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,629
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1372
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,427
You didn't say anything back.

1373
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:10,162
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1374
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:11,805
You are my drug dealer.

1375
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:13,702
There's one reason
we know each other.

1376
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,900
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1377
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:19,308
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were...

1378
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,608
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1379
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:27,577
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1380
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:29,313
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1381
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,924
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1382
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:34,118
What? That's not even
an expression.

1383
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:37,025
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1384
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:39,063
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1385
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:43,026
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1386
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:45,764
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1387
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,033
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1388
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:50,609
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1389
01:11:50,778 --> 01:11:53,008
I didn't mean that.

1390
01:12:05,426 --> 01:12:08,190
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

1391
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:52,799
That looks great.

1392
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:01,881
Hello?

1393
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,281
Dale?

1394
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:05,817
<i>It is Dale.</i>

1395
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:10,856
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the world...

1396
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:14,461
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1397
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:16,358
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1398
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,125
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1399
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:22,997
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

1400
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,331
<i>So please
just take me back, please.</i>

1401
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:27,599
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

1402
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:31,911
<i>- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

1403
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,537
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1404
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:36,944
I don't know. I just...

1405
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:38,517
I wanna marry you.

1406
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:43,283
I made a mistake.

1407
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:45,789
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've...</i>

1408
01:13:46,193 --> 01:13:48,593
<i>- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

1409
01:13:48,763 --> 01:13:51,357
<i>- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?</i>

1410
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:53,090
I don't know.

1411
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:55,394
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1412
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:57,503
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1413
01:13:57,672 --> 01:14:01,233
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1414
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:04,537
<i>- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

1415
01:14:04,712 --> 01:14:07,909
<i>I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

1416
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:09,379
Just because you're older.

1417
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,075
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1418
01:14:12,253 --> 01:14:14,414
<i>- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?</i>

1419
01:14:14,588 --> 01:14:16,681
<i>- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?</i>

1420
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:18,051
What is a half? Your hand?

1421
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:21,160
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.</i>

1422
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:23,991
<i>I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."</i>

1423
01:14:24,165 --> 01:14:26,531
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.</i>

1424
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:28,032
<i>Screw you.</i>

1425
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:29,362
Get me out of this room.

1426
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:32,597
<i>I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

1427
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:38,575
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1428
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:44,080
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1429
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:46,816
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1430
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,818
Do you use the pool over here?

1431
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:51,753
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1432
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:55,123
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1433
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,230
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

1434
01:14:57,398 --> 01:15:00,128
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

1435
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:02,292
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1436
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:05,132
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1437
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:06,432
May I call you Faye?

1438
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:09,735
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1439
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,434
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1440
01:15:11,612 --> 01:15:13,136
What do you want from me?

1441
01:15:13,314 --> 01:15:14,679
<i>Bubbe. Hey, guys.</i>

1442
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,340
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1443
01:15:21,455 --> 01:15:22,479
Damn.

1444
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:24,755
Oh, shit.

1445
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:26,517
Sorry, Betty.

1446
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:33,297
They kidnapped my grandson.

1447
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:35,367
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1448
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:38,528
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1449
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:40,799
I never saw them in my life before.

1450
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:44,138
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1451
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:48,771
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1452
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:52,715
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

1453
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:54,218
...but he was short as shit.

1454
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,322
But the worst part was...

1455
01:15:56,490 --> 01:16:00,859
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1456
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:03,019
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1457
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:04,459
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1458
01:16:04,632 --> 01:16:06,497
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1459
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,191
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

1460
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:17,071
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1461
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:19,007
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1462
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,013
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1463
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:24,378
Where am I, man? What?

1464
01:16:24,552 --> 01:16:28,010
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1465
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,520
Shit. Did I do that?

1466
01:16:31,192 --> 01:16:34,184
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1467
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:36,694
Fuck you, man!

1468
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:39,560
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1469
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,064
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1470
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:43,226
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1471
01:16:43,404 --> 01:16:46,805
- lf anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like Hamburglar.

1472
01:16:46,974 --> 01:16:47,998
And the Elephant Man.

1473
01:16:48,175 --> 01:16:50,370
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1474
01:16:50,544 --> 01:16:52,273
Professional. Professional.

1475
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,573
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

1476
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:56,875
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1477
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:58,916
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1478
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,747
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1479
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,116
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1480
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,690
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1481
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:09,091
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1482
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:11,424
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1483
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:14,568
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1484
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:16,362
I might act tough...

1485
01:17:16,537 --> 01:17:18,596
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1486
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:21,907
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1487
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,638
This ain't over.

1488
01:17:25,112 --> 01:17:26,977
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1489
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,206
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1490
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:32,648
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1491
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,084
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

1492
01:17:35,256 --> 01:17:38,316
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1493
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:39,516
Watch your head.

1494
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,259
Hey, watch him.

1495
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:46,327
Oh, my God.

1496
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,832
El Dorado.

1497
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:51,399
The legends are true.

1498
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:54,201
Look at all this weed, man.

1499
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,104
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1500
01:17:56,277 --> 01:17:58,643
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1501
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:00,609
OG Kush?

1502
01:18:00,781 --> 01:18:02,112
OG Kush.

1503
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,918
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1504
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:13,753
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1505
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:15,828
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1506
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,008
Hello?

1507
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,579
Red?

1508
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,654
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1509
01:18:42,823 --> 01:18:45,621
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1510
01:18:45,793 --> 01:18:48,887
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1511
01:18:49,063 --> 01:18:50,496
Good.

1512
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:53,394
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

1513
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,432
You don't look great.

1514
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:57,127
They shot me, Denton.

1515
01:18:57,304 --> 01:18:58,601
They got me right here.

1516
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,103
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1517
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:02,071
And then they got me again
right here.

1518
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:05,473
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1519
01:19:05,646 --> 01:19:07,170
They'll save your life, okay?

1520
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:09,248
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1521
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,044
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1522
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:14,483
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1523
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:16,748
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1524
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:19,859
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1525
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:21,654
He's just, like, an asshole.

1526
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:24,764
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1527
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,797
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1528
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:28,332
And I'm gonna get him back.

1529
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,493
You know, like, he saved my life.

1530
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:33,799
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1531
01:19:33,974 --> 01:19:36,807
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

1532
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:38,035
I was mean to him, man.

1533
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,942
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1534
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:44,778
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1535
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:48,854
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1536
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:50,957
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1537
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:55,084
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1538
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:59,392
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1539
01:19:59,566 --> 01:20:01,932
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

1540
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:04,969
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

1541
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,903
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1542
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:11,806
Or a worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1543
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:14,379
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1544
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,106
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1545
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:17,841
You'll come back as a dragon.

1546
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:19,679
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1547
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,682
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1548
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:26,189
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1549
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,384
It belongs to me.

1550
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:28,994
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1551
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:32,997
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1552
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:34,395
You'll have a second wind.

1553
01:20:34,568 --> 01:20:36,968
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1554
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:39,799
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1555
01:20:39,973 --> 01:20:43,136
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1556
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:45,608
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1557
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:47,440
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1558
01:20:47,614 --> 01:20:49,912
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

1559
01:20:50,084 --> 01:20:51,847
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1560
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:54,852
Come here.

1561
01:20:58,058 --> 01:21:01,755
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1562
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:06,290
Thug life.

1563
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:13,500
Oh, shit.

1564
01:21:13,674 --> 01:21:16,404
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1565
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:18,636
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1566
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,315
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1567
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:35,227
Don't.

1568
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:36,419
Don't.

1569
01:21:36,597 --> 01:21:38,258
Just something quick like that.

1570
01:21:38,432 --> 01:21:39,922
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1571
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,227
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1572
01:21:55,516 --> 01:21:57,347
Oh, God.

1573
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,079
That's a big hideout.

1574
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:06,049
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1575
01:22:06,226 --> 01:22:09,195
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1576
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:12,264
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1577
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:14,866
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1578
01:22:15,035 --> 01:22:17,128
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1579
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:20,205
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1580
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:22,535
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

1581
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:25,075
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1582
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:26,439
This could be your moment.

1583
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,173
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

1584
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:30,373
Fuck you.

1585
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:32,712
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1586
01:22:32,886 --> 01:22:37,084
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

1587
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:40,658
Carol, she's cool now.

1588
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:44,764
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1589
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:47,230
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1590
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,801
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1591
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,268
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1592
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:54,669
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

1593
01:22:54,842 --> 01:22:56,366
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1594
01:22:56,543 --> 01:22:58,135
Put them down. On the ground.

1595
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:00,678
All right, everybody just chill.

1596
01:23:00,848 --> 01:23:02,748
Oh, my God!

1597
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:04,577
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1598
01:23:04,751 --> 01:23:07,276
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1599
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:09,752
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1600
01:23:09,923 --> 01:23:11,720
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1601
01:23:11,892 --> 01:23:14,622
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1602
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:17,286
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1603
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:19,398
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1604
01:23:19,566 --> 01:23:21,693
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1605
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:23,666
End of story.

1606
01:23:23,837 --> 01:23:25,862
I'm telling Ted.

1607
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:27,802
- lf you do...
- He's got a piece.

1608
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:29,567
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1609
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:31,404
He's got another one, in the side.

1610
01:23:31,578 --> 01:23:33,170
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1611
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:35,611
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1612
01:23:35,782 --> 01:23:37,943
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1613
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:39,346
No. Come on.

1614
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:44,890
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

1615
01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:46,150
- Dale.
- Yes.

1616
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:49,489
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1617
01:23:49,663 --> 01:23:51,528
- No, man.
- Yes.

1618
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,393
I'm here to save you.

1619
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,229
No. You just got caught too.

1620
01:23:56,403 --> 01:23:58,769
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1621
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:00,998
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1622
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:04,007
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

1623
01:24:04,177 --> 01:24:07,340
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1624
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:10,717
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1625
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:13,318
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1626
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:16,547
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1627
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:19,248
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1628
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:21,155
You're a mean jerk.

1629
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:24,297
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

1630
01:24:24,464 --> 01:24:26,694
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

1631
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:29,563
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1632
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:32,204
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1633
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:33,862
You're the best guy I know.

1634
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:35,871
BFFF.

1635
01:24:36,043 --> 01:24:38,477
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

1636
01:24:41,815 --> 01:24:44,010
- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

1637
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:46,584
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

1638
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,084
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1639
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:51,418
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

1640
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:54,492
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

1641
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:56,390
- I know. They are.
- Fuck, man.

1642
01:24:56,563 --> 01:25:00,897
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1643
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:03,628
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

1644
01:25:03,804 --> 01:25:05,931
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

1645
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:07,596
I do.

1646
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,571
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1647
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:13,677
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

1648
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:17,305
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1649
01:25:18,685 --> 01:25:20,277
- Is it working?
- I can't feel it.

1650
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:21,478
I can't feel you.

1651
01:25:21,655 --> 01:25:23,589
- Wait, I feel it.
- I feel it. Yes, okay.

1652
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:25,156
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1653
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:27,418
- I'm gonna save you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1654
01:25:27,594 --> 01:25:29,357
- Let me save you.
- Save me, Dale.

1655
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:31,394
It's not working.
We gotta change angles.

1656
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:33,795
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

1657
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,457
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1658
01:25:35,635 --> 01:25:37,569
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

1659
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:39,831
- All right. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

1660
01:25:40,941 --> 01:25:43,068
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

1661
01:25:43,243 --> 01:25:45,643
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

1662
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:48,110
- You're my best friend, man.
- Yeah, see?

1663
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:51,375
- It's not working.
- Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

1664
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:53,519
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

1665
01:25:53,687 --> 01:25:55,780
Come on. Let's go.

1666
01:25:55,956 --> 01:25:57,821
Harder.

1667
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,833
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

1668
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:11,698
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1669
01:26:11,872 --> 01:26:14,773
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1670
01:26:14,941 --> 01:26:16,374
It's gross.

1671
01:26:16,543 --> 01:26:18,807
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1672
01:26:18,979 --> 01:26:22,779
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1673
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:25,144
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1674
01:26:25,318 --> 01:26:28,549
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1675
01:26:28,722 --> 01:26:30,280
He shot Pete?

1676
01:26:30,457 --> 01:26:32,448
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1677
01:26:32,626 --> 01:26:35,151
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1678
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:38,627
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1679
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,229
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1680
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:47,430
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1681
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:50,709
Stop. Wait here.

1682
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:53,641
No retreat, no surrender.

1683
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:00,143
Yes, yes, yes.

1684
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,153
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1685
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:06,724
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1686
01:27:06,893 --> 01:27:09,088
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1687
01:27:09,262 --> 01:27:11,162
Just don't. Don't...

1688
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:19,830
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1689
01:27:20,006 --> 01:27:24,102
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1690
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:25,767
Stop.

1691
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:31,709
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1692
01:27:31,885 --> 01:27:33,716
I can hear everything you're saying.

1693
01:27:33,887 --> 01:27:36,583
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1694
01:27:36,756 --> 01:27:39,247
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1695
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:41,690
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

1696
01:27:41,862 --> 01:27:43,420
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1697
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:46,031
What the fuck is that?

1698
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:49,359
Dale!

1699
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:56,908
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1700
01:27:59,212 --> 01:28:01,544
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1701
01:28:08,054 --> 01:28:09,544
You shot me.

1702
01:28:09,723 --> 01:28:11,088
I'm sorry, man.

1703
01:28:11,258 --> 01:28:14,955
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1704
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:16,755
I got glass in my ass.

1705
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,524
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

1706
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,792
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1707
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:26,196
Asians!

1708
01:28:31,211 --> 01:28:32,178
War is upon you!

1709
01:28:32,345 --> 01:28:34,142
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1710
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,412
Get down, motherfucker!

1711
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:47,187
Come on!

1712
01:28:49,896 --> 01:28:51,124
Fuck!

1713
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,871
Go! Go!

1714
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,202
Get down, baby!

1715
01:29:03,376 --> 01:29:05,105
Dale, no!

1716
01:29:05,278 --> 01:29:06,905
No, wake up, man.

1717
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,945
No, you're not dying, man.

1718
01:29:09,115 --> 01:29:11,675
Not without me.

1719
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:13,182
- Dale.
- What?

1720
01:29:13,353 --> 01:29:15,184
You're alive.

1721
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:18,882
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1722
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:21,518
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1723
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:24,425
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1724
01:29:25,565 --> 01:29:27,192
Fuck!

1725
01:29:29,469 --> 01:29:30,959
- Help!
- My ear.

1726
01:29:31,137 --> 01:29:32,161
- Yeah.
- Help!

1727
01:29:32,339 --> 01:29:34,432
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1728
01:29:34,608 --> 01:29:36,508
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1729
01:29:36,676 --> 01:29:37,700
You shot him?

1730
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:40,107
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1731
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,907
We've had enough out of you.

1732
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:43,310
I'm not your friend.

1733
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:44,848
Maybe I can just...

1734
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:47,009
No. No, infected.

1735
01:29:47,187 --> 01:29:49,587
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1736
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,751
It's clear.

1737
01:30:26,693 --> 01:30:29,025
Dude. Look.

1738
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:30,753
Nice.

1739
01:30:43,109 --> 01:30:44,633
Bullets.

1740
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:55,619
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1741
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:59,122
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1742
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:01,351
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1743
01:31:01,528 --> 01:31:03,496
I feel like I can smell it.

1744
01:31:03,663 --> 01:31:06,131
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1745
01:31:06,299 --> 01:31:07,357
You can't even tell.

1746
01:31:07,534 --> 01:31:08,626
That's a good point.

1747
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:10,201
Wait.

1748
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:54,277
Did you shoot that guy?

1749
01:31:54,447 --> 01:31:56,039
No. I'm out of bullets.

1750
01:31:56,216 --> 01:31:57,740
Me too.

1751
01:31:57,917 --> 01:32:00,181
Maybe it was ricochet.

1752
01:32:00,353 --> 01:32:02,344
Gravity.

1753
01:32:02,522 --> 01:32:04,251
Oh, nice.

1754
01:32:04,424 --> 01:32:06,358
You go down.

1755
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:07,686
I'll cover.

1756
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:11,024
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1757
01:32:15,535 --> 01:32:17,366
Sexy motherfucker.

1758
01:32:36,022 --> 01:32:38,422
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1759
01:32:38,591 --> 01:32:40,855
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1760
01:32:41,027 --> 01:32:44,258
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1761
01:32:45,999 --> 01:32:47,796
Oh, nice.

1762
01:32:49,302 --> 01:32:50,894
Here we go. Okay.

1763
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:54,005
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1764
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:57,934
Nice.

1765
01:32:58,578 --> 01:33:00,409
Nice. Okay.

1766
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:01,842
Pull me up.

1767
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:03,812
I'm ready. Go.

1768
01:33:03,983 --> 01:33:05,780
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1769
01:33:05,952 --> 01:33:08,386
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1770
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:10,546
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

1771
01:33:10,723 --> 01:33:13,453
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1772
01:33:13,626 --> 01:33:16,424
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1773
01:33:19,365 --> 01:33:20,389
Dale!

1774
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:22,091
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1775
01:33:23,903 --> 01:33:27,134
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1776
01:34:54,794 --> 01:34:56,625
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1777
01:34:56,796 --> 01:34:57,990
Okay.

1778
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:22,652
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1779
01:35:22,822 --> 01:35:23,982
Now!

1780
01:35:38,905 --> 01:35:40,031
Fuck you!

1781
01:35:45,178 --> 01:35:48,079
Fuck the police!

1782
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,967
Motherfucking kill you!

1783
01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:15,898
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1784
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,500
Oh, shit!

1785
01:36:18,678 --> 01:36:19,872
Come here!

1786
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,154
I hate you!

1787
01:36:29,322 --> 01:36:31,586
No! Ted, stop it!

1788
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:41,432
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1789
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:43,569
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1790
01:36:51,544 --> 01:36:52,602
Jesus!

1791
01:37:00,019 --> 01:37:01,543
Fuck.

1792
01:37:10,797 --> 01:37:12,355
Gonna die.

1793
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:17,367
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

1794
01:37:18,438 --> 01:37:20,372
But you weren't gonna stop.

1795
01:37:26,913 --> 01:37:28,471
Shoot him!

1796
01:37:28,648 --> 01:37:30,980
Just take it easy, buddy.

1797
01:37:32,752 --> 01:37:35,118
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1798
01:37:38,257 --> 01:37:40,020
I'm hungry.

1799
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:42,127
I'm going home.

1800
01:37:46,032 --> 01:37:47,693
All right.

1801
01:37:49,302 --> 01:37:50,963
Help.

1802
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,469
I knew you were going soft.

1803
01:37:55,641 --> 01:37:58,735
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1804
01:37:58,911 --> 01:38:00,970
Fucked up, man.

1805
01:38:03,182 --> 01:38:06,743
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

1806
01:38:06,919 --> 01:38:08,352
What's up, sir?

1807
01:38:08,988 --> 01:38:12,788
- Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

1808
01:38:12,959 --> 01:38:17,453
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

1809
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,224
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

1810
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:22,526
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1811
01:38:22,702 --> 01:38:24,135
All right.

1812
01:38:24,303 --> 01:38:26,362
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

1813
01:38:26,539 --> 01:38:30,134
All right. This is how it ends.

1814
01:38:46,292 --> 01:38:50,388
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1815
01:38:50,563 --> 01:38:52,053
How you like me now, huh?

1816
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:54,559
Gross.

1817
01:38:54,734 --> 01:38:55,758
Red?

1818
01:38:56,202 --> 01:38:57,362
Saul.

1819
01:38:57,537 --> 01:39:00,438
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1820
01:39:00,606 --> 01:39:02,267
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

1821
01:39:03,109 --> 01:39:04,599
Bro's before ho's.

1822
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:08,280
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1823
01:39:08,447 --> 01:39:12,884
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1824
01:39:13,052 --> 01:39:16,647
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1825
01:39:16,823 --> 01:39:20,623
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1826
01:39:20,793 --> 01:39:23,785
...I wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

1827
01:39:24,564 --> 01:39:27,431
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

1828
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:30,160
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1829
01:39:31,404 --> 01:39:33,167
No more lies, Red.

1830
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:35,864
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

1831
01:39:38,477 --> 01:39:39,967
Red!

1832
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:00,565
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1833
01:40:00,733 --> 01:40:02,598
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1834
01:40:02,768 --> 01:40:05,202
Your stupidity amazes me.

1835
01:40:07,607 --> 01:40:09,370
Hey, Ted!

1836
01:40:09,542 --> 01:40:11,510
You killed my brother...

1837
01:40:11,677 --> 01:40:14,771
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1838
01:40:14,947 --> 01:40:17,973
Suck my balls! Two times!

1839
01:40:25,825 --> 01:40:26,917
Bitch!

1840
01:40:27,093 --> 01:40:28,617
Bring it on.

1841
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:41,263
Shit. Dale.

1842
01:40:42,808 --> 01:40:45,003
Dale!

1843
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:46,838
Holy shit!

1844
01:41:23,349 --> 01:41:24,373
Sorry, Ted.

1845
01:41:28,554 --> 01:41:30,522
You've been served.

1846
01:41:37,663 --> 01:41:40,427
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1847
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:43,124
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1848
01:41:47,406 --> 01:41:49,033
Saul! Saul!

1849
01:41:54,613 --> 01:41:57,548
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

1850
01:41:57,717 --> 01:41:59,548
Come to me!

1851
01:42:01,587 --> 01:42:03,452
You're not dying today, friend.

1852
01:42:03,622 --> 01:42:06,489
Not on my watch.

1853
01:42:33,486 --> 01:42:36,683
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1854
01:42:36,856 --> 01:42:38,289
Saul.

1855
01:42:38,457 --> 01:42:39,947
Wake up.

1856
01:42:40,126 --> 01:42:42,560
Oh, sweet Saul.

1857
01:42:45,064 --> 01:42:47,760
Saul.

1858
01:42:50,603 --> 01:42:52,400
Yes. Yeah.

1859
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:54,038
Saul, you made it.

1860
01:42:54,206 --> 01:42:56,731
- What?
- Yeah.

1861
01:42:56,909 --> 01:42:58,843
Where am I?

1862
01:42:59,011 --> 01:43:01,036
You made it, man.

1863
01:43:01,213 --> 01:43:03,738
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1864
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:06,942
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

1865
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,450
What happened?

1866
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:09,849
What happened?

1867
01:43:16,362 --> 01:43:18,762
Holy shit.

1868
01:43:22,668 --> 01:43:24,397
What's that?

1869
01:43:27,173 --> 01:43:29,038
Hi.

1870
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:31,073
- Red?
- Red?

1871
01:43:33,913 --> 01:43:36,677
- Red.
- Hey.

1872
01:43:36,849 --> 01:43:40,182
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1873
01:43:40,352 --> 01:43:41,444
He came back to save us.

1874
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,678
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1875
01:43:42,855 --> 01:43:44,288
All right, man.

1876
01:43:44,457 --> 01:43:46,584
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1877
01:43:46,759 --> 01:43:49,626
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1878
01:43:49,795 --> 01:43:53,424
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1879
01:43:58,871 --> 01:44:03,831
<i>Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.</i>

1880
01:44:04,009 --> 01:44:07,843
<i>The topic of the day: new beginnings.
Getting over losses.</i>

1881
01:44:08,013 --> 01:44:10,413
<i>Friends. Life.</i>

1882
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:13,177
We have our first caller.

1883
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:15,980
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1884
01:44:16,155 --> 01:44:17,782
Hi. Am I on the air?

1885
01:44:17,957 --> 01:44:20,983
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1886
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,218
A D in the face.

1887
01:44:22,394 --> 01:44:23,759
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1888
01:44:23,929 --> 01:44:25,863
You're my hero.

1889
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:28,556
You're my hero.

1890
01:44:29,268 --> 01:44:30,758
You are good, man. Seriously.

1891
01:44:30,936 --> 01:44:32,836
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1892
01:44:33,005 --> 01:44:34,996
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1893
01:44:35,174 --> 01:44:37,972
- It's not bad, huh?
- lf I close my eyes, it sounds like...

1894
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,238
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1895
01:44:41,413 --> 01:44:44,280
- lf you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1896
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:46,816
<i>It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...</i>

1897
01:44:46,986 --> 01:44:48,817
<i>...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.</i>

1898
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:51,786
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1899
01:44:51,957 --> 01:44:54,551
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1900
01:44:54,727 --> 01:44:56,820
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1901
01:44:56,996 --> 01:44:58,759
...I like you now.

1902
01:44:58,931 --> 01:45:02,389
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1903
01:45:02,568 --> 01:45:04,593
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1904
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:08,001
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

1905
01:45:08,174 --> 01:45:10,972
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

1906
01:45:11,143 --> 01:45:13,338
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

1907
01:45:13,512 --> 01:45:14,911
We should get a three-way one.

1908
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,709
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

1909
01:45:18,884 --> 01:45:21,819
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

1910
01:45:21,987 --> 01:45:25,889
I know we've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

1911
01:45:26,058 --> 01:45:28,788
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

1912
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:31,486
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

1913
01:45:31,664 --> 01:45:34,531
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

1914
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,567
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

1915
01:45:37,736 --> 01:45:40,466
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

1916
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,197
Is that us getting a time-share?

1917
01:45:42,374 --> 01:45:44,774
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

1918
01:45:44,944 --> 01:45:47,310
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

1919
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:50,039
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

1920
01:45:50,216 --> 01:45:53,310
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

1921
01:45:53,485 --> 01:45:55,476
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

1922
01:45:55,654 --> 01:45:57,121
You fuckhead.

1923
01:45:57,289 --> 01:45:59,849
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

1924
01:46:00,025 --> 01:46:02,619
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

1925
01:46:02,795 --> 01:46:05,730
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

1926
01:46:05,898 --> 01:46:09,925
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

1927
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:12,036
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

1928
01:46:12,204 --> 01:46:14,399
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

1929
01:46:14,573 --> 01:46:18,304
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood left?

1930
01:46:18,477 --> 01:46:21,344
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

1931
01:46:21,513 --> 01:46:23,276
- You're losing stuff.
- Here.

1932
01:46:23,449 --> 01:46:25,314
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

1933
01:46:25,484 --> 01:46:28,942
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

1934
01:46:31,156 --> 01:46:33,624
It's a miracle.
I think we should all take a moment...

1935
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:36,352
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

1936
01:46:36,528 --> 01:46:38,519
And that we became friends
in the process...

1937
01:46:38,697 --> 01:46:40,927
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

1938
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,332
Should we touch each other's hands
while we do it? Okay.

1939
01:46:47,373 --> 01:46:48,806
I love you guys.

1940
01:46:48,974 --> 01:46:51,340
I love you dudes so much.

1941
01:46:54,246 --> 01:46:56,942
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

1942
01:46:57,816 --> 01:46:59,249
- Red?
- Red?

1943
01:46:59,418 --> 01:47:01,409
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

1944
01:47:01,587 --> 01:47:02,952
What's up, pal?

1945
01:47:03,856 --> 01:47:05,346
- Hey.
- Hey.

1946
01:47:05,524 --> 01:47:09,221
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

1947
01:47:09,395 --> 01:47:11,659
That's okay. We won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

1948
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:15,288
<i>- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's bubbe.</i>

1949
01:47:15,467 --> 01:47:17,560
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1950
01:47:17,736 --> 01:47:19,670
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

1951
01:47:19,838 --> 01:47:21,931
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

1952
01:47:22,107 --> 01:47:24,041
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

1953
01:47:24,209 --> 01:47:26,473
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

1954
01:47:26,645 --> 01:47:28,704
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

1955
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:31,907
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

1956
01:47:32,084 --> 01:47:33,949
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

1957
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:35,711
Blood from my ear just...

1958
01:47:35,888 --> 01:47:38,686
You guys smell like shit.

1959
01:47:39,892 --> 01:47:42,554
You are in serious danger.
