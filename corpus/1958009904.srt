00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,841
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,684
(upbeat music continues)

00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,622
(upbeat latin music)

(upbeat latin music continues)

13
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,770
(dramatic music)

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,805
(gun cocking)

15
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,306
(dramatic music)

16
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,675
- Man what the fuck dog, you ain't got to do this shit.

17
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,910
- [Rob] Shut the fuck up.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,211
- Give me the blow and I'll let you go man.

19
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,579
I'll pay you more I swear bro.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,914
- [Assassin] Hey bitch (indistinct)

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,848
- (indistinct)

22
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,782
You 525 come to the site man's

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,318
a hundred racks on that bitch.

24
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,853
- Please don't kill us man, you ain't gotta do this man.

25
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,055
Please, please don't kill us man, please.

26
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,125
- (all three victims pleading)

27
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,593
(gunshot firing) - No, mother fucker.

28
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,095
(gunshot firing)

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:35,929
(gunshot firing)

30
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,265
(Sky breathing heavily)

31
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,536
(upbeat music)

32
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,379
(upbeat music continues)

33
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,322
(upbeat music continues)

34
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,331

37
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,291
(upbeat music continues)

38
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,333
(upbeat music continues)

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,342
(upbeat music continues)

40
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,387
- [Sky's Inner voice] You ever been one of those people

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,355
on the outside looking in?

42
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,625
Thinking damn I wish I had their life,

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,361
not knowing what shit is really like.

44
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,299
Just because someone is always driving nice cars,

45
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,202
wearing designer clothes and looking good every day.

46
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,173
But it's just that, it looks good.

47
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,511
So you think it's all good but only the person on the inside

48
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,981
knew what it took and the bullshit one had to endure.

49
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,651
And you on the outside never knowing

50
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,321
how nasty shit can really get.

51
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,190
Some of those people on the inside wish

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,659
they could be on the outside with you looking in.

53
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,997
I know because I was one of them,

54
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,266
but I was Mitchell James' daughter

55
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,102
so being a hustler was in my DNA.

56
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,907
- You crazy ass bitch. - [Kathy] Really

57
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,610
- Dave, you couldn't find no other nigga to fuck with dude?

58
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,844
- Bitch. - [Kathy] Really?

59
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,012
- If you bring mother fucking ass on my porch,

60
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,213
I'm gonna fuck you up.

61
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,115
- Bitch not your porch, Dave's bitch

62
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,117
you could find no other nigga to mother fucking feed you.

63
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,952
Bitch if you wanted a threesome,

64
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,121
you could just fucking said that bitch.

65
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,022
- Hey, Stacey. - You could've

66
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,956
fucking said that.

67
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,157
- bring ain't no dog up here.

68
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,826
- (indistinct) What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,195
- You gotta flat ass anyways bitch.

70
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,330
- (indistinct) They love it and they love it and you're mad.

71
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,868
Bye hun, walk you like a dog, authority.

72
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,939
- Girl what could you and Stacy possibly be arguing about?

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,742
- Girl she mad at me because I'm fucking with Dave, right?

74
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,645
But like I told her, we was never friends, just neighbors.

75
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,614
Do not be mad at your ex nigga chose me, okay?

76
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,517
- Mm-mm, see that right there is what I'm not doing.

77
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,753
Argue with a bitch about a nigga.

78
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,022
Plus any man of mine would know better anyways.

79
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,256
- Period. - And I don't know why

80
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,658
you waste your time on that dumb ass girl.

81
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,259
You know she saucy because she think my daddy

82
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,261
had something to do with her daddy getting locked up.

83
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,764
- You need to ask her ass to share anything about the rumors

84
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,299
that somebody want to kill him.

85
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,668
Look Sky, I don't trust that bitch.

86
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,871
- Mm-mm, nah, she's not that stupid.

87
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,306
And ever since my uncle went back to Cuba,

88
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
my dad took over his businesses,

89
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,442
you know I've been hearing a lot of little hating ass shit.

90
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,778
But I let it slide, like you need to do.

91
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,113
- Not letting shit slide.

92
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,317
But, anyway, let's talk about that dope ass

93
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,952
18th birthday party you had girl.

94
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,154
- Aah yeah.

95
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,056
- You talk to that fine ass looking Ken yet?

96
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,658
- No, I haven't started talking yet, and you know my parents

97
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,427
definitely outdid themselves at that party.

98
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,594
But I'm supposed to be talking to Ken

99
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,330
later on when he get off work.

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,864
- Okay. - You know what's crazy?

101
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,334
Is that I never paid him any attention in school.

102
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,268
- He was a little weird.

103
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,502
- Hopefully a little weird.

104
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,737
- A little weird.

105
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,440
- But, I'm glad Juan brought his fine ass.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,274
Ah, (Sky laughing).

107
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,778
Anyway, you figure out what to eat 'cause I'm starving?

108
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,281
- Anywhere y'all wheels roll. I'm starving, let's hit it.

109
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,749
You so busy dealing with steak,

110
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,018
that I sit outside stretching looking for you.

111
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,220
- (indistinct) - (indistinct)

112
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,222
- You are so real, you know you asked me to go out

113
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,726
so we going out tonight, I can't wait-

114
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,427
- Look auntie, this is gonna be our last transaction.

115
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,429
- I'll call you right back.

116
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,831
What's going on now?

117
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,532
- Look I told you I got my own spot now.

118
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,834
I can't give you no more money.

119
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,869
- nigga I'm the one that took care of your ass

120
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
when your mom passed and if it wasn't for me,

121
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,974
your ass to be out on the mother fucking streets.

122
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:19,078
- Oh it's funny, auntie, but I ain't meet you till I was 14.

123
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,313
How we never moved here,

124
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,215
I probably would've never even known you.

125
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,649
I mean you just my dad's sister,

126
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,551
he died when I was what, 11?

127
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,753
So who are you really?

128
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,521
- So little nigga what you trying to say?

129
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,390
- I'm just saying you took care of them badass kids

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,624
that you ever took care of me.

131
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,927
With my money, my checks, my shit.

132
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,197
And you looking just fine, so here's your last thousand

133
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,900
'cause you dare try and be- (hand smacking)

134
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,668
- Please get your mother fucking hands down on my face,

135
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,203
you ain't that grown.

136
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,441
Yeah, thank you too, little gold mouth bitch ass nigga.

137
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,845
Fuck you thought this is? Talking about my badass kids.

138
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,516
(upbeat music)

139
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,292
(upbeat music continues)

140
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,964
(telephone ringing)

141
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,467
- [Sky] Hello. - Hey is this Sky?

142
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,102
- [Sky] Yeah, this is Sky.

143
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,504
- This is Ken. You wasn't busy was you?

144
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,406
- [Sky] No, I'm not busy.

145
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,774
- Cool, cool, cool.

146
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,144
Um, I was wondering if you wanted to

147
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,779
go grab a bite to eat sometime.

148
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,681
- [Sky] That would be nice. I can do it tomorrow.

149
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,784
- Oh, tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.

150
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,753
All right, I'll see you then.

151
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,754
- [Sky] Bye.

152
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,925
- So that was Ken.

153
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,929
He wanted to see if we could link up later

154
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,867
but I can't 'cause I have to see my parents off.

155
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,403
- You did tell him tomorrow though, right?

156
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,871
- Now you know I did.

157
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,909
Man this is about to be the first guy I ever talked to.

158
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,513
- Bless you, it really is.

159
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,484
But I mean when your daddy is Mitchell James aka Killer,

160
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,586
that'll be enough reasoning right there.

161
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,488
You know niggas are scared of him.

162
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,089
- I don't know about that.

163
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,525
When I introduced Ken to my poppy at the party,

164
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,394
he didn't seem nervous at all, which is a good thing.

165
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,697
- Okay.

166
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,598
- Anyway girl let me get up outta here,

167
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,266
you know how they get.

168
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,702
- I'll sail away girl.

169
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,636
- I'll call you later.

170
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,437
- All right girl call me.

171
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,138
- All right.

172
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:31,143
(car door slams) (car engine revving)

173
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,284
- Mommy, are you sure you don't want me to go to Cuba

174
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,752
with you and Poppy?

175
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,521
I mean I wanna meet dad's other side of the family too.

176
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,922
- Not this time baby girl.

177
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,891
We got some family business to take care of

178
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,158

You're are gonna be an accountant, right, right?

184
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,206

Miami, ain't that where all the young people go?

299
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,460
- I guess Sky, but your ass say anywhere

300
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,295
and you chose Miami?

301
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,765
We about to be like the rest of these ghetto bitches.

302
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,669
This is only like it's RV day, and Thought City Miami.

- Come on it won't take us on to get there

304
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,541
and I'm sure you will have us a ball in Thought City Miami.

305
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:14,213
- Look whatever, anyway, you talked to Ken?

306
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
- I did, and. - Mm-hmm.

307
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,489
- We were texting before I got here and we're linking up

308
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,724
and going out to eat later when I leave.

309
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,629
- Please tell me everything, I need to know what he's about

310
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,332
because I mean shit, he ain't talking much in school,

311
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,633
think that a little weird.

312
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,236
- Right?

313
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,539
Maybe that's why I never paid him any attention in school.

314
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,707
But you already know

315
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,943

00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,878
- Please do.

317
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,447
- For now, let me just make sure these books are straight.

318
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,518
(background traffic and hooting)

319
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,491
- (Sky indistinct) I'm gonna call you later.

320
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,261
- Don't forget you better call me girl.

321
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,130
- Don't forget you better call me girl.

322
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,135
♪ It's heavenly something like a melody ♪

323
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,140
♪ Time keeps on slowing down

324
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,710
(gentle music)

325
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,851
(gentle music continues)

326
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,455
- So, I had a taste for Chinese food

327
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,557
and this is my favorite restaurant.

328
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,092
- Okay.

329
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,595
- But unfortunately they don't have a good dining experience

330
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,232
so I figured we could just order it and have it here.

331
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,334
- Baby, I'm just happy you called me.

332
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,339
- Um, you know what's crazy? - What?

333
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:52,244
- We never talked in school and I never knew

334
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,079
that you and Juan were friends

335
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,548
until I seen y'all at the mall that day.

336
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,616
- Yeah, he cool.

337
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,353
The whole time I always had my eyes on you,

338
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,958
even though everybody would tell me how crazy your pops is,

339
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,992
baby, I ain't scared.

340
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,397
- Okay, first of all, my daddy is not crazy,

341
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,599
he just don't take no shit.

342
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,268
- I understand.

343
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,204
- But um, tell me more about you.

344
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,176
- Well I moved up here when I was 13, from Ohio.

345
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,780
It was me and my mama, She got a new job at the Ford plant,

346
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,149
thinking you know we make a better life

347
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,717
for ourselves and everything.

348
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,424
Two weeks later my little brother and my uncle, killed.

349
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,432
- Oh, I wasn't expecting that. I'm sorry.

350
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,268
- Don't be sorry.

351
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,140
- Well um, if you don't mind me asking,

352
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,510
how did they pass, and what about your dad?

353
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,847
- Nah, I don't mind at all, um.

354
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,751
My brother and my uncle bodies was never found.

355
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,553
But what would make you never return to your family

356
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,854
other than death, right?

357
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,592
My mama basically died from a heart attack,

358
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:15,961
she was heartbroken.

359
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,429
Pills and alcohol killed her.

360
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,501
And my dad, he was just a street nigga,

361
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,837
so that street shit killed him, you know how that go.

362
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,242
- Well at least you seem to be holding up okay.

363
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,279
- I mean, yeah, I got to stay with my auntie

364
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,082
until I graduated and then I was able to get

365
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,186
this trust fund my mama left for me and I went straight.

366
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,122
But you, you don't seen there no problems

367
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,023
living in this big ass house?

368
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,862
- Yeah, I mean I am a lot more fortunate than others my age,

369
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,498
but that's only because of my parents.

370
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,701
- When they coming back in here?

371
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,573
- I don't know, but um, when is our next date gonna be?

372
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,611
I know this probably seems pretty lame.

373
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,613
- Lame? Lame?

374
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,317
Baby ain't nothing about this lame.

375
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,888
Mija, it can be whenever you want it to be.

376
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,958
Whenever you want it to be.

377
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,694
(romantic music)

378
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,571
(romantic music continues)

379
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,547
(romantic music continues)

380
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,556
(romantic music continues)

381
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,598
(romantic music continues)

382
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,804
(telephone ringing)

383
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,373
- [Carla] What's up Sky?

384
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,209
- Hey Car, what ya doing?

385
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,311
- Girl eating this stale ass breakfast

386
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,879
my mama made, what's up?

387
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:19,985
- Hey um, I'm trying to get in touch with my parents.

388
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,487
Can you ask your mom if she's talked to my mom?

389
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,022
- Yeah, gimme one second.

390
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,693
Ma, Sky wants to know if you talk to her parents.

391
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,864
- Chica how many times I tell you stop yelling

392
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,466
through the house, huh?

393
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,736
And no I haven't, you know I called her yesterday

394
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,104
and she didn't answer.

395
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,873
Last I heard from her was three days ago.

396
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,209
Now you tell Sky that when she talks to her

397
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,511
she asks her to call me back, all right?

398
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,312
Gracias.

399
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,448
- (speaking in foreign language), Mommy.

400
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,849
- Now stop yelling.

401
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,753
- (speaking in foreign language)

402
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,821
- Yeah I heard her.

403
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,891
That's just so weird because they talk all the time.

404
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,394
- Girl you know she be always yelling and shit, God.

405
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,965
- Mm-hmm. (doorbell ringing)

406
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,533
Hey, I'm gonna hit you back,

407
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,503
somebody at the door, all right.

408
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,174
(shoes clanking on floor)

409
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,448
(intercom buzzing) (door creaking)

410
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,087
Uncle Don (indistinct) - Baby girl.

411
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,722
- What are you doing here?

412
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,723
- Hell yeah, how you been doing?

413
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,458
- Oh my God, good.

414
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,459
- Long five years.

415
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,327
- Yes it has.

416
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,132
Well wait uncle Don, if you're here

417
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,534
then where are my parents?

418
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,936
I thought they were in Cuba with you.

419
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,973
- That's why I'm here, let's have a seat.

420
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,711
- What's going on uncle Don? Where are my parents?

421
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,847
- Well you know, your parents weren't involved

422
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,683
in a really bad car accident.

423
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,618
- What?

424
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,821
- By the time the paramedics arrived,

425
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,158
the car burst into flames and they got stuck in.

426
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,393
(dramatic music) - Hell, no.

427
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,429
So you're telling me my parents are dead?

428
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,833
No, please tell me that's not what you're saying right now.

429
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,636
Uncle Don, please tell me that's not what you're saying.

430
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,507
No. No (Sky crying) - I'm here for you.

431
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:27,512
(dramatic music) (Sky crying continues)

432
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,620
(dramatic music continues)

433
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,625
- Hey uncle Don.

434
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,062
- Hey, hey baby girl, hey Carla, what's up?

435
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,099
Hey, Jackie should be here any minute now.

436
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,600
- My mom?

437
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,702
- Yeah, she's been a part of the family business

438
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,037
for many years.

439
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,338
- Never knew that.

440
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,942
- (Sky indistinct) (knocking on door)

441
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,711
- Hello, it's me, Jackie.

442
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,313
- Hey, what's going on Jack?

443
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,147
- Hey Mommy.

444
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,014
- Hello.

445
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:03,915
- Hey, how you doing?

446
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,150
- Hey auntie Jackie.

447
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,587
- Hey big girl, how you doing pretty girl?

448
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,655
- All right, so now since we got everybody here,

449
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,957
let's talk business.

450
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,425
- Okay.

451
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,395
- Sky, I know you thought your dad only had the car wash

452
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,330
and selling used cars,

453
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,866
but he also helped me manage my strip club as well.

454
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,904
- What, a strip club? He never mentioned that.

455
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,708
- It's never really a reason for him to mention that to you.

456
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,744
But the real money came from our clientele base,

457
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,814
it's just the rappers, athletes, politicians.

458
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,315
- So y'all pimped?

459
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,152
- Girl, ain't nobody no damn pimps.

460
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,923
- Definitely not pimps. And these women are not prostitutes.

461
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,626
I like to call 'em working professionals.

462
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,528
- Working professionals, prostitutes.

463
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,064
- So your mom and Jackie find a way to turn this into a very

464
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,301
lucrative business and our clients still need us.

465
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,604
Jackie will assist you with the rest.

466
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,673
(dramatic music)

467
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,608
- I mean, I don't know about this.

468
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,880
Do you think Carla and I can really handle all of this?

469
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,749
- Did you forget where you came from?

470
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,220
Little James I know we need help, never forget that.

471
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,689
I'm gonna stick around for a little while,

472
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,558
to make sure you damn runs smooth.

473
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,460
Aunt Jackie, take care of the rest.

474
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,131
- Don't worry girls, I'm gonna make sure you two run things

475
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,502
just as well as Stanley did (speaking foreign language)

476
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,271
(dramatic music)

477
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,114
(dramatic music continues)

478
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,122
(dramatic music continues)

479
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,158
- Are they really fucking serious?

480
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,795
They do know that we're only 18, right?

481
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,898
I mean, who's gonna listen to us?

482
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,199
- For the fake IDs that your uncle-

483
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,336
- Fuck those IDs. What about college?

484
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,173
(dramatic music continues)

485
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,410
What about my life? This is not what I had planned.

486
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,114
- Listen, first of all, you need to loosen up.

487
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:20,051
You're so uptight about everything, it's going to be okay,

488
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,555
literally, we've been through worse shit than this.

489
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:27,425
Now pull yourself together. We got shit to do.

490
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,398
- Right. I'm Mitchell James's daughter.

491
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,369
(dramatic music continues)

492
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,671
But mentally Car, I'm just not ready.

493
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,108
- Girl, as long as you got me you're good

494
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,743
and you got me forever.

495
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,512
Now, I think you need to come to this listener party

496
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,014
that these Detroit rapper just having,

497
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,650
it might help ease your my and loosen your ass up.

498
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,188
- Fine, anything's better than listening to this shit.

499
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,091
- Beau, now let's go find something sexy to wear,

500
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,526

505
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,142
- You had to get your lame ass get out the house.

506
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,645
- I mean, yeah, I guess it's a vibe in here.

507
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,381
- Girl, it's fucking slapping in here.

508
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,017
You don't see all these fine ass niggas?

509

510
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,089
- Bitch, even KD's are in here.

511
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,760
- I mean they're okay.

512
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,330
(upbeat music)

513
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,471
- I see how you looked at him, don't forget about Ken.

514
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,974
- Bitch, Ken is not my man.

515
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,208
- Yeah. - Yeah.

516
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,347
But um, I don't know, it's just something about him

517
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,248
that intrigues me.

518
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,184
- Probably 'cause he the only goofy ass nigga

519
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,418
in here with a suit on.

520
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,653
- No, you mean the only one in here

521
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,622
looking like a grown ass man,

522
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,624
- His ass sticking on like a sore thumb.

523
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,961
- Wait a minute, I think he about to walk over here.

524
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,795
- Think tall.

525
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,933
- How you ladies doing tonight?

526
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,468
- Bitch we're ladies?

527
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,739
- Uh, we're good. How are you?

528
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,174
- I'm doing good. I can't complain.

529
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,144
- You wanna have a seat? - Mm-hmm.

530
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,514
- Bitch, that's my cue, look, I'm about to go work the room.

531
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,349
I don't need none of these fine ass niggas

532
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,585
think I'm taken, so see you.

533
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,755
- Yo, she got jokes.

534
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,589
- I know, right?

535
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,860
- Yeah, oh my bad, let me introduce myself, I'm Mark.

536
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,631
- Uh, hi Mark, I'm Sky.

537
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,067
- Sky, and that's short for?

538
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,202
- Short for Skylar.

539
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,338
- Skylar, that's a pretty name,

540
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,041
I mean it matches your whole aesthetic.

541
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,176
(upbeat music)

542
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,779
Well I'm not from around here.

543
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,814
- I, I didn't think you were.

544
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,882
- Oh you gonna think of-

545
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,816
- No.

546
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:05,784
- Yeah, it's probably the suit.

547
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,252
- Yeah, definitely the suit.

548
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,287
- Yeah I'm from Cali though.

549
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,490
Look, you should put your number in my phone, keep in touch.

550
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,327
Don't forget to put the tongue emoji next to your name

551
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,996
so I know it's you when you call.

552
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,099
- Okay.

553
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:24,302
(upbeat music)

554
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,370
There you go.

555
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,207
- Sky, enough of this Christian mingle shit.

556
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,509
Excuse me Mr. Rico Suave nice meeting you.

557
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,045
Skylar get your ass up we're going to the dance floor.

00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
Let's go.

559
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,116

562
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,591
(upbeat music)

563
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,961

564
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,330
- (speaking in foreign language)

565
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,465
- Smells good in here.

566
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,701
- That's that good ass pig.

567
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,305
- Oh, you and my poppy are definitely brothers.

568
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,573
I don't think there was ever a time

569
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,708
where mama wasn't making him no pig.

570
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,044
- Yeah, that's my brother.

571
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,850
So how was last night?

572
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,519
- Oh it was great, I had a really good time,

573
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,354
really needed it.

574
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,623
- Well I'm glad you enjoyed yourself,

575
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,592
now it's time to get to business.

576
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,160
(dramatic music)

577
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,165
- Oh hold on, what about college?

578
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,005
- All work yourself out baby girl. Don't worry about it.

579
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
- Why do I have to take over the family business?

580
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,878
I mean, who's gonna listen to me?

581
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,849
- This is your future, you gonna make 'em listen.

582
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,854
(speaking in foreign language)

583
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:53,424
(dramatic music continues)

584
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,832
(dramatic music continues)

585
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:05,170
- Hey, you ever find out what happened to your pops?

586
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,974
- No and be honest, I haven't given it much thought

587
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,244
since he passed, why you ask?

588
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,915
- I was just wondering, what about your uncle

589
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,583
when he coming back?

590
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,857
- I don't know, I wish he would've never left.

591
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,861
- Ew, it's funny you say that

592
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:35,166
'cause I was thinking you got this big ass house,

593
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,568
I be up here all the time,

594
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,102
but why don't I just move in with you.

595
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,840
- Move in with me?

596
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,640
- Yeah.

597
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,846
- Um, you do know that Carla is here with me now.

598
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,415
(upbeat music)

599
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,653
And I mean, I don't know, I'm just not ready for that.

600
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,323
I know I'm doing a lot of things at my age

601
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,791
that someone would normally be doing,

602
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:04,596
but living with a man, I just don't see it, I'm sorry.

603
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,436
- Don't be sorry.

604
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,604
- I do love you though.

605
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,542
- I love you too my love. (lips smacking)

606
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,144
(upbeat music)

607
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,718
(shoes clanking on floor)

608
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,355
- Girl, your ass always on the phone. Get off the phone.

609
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,124
- Sure, handling business.

610
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:33,958
- Whatever.

611
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:40,164
- Anyway, what's up with this whole meeting today?

612
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,066
So this music video director, right?

613
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,603
He needs some girls and shit, we got plenty of girls.

614
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,474
- And they wanna use my uncle's hall?

615
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,109
- Yeah, that's why the meeting is there,

616
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,044
be killing two birds and one stone.

617
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,080
- Anybody famous?

618
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,349
- Just some local rappers.

619
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,119
- I was talking about the video director.

620
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,987
- God lee girl, can you just wait?

621
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,423
You the fucking hardest person to surprise.

622
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,158
Let's go. Come on.

623
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,929
- You better not be up to no shit Carla.

624
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,632
- It's (indistinct) and I'm always up to some shit.

625
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,803
- Hey ladies.

626
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,939
- Hey girl. - Good to see you.

627
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,041
- Your guest is in the office waiting for you

628
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:23,908
and he's fine too.

629
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,944
- You're so crazy.

630
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,446
- Ah fine, Carla, what is she talking about?

631
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,285
- Surprise, remember Mark?

632
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:40,358
- Yes, I remember Mark. But what is he doing here?

633
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,927
I thought we were having a meeting.

634
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:47,265
- We're having a meeting. He's the video director.

635
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,766
- What's up Sky?

636
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,935
Look, I know in all of our conversations

637
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,937
we never talked about our profession,

638
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,606
but when Carla mentioned your name, I knew it was you.

639
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,179
- No, we never talked about that.

640
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,449
And it's me. So um, come down to business.

641
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,585
- Well I'll leave y'all to it.

642
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,356
(upbeat music)

643
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,031
(upbeat music continues)

644
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,634
Look at you, you already working, thanks.

645
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,237
- Um, I could say the same for you.

646
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,874
- So why you stopped returning my calls?

647
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,111
I was hoping to see you again after your first visit.

648
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,647
- I told you I started talking to somebody

649
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,384
and it became serious, so that's why I stopped calling.

650
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,354
- So me being here is making you uncomfortable?

651
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,556
- You don't think you're moving too close?

652
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,759
- Not at all, you ain't have no problem with it

653
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,161
the first time I kissed you.

654
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,563
- Um Mark, Mark what are you doing?

655
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,166
(upbeat music)

656
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,909
(upbeat music continues)

657
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,918
(upbeat music continues)

658
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,322
- Aah, look, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, nice.

659
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,600
- Baby can I come down to the club with you tonight?

660
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,336
- Not tonight. Rob will be there.

661
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,704
- Well will I see you when you get off?

662
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:37,842
- We'll see. What about you, you work tonight?

663
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,977
- I'm off for the next couple of days.

664
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,214
- Mm-hmm, enjoy your next couple of days off babe.

665
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,019
Stacey, I'll call you.

666
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:48,853
- Okay?

667
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:56,527
- Mm-hmm. (Ken sighing)

668
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,098
(dramatic music)

669
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:05,036
(electronic beeps) (phone ringing)

670
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,505
- Hello Ken?

671
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,806
- Hey babe.

672
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,274
- Why haven't you been answering my calls?

673
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,509
I was worried about you.

674
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,413
- It was, I was at the club being disrespectful

675
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,614
to the girls last night, (Stacey laughing)

676
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,516
and I had to, I had to handle that.

677
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,320
But it is everything good now.

678
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,489
- Who is that?

679
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,556
- Who's what?

680
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,461
- Thought I heard somebody's voice in the background.

681
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,498
- You just go ahead and get yourself together.

682
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,666
- I will baby. I love you.

683
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,536
- Bye.

684
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,305
(dramatic music)

685
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,811
(phone thuds on table)

686
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,414
(dramatic music continues)

687
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,618
Nah, he wouldn't do that to me.

688
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,188
(dramatic music continues)

689
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,760
- Keep your voice down, huh? Hmm?

690
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,562
You think that Carla whipped your ass,

691
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,464
bitch, I will kill you.

692
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,735
(Ken laughing)

693
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,537
Go dry your fucking face off.

694
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,438
(dramatic music)

695
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,275
(Stacey crying)

696
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,646
(dramatic music continues)

697
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,549
(Sky humming)

698
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,050
(door creaking)

699
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,884
- Hey girl.

700
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,718
- Hey.

701
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,986
(door slams)

702
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,688
- What's up? You gimme some?

703
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,758
- No ma'am, and I'm sure your greedy ass party ate anyway.

704
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:34,825
- Twice.

705
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,693
- Oh, (indistinct).

706
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:42,400
- Anyway, what's up? - Um.

707
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,138
Before we get down to business,

708
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:51,142
I need to clear my mind of a few things. Nothing about you.

709
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,312
- All right, what's up?

710
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,984
- So remember when I went to California,

711
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,120
I never told you that I slept with Mark.

712
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,724
- You never said anything

713
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,759
but I kind of just put it together,

714
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,528
you came back all glowy and shit.

715
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,497
Why did he do something?

716
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,836
- Nothing. I mean nothing like that.

717
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,273
Remember when we first started talking,

718
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,209
Ken and I weren't serious so it didn't matter.

719
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,645
But since he's been in town, he's been pressing me.

720
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:32,450
And yesterday we had sex, then I had to go home.

721
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,951
I had sex with Ken too.

722
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,620
(Carla coughing)

723
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,321
- Which I felt like a whole whore.

724
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:43,227
- Skylar James, now that's fucked up. Ain't no way girl.

725
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,129
You should have said it was on your period,

726
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,131
you wasn't in the mood, something.

727
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,332
'Cause there ain't no way,

728
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,668
I'm fucking two niggas in one night.

729
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,137
And I pray you didn't have to give them both head

730
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,673
because I know your jaws is tired, girl.

731
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,843
(Carla laughing) - Whatever.

732
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,678
- What are you gonna do about Mark?

733
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,983
- I don't know. I mean I like Mark.

734
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,288
He's the total opposite of Ken, more professional,

735
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,693
just like a grown man, I mean you get it?

736
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,230
But I am in love with Ken though.

737
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,331
- Woo.

738
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,800
- But I'm attracted to Mark.

739
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,872
- Since it sound like you got some decisions to make,

740
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,508
there's nothing wrong with exploring your options.

741
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,077
I mean, hell, Ken has been your only boyfriend.

742
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,713
You've got some decisions to make,

743
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,648
but it's one that I can't make for you.

744
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,085
- Yeah, I feel you.

745
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:47,291
But anyways, I have to meet up with Mark again

746
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,128
to finish the video, but I really don't wanna go.

747
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,232
Can you please, please, please go?

748
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,468
I gotta flight to catch in two hours.

749
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,637
Did you forget we have business in Chicago?

750
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:05,943
- Yes, I forgot. Tell old faithful Tim I say hello.

751
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,880
- Will do, oh, don't worry about coming to get me,

752
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,382
Dave is gonna come pick me up.

753
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,752
- Dave, that took my best friend.

754
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,324
- Sky, look, we locked in forever, okay?

755
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,960
(dramatic music)

756
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,794
- Okay.

757
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:24,995
- Ti amo, besty.

758
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,200
- Ti amo, besty.

759
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,570
(shoes clanking on floor)

760
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,939
- Thank you for always being there for me.

761
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,575
- No problem, I got you forever, okay?

762
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,810
- Okay. - Now fix your face.

763
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,482
Put a smile on it, there you go. I wanna see you tomorrow.

764
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,983
- You act like you not gonna see me again

765
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,418
or something, girl.

766
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,587
- Cheer up. See you later.

767
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,022
- See you.

768
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,792
(dramatic music)

769
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,430
Hmm, it's not even good.

770
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,435
(dramatic music) (cutlery clanging)

771
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,741
- [Waitron] Would you guys like anything else?

772
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,575
- No, thank you.

773
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,310
- [Waitron] Enjoy it.

774
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,784
- So what you see in this dude?

775
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,218
- That's none of your business?

776
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,887
- I mean, I'm just saying he don't look like

777
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,588
he could do what I can do for you.

778
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,357
Damn sure don't look like he can take care of you

779
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,827
the way I do, I mean he just look like

780
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,631
some old street nigga, don't even seem like your type.

781
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,300
I mean I could be wrong but that just what I see.

782
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,672
- First off, I make and have my own money

783
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,810
and I don't need a man to take care of me.

784
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,179
And so what if he is a nigga from the streets?

785
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,081
He's mine, and I'm gonna stick beside him.

786
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,852
Know, I should've went home.

787
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,320
- Hey, listen, listen, listen.

788
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,591
I just knew I wanted you from the first time I saw you.

789
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,860
You can't tell me that connection wasn't real.

790
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,863
I mean, you left California

791
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,665
and I just knew you would come back.

792
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,502
- Sorry I didn't come back.

793
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,104
- Yeah, me too.

794
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,343
You mind following me to the rental spot

795
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,811
and take me back to my hotel?

796
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,914
- Yeah, I can do that.

797
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,617
- Let's go.

Sky, what's wrong?

820
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,800
- She's gone.

- Who's gone?

822
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,235
- She's gone right.

823
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,337
- Who is gone?

824
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,906
- Carla, somebody killed Carla.

00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,144
(dramatic music continues)

826
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,146
And her fiance.

827
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:36,981
- Fuck.

828
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,784
- They we're both shot inside of a car.

829
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,554
- Baby, baby I'm so sorry, come here, come here.

830
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,757
- (Sky crying) No.

831
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,526
I have to go Mark, I to get out here, I have to go.

832
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,962
- Listen, listen, be careful.

833
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:56,233
Keep me informed about anything, you hear me?

834
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,303
- Yeah. - Sorry.

835
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,974

- Yes, I would really like a cremation.

842

(indistinct background noise)

844
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,692

I mean, honestly, with Carla gone now,

846
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,629
I really need to keep busy.

847
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,499
- It's, it's a crazy world we live in baby girl.

848
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,934
- [Radio] Reception.

849
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:08,372
With Carla being gone, I won't be here too much longer.

850
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,907
Least you can rely more on Rob.

851
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,576
I also considered talking to Ken

852
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,378
about the flip side of the business.

853
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,117
- I don't think that's a good idea uncle Don.

854
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:23,087
I mean, I just feel like giving him all of that power

855
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:27,024
will make me forever connected to him.

856
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,159
- Well if you wanna stay in this business,

857
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,661
you gotta find somebody other than yourself

858
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,129
that you can trust.

859
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,033
I won't be around too much longer. I gotta go back to Cuba.

860
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,804
Think about it, if you wanna keep this thing going,

861
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,806
I trust you can do that.

862
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,311

00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,955
(plastic rustling)

884
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,565
(bed creaking)

885
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,334
(hand tapping)

886
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,036
Change your clothing a little bit.

887
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:29,506
- Everybody going it?

888
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,110
- Yeah my uncle Don and auntie Jackie

889
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,511
are down in kitchen talking.

890
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,050
And I need to talk to you about the business.

891
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,653
But it can wait, I just wanna try and get some sleep.

892
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:46,023
- Okay, yeah, yeah, let's, let's talk after take a nap.

893
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,829
- So considering everything we've been through,

894
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:53,730
how y'all feeling?

895
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,334
- I'm good. - I'm chilling.

896
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,104
- That's good, so I'm pretty sure Sky mentioned

897
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,006
she wanted to talk business with you.

898
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,107
- She did. She did.

899
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,011
- So Carla being gone, she needs somebody she can trust.

900
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,280
You've been around for a minute

901
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,782
so I'm hoping that can be you.

902
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,952
- You can definitely trust me sir,

903
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,386
I feel good help is on.

904
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,524
- I hope we can too, and I trust

905
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:24,528
that you won't disappoint me, or Sky.

906
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,133
- I won't, you made the right decision,

907
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,501
thank you, for trusting me.

908
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,944

- Hi uncle Don, I'm good, how are you?

913
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,561
Yeah um, I was wondering if you talked to Rob?

914
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,465
I'm trying to fly to California,

915
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,966
but I can't get in touch with him

916
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,869

Having fun?

929
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:48,445
- Dance, so not serious, just a little dance.

930
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,614

932
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,184
- I came by 'cause I haven't been here in a while

933
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,186
so I was coming to check on things.

934
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,355
- Okay.

935
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,890
- Who are they?

936
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,893
- They just friends from the neighborhood, that's all.

937
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,362
- You never mentioned them before.

938
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,564
- Well wasn't no need to mention it baby.

939
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,935
Look it's always been about me and you, come here, sit down.

00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,743
- No, not since yesterday.

944
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,647
(upbeat rap music continues)

945
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,916
- Oh, I'll see you at home.

946
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:31,088
- Okay bro, I'll see you later then.

947
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,323
- That's your girl bro?

948
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,491
- You know me.

949
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:39,496

961
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,864
(Sky screaming)

962
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,404
- Get the fuck up, bitch.

963
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,040
(Sky screaming continues) Get up.

964
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,708
- What the fuck is going on?

965
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,677
(indistinct) Get the fuck off of me.

966
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,846
- I never meant to hurt you like this, Sky.

967
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,514
See once I found out you was fucking that nigga

968
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,349
you was doing business with,

969
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,751
I knew you didn't even give a about me.

970
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,020
So why should I give a about you, Sky?

971
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,458
You ran in here that night, straight to the shower.

972
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,094
I thought how strange 'cause she ain't never did that one.

973
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,230
I went to pick up your clothes for you

974
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,066
and low and fucking behold I smelled that nigga cologne

975
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,067
all over bitch.

976
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,102
(hand smacking) Hmm?

977
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,905
Sit your ass up. (Sky crying)

978
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:33,143
I thought, not my Sky, it's only one of my favorite bitches

979
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,745
you've had at that video shoot, only confirmed it.

980
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,918
See Sky, I'm about to give you every grimy detail.

981
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,854
(gunshot firing)

982
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,389
(gunshot firing)

983
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,993
- You know, mentally, supposed the feel of pain I endure

984
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,729
when your bitch ass daddy killed my brother

985
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,998
and my fucking uncle.

986
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,734
(gunshot firing)

987
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,669
- Hey Mitch, help me clean this shit up.

988
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,873
- Don't even say shit, don't say shit.

989
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,909
(dramatic music)

990
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,511
That look on your face, that stupid ass fucking

991
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,248
look on your face, just tell me you do.

992
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,883
(Sky crying continues)

993
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:17,153
My brother was only 17 and my uncle was just like my daddy.

994
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,358
Your father's the reason I don't have fucking.

995
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,892
(Sky gasping)

996
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,461
Your father's the reason I don't have a family, Sky.

997
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,363
(dramatic music)

998
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,897
And you know how the streets talk,

999
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,068
and I was just praying, praying deals wrong,

1000
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,070
when they said you was his fucking daughter.

1001
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:40,176
But hey luckily for me they tripped to Cuba, did the job.

1002
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:44,347
I thought maybe I ain't have to be the one behind your pain.

1003
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,417
But then, you had this best friend Carla

1004
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,918
and then this uncle Don,

1005
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,720
this family business bullshit, shit.

1006
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,623
(hand smacking) (Sky crying)

1007
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:58,628
(dramatic music) (Sky gasping)

1008
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:06,970
And Stacey, that damn Stacey, see, she would do anything

1009
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,709
for some good dick, and to think that I made love to her.

1010
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:16,780
(dramatic music continues)

1011
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,416
You and Carla really fucked that girl up that night.

1012
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,620
That just made it easier for her to fall in my plan.

1013
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,825
Mm-hmm, Carla was in the way.

1014
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,428
(gunshot firing) (gunshot firing)

1015
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,029
And as long as she's in my way,

1016
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,931
I'd never be the one you could fight her then,

1017
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,500
never be part of this family fucking business.

1018
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,604
And it was all that to me, for the death of my family.

1019
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,972
And that's how I fucking fell.

1020
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,175
(hand smacking) (dramatic music continues)

1021
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,743
(Sky crying)

1022
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:50,347
(dramatic music continues)

1023
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,387
(Sky gasps)

1024
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,590
- Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, uh-uh Sky.

1025
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,758
Sky, baby.

1026
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,927
(Sky crying)

1027
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,429
No, I ain't mean to make you sick to your stomach.

1028
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,465
(hand smacking) (Sky screaming)

1029
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,566
Fuck this bitch.

1030
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,067
(dramatic music continues)

1031
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:15,405
Get up, get up, get up (Sky crying)

1032
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,273
Go clean your mother fucking face up.

1033
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:19,976
(door slams)

1034
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,878
- Shit bro, where we taking our arrest?

1035
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,380
- To the spot where else?

1036
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,417
(dramatic music continues)

1037
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,351
(Sky sniffing)

1038
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,921
(dramatic music continues)

1039
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,460
(Ken indistinct)

1040
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,896
- Are we're really done with shit.

1041
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,500
(dramatic music continues)

1042
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,703
- Where are we going now Ken?

1043
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,507
(dramatic music continues)

1044
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,842
Is it really that bad that I deserve this?

1045
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:58,114
I mean I understand that you thinking that my dad

1046
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,816
has something to do with the death of your uncle

1047
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:04,087
and your brother, but why do this to me?

1048
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,124
- I really did love you Sky.

1049
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,193
(dramatic music continues)

1050
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,195
And this was never my intention for you, I.

1051
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,498
I just wonder what belonged to me.

1052
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,234
And if that meant taking over the business

1053
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:21,704
from the man that destroyed my fucking life, so be it.

1054
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,607
You was good to me bitch.

1055
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,010
Til' you brought that nigga in the picture

1056
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,344
and started fucking.

1057
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,514
(dramatic music continues)

1058
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,750
So what about me then? Huh?

01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:25,548
- I'm good.

1233
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:27,550
- Don't touch anything.

1234
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,417
- What's your sign?

1235
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,719
- Tell me.

1236
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,488
(dramatic music)

1237
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,392
(hand smacking)

1238
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,928
- You was really gonna snitch on me bitch?

1239
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,429
You really gonna snitch bitch?

1240
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,932
You should be fucking sorry.

1241
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,536
(Stacey crying) (dramatic music)

1242
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:51,007
- Well now, what the fuck are you doing, you stupid bitch?

1243
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,242
- I'm so sorry.

1244
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:57,046
- (indistinct) - (indistinct)

1245
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:01,751
(dramatic music continues) (Stacey crying)

1246
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,820
Quit all that crying bullshit please.

1247
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,921
Should have thought about that shit

1248
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,323
before you did what you did.

1249
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:14,630
I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?

1250
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,332
- I don't know.

1251
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,568
I I told Ken my conscience was getting to me

1252
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,704
and, and I was gonna go to the police

1253
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,339
and he brought me here.

1254
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,375
I don't wanna die.

1255
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,212
- You don't wanna die.

1256
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,582
Bitch, do you think Carla wanted to die?

1257
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,987
So why should I give a fuck about you dying?

1258
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,190
(dramatic music continues)

1259
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,293
- Tell me was the dick really that good

1260
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,063
that you would sell your soul to the devil?

1261
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,299
'Cause it wasn't for me, Bitch, I will kill you.

1262
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,939
If it wasn't for the situation we're in right now.

1263
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,576
But I have to get outta here alive.

1264
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:03,079
So let's make that our focus for now.

1265
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,415
- Understood.

1266
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:14,557
- Now tell me what he has planned.

1267
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,692
- I don't know, he just said

1268
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,561
the family business belongs to him now.

1269
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,563
- Fucking idiot.

1270
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,066
He does know my uncle's still alive, right?

1271
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,634
- I don't know.

1272
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:29,205
(dramatic music continues)

1273
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,309
- Stacey before we die in this room,

1274
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,612
I'm not going down without a fight.

1275
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,748
So I suggest you do the same.

1276
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,352
(dramatic music continues)

1277
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,021
Now untie me.

1278
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,524
(dramatic music continues)

1279
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,259
Hurry up stupid bitch untie me.

1280
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,228
- Just don't hurt me.

1281
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,530
- Stacey dammit, hurry up.

1282
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,100
(dramatic music continues)

1283
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,042
(dramatic music continues)

1284
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:17,186
- Mm-mm. What the fuck, what the fuck is that?

1285
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,491
- Chicken tenders from Mighty Wings.

1286
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,094
- Well don't want that nasty ass shit.

1287
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,362
- Fuck it then.

1288
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,002
Anyway, you spoke with Don yet?

1289
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,437
Know it's been a couple days.

1290
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,874
Know he ain't spoke to Sky either.

1291
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,943
- Now how the fuck would I hear from him?

1292
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:45,181
You ain't got this shit figured out yet, do you?

1293
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,918
You supposed to be a mother fucking gangster.

1294
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,987
Man, you're a stupid mother fucker.

1295
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,791
- Stupid mother fucker.

1296
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,394
(Ken laughing)

1297
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,833
You mother fuckers, you must got shit confused.

1298
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,970
I'm running this shit now. It's my shit.

1299
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,306
(gun thuds)

1300
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,642
(gun thuds)

1301
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:21,584
- Yeah, you hit like a bitch.

1302
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:22,685
- Like a bitch.

1303
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,020
(gun thuds)

1304
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:27,556
(gun thuds)

1305
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,126
(dramatic music continues)

1306
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:40,135
(dramatic music continues)

1307
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,144
(dramatic music continues)

1308
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:58,153
(dramatic music continues)

1309
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,324
Fuck, she really fucking pregnant.

1310
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,762
(dramatic music continues)

1311
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,430
- So bro, you good?

1312
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:12,268
Yeah, you been over there quiet for a minute.

1313
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,136
- Yeah, I'm good.

1314
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,872
- Yeah, I'm about to make some chicken real quick.

1315
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:20,242
- So bring me a shot of that wings,

1316
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,011
and some of that chicken.

1317
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,614
(dramatic music continues)

1318
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,353
(dramatic music continues)

1319
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,455
And take them some water back there too.

1320
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,957
- All right bro, got you.

1321
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:35,891
- I've been waiting all night for them to get here

1322
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,393
so we can figure this shit out.

1323
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,028
- Yeah man, just tell me when they get here bro,

1324
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,829
I'm gonna keep on this down.

1325
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:44,433
(dramatic music continues)

1326
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,738
- Sky, do you think you'll ever be able to forgive me?

1327
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,140
And what do you think is gonna happen to me

1328
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,508
when we get outta here?

1329
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,709
If we get outta here.

1330
01:11:56,045 --> 01:12:00,949
- Bitch, like I already told you, I don't give a fuck.

1331
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,988
Should have thought about that

1332
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,723
before you did the shit that you did.

1333
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:14,730
Now please stop talking to me about it

1334
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,032
before you make me depressed, like you.

1335
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:23,372
And I'm a soldier, not some weak ass civilian.

1336
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:28,377
(dramatic music) (knocking on door)

1337
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,580
- Shit, about time I think.

1338
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,451
(dramatic music continues)

1339
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:40,456
(door slamming) (gunshots firing)

1340
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,559
- Where the fuck is Sky?

1341
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,062
- Sky in the back, key in my right pocket.

1342
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,897
- Then gimme the fucking key, nigga.

1343
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,035
- Shit. - (indistinct) fuck off.

1344
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,871
(dramatic music continues)

1345
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,740
- Oh gracias (speaking in foreign language).

1346
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:01,276
- Poppy? Poppy!

1347
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,312
All right, not here baby girl.

1348
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,747
I'll explain everything to you later.

1349
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,315
Poppy gotta get you outta here.

1350
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,983
- Hello, what is she doing right there?

1351
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,918
- I am so sorry.

1352
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,820
- Come on, we gotta go, we gotta go.

1353
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,657
(dramatic music continues)

1354
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:19,428
(shoes clanking on stairway)

1355
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,700
(dramatic music continues)

1356
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,206
- Got his body in the fucking basement.

1357
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,477
Get him up and get him out here.

1358
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,311
- You got it boss.

1359
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,746
- Now!

1360
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:41,150
(dramatic music continues) (Mitchell screaming)

1361
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,753
(dramatic music continues)

1362
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,058
Both of you outside.

1363
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,629
(dramatic music continues)

1364
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,465
- Where are we going, Poppy?.

1365
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:59,201
- Home, Lovell, clean this shit up.

1366
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,671
(dramatic music continues)

1367
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,844
(dramatic music continues)

1368
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,345
Come on, hurry up.

1369
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,649
Have a seat next to them. Everyone have a seat.

1370
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,757
- Where's my phone at you piece of shit?

1371
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,325
(hand smacking)

1372
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:27,429
- Hmm, hmm, it's in my front pocket, maybe.

1373
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,263
- Fuck that.

1374
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,435
- Sit the fuck down nigga.

1375
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,104
(hand smacking)

1376
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,144
Look first, let me apologize to you Sky,

1377
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,680
by having you believe your mother and I were deceased

1378
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,882
and putting you through hell.

1379
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:50,752
We knew a few weeks before leaving

1380
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,788
someone was after my head.

1381
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,323
Now we thought about taking you with us

1382
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,192
but didn't want you to have to leave this life you had here.

1383
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:00,662
So we figured if we faked our deaths you'd be okay.

1384
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,665
And your uncle Don would've made sure that.

1385
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,134
And we knew the person was related to one of the dudes

1386
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,236
we did business with.

1387
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,439
But it wasn't until now that we knew who,

1388
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,209
if I would've seen this coming,

1389
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,444
I would've listened to your mother

1390
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,679
let go all this shit and took you with us.

1391
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:25,053
- Do you have any idea what this bitch put me through?

1392
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,455
How could you have possibly thought

1393
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,023
that any of this would be okay?

1394
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,392
I don't know whether to hate you

1395
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,127
or to love you at this point.

1396
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,797
I coulda still had my best friend.

1397
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,036
Oh, that's right, y'all don't know.

1398
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,371
You wanna tell them Stacey?

1399
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,874
- What would Stacey have to do with anything.

1400
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,676
- That's the same shit I wanna know.

1401
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:53,248
- This bitch and this nigga Ken, killed Carla.

1402
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,953
Yeah, she was ready to snitch on his ass too.

1403
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,756
That's why she was locked up in that room with me,

1404
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,090
but she wasn't there long enough

1405
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,126
to get pimped out like I did.

1406
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:07,496
- The fuck you mean?

1407
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,298
(hand smacking)

1408
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,233
You tricking my daughter mother fucker?

1409
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,668
- Bro, whoa, whoa, whoa chill out, chill.

1410
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,003

1412
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,407
- Stop.

1413
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,911
Please let me be the one to deal with him.

1414
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:30,619
I told you I was pregnant, but you didn't believe me.

1415
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,522
And I know you looked in the trash too

1416
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,192
so I know you know that it's true.

1417
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,496
You don't even deserve to breathe.

1418
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,567
(hand smacking)

1419
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:49,137
(dramatic music continues)

1420
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,708

1421
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,409
under these circumstances, as you know,

1422
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,878
this is not the outcome I had intended.

1423
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,247
- You damn right about that.

1424
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:00,849
Not can't believe y'all had me believing

1425
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,884
my best friend was dead.

1426
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:05,854
She mustn't give a fuck about my child's funeral

1427
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,155
or the friendship.

1428
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,393
And to think, y'all didn't trust me enough

1429
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,528
to let me know what was going on, me.

1430
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:18,333
I am pissed (speaking in foreign language)

1431
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,835
- (speaking in foreign language), okay?

1432
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,604
Now she'll be back when all this fucking shit is over.

1433
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,272
It was best for everybody, Jackie.

1434
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,842
- Yeah, if you say so, Mitchell.

1435
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,680
I just need to see the bitch that kill my baby.

1436
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,483
That is it. That is all.

1437
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,618
- She's in the basement locked up with Ken.

1438
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,153
- Hey, maybe we should get the mother fuckers

1439
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,689
some water or something

1440
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,358
- (speaking in foreign language) You of all people

1441
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,028
should know stray dogs don't get fed.

1442
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,497
And Nico, what do you plan to do with Rob's body?

1443
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:51,967
- I'm have him cremated ,

1444
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,403
and then I'm gonna take him home with me.

1445
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,939
- Okay, just let me know if there's anything else you need.

1446
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,610
- Look, I'm just ready to get this shit over with.

1447
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:06,815
(speaking in foreign language), Nico.

1448
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,083
- See him (speaking foreign language)

1449
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,618
- Wait, wait, wait, what are you talking about?

1450
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,354
- Mitch, I got this.

1451
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,791
Okay now Sky here, asked me for a personal favor

1452
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,693
and being that that's the mother fucker responsible

1453
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,594
for me not having a brother right now,

1454
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,398
I'm gonna have fun filling her request.

1455
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:28,804
- And I am too, we have everything we need.

1456
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,742
- But first, let Nico and I take care of Ken.

1457
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,813
- Sky, you sure about that?

1458
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,115
- Just as sure as when you left me for a year.

1459
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,519

01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,534
shut the fuck up.

1468

Oh, and don't worry,

You're not putting that shit in my mouth

1477
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,542

(dramatic music continues)

1481
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,326
- Is he still breathing?

1482
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,500
- Barely, but still just enough life in him

1483
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:39,734
for you to take away.

1484
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:45,707
- Good, now he can watch exactly what auntie Jackie

1485
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,776
is about to do to Stacey.

1486

- You mind if I come with you?

- You can, but I'm not sure if you ready for this.

1491
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:06,528

- I'm so sorry, please forgive me, I'm sorry.

1498
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,352

(Stacey crying)

1501
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,761
- You should have really done your research.

1502
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,030
Yeah, research would've told you,

1503
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,267
you were with the wrong familia baby girl.

I mean, we really love it, it's so beautiful.

1519
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,250
- No baby, thank you for forgiving your mother and I

1520
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,753
because for a moment I didn't even think you were.

1521
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:16,124
- Yeah, for a moment I didn't think I would either,

1522
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,127
but I know that you and Mommy

1523
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,196
thought you were doing what was best for me.

1524
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,030
(baby cooing)

1525
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,332
Dumb decision, bye.

1526
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:32,807
But I do understand.

1527
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,343
- Yeah, definitely one of the dumbest decisions

1528
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,478
I could have ever made.

1529
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:43,084
- I mean, but the best thing to come out of this, is Storm.

1530
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,289
- Yeah, my granddaughter for sure is something special.

1531
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,158
- [Sky] Yeah, she should be asleep soon.

1532
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,261
- Yeah, I'm sure the car ride wore her out.

1533
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,063
But I think it's time for us to go Papa,

1534
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,664
I mean I think we should leave.

1535
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,333
- Wait, no,

1536
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,235
I thought your flight didn't leave until the morning.

1537
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,469
- It doesn't, but (speaking foreign language)

1538
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,538
Papa, we're gonna go stay at a hotel.

1539
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,573
You got a new baby, you got a new family,

you got a new house, mija, enjoy it.

1541
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,247
- I mean Mommy, Poppy you could have stayed a little longer.

1542
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:15,316
- No, your mother's right, we stayed long enough.

1543
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:19,888
We'll be back soon and I hope you enjoy your new office.

1544
