1
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,256
I'm here to see Rod McCain.

2
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,264
Willa Weston.

3
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:15,636
I'm not gettin' an answer.

4
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,072
You'll have to wait, ma'am.

5
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:21,236
I'm starting work here today,
and I can't be late.

6
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,143
Can I help?

7
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:24,806
I don't think so.

8
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:27,510
Could you try Mr. McCain's assistant
again, please?

9
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,849
I already did, ma'am.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,013
You sure I can't help?

11
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:34,319
Am I not on the list?

12
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:38,021
Don't worry, Bill. I'll take her up.
She's from the White House.

13
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,461
Whateveryou say, Mr. McCain.

14
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,731
Vince McCain. I'm the son.

15
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:47,896
This way. You are?

16
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:51,933
Willa Weston.
I'm here to manage WOCT networks.

17
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,943
And you are vice president
ofmarketing.

18
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:57,708
Yes, but mostly I just
wait for my father to die.

19
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,113
What was that thing
about the White House?

20
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:03,710
I wasjust changing
his perception ofthe situation.

21
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,722
First law ofmarketing.

22
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,352
So, what would you like to know about
the most powerful man alive?

23
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:17,592
Around here, he's known
as '' Rod Almighty.''

24
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:21,630
Wait right here.

25
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,469
He called me.

26
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,203
I'll be right out.
He called me.

27
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,280
Hi, Neville. How's it going?

28
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:33,407
Rod's busy.

29
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,475
Yes. Yes.

30
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,688
Oh, yeah! Oh, God.

31
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:42,385
Oh, God. Oh, yes!

32
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,797
I did it. I did the deal.

33
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,630
One-four-five?

34
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:54,535
One-three-bloody-eight. Hit me.

35
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,039
You bloody beauty!

36
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,543
Way to go, Dad! We did it again!

37
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,570
- Oh, it's you.
- Dad, can I introduce--

38
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,774
I don't have time.
I'm late for the finance meeting.

39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,613
- But, Dad--
- Shut up.

40
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,710
- What do we do about Detroit?
- Close it.

41
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:10,879
It's done.

42
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,624
Call me Rod.

43
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,494
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

44
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:24,159
- Dad, I'd like to introduce--
-Just signed a beautiful deal.

45
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,669
Alliance Leisure, U.K.
The sweetest part is...

46
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,297
I snatched it from under the nose
ofthat bastard Murdoch.

47
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,307
- What are the crownjewels?
- Northeast Television...

48
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,865
and Great British Publishing.

49
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:37,141
There's a film distribution company,
1 4 multiplexes, some bingo halls--

50
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:41,048
- Three ice rinks, a crematorium--
- Nice little owner, that, and a zoo.

51
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:43,052
- A zoo?
- Yep.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,247
Gotta go, Willa. Finance meeting.

53
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:49,656
Back, Neville. So, make a lot
ofmoney for me at--

54
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,492
- WOCT.
- Sorry.

55
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,998
- What?
- Sold it this morning.

56
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't worry.
We'll find something forya.

57
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,002
Talk toyou later.

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,174
- That's it?
- That's Dad.

59
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:07,176
- You mean I don't have ajob?
- Look, Willa--

60
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,270
- I just gave up a vice presidency.
- No worries, Willa.

61
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,043
We've got lots ofjobs.
We're always expanding.

62
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,483
Neville, check our liability
on the Detroit pension rights.

63
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:18,454
- Righto.
- Vince, go away.

64
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,516
- Where are my grapes?
- I'm sorry, Mr. McCain.

65
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,755
I wanted grapes!

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,491
It was a natural mistake.

67
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,863
I wanted grapes. Get the fruit.

68
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,874
- What's going on at that zoo?
- What zoo?

69
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:40,911
The oneyoujust acquired
in Britain.

70
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,242
We put in a guy from Octopus TV,
Hong Kong.

71
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:46,010
Hard-nosedlittle Chinesebastard
calledLee.

72
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,484
He usedtobein the Hong Kongpolice.
SpeaksgoodEnglish, but--

73
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:52,488
- Big cats over there, right?
- Yes.

74
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:55,457
And small mammal house there.

75
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:58,290
- That's right.
- Good.

76
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,296
Mammals.

77
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,855
Haveyou any background in animals?

78
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,663
Well, I've eaten a lot, you know.
Sorry.Joke.

79
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,529
Good evening.

80
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,115
Now, for those ofyou who have
not met meyet, my name is Rollo Lee...

81
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:25,588
and as ofyesterday morning,
I have assumed command ofthis zoo...

82
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:30,559
and I shall be reporting to our new
owners, Octopus, Inc., ofAtlanta.

83
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:35,128
Now, Octopus, ofcourse,
is owned by Mr. Rod McCain, who...

84
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,135
as I'm sureyou were aware,
is a remarkable man.

85
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:42,536
Starting with his father's
radio stations in New Zealand...

86
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:45,734
he has built up a global empire...

87
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:49,939
currentlyworth more than
six billion dollars...

88
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,879
and growing.

89
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,577
How much does he want in the end?

90
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:56,176
Yeah.

91
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:59,620
- What ?
- How much bigger does he wanna get?

92
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,158
Well, there aren't any limits.
He wants growth.

93
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:04,990
Presumably, he's aware
of Dr. E.F. Schumacher's...

94
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,896
concept oflimited resources or,
asJean-Paul Sartre puts it--

95
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,230
Any sensible questions? Yes.

96
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:13,896
- Areyou going to close the zoo?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,167
I'm very glad you asked me that.

98
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,506
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

99
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,807
- No, you're not.
- Now, look.

100
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,581
This zoo has to make money.

101
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:26,843
It does.

102
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,181
- Yes, yes, but not enough.
- Enough forwhat?

103
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,187
Now, don't--

104
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,485
Actually, I will tell you precisely.

105
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:37,891
Mr. McCain requires
a 20% return on capital...

106
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:41,454
from each and every asset
in his empire.

107
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,999
Why 20%?

108
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,328
Because he does, that's why.

109
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,337
Could we explore
that thinking a little?

110
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,270
Yeah.

111
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,804
I thought not.

112
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,578
Despite the fact that current
management theory regards--

113
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:55,135
Despite the fact that current
management theory regards--

114
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:58,648
Now, the big problem is this:
How do we cut costs...

115
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:01,708
and attract more visitors?

116
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,277
I'll tell you from my experience
at Octopus Television...

117
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:09,520
exactlywhat draws the biggest
audiences all over the world.

118
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:15,862
Violence. Oh, yes.

119
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:19,391
Mr. Sylvester Stallone
did not get where he is today...

120
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,404
by playing inJane Austen.

121
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:23,667
-What's that got to do with it?
-Therefore, in this zoo...

122
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:27,973
we require only animals
that are potentiallyviolent.

123
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,536
Fierce animals.

124
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:33,640
All the rest, I'm afraid,
will have to go.

125
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,651
What d'you mean, go?

126
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:39,211
- We'll have to find them other homes.
- What? Outside the zoo?

127
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,382
This zoo is dedicated
to conservation.

128
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:45,189
- Yes.
- I am all in favor ofconservation...

129
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:48,720
and the three things that I
want to conserve are this zoo...

130
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,734
yourjobs and fierce animals.

131
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,862
He barges in here without
the slightest idea ofwhat--

132
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,304
- You two don't seem very upset.
- We are, really.

133
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,604
- Becauseyour animals are fierce?
- No, we think it's--

134
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:02,577
- Diabolical.
- What does he mean by ''fierce''?

135
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:05,376
A giraffe can kick a man's head off,
butyou wouldn't call them ''fierce.''

136
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,679
It's the same
with sea lions and penguins.

137
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:12,484
I mean, people don't think ofthem
as violent, but they can be killers.

138
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,806
Why haveyou all gone quiet?

139
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,743
Areyou trying to tell me
that coati is fierce?

140
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:28,372
Please! This is a wild animal.
It's not domesticated.

141
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,916
You take a libertywith one ofthese
things, they giveyou a very nasty nip.

142
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:34,579
A safety pin would give me a nasty nip.

143
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:38,523
I'll tell you what's fierce.
Fierce is biting the whole hand off.

144
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,219
- The whole hand?
- Thankyou.

145
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,557
It is all right
ifit wrenches the hand off?

146
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,029
Oh, yes, fine.

147
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:48,693
Lotterby, could I have
a word with you, please?

148
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,704
- These areyour meerkats, correct?
- Don't do that, please, sir.

149
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,969
- They go straight for the throat.
- This new plaque ofyours...

150
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,976
says that they're known as
''The Piranhas ofthe Desert.''

151
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,136
Is that right?

152
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,441
They can strip a human
carcass in three minutes.

153
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:05,076
My encyclopedia says they're
easily tamed and often kept as pets.

154
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,484
You've not been attacked
by one, sir.

155
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,749
Nobody's been attacked
by one, Lotterby...

156
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:12,986
or, rather, ifthey have,
they never noticed.

157
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,689
Now, these Patagonian maras ofyours...

158
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:19,926
devastate entire
Argentinian villages, do they?

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,934
They completelywipe 'em out, sir.
Shocking to watch.

160
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,936
It says here they eat grass.

161
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,403
That's for hors d'oeuvres, sir.
When their blood's up--

162
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,442
Lotterby, you are trying
to deceive me into thinking...

163
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,740
- some ofyour animals are fierce...
- I'm talkin' about the rogue ones, sir.

164
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:37,216
when they are, in fact, loveable, cuddly
and surplus to requirements.

165
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,218
You want ever animal here a psycho?

166
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:42,687
Exactly. I want
a lethal weapon in every cage.

167
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:46,419
- So what do we do with all the others?
- Simple. Get rid of'em.

168
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,265
- Willa, can I askyou a question?
- Sure.

169
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,534
- Are those breasts real?
- Yes.

170
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,475
You know, Willa, you better be careful
dressed like that around here.

171
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,677
People will thinkyou're
sleeping yourway to the top.

172
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,813
Just as long as they don't think
I'm sleeping myway to the middle.

173
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,284
What areyou doing?

174
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,828
I'm going to askyour father
ifI can go run the zoo.

175
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,693
What?

176
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,131
You want to go to the Third World
and operate an animal toilet?

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,227
Animals, paper clips, television
companies. It's all business.

178
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:34,000
Willa, these things smell.

179
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:37,237
With enough zoos up and running,
we are talking billions.

180
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,006
Wow! How about dinner tonight?
You can wearyour office clothes.

181
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,709
No, I have to get up early.
I'm pitching it to Rod in the morning.

182
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,718
- What's the hurry?
- I don't want to give our ruthless...

183
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:48,949
little Chinese friend
time to make an impact.

184
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,855
Idaresay theyare upset,
Di, butIhaveajob to do.

185
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,292
- Yes, I know, but I--
- Look, I have to be hard-nosed, okay?

186
00:10:55,362 --> 00:11:00,561
McCain demands it. All the time,
you've got to be tough, tough, tough.

187
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,067
God knows why.

188
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,932
You mean Octopus is ruled by fear?

189
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,870
No, no. Terror.

190
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,536
I've got this one chance to show that
I can run something or I'm out...

191
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:16,173
and at my age, scrap heap.

192
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:19,275
Mr. Lee, there's a call
from Atlantis.

193
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:22,082
- Atlantis?
- Atlanta.

194
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,417
Hello. Lee here.

195
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,584
Rollo, Nev here.
Rod would like a word with you.

196
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,558
That's right.
The wifeandkidssettledinyet?

197
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,622
Yes. Everything's absolutely
terrified here, thanks.

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,634
Sir, howkindofyou toask.

199
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,897
Rollo, Rod here.
Got the wife and kids settled in?

200
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:39,598
Yes, yes, yes, sir.

201
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:43,871
Let me know whatyou're gonna do to push
earnings up to our favorite 20%, okay?

202
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:47,573
It's marvelous to have this opportunity
ofexplaining what I've got in mind.

203
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:51,208
- Hello, Rollo?
- Hello again, Mr. McCain.

204
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:54,549
It's Nev, mate. So the wife and kids
are settled in all right?

205
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,555
Look, I don't want to seem awkward...

206
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:58,557
but I'm not married
and I haven't got any children.

207
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,115
What happened to Rod?

208
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:03,651
He's been called away.
So let Rod knowyour plans, okay?

209
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,664
Zoos are not moneymakers, Willa.

210
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:08,895
Mr. McCain, with good marketing,
cash comes walking in the gate...

211
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,062
and with sponsorships, even more cash.

212
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,128
That was my idea, Dad.
I've got several lined up already.

213
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:17,666
Just think ofit as a prototype
for a chain ofcash cows.

214
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,713
Sort ofa cash dairy, eh?

215
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:20,645
Sort ofa cash dairy, eh?

216
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:33,718
This inclination towards absolutism
within the Austro-Hungarian empire.

217
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,727
C.B. Wedgewood in--

218
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:45,128
Yes? Come in.

219
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,431
Yes?

220
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,172
- Here are the animals, sir.
- What animals?

221
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,874
The first batch ofanimals
that are definitely not fierce, sir.

222
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,281
Ah, good.

223
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:01,986
Yes?

224
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:05,650
We tried to place them
with other zoos. No takers.

225
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:09,821
Doyou mean ofall the zoos in this
country, you can't find a single one--

226
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:12,797
Zoos are keeping
less and less species, sir.

227
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:16,302
Well, what about having people
take them as pets?

228
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,496
- Pets?
- Oh, come on, now.

229
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,471
They need expert attention.

230
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,873
Anyway, it's not allowed, sir.
Quarantine regulations.

231
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:27,345
Well, can we release them
back into the wild?

232
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:30,383
In the wild, there's no
safe habitat for this one.

233
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,477
What doyou propose?

234
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:38,354
There's only one solution, Mr. Lee.
What the London Zoo proposed...

235
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,484
a fewyears ago when the government
wouldn't give any more funds.

236
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,721
- What was that?
- Shoot 'em.

237
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,725
Areyou seriously telling me...

238
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,133
there's no otherway ofgetting rid
ofthese animals?

239
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,535
Not...

240
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,732
unless you were to change
the Fierce Animal Policy.

241
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,070
Nope.

242
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,167
You sure about that
in the circumstances, sir?

243
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,773
Perfectly sure, thankyou.

244
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,783
- They're very dear creatures.
- That's not in dispute.

245
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,785
Butyou would like them killed
in line with your policy?

246
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:10,414
Ifyou really have explored
all the other avenues, yes.

247
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,926
I mean, ifextermination
is the only choice, so be it.

248
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,894
I'm sorry, but I see no alternative.

249
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,896
The Fierce Animal Policy...

250
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:20,057
is absolutely essential...

251
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,466
for the continuing survival of--

252
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,663
- What areyou doing?
- Well, it'sjust that...

253
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,606
we'd rather not shoot them
ourselves, sir.

254
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,768
- We're very fond ofthem.
- We're keepers...

255
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:34,405
and now we're not keeping them.

256
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,409
Oh, I see.
I'm shooting them, am I?

257
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,947
- Ifit's not too much trouble.
- No, no, fine.

258
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:45,958
Doyou have my diary there?
Thankyou.

259
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:50,119
You will make it quick, sir,
won'tyou?

260
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,790
Doyou mean I'm not allowed to
torture them a bit firstjust for fun?

261
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:56,131
- You wouldn't do that!
- I wasn't being serious, stupid girl!

262
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:59,103
Hardly the time forjokes.

263
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:01,140
Bye-bye, Suzie.

264
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,407
Bye-bye, Petal.

265
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,068
I tried.

266
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,778
Be brave, Mitzi.

267
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:13,076
Bye, Rollo.

268
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,281
I'd prefer it
ifyou called me '' Director.''

269
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:19,416
I was talking to the lemur!

270
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,953
The lemur is called '' Rollo''?

271
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,125
She named him afteryou.
It was a mark ofrespect.

272
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,104
Would you pass
the marmalade, please?

273
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:45,516
You should have seen his face when he
realized he was supposed to shoot them.

274
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:50,347
Without wishing to detract from your
award-winning performances...

275
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:54,655
may I be so bold as to inquire
whatyou hope to achieve by this prank?

276
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,594
It wasn't a prank, Bugsy. We're tryin'
to confront him with the reality.

277
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:01,464
Ifyou paint him into a corner,
you'll find that he will--

278
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,560
Shut up. He's not
a cold-blooded murderer.

279
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:08,733
We've given him the five sweetest,
cuddliest, most loveable--

280
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:58,356
- I told you so.
- Shut up!

281
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:01,393
Bugsy, he'll start on yours next.

282
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,435
- Yes?
- Hello, Rollo.

283
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,537
- Yes?
- Vince here. Howyou doin'?

284
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:30,607
- You having dinner?
- Dinner? It's 2:00 in the morning.

285
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:32,619
Oh, wereyou asleep?

286
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:35,121
Yes, Ifrequentlyam
at2.:00a.m., I'm afraid.

287
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,556
Filthy habit I picked up
in the Far East.

288
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,753
Gee, ifthis communique
is in anyway sleep-interruptive...

289
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:44,321
- I'll re-telephoneyou later.
- It'snotsleep-interruptive, really.

290
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:48,392
Let's chatnow. Icanalways catch up
onsomerest. Christmasprobably.

291
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,468
- Right.
- Good. Let's talk marketing, shall we?

292
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,635
- Good.
- Yeah. First thing tomorrow...

293
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:59,805
I'd likeyou to send me the most current
marketing figures you've got, okeydoke?

294
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,145
Right.

295
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:03,616
Rollo, hi.

296
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,619
Willa Weston here.
Areyou all right?

297
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,780
No, no. Notnow. Notnow.

298
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,181
- You got a problem with now?
- No, no. I'm fine.

299
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,921
Don'tdo that.
Sorry. Hangonamoment.

300
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,259
Suzie, be quiet.

301
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,233
Hello? I'm going to putyou
on holdjust for one moment.

302
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,791
Okay? Thankyou.

303
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,973
Another filthy habit
he picked up in the Far East.

304
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,169
Now, youjust go over there.
Right. Stay.

305
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,872
Don't, don't, don't.
Just stop it.

306
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,847
I'vegot to talk
with thosemarketing Moonies.

307
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,851
Just go over there and play
with each other. Right. Go on.

308
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,444
- He's got two girls.
- Goaway, Suzie.

309
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,752
Suzie, what areyou
going down there for?

310
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,719
No, stop licking my-- Careful!

311
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,387
Don't bite.

312
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,558
No, Ican'tfoolaroundwithyounow.

313
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,963
Don't pull. Don't pull.

314
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:59,165
Get-- There.
There. Stay. Stay.

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,208
Cindy, get offthe bed.

316
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,938
Cindy, off, off!.

317
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,708
- Idon't wantyounow.
- Three girls?

318
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,909
Cindy, goaway!

319
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,043
All right, all right.
Just go.

320
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,055
Oh, that is disgusting.

321
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,689
Sorry. I had a bit ofa cramp.

322
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:27,098
Hello? Hello!

323
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,230
He must have eaten
a whole rhino horn.

324
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,870
Now, there's a thought.

325
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,876
I'll be right back.

326
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:41,748
Takeyour time.

327
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,415
How does he get three girls?

328
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,355
Where does the third one go?

329
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,388
Bastard.

330
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:59,559
The place is probably crawling with
young, beautiful female zookeepers.

331
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,192
Damn!

332
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:05,396
I hate it when people abuse
positions oftrust...

333
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:08,636
for their own personal,
sexual gratification.

334
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,642
It's demeaning to women.

335
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,946
- Tell me about the sponsorships.
- What sponsorships?

336
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,612
The ones you told Rod about.

337
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,952
- I made that up.
- Vince, I told--

338
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,486
What areyou doing?

339
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:31,498
I'm getting undressed for sex.
I thoughtyou were in the bedroom.

340
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,938
I was getting us dinner.

341
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:39,906
You wanna eat first?

342
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,748
Oh, goody-goody. Goody.

343
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:59,690
Vince, I invited you
here tonight...

344
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,424
to say ''thankyou''
for helping me with Rod.

345
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,731
Not tojump in the sackwith you.

346
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:12,671
Whoa, wait, wait--
What is the problem?

347
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:16,537
I really likeyou.

348
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,478
Who knows what might've happened?

349
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,710
Oh, you mean ifyou weren't
going to England tomorrow?

350
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,342
Exactly.

351
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,280
Look, it's all right.
I understand.

352
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:30,815
- Really?
- Yes.

353
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,393
- You sureyou're okaywith this?
- Yes.

354
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,556
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

355
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,658
Thanks.

356
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,031
'Cause I'm going with you.

357
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:48,275
- What?
- Yes! Surprise!

358
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:51,710
I talked to Rod, and he said
we could run the zoo together!

359
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:56,016
Great!

360
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:01,245
You'renotgonnalethim
go to MarwoodZoo?

361
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:05,418
I know it's only 4,000 miles away,
Nev, but it's a start.

362
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:08,985
Still, it's tough on Willa,
getting landed with the idiot son.

363
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:11,793
She can manage him.
She's a natural-born corporate killer.

364
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,800
Right this way, Mr. McCain.

365
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:16,200
- You have the questions?
- Yes.

366
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,204
Back, Nev.

367
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:23,271
No. No.

368
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:25,812
No!

369
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,213
You better send a good
bookkeeperwith him.

370
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,376
He would never dare
try to steal again.

371
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,387
Fakin' my signature.

372
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:37,390
Not afterwhat happened
to him last time.

373
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:42,361
That's enough. You must be the
intellectuals. What doyou wanna know ?

374
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,764
Whatabout the5,000layoffs
ifyouclose down in Chicago?

375
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,036
Ifanyemployees were letgo, it would
dependonsecond-quartergrowth...

376
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,800
Ifanyemployees were letgo, it would
dependonsecond-quartergrowth...

377
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:55,241
because we don't wannaloseanyone
unlessitisabsolutelynecessary.

378
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:59,207
Weat Octopusare in thebusiness
ofjob creation.

379
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,114
Currently, we employmore
than 70,000people worldwide.

380
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:07,712
Sometimes circumstances require
parts ofthe companytoberelocated.

381
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,589
It's inevitable inanybusiness that's
going to face the competition, and--

382
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:24,732
Scared? Don't worry about Terry.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

383
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:27,172
Actually, he would hurt a fly
being a Mexican redknee tarantula...

384
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,574
Brachypelmasmithi, and therefore
particularly partial to flies.

385
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,676
The point is that Terry...

386
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:37,582
has a bite relatively
harmless to human beings.

387
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:40,587
Yetyou reacted
as though he were fierce...

388
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,089
which he isn't!

389
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,885
Yes, I've always had a bit ofa thing
about spiders, actually.

390
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:53,525
So, ifcreatures
are thought to be fierce...

391
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,832
they are, ipso facto, fierce!

392
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,339
Sorry, Director.
We need the guns.

393
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,432
- What?
- Animal has escaped. We must catch it.

394
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,704
- We need three, sir.
- Tranquilizer darts?

395
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:07,236
Gerry's got the blowpipe, sir.
We need the real thingjust in case.

396
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:10,284
- Okay, I'll get one too.
- Don't worry. We can handle this.

397
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,326
Keep back, everybody.
Please, keep back.

398
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,555
- What's going on?
-Just recapturing an animal.

399
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,564
Nothing to worry about.
It's not fierce.

400
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,793
Why haveyou got the guns then?

401
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,336
Just a precaution. Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

402
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:32,497
How did the blackwidow spider
get its name, Mr. Lee?

403
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,768
Because it eats its mate.

404
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:39,478
We've caught it, ladies and gentlemen,
so we can all relax.

405
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:43,574
And thankyou very much
foryour cooperation. Thankyou.

406
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:47,109
Well done, everyone. Well done.

407
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:49,122
- What is that?
- That is an anteater.

408
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,124
Not too close! He's angry.

409
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,126
- Angry?
- They got wicked tempers, sir.

410
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,788
- Devastate small towns, do they?
- No, not--

411
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:58,457
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Look at the claws. They're diabolical.

412
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,831
Lotterby, you did not need
three guns to recapture this.

413
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,245
A sharp stickwould've sufficed.

414
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:02,711
A sharp stickwould've sufficed.

415
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,804
A sharp stick?
Believeyou me, sir, hisjaws--

416
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:07,076
It's an anteater, not a man-eater.

417
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,641
What would you be saying
ifhejumped into that pram?

418
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,653
- What would you say to the child's mum?
- I'd be saying...

419
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,281
'' Madam, you were the victim of
an eight billion-to-one chance...

420
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:19,090
a leaping anteater, an evolutionary
mutant previously unknown to science.''

421
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,494
- They climb like monkeys.
- Will you be quiet?

422
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:23,999
Just get this fluffy toy
back in its enclosure...

423
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,001
and stop insulting my intelligence!

424
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:30,363
The tsetse fly, Muscidaeglossina.

425
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,136
- Ten blood-sucking millimeters long.
- Areyou all right?

426
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,373
- One ofthe major disease carriers.
- I'm fine. I'll be okay.

427
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,607
- Is she hurt?
- Little local difficulty.

428
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:41,617
- She took a libertywith a bandicoot.
- A bandicoot?

429
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,619
- My God!
- It'sjust a flesh wound.

430
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,746
- A few stitches, I'll be back at work.
- Areyou sure?

431
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:48,620
Don't worry. It's part ofthejob
with the bandicoots.

432
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:50,922
-Just be careful ofthose bandicoots.
- The bandicoots.

433
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:53,690
- Bandicoots, right.
- Pity about Pip's leg.

434
00:25:53,763 --> 00:25:55,731
- But it's good for the zoo, isn't it?
- What?

435
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,733
- All this fierceness.
- What's that?

436
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,736
-Just a bite, sir.
- From what?

437
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:07,301
- What's going on now?
- It's the sea lions, sir.

438
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:10,312
Sea lions? What?
Are they attacking someone?

439
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,453
Thankyou! Everything's fine.

440
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:19,455
Nothing to worry about.

441
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,522
Nice crowds today, Director.

442
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,697
Yes, yes, very good.

443
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,475
And she's a fully trained
telephone engineer.

444
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:43,979
- Really?
- Yes.

445
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,072
I didn't know that.
Enjoying the show?

446
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:48,982
- Stunning creatures, sea lions.
- Wonderful plumage.

447
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:52,112
Lovely movers, too,
considering the flippers.

448
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,554
God at His best, I'd say.

449
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:07,298
-She couldn't do that ifit were fierce.
-What?

450
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,270
Ifit were fierce,
she couldn't go in there with them.

451
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:12,968
I'm 1 00% behind the
Fierce Animals Policy.

452
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:16,809
But in a case ofanimals like that,
the attendances speak for themselves.

453
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,179
I understand the purpose ofthe policy
is to increase attendances.

454
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,275
But where attendances are already high
for non-fierce animals...

455
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:25,981
I would've thought there'd be
an exception to the general rule.

456
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:29,548
Then there's the African
migratory locust--

457
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:33,185
Perfect.

458
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:35,026
Stay.

459
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,032
It's typical, isn't it,
these management types?

460
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,035
No inkling ofinterest in any
subject other than their own.

461
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:43,038
- Bit more.
- Not too much. Gotta look real.

462
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:46,439
Right. Better not do anyone else today
or he might get a bit suspicious.

463
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:49,444
- Oh, yeah.
- We don't want to make him too fierce.

464
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:53,141
I have a suggestion.
To make a complete idiot ofhim...

465
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,845
let's make those wounds
as realistic as possible, shall we?

466
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:02,323
Open the door!

467
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:15,004
Something wrong
with the sights on this.

468
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:17,869
I keep hitting coffee mugs. Right.

469
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:21,877
I'll seeyou three in my office,
9:00 tomorrow morning.

470
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:27,973
Oh, my God!

471
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:32,416
Did you know that the anopheles
mosquito kills more people in a year...

472
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,855
than all the wild animals
in Africa in a century?

473
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:38,155
- Wereyou shooting more animals?
- No,just culling a few keepers.

474
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:42,028
Leg better, is it?
Miracle recovery or--

475
00:28:42,098 --> 00:28:45,363
He'sjust shot a keeper!
Watch out!

476
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:49,667
- No, I haven't!
- He is in there dying! Look out.

477
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:52,737
Be quiet! Stop that or I'll--

478
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,903
- Everything under control.
- Oh, my God, he's gone mad!

479
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,503
Nothing to worry about.

480
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,615
Here we are. Yeah.

481
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:06,020
Right.

482
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,528
Mr. Lee, I'm afraid
there's been an accident.

483
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:16,395
Ofcourse there has, Lotterby, and I
can promiseyou, it's the last one.

484
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:18,400
- What?
- This lady fell, Mr. Lee--

485
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:21,801
No, surely she's been savaged
by a chipmunk or gored by a gopher...

486
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:24,305
or disemboweled by a chicken,
hasn't she?

487
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:26,308
- Come on. Get off. I've had enough.
- What?

488
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,537
- Put that stretcher down, you two.
- I fell.

489
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:30,875
- She did. Scout's honor.
- I'm warning you, Lotterby.

490
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:33,381
Put the stretcher down now!

491
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,384
What areyou doing?

492
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:37,682
- Oh, come offit.Just get up.
- She needs treatment.

493
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:39,688
- No, she doesn't.
- She's hurt her leg.

494
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,087
- No, it's fake.
- What?

495
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,318
It's fake blood.
Look. Taste it.

496
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,092
- It's fake.
- Fake?

497
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:50,655
Yes, fake. Try ityourself.

498
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,231
- Who is this?
- He's the director ofthe zoo.

499
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:57,865
- He's in charge.
- You've been rumbled, okay?

500
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,967
- What?
- You're not fooling anyone, so get up.

501
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:03,945
- What is going on?
- Don'tyou understand?

502
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:07,039
This is artificial blood.
The whole thing's a charade.

503
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:09,142
- She's not hurt.
- She is hurt.

504
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,278
She'sjust one ofthe keeper's wives.

505
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:13,379
- She's mywife!
- Look, taste the blood!

506
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:15,117
She's mywife!

507
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,489
- Taste the blood. She's yourwife?
- She's mywife!

508
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:24,089
- Wait a moment.
- He's drinking her blood! Stop!

509
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:27,937
- Areyou sure she's yourwife?
- Ofcourse!

510
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:30,666
-Just get away from her!
- Let's be sensible about this.

511
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,867
Count Dracula's telling me
to be sensible?

512
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:35,172
- What is happening here?
- He's sucking her blood!

513
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:36,837
- He's what?
- Look at his lips!

514
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,473
- He's the director ofthe zoo.
- You're Rollo Lee?

515
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:41,642
- Christopher Lee, more like.
- This woman is injured.

516
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:43,879
- She needs attention.
- I know she needs treatment.

517
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:46,979
- Youjust told everyone she didn't.
- Beforeyou bit her.

518
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:49,820
- Areyou in pain, Mrs.--
- Pike. No, but it's tender.

519
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,827
- I can handle this.
- No, you can't.

520
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:54,193
- I'm in charge. Yes, I am!
- No, you're not.

521
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:58,530
By God, you Americans are pushy!
Who the hell doyou thinkyou are?

522
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,873
Welcome to Marwood Zoo.

523
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,034
Can I offeryou a coffee, doughnut?

524
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,635
- Cappuccino.
- That's him!

525
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,977
- There he is.
- You're under arrest. Come here.

526
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,677
- He shot a keeper.
- No, he didn't.

527
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,720
He tried to, but he missed.

528
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:20,255
Missed? Look at that.

529
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:29,365
- Get offher, you pervert!
- Rape!

530
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:35,430
So the big question is...

531
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,441
what am I gonna do with you all?

532
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,539
'Cause I'm almost certainly
on the scrap heap, you see.

533
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:46,873
Ah, well.

534
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:51,177
A pity. I like it here.

535
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:56,521
Lookwhatyou've done!
That's the second time.

536
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,289
Don't they teach you
any manners in Argentina?

537
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,962
Ifyou do that again,
I will shootyou.

538
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:07,429
Coming! Come on.

539
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,233
Get in there. Quick. Quick.

540
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:12,206
- I still saywe shouldjust fire him.
- Okay, fine.

541
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:14,800
- You call your father.
- Come here, darling.

542
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:18,846
Now, quiet, you two.

543
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:21,247
All right. Suzie?
Suzie, come here.

544
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,251
He's at it again.

545
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,150
Come on. Get in there.

546
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:28,156
No fighting. Stop it.
Cut it out.

547
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:34,586
Oh, hello.

548
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,124
Can we come in?

549
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,937
You are still working, right?
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

550
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,372
- Oh, doyou want the report?
- Yes.

551
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,343
- So, we can come in. Okay? Yeah?
- Good idea. Good idea.

552
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:54,516
Bit ofa mess, I'm afraid.
I just spilled something.

553
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:59,086
Look, Rollo, we've been
reviewing your situation...

554
00:32:59,155 --> 00:33:01,089
and we've decided...

555
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:04,991
to reappraiseyour position.

556
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,996
- Away from the public.
- You saw the local paper?

557
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:12,660
Yeah, the ''Vampire Gunman
Runs Amok'' story?

558
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:15,704
That? Yes.
Bloody newspapers. Ha!

559
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,800
Report to me tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
and we'll discuss the position.

560
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:21,810
And your new office.

561
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:24,176
One thing beforeyou go.

562
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:27,011
About those five animals
that I'm supposed to have shot--

563
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,381
- Smart career move, bub.
- What?

564
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:31,477
Killing them saved
your ass from extinction.

565
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:36,183
- Oh, I see.
- No, theyjustputitin.

566
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,894
Well, it wasn't an easy
decision, obviously.

567
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:43,797
You know, you've gotta
be hard-nosed, because...

568
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,892
toughness is the name ofthe game
ifyou want no-nonsense management.

569
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,303
After all, toughness
is what it's all about these days.

570
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:54,207
Toughness and hard-noseness. Well,
hard-nasality, as I mentioned before.

571
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:57,303
That is the bottom line,
as Rod often says.

572
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,396
Rod is right. Remarkable man.
Absolutely remarkable man.

573
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:01,363
Rod is right. Remarkable man.
Absolutely remarkable man.

574
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,332
Six billion dollars!
How extraordinary!

575
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,634
Damn radiator.

576
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,111
- Hardly slept last night.
- I bet.

577
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,643
Listen, Rollo, I don't likeyou.

578
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,120
You're weird and unattractive.
You'd better reposition your attitude--

579
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,885
vis-a-vis certain
members ofthe female staff--

580
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,153
oryou're gonna be out ofhere.

581
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,357
''Certain members
ofthe female staff''?

582
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,801
Oh, please.

583
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:45,666
- Well, I thinkhe'ssexy.
- Sexy?

584
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,472
He looks like a giraffe in drag.

585
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:53,413
Did you get a whiffofhis cologne?
Eau de Monkey Fart. He's a geek.

586
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,610
The way he moves, it's like he's
borrowed his body for the weekend...

587
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:57,619
and hasn't figured out
how it works yet.

588
00:34:57,687 --> 00:35:01,384
He's got something. He's been demoted,
and the girls are still all over him.

589
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:05,689
I bet they're real dogs. Mangy,
nearsighted, weight-watcher rejects.

590
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:07,992
God, he's so male.

591
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,225
- Him ?
- No,Jambo.

592
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,564
Look. Isn't he wonderful?

593
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,737
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Reminds me ofmy father.

594
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:18,641
Was your father ugly?

595
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,642
No, it'sjust I didn't
get to see him very much.

596
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,508
But when I did, he used to
take me to the Atlanta Zoo...

597
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,707
to see Willy B., the gorilla there.

598
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:29,946
That's when I felt close to him.

599
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,953
To the gorilla?

600
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:35,323
No, to my father.

601
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:40,529
Lifejust seemed simple then.

602
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,188
Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,223
Is this all he does?

604
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:49,533
I mean, because the zoo is after
the entertainment dollar, right?

605
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,971
Is that the show? Because if
this is the evening performance...

606
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,975
I'm glad I missed the matinee.

607
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:56,477
What doyou do for an encore?
Fall asleep?

608
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,105
You really don't
like animals, doyou?

609
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:03,482
It's not that I don't like them.
I just don't see the point.

610
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:07,853
I rememberwhen I was five,
my mother got me this dog.

611
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,449
I just didn't get it.

612
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:13,757
I suppose I had nothing
I needed fetched. So I sold him.

613
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,561
- Oh, that's sad.
- Oh, he got over it.

614
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,797
No, foryou. It's very sad foryou
becauseyou couldn't love a puppy.

615
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:30,074
This is the kind ofconversation two
people have when one ofthem is female.

616
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:34,981
Surprise!

617
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,484
- Celebrate our partnership.
- Our partnership.

618
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:43,252
That's right.

619
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,022
However, there'sjust one thing
I couldn't help noticing.

620
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:48,529
I don't know ifyou did.
We still have separate bedrooms.

621
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:53,494
Just missed.

622
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,800
I mean, we have
taken over the zoo.

623
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:58,807
We are here in England.

624
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:02,672
To us.

625
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,278
I think it's too soon.

626
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,288
Why?

627
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,683
Because what we have is special.

628
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:18,454
No, it isn't.

629
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,826
Yes, it is.

630
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:29,162
It's too soon.

631
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,537
How too soon?

632
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,638
Goddamn it! Thanks, asshole!

633
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,646
This is your fault!

634
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:49,220
You!

635
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:52,227
Oh, hello. Lovely evening.

636
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,163
What areyou doing with that?

637
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,165
- Oh, the lemur?
- Yeah.

638
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,167
Oh,just putting it back
in its enclosure.

639
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,169
Why'd you take it out?

640
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:04,533
For a walk, you know, exercise.

641
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,269
It can hardly move in there.

642
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:09,504
The exercise is for me.

643
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,706
So what doyou need that for?

644
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:13,715
That's a good point, actually.

645
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:16,877
Well, perhaps I won't bother
in future. Thanks for the hint.

646
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:20,555
Wereyou gonna use that
for target practice?

647
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:25,359
Or one ofyour orgies?

648
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,969
- Orgies?
- Yeah!

649
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:35,833
I'm ontoyou.

650
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:38,772
You were gonna put that somewhere.
You're sick!

651
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,035
Is there a history
ofinsanity in your family...

652
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:47,071
or is smashing up trolleys
the latest American craze?

653
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:51,984
No, the latest American craze, pal,
is firing weirdos likeyou!

654
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:56,718
Come on, Rollo, let's getyou back home
before some loony attacks this trolley.

655
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,158
''Come on, Rollo''?

656
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:02,288
He's talking to himself,
and I'm the loony!

657
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:05,129
Animals are boring!

658
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,194
But people pay money to see them,
which led me to my latest inspiration.

659
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,866
We are talking about a whole
new concept in sponsorship...

660
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:15,069
that completely eliminates
the non-event impact deficit.

661
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,544
For instance-- What have we here?

662
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:20,741
An African spurred tortoise.

663
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,552
Who gives a shit, right?
I mean, look at it.

664
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,449
Ifit died, would we know?

665
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:33,826
My grandmother's grave is
a bigger attraction. But wait.

666
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:54,444
It's notjust some
nonentity tortoise now.

667
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,452
It's Bruce Springsteen's tortoise.

668
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,579
Immediately, it's an event!

669
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:01,646
It's practically a celebrity itself.

670
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:03,749
Will he come and visit it?

671
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:06,294
- What?
- Will he come and visit it?

672
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,693
- Yeah, when his schedule allows.
- So he's agreed to sponsor it?

673
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:14,258
I'm expecting his call any minute.
But the potential!

674
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:17,500
We can market little
Bruce Springsteen tortoises.

675
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:21,634
Jurassic Park made halfofits money
from those little plastic dinosaurs.

676
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,306
And they're even deader than
this heap ofgarbage! Follow me!

677
00:40:26,115 --> 00:40:28,845
Now here we have a Brazilian tapir.

678
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,611
I have to say I've dated
better-looking women.

679
00:40:32,688 --> 00:40:35,623
Now, listen to this
experience-enhancing...

680
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:38,660
digitally-manipulated
educational tool.

681
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,662
Brazilian tapirs.

682
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,531
Solitary, three-toedungulates which
inhabitlowlandforests insunny Brazil.

683
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:49,264
Reachablenowin less than 14hours
via BritishAirways'...

684
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:52,796
nonstop flights tostunning
Rio deJaneiro.

685
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,708
Imean, it'sbadenough
having to wearthis rubbish!

686
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:57,712
- I do know whatyou mean.
- I can only assume he's planning...

687
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,907
to turn the entire zoo
into a supermarket...

688
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:02,644
where he can sell videos
about animals in other zoos.

689
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:04,811
- I agree.
- The cheap little souvenirs...

690
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:07,947
the ones they didn't have time to see
because theywere too busy shopping.

691
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,356
I'm surprised he hasn't started
selling all the animals here.

692
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,054
- Look, the point is this--
- Special summer sale.

693
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,063
Antelope, 50% off.

694
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:18,191
Ocelots, 200 pounds each
or six for a thousand.

695
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,701
Rhino horn,just thejob
for a Friday night.

696
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,704
- Could I say something?
- One free porcupine...

697
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,104
with every purchase
oftwo overpriced T-shirts.

698
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:27,904
Please!

699
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,938
- Thankyou. I wanna make this point--
- Ifyou ask me--

700
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,175
I don't!
I can't get a word in edgewise...

701
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,775
let alone askyou anything.

702
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,786
- You didn't kill them!
- What?

703
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,383
We checked! They're all alive!

704
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,086
You rascal. He was only kidding.

705
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:47,629
-Just figured that out, haveyou?
- I say.

706
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:49,631
Andnowoverhere,
this usedtobe thelionhouse...

707
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:51,633
but as it's no longer suitable
for animals...

708
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,135
we're using it for middle management.

709
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:59,601
What the hell
doyou thinkyou're doing?

710
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:02,134
Can you keep a lid on it till
the sun goes down, for God's sake?

711
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:02,657
Can you keep a lid on it till
the sun goes down, for God's sake?

712
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:05,863
You're supposed to be working,
not prancing around your cell...

713
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:08,566
like a flamingo with a boner!

714
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:12,143
Terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
We're having a little problem...

715
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:14,202
getting the right balance
with his medication.

716
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,239
This is a family zoo,
not the Playboy Mansion, you pervert!

717
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:21,811
This is your last warning, Lee!

718
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:24,549
Follow me, ladies and gentlemen. It's
perfectly all right. Sorry about that.

719
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:27,285
Right this way. Right this way.

720
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,760
Now I know why
they keep him in a cage.

721
00:42:37,536 --> 00:42:39,970
Yes, but we thought
you had actually killed them.

722
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:42,769
- I had to pretend I shot them.
- Why?

723
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:45,902
- To preserve my authority.
- What authority?

724
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,912
Yeah, all right, all right.
Anyway...

725
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,744
I'm just praying that Vince
doesn't fire me, 'cause I love it here.

726
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:55,253
Oh, come on, youjust love putting
things in cages, being an ex-cop.

727
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:58,290
It's true, but this place
is still special.

728
00:42:58,357 --> 00:43:00,757
- It used to be.
- What?

729
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:02,487
Before Vince McCain.

730
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:05,496
He is right at the bottom
ofthe food chain, isn't he?

731
00:43:05,564 --> 00:43:09,091
I fail to see how
you can criticize him.

732
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,996
What?

733
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:14,005
He's bringing
the crowds in, isn't he?

734
00:43:14,073 --> 00:43:16,769
In order to raise the revenue
to the 20% profit margin...

735
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:20,801
thatyou yourselfwere advocating
so vociferously less than a month ago--

736
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,814
No, that's not what I was saying.

737
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:24,543
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

738
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:26,380
- Yes, you were!
- No, I wasn't.

739
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:28,386
What was the point
ofraising it to 20%--

740
00:43:28,454 --> 00:43:31,685
All right, insect breath.
You reallywant to know what I think?

741
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:34,157
- Yes.
- Right. I'll tell you.

742
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:38,526
I think the whole
Octopus philosophy is poison.

743
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:43,631
The only aim ofany and every
McCain business...

744
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:46,535
is to downsize
and halve the quality...

745
00:43:46,605 --> 00:43:50,006
to make enough money to acquire
another business to downsize...

746
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:52,010
and halve the quality
to make enough money...

747
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:54,638
to acquire another business to downsize,
et cetera, et cetera...

748
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:58,046
without ever running
a single one ofthem reallywell.

749
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:00,711
And ifanyone ever
raises the question ofquality...

750
00:44:00,786 --> 00:44:02,754
they're immediately attacked
as an elitist...

751
00:44:02,822 --> 00:44:05,552
because at Octopus it's considered
morally offensive...

752
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,592
to talk about anything but money.

753
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,290
All so that Mr. Rod McCain can feel
a little more powerful every day.

754
00:44:12,364 --> 00:44:15,299
That's why, instead ofrunning...

755
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,562
this wonderful zoo properly...

756
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:19,570
we have to spoil it...

757
00:44:19,638 --> 00:44:22,607
in order to finance
his next mindless acquisition.

758
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:30,674
On the other hand,
he is a remarkable man--

759
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:33,775
- Tea time!
- Halfpast 8:00. We should be going.

760
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:36,321
I haven't finished! I haven't finished!

761
00:44:36,388 --> 00:44:40,518
He is a true visionary of--
Hello.

762
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:43,926
- I wasjust--
- Trashing Octopus. I know.

763
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:46,794
It didn't really sound
like that, did it?

764
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,800
Why doyou work for us, Rollo?

765
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:54,237
Cowardice?

766
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:58,076
We all have to live in the real world,
or this place is gonna close...

767
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:03,980
but I just wantyou all to know I intend
to run this one business reallywell.

768
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:06,847
And ifyou do, we could open a chain
ofthem all over the world.

769
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:09,911
Little zoos popping up everywhere,
all exactly the same.

770
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:13,550
Leopards on the left, rhinos
on the right, monkeys in the middle...

771
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:16,959
sea lions in the center,
ferrets in the front--

772
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:32,977
I hate these banners.

773
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,110
Hello.

774
00:45:53,732 --> 00:45:56,758
Oh, Vince, you idiot.

775
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:20,785
Areyou all right?

776
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,055
Yeah, I'm fine.

777
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:39,363
Come on,Jambo.

778
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:44,433
Come on.

779
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:49,610
Good boy. Thereyou go.

780
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:57,913
I have it. Yes, I do.
I do have it.

781
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,124
You okay, Miss Weston?

782
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,767
No, I'm fine, I--

783
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,533
I just--

784
00:48:14,606 --> 00:48:17,097
Oh, you made contact.

785
00:48:19,178 --> 00:48:21,078
That's great.

786
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:29,186
You don't understand.
I wasn't lying.

787
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:32,849
Oh, really?Just what? Altering
my perception ofthe situation?

788
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:34,859
I spoke with Springsteen direct!

789
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:37,259
Direct? Oh, really?

790
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,856
Yeah, he said, ''Vince, you were born to
run with this. You have my blessing.''

791
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,993
Then how come I have this
pissed-off fax from his agent?

792
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:47,698
Oh, this isjust a negotiating ploy.

793
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:51,265
Just offer him 50% of
the total tortoise revenue.

794
00:48:51,343 --> 00:48:53,743
There is no tortoise revenue.

795
00:48:53,812 --> 00:48:56,713
- Exactly. The point is--
- The point is, Vince...

796
00:48:56,782 --> 00:49:00,809
that this sponsorship stuff
is degrading to the animals.

797
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,322
Like what?

798
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,358
Like that.

799
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,797
That's genius! There's not one
major award I won't win for that!

800
00:49:12,865 --> 00:49:15,959
That is unacceptable.

801
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:19,265
- Take it off.
- But-- But--

802
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:21,636
It's brilliant.
It's never been done before!

803
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,833
Try to work out why.

804
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:29,213
- It's for the zoo.
- It's a perfectly reasonable...

805
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:31,545
- request for information.
- She won't tell me!

806
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:33,949
- She will!
- Not afterwhat I said about Octopus.

807
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:35,486
She likes you.

808
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:38,079
She's the one who's always
on about consultations.

809
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:40,091
- She likes you.
- What doyou mean?

810
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,093
What she means is, the pheromones...

811
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,959
thatyou are unconsciously releasing
into the atmosphere...

812
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,260
have the physiological
effect ofincreasing...

813
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:49,493
the statistical probability ofher
taking part...

814
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:53,096
in some form ofmounting behavior, not
unlike that ofan African grasshopper!

815
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,259
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

816
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,862
- What areyou doing?
-Just visiting some little friends.

817
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:07,342
Plenty ofthem at the zoo,
I've heard.

818
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:11,006
- Yes. Look, can I askyou something?
- Sure.

819
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:13,572
About some ofthese sponsorship ideas--

820
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,380
I wonder ifyou and your fiance
don't feel that--

821
00:50:16,453 --> 00:50:18,478
Fiance?

822
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:21,023
We're not together.

823
00:50:21,091 --> 00:50:23,252
Oh, good.

824
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:24,521
''Good''?

825
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:31,292
I know we're not making 20%yet...

826
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:35,566
but some ofthe marketing
devices are a bit crude.

827
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,335
- Yes.
- Good.

828
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,472
Because, you know, the keepers...

829
00:50:41,545 --> 00:50:43,479
and I were--

830
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:47,880
Oh, look at that.

831
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:49,885
Aren't they gorgeous?

832
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:52,888
Oh, theyjust makeyou
want to fondle them.

833
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:56,323
Oh, yes! Yes!
I see whatyou mean.

834
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:57,826
Yes.

835
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,495
Is this oneyour favorite?

836
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,601
Yes, I like him breast of--

837
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:08,433
best ofall the small mammaries.

838
00:51:08,505 --> 00:51:10,439
Mammals! Sorry.

839
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:13,169
- Yes, his name's Rollo, actually.
- Really?

840
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:18,470
Yes, so I sort offeed him
some special titsbits--

841
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,279
Sorry. Tidbits.
I keep making boobs--

842
00:51:23,787 --> 00:51:26,483
Anyway, hejust loves his nuts.

843
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:31,160
Does he?

844
00:51:34,898 --> 00:51:37,093
And is...

845
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:40,068
Rollo very sexually active?

846
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:43,698
Well, he doesn't have a partner
at the moment, you know, ifhe had one.

847
00:51:43,774 --> 00:51:45,708
One?

848
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:49,507
I mean,just one?
He wouldn't get bored or--

849
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:53,845
I mean, you had two
in your cage the other day.

850
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,078
Yes. Yes.

851
00:51:56,153 --> 00:52:01,113
Only some ofthe sponsorship gimmicks
are a bit sexessive--

852
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:03,455
- Excessive.
- That's it. Sorry.

853
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:06,052
Freudian slit-- slut--

854
00:52:06,129 --> 00:52:08,529
Slip.

855
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:10,532
Sorry. Slip.

856
00:52:12,669 --> 00:52:15,866
Rollo, doyou really
want to talk about the zoo?

857
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:19,141
Well, I thinkwe ought.

858
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,610
How about dinner, tomorrow night?

859
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,444
Dinner?

860
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:30,008
Yes.

861
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:33,284
Well, yes, I don't think
I've got anything else on as yet.

862
00:52:33,356 --> 00:52:35,984
No, that'd be fine.

863
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,993
Good. Dinner.

864
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:44,529
Rollo...

865
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:46,660
I think I likeyou.

866
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:51,173
Something in the air.

867
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:56,445
Fucking hell.

868
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:03,446
Damn it!

869
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,388
I can't have dinnerwith you tomorrow.
I'm having dinnerwith Rod McCain.

870
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:09,718
What, here?

871
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:13,126
No, at the Marwood Arms.
Wednesday, then.

872
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:15,391
Yes, but...

873
00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:18,298
he's not gonna close us down, is he?

874
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:23,232
The zoo's safe. Rod trusts me.
Don't worry.

875
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:25,433
- Good.
- Seeyou Wednesday.

876
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:26,601
Good.

877
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,706
I'd like to know what
McCain's really thinking.

878
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:34,147
Just because she trusts him
doesn't mean we have to.

879
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:36,515
I tell you, whatyou need to deal
with these big corporations...

880
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:40,044
is inside information.

881
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:49,998
- Where shall I put this?
- On the bed in our room.

882
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:52,000
We didn't have to use
something this big, did we?

883
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,003
The Revox A-77 is known as being
heavier than comparable models...

884
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,336
owing to its three-motor design
and 1 0-1 /2 inch reel capacity.

885
00:53:58,408 --> 00:54:00,342
Would you likeyour bed
turned down now, Mr. Lee?

886
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,072
No, everything's fine, thankyou.
Good evening.

887
00:54:04,147 --> 00:54:06,081
- Acoustic response is required.
- Please, Bugsy.

888
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:08,083
How much longerwill it take
to get this mike--

889
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:10,517
This FM transmitterwill give
you wire-free remote sound--

890
00:54:10,587 --> 00:54:13,112
Shut up! Sorry.

891
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,522
- I'm a bit on edge.
- We've got plenty oftime.

892
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:18,288
- We have not got plenty oftime.
- McCain's not due for halfan hour.

893
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:20,295
Doyou know the risk
we're taking here?

894
00:54:20,363 --> 00:54:22,854
If McCain finds us, we're dead meat.

895
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:24,867
We'll be safely in there.

896
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:27,130
You do realize this is a criminal act.

897
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,637
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

898
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:31,868
Wireless TelegraphyAct, 1 957,
clause five, subsection three.

899
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:35,139
- How soon ? How soon ?
-Just one microphone to check.

900
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:37,476
- Right.Just one?
- Yeah.

901
00:54:39,616 --> 00:54:42,278
Another interesting thing about
the combination ofthe A-77...

902
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:44,650
with a standard
hypercardioid microphone--

903
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:47,783
Dead wasp.

904
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,621
Luckyyou, Terry.

905
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,858
- You all right?
- Yeah.

906
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,865
- Any sign ofanything?
- No, notyet.

907
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,798
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

908
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:01,268
- You can see the back entrance?
- Everything.

909
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:03,203
Great. Keepyour eyes peeled.

910
00:55:08,578 --> 00:55:10,409
Hey, over here!

911
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:15,645
Right over here!
Here we go! Yep! Whoa!

912
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:18,320
Let me get that, Dad.

913
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:20,322
Oh, damn.

914
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,824
Andas ProfessorStephen Hawking
haspointedout...

915
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:26,055
ifyou're watching a star collapse
to form a black hole...

916
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:28,393
we must remember that
in the Theory of Relativity--

917
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:30,956
- Hurry up !
- May I point out that--

918
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:32,968
- Is the microphone fixed?
- Yeah, yeah.

919
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:35,163
Let's get in the next room, please,
and close the door.

920
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:39,072
- I'djust like to make a point--
- I don't care. I wantyou to be quiet.

921
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:41,076
- Look, I know my loquacity--
- Will you can it?

922
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:43,078
I mean,just for once?

923
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:46,479
Areyou aware what
a complete windbag you are?

924
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:56,910
Rollo!

925
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,003
Rollo!

926
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:01,007
- They're here!
- What?

927
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:02,709
Quick!

928
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,877
The door!

929
00:56:08,923 --> 00:56:11,187
Other door!
Other door!

930
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:13,557
It's our special, sir.
The Churchill Suite.

931
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:17,120
I don't care what it's bloody called.
I just wanna know how much money it is.

932
00:56:17,198 --> 00:56:19,325
We've had many famous visitors
over theyears.

933
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:23,596
It's called the Churchill Suite
because...

934
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,435
SirWinston stayed here
on two separate occasions.

935
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:29,271
We do hopeyou will enjoyyour stay.
Ifthere's anything at all--

936
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,437
- It's Melbourne.
- All right. Gentlemen, ladies...

937
00:56:31,512 --> 00:56:35,209
ifyou'll excuse me,
I have a rather important call.

938
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:38,343
A little bubbly? Have some champagne.
Come on. It's a big day.

939
00:56:38,419 --> 00:56:40,717
I'm so glad to seeyou.

940
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:44,155
Yes, yes.
A grand day this is.

941
00:56:44,225 --> 00:56:46,386
All right, how much?

942
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:48,053
Waiter.

943
00:56:51,132 --> 00:56:53,623
Right. Right.

944
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:59,068
What'd be the cost ofa plant
in Papua, New Guinea?

945
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,039
I'm gonna close Melbourne down.

946
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:06,376
- What?
- It's not being recorded.

947
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:11,282
I know!
That's why I'm trying to listen!

948
00:57:11,352 --> 00:57:13,286
They shouldn't be so greedy.

949
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:15,754
Right.
Fax Atlanta about this.

950
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:17,586
Beijing called.

951
00:57:17,658 --> 00:57:21,651
We've got the television rights
to their public executions.

952
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,821
Worldwide?

953
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,388
- Five guys a week, guaranteed!
- Beauty!

954
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:30,994
This is what satellite television was
invented for. Totally cross-cultural.

955
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,098
So Vic-- Vince--
what do want to talk about?

956
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:37,303
- The zoo's going reallywell, Dad.
- Haveyou got the figures?

957
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,871
It's taken some time to whip
the Brits into shape.

958
00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:44,509
Got some amazing plans.
You're going to be proud ofme.

959
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:46,018
Just give me the figures.

960
00:57:47,288 --> 00:57:49,620
You're not gonna believe
what I put together, Dad.

961
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,180
Probably not.

962
00:57:53,494 --> 00:57:55,860
I reallywant to thankyou, Dad,
for accommodating me, schedule-wise.

963
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,696
It means a lot to me, both as
an employee and flesh- and blood-wise.

964
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,600
Cut the crap.
It was on myway.

965
00:58:08,509 --> 00:58:10,534
Done reallywell, haven't I, Dad?

966
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,678
Chip offthe old block, eh?

967
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:17,616
- I'm reading.
- Sorry.

968
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:21,451
- Something here doesn't add up.
- Ifyou read between the lines--

969
00:58:21,522 --> 00:58:23,251
What areyou doing?

970
00:58:23,324 --> 00:58:25,258
The tarantula's escaped.

971
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,958
What? What?

972
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:34,627
- The tarantula's loose.
- What?

973
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,128
Told you I'd kick ass, Dad.

974
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:40,538
What I reallywanted to ask is...

975
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:43,475
I feel really close toyou, Dad...

976
00:58:43,544 --> 00:58:45,535
these last few moments...

977
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:47,547
and I was wondering,
could I get a raise?

978
00:58:47,615 --> 00:58:50,846
- Out ofthe question.
- Why?

979
00:58:51,886 --> 00:58:54,548
- I don't have the money.
- You got six billion dollars!

980
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:57,557
Seven, but things
are tight right now.

981
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,150
What the hell's making
all this bloody noise?

982
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:01,525
Who's there?

983
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,928
What about a small advance
on my inheritance?

984
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,092
What inheritance?

985
00:59:10,037 --> 00:59:12,005
I'm your son.
You have to leave me something.

986
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:13,563
Why?

987
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:16,667
'Causeyou screwed up
mywhole childhood!

988
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:19,440
How could I have?
Wasn't even there.

989
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,344
Besides, I'm not leaving.

990
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:32,390
- What doyou mean?
- The moment I become seriously ill...

991
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,896
I'm being cryogenically frozen
till they find a cure.

992
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:38,796
All the money goes into a trust
till I get back.

993
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,027
You mean you're not gonna die?

994
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:42,694
Bad news, eh?

995
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,437
Get ahold ofyourself.

996
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,603
That was a sheep.

997
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,012
You mean, you're gonna be immortal?

998
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:57,812
Nowyou got it!

999
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:02,345
This cryogenic stuffisn't cheap.
It's costing me an arm and a leg.

1000
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:12,161
Sheep are exactly
like people, you know.

1001
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:16,567
Give 'em a couple ofmeals a day,
theyjust stand there quietly...

1002
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:18,571
till you eat 'em.

1003
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,245
- Christ!
- What?

1004
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:31,547
That's the biggest
goddamn spider I ever saw.

1005
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,019
Yeah. That's probablywhat was
making the bleating noise.

1006
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:38,115
- I don't like spiders. Kill it!
- It's terminated.

1007
01:00:38,192 --> 01:00:39,659
Damn!

1008
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,127
I missed!

1009
01:00:42,196 --> 01:00:45,393
It must've gone under the sofa.
I'll wait here.

1010
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:47,696
Listen, Vince, you might
have to close the zoo down.

1011
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:48,792
What?

1012
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:53,499
I can make a lot ofmoney ifI sell it
to theJapanese as a golfcourse.

1013
01:00:53,574 --> 01:00:55,838
- But Dad, I'm--
- Shut up.

1014
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,539
And don't mention it to Willa yet.
Come on. Let's eat. I'm starving.

1015
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,174
- Hello, Mr. McCain.
- Hello, Willa.

1016
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,616
- Am I early?
- You'rejust in time. How's business?

1017
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:08,018
- So great. I have so much--
- Good, let's eat.

1018
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:13,157
- Do I look all right?
- Great, yeah. Never better.

1019
01:01:13,227 --> 01:01:16,162
- How'd it go?
- Reallywell. Let's go.

1020
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,926
- Is that blood?
- Yeah, spider bite.

1021
01:01:21,002 --> 01:01:22,936
Come on. Let's go.

1022
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:28,266
Terry? Terry!

1023
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:31,800
Thereyou are.
Terry-erries!

1024
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:34,541
- Got him!
- Her bag!

1025
01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:51,424
Never again.

1026
01:01:54,535 --> 01:01:56,127
Not at my age.

1027
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:02,098
Hello.

1028
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,710
Hello.

1029
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,542
What areyou doing?

1030
01:02:08,616 --> 01:02:12,347
- Well, to cut a long story short--
- No, give me the long version.

1031
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,015
Oh, right.
Well, I took the room next door--

1032
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,287
just for the evening--
andjust now I noticed that...

1033
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,126
the interconnecting doorwasn't locked,
so I strolled in out ofcuriosity.

1034
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,893
You took the room next door?

1035
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:27,900
- Yes, I wanted to...
-Just for the evening?

1036
01:02:27,968 --> 01:02:29,902
listen to some music!

1037
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:56,656
Good news.
Customer pull-through--

1038
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,097
way, way, way up!

1039
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:02,431
And the feedback
has been sensational.

1040
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:05,233
And I want to thankyou
all personally for...

1041
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:10,505
the enthusiasm you've shown vis-a-vis
our latest, new, innovative initiative.

1042
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,910
You look fantastic!

1043
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,609
You're no longer a bunch
ofsmelly old animal keepers!

1044
01:03:16,684 --> 01:03:18,845
No. As oftoday, you are official...

1045
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:22,616
theme-zoo visitation
enhancement facilitators.

1046
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:25,652
Now for the really big news.

1047
01:03:25,726 --> 01:03:29,127
This is it, ladies and gentlemen,
the coup de zoo.

1048
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:32,131
Ifyou'll just look this way.

1049
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,468
- Look! A panda! How did you get it?
- It wasn't easy.

1050
01:03:46,547 --> 01:03:50,347
- It's beautiful. Look.
- Don't!

1051
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:53,011
- Don't! Stop!
- It's a dangerous animal!

1052
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,783
Stay away!
Back! Go on!

1053
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:58,824
Get out, get out,
get out, get out!

1054
01:04:07,101 --> 01:04:10,400
You diabolical bastard!

1055
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:14,833
You can't put an
animatronic animal in a zoo!

1056
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,134
- Why not?
- It's not real!

1057
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:20,680
So what?
It gaveyou a thrill.

1058
01:04:20,748 --> 01:04:22,682
People come from
all over the world...

1059
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:25,719
who have never seen a panda
in theirwhole miserable life.

1060
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:28,812
It's not a real thrill, is it?
It's artificial!

1061
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:32,484
Having pandas in England
is artificial, for God's sake!

1062
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,825
What doyou want me to do? Put everyone
on a plane and fly them to Africa?

1063
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:37,693
Africa?

1064
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:41,326
- They come from China.
- Not this baby.

1065
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:44,428
This was handmade in Belgium.
I don't want some cheap Chinese panda.

1066
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,673
What's the matter?
What is wrong with you people?

1067
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:53,426
I can't stand
all this negativity!

1068
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,752
- Why aren'tyou pleased?
- Go home!

1069
01:04:57,597 --> 01:04:59,792
What does it take to get
appreciated around here?

1070
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:02,300
This is a hit zoo, thanks to me!

1071
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:05,361
People come here to feel
their connection with nature.

1072
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:07,372
You don't get that
with electric pandas.

1073
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,374
We'rejust giving them
what theywant!

1074
01:05:09,442 --> 01:05:11,876
What about the quality
ofthe experience?

1075
01:05:11,945 --> 01:05:13,845
No, Rod says quality
has neverworked for him.

1076
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:15,744
Right! Everything he touches
gets tackier.

1077
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:18,409
- That's the price ofsuccess.
- Vince!

1078
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:22,444
I had an extraordinary
experienceyesterday.

1079
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:24,456
What sort ofexperience?

1080
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,753
- With him.
- With him?

1081
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,828
A sort ofcontact.

1082
01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:34,092
What?

1083
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:39,236
- You couldn't understand, could you?
- Wait! Yes, yes, yes!

1084
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:42,002
Yes, yes, yes!
I think I do!

1085
01:05:42,075 --> 01:05:45,567
I don't turn you on anymore because
you've got the hots for a gorilla!

1086
01:05:46,646 --> 01:05:48,841
It's not sexual.

1087
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:51,748
He's clearly more attractive
than I am, isn't he? Yes!

1088
01:05:51,818 --> 01:05:54,582
But let me askyou something.
How much does he earn?

1089
01:05:54,654 --> 01:05:58,283
How much does Mr. Gorilla
take home at the end ofthe week?

1090
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:01,816
Not a lot!
A couple ofbananas!

1091
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:04,329
You know how much I'm worth?
Doyou have any idea how much money...

1092
01:06:04,397 --> 01:06:07,833
I have made since I've been
at this stinking zoo?

1093
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:11,997
1 .2 million dollars!

1094
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:16,168
- Yeah! Think about it!
- What areyou talking about?

1095
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:20,702
I've made nearly 800,000
in sponsorship deals in cash...

1096
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,045
plus consultancy fees,
plus commission on animal futures.

1097
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:26,551
You've been stealing?

1098
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:32,087
No matterwhat I do orwhat I wear,
I can never impress you.

1099
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:35,355
- You'rejust like my father!
- This is going to close the zoo.

1100
01:06:35,428 --> 01:06:38,591
So what?

1101
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,860
You and me, we walk away
with two million dollars.

1102
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:43,562
The place closes. What a shame.
TheJaps buy it--

1103
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:46,628
Fore! '' Hore'' in one!

1104
01:06:46,706 --> 01:06:48,970
You know whatyou are?

1105
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,634
You're pronoid.

1106
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,337
'' Pronoid?''

1107
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:54,937
It means that contrary to all
the available evidence...

1108
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:56,948
you actually think
that people likeyou.

1109
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:02,047
Your perception oflife is that it's one
long benefit dinner in your honor...

1110
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:06,115
with everybody cheering you on
and wanting you to win everything.

1111
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:08,592
You thinkyou're
the prince, Vince.

1112
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:12,222
Well, let me tell you something.
You will put back every last cent...

1113
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:14,766
into that zoo account
by 1 0:00 tomorrow morning...

1114
01:07:14,834 --> 01:07:17,860
or I am gonna call your daddy...

1115
01:07:17,937 --> 01:07:19,837
and tell on you.

1116
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,344
Hello.
Ready for dinner?

1117
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:38,247
Fine, let's leave it.

1118
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,854
Perhaps I should explain why I didn't
have any trousers on last night.

1119
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:46,524
- It doesn't matter.
- No, right.

1120
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:49,159
Butyou're wondering why the girls
didn't have any kit on either?

1121
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,764
Look, I'm sorry, I--

1122
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:58,470
I don't know what I've done
to upsetyou.

1123
01:08:00,246 --> 01:08:01,941
It's notyou, Rollo.

1124
01:08:05,952 --> 01:08:08,147
I love this zoo.

1125
01:08:08,221 --> 01:08:10,280
I love zoo too.

1126
01:08:10,356 --> 01:08:12,153
The-- The zoo too.

1127
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:22,328
It's all going wrong.
And now Vince has been stealing.

1128
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:25,166
- Stealing?
- Yeah, and if McCain finds out...

1129
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:27,468
I don't know what he's gonna do.

1130
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,637
Okay, look. Let's find out
how obvious it is to Atlanta, all right?

1131
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:35,738
First we'll see ifthe bank
reconciliation figures...

1132
01:08:35,815 --> 01:08:38,545
and the cash flow tie up.

1133
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:41,143
Then we'll--

1134
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,822
Thankyou.

1135
01:08:57,737 --> 01:08:59,500
You know about this stuff?

1136
01:08:59,572 --> 01:09:01,506
I was in the police for 20 years.

1137
01:09:01,574 --> 01:09:05,408
It's notjust hitting people on the head
with dicks-- Sticks! Sticks.

1138
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:06,911
Sorry.

1139
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:10,882
Damn.
You see, it is pretty obvious to--

1140
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:18,085
It is pretty obvious
ifthey know what they're--

1141
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:28,823
Willa!
I'm putting the money back...

1142
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:30,927
but only because
I have feelings fory--

1143
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,939
Oh, Rollo, not again!

1144
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,101
How doyou do it? I'm gonna call
the zoo vet and getyou fixed.

1145
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:40,111
Get the bimbo
out of Miss Weston's office.

1146
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:49,479
I can understand the gorilla,
but not Mr. Disgusting.

1147
01:09:49,556 --> 01:09:52,150
- Vince!
- What is it? He drugged you?

1148
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:55,251
Doyou owe him money?
Was it a dare? What?

1149
01:09:55,328 --> 01:09:57,296
He's very attractive.

1150
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,062
Attractive?

1151
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:07,735
Attractive? How can you touch him?
Look at that suit!

1152
01:10:07,807 --> 01:10:10,071
The suit comes off.

1153
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:15,138
I just got an image ofthat!
You must be desperate!

1154
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:18,513
- Don't speak to her like that.
- '' Don't speak to her like that!''

1155
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:22,043
Oh, engaged already, are we? You broke
up with that lemur pretty quick.

1156
01:10:22,121 --> 01:10:25,784
Whose heart areyou gonna break
next week? Some warthog's?

1157
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:27,723
- Where areyou going?
- I'm out ofhere.

1158
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:29,853
- Leave me the money.
- I think not.

1159
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:32,864
- Vince, it's notyours!
- It is too!

1160
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:36,834
I stole it whileyou were two-timing me
with the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

1161
01:10:36,903 --> 01:10:39,371
I wasn't even one-timing you.

1162
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:41,407
- We never had a relationship.
- You were in love with me.

1163
01:10:41,474 --> 01:10:44,102
- Oh, please!
- Youjust can't admit it, can you?

1164
01:10:44,177 --> 01:10:46,668
You better hand that back
ifyou know what's best foryou.

1165
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:51,676
What century areyou from?

1166
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:57,913
Paisley!

1167
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:03,790
Areyou insane?
I mean, what is the attraction?

1168
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:06,525
Well, for one thing,
he likes animals.

1169
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:09,500
- He doesn'tjust like 'em. He f--
- Miss Weston...

1170
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,503
finds them very attractive.

1171
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:14,165
Doyou mind? We're trying
to have a board meeting here.

1172
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:18,336
We've been delegated by an emergency
meeting ofthe Keepers Committee.

1173
01:11:18,411 --> 01:11:19,571
What emergency?

1174
01:11:19,646 --> 01:11:22,979
Last night Rod McCain said
he might turn us into a golfcourse.

1175
01:11:23,049 --> 01:11:24,983
- He did not!
- Yes, he did.

1176
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:27,212
- I was in the cupboard listening.
- The cupboard?

1177
01:11:27,286 --> 01:11:31,416
- He was too.
- It's true.

1178
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:34,688
- I wantyour cage cleared by 9:00!
- What did he say?

1179
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:36,695
- I'd like to make five points.
- In a moment.

1180
01:11:36,763 --> 01:11:40,631
One: This zoo provides
a invaluable amenity.

1181
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,567
- Ifwe didn't have the 20%...
- Any attempt to close it down--

1182
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:45,194
by the end ofthe month--

1183
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:48,104
- Bugsy, please!
- Shut up! I can't think!

1184
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:50,734
- Not to mention mass protests--
- Hey! Yo!

1185
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,836
Mouth-boy! Zip it!

1186
01:11:54,881 --> 01:11:57,247
Not to mention
mass protests--

1187
01:11:57,316 --> 01:11:59,807
My life is falling apart.
He will not shut up!

1188
01:11:59,886 --> 01:12:02,411
- Financial markets ofthe world--
- Shut up!

1189
01:12:04,691 --> 01:12:08,286
Second: In the conservation view,
there'd be considerable disruption--

1190
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:10,591
I don't believe it.

1191
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:13,325
I want to have a private word with
Vince whileyou're getting the police.

1192
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:15,799
Okay, Rod.
Soyou're gonna close the zoo?

1193
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:18,302
Too right. It's way under the 20%.

1194
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:20,236
You realizeyou're going
to have to shoot the animals.

1195
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:23,537
- So?
- Well, this is England, mate.

1196
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:28,103
We'll get some tame vet to say
they've caught some disgusting disease.

1197
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:30,012
- Pity this isn't Texas.
- Why?

1198
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,347
We could charge people
to do it for us.

1199
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:54,765
Fifthly: May I remind you
it takes at least 1 8 months...

1200
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:57,071
to decommission a zoological
facility ofthis kind.

1201
01:12:57,143 --> 01:12:59,771
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- My God! He's gone mad.

1202
01:12:59,846 --> 01:13:02,212
What's this, the latest
Harvard Business School technique?

1203
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,909
Or merely an extension
ofyour policy ofconsultation?

1204
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:06,781
- You would rather talk than live?
- You won't shoot me.

1205
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:09,481
- I will!
- Not with a 7.65 Baretta .34.

1206
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:13,150
- Oh, really? Why not?
- The safety catch is still on.

1207
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,628
Grab him!
Get the gun, get the gun!

1208
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:21,124
What in bloody hell's
going on here?

1209
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,101
Dad! You look great!
Howya doin'?

1210
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:26,161
Clear off, you freaks!

1211
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,708
- Who in bloody hell areyou?
- This is Rollo Lee.

1212
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:34,307
Mr. McCain. I'd like to make
five points about the zoo.

1213
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,348
- Go away.
- Point one: The zoo--

1214
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:44,219
- You've been stealing from me again.
- Stealing?

1215
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:48,056
- My God, I've caughtyou red-handed.
- Oh, that!

1216
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:49,822
I wasjust putting that back.
I borrowed that--

1217
01:13:49,896 --> 01:13:52,660
- Neville's gone to the police.
- What?

1218
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:57,999
- You're going tojail, Vince.
- Oh, no! Not again!

1219
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:01,096
Mr. McCain, Vince'll put the money back.
I promise.

1220
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:04,632
Sorry, Willa, but I'm gonna
have to close the zoo too.

1221
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,168
What? Why? We're up to 20%!

1222
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:11,546
- No, you're not.
- Oh, we are! We are with this!

1223
01:14:11,617 --> 01:14:13,847
- Areyou sure?
- I swear it.

1224
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,217
Nearly 25.

1225
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:20,620
All right, I'll leave it open.
But don't let it drop.

1226
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:22,684
Sayyou won't have me arrested
or I'll kill you.

1227
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:30,500
- You won't shoot me.
- Oh, yes, I will.

1228
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,539
You haven't got the guts
to shootyour own father.

1229
01:14:33,606 --> 01:14:36,734
Yes, I do! Get back!

1230
01:14:38,344 --> 01:14:40,209
Go on then.

1231
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:44,041
Go on, you spineless twat!

1232
01:14:44,116 --> 01:14:47,882
See?
You're no son ofmine.

1233
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:50,354
Oh, yeah, good idea!

1234
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:53,221
Give us all a good laugh,
you wuss!

1235
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:56,728
I am not a wuss!

1236
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:58,593
Wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss!

1237
01:14:58,664 --> 01:15:02,332
- Oh, God, I hateyou.
- I hateyou!

1238
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:07,926
- Gimme that gun.
- It's all right. It's a Baretta .34--

1239
01:15:11,642 --> 01:15:13,371
You're fired.

1240
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,049
Is he dead?

1241
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:36,063
Oh, great.

1242
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:40,229
Terrific. He decides to keep
the zoo open, soyou kill him.

1243
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:43,097
Brilliant. Well done.

1244
01:15:43,173 --> 01:15:46,870
Thankyou so much, especially for
shooting him right between the eyes...

1245
01:15:46,944 --> 01:15:49,538
so that it doesn't
look like an accident...

1246
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:52,844
because the people at Octopus will know
he was coming here to close us down.

1247
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:55,942
So there's our motive
for murdering him. Stunning.

1248
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:59,352
Well, Mr. Brain of Britain,
what are we going to tell the police...

1249
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:02,051
who are, ofcourse,
already on theirway here?

1250
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:06,289
Another example
ofthe thoroughness ofyour plan.

1251
01:16:06,363 --> 01:16:08,024
Go on. I'm all ears.

1252
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,259
What doyou suggest we do
with the dead body...

1253
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:14,327
ofthe incredibly famous man...

1254
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:17,464
whoyou havejust assassinated?

1255
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:22,443
Sorry, I didn't quite catch it.
What?

1256
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:25,572
What was it?
Pop him in the blender?

1257
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:31,253
I know he's dead!
I did notice!

1258
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:33,084
Well-- What?

1259
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,697
Give it, give it, give it...

1260
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,896
beforeyou shoot somebody else!

1261
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:54,601
What areyou doing?

1262
01:16:55,379 --> 01:16:57,574
- I'm freezing him.
- Why?

1263
01:16:57,648 --> 01:17:00,583
He's gotta be cryogenically
frozen until they find a cure!

1264
01:17:00,651 --> 01:17:02,642
- A cure?
- Yeah.

1265
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,586
- He has a bullet in the brain.
- Well, get more ice!

1266
01:17:05,656 --> 01:17:09,592
Vince, there is no cure
for a bullet in the brain.

1267
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,823
It is very fatal.

1268
01:17:17,601 --> 01:17:20,832
- You mean he's dead?
- Yes.

1269
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:26,640
- And he's not coming back?
- No. I'm sorry.

1270
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:39,549
I'm so happy!
You're dead!

1271
01:17:39,623 --> 01:17:43,024
You're dead!
You're dead!

1272
01:17:43,093 --> 01:17:47,052
You big, fat bastard!

1273
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,064
Yes, Bugsy!

1274
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,534
High five! Low five!
I loveya!

1275
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,995
Life begins!

1276
01:17:59,343 --> 01:18:01,607
So what are we gonna do?

1277
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,669
I never have to listen
toyou again, do I?

1278
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:07,148
With your, ''You're no son ofmine,
you miserable little worm.

1279
01:18:07,217 --> 01:18:11,210
You've been a disappointment
to me since the day...

1280
01:18:11,288 --> 01:18:14,052
your mother
farted you out ofherwomb.''

1281
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:15,386
Good idea!

1282
01:18:15,459 --> 01:18:17,859
I need something to glue
the mustache down with.

1283
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:20,192
I need things for the hair.

1284
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:24,867
- Neville, that's good, mate.
- That's terrible.

1285
01:18:24,935 --> 01:18:27,199
Oh, no, those eyebrows are terrible.

1286
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,238
- Squintyour eyes together.
- Like that?

1287
01:18:29,306 --> 01:18:31,399
- Right like that. Hold that.
- Careful!

1288
01:18:31,475 --> 01:18:33,773
- Glasses!
- Oh, yeah, get the glasses.

1289
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:38,408
- Give me cotton balls.
- Hello, Inspector.

1290
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:41,642
Let's compare them.
Come on.

1291
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:45,081
Mr. McCain looks paler-- much.

1292
01:18:45,155 --> 01:18:47,123
- What doyou think?
- He's dead, you idiot.

1293
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:51,627
- Oh, my God, it's not going to work.
- Oh, yes, it will.

1294
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:55,756
- No, no, no. We shall all go tojail.
- It's gonna go like clockwork.

1295
01:18:55,832 --> 01:19:00,201
Hello, Neville.
Hello, Inspector.

1296
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,068
- That's very good!
- Doyou have the will?

1297
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,200
- Very good indeed.
- It's very short.

1298
01:19:06,276 --> 01:19:08,403
Yeah. The simpler it is,
the more watertight.

1299
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,912
So we're going to set the zoo up
as a trust-- that's for all ofus--

1300
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:14,178
and everything else goes to
''my son Vincent McCain, absolutely.''

1301
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:17,778
- You mean, we get the zoo?
- Yeah.

1302
01:19:20,524 --> 01:19:22,924
Let's get this body
up to my office. Let's go!

1303
01:19:22,993 --> 01:19:26,121
- I don't think this is fair.
- Fair?

1304
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,630
- You get to run the zoo with Willa.
- Yes.

1305
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,599
Well, I think I love her.

1306
01:19:31,668 --> 01:19:34,159
- What?
- I love Willa.

1307
01:19:36,306 --> 01:19:37,796
No, I love her.

1308
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:40,342
No, I love her.

1309
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,935
- I love her.
- I love Willa!

1310
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:47,109
Look, I get Willa,
you get seven billion dollars.

1311
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:53,251
- Right. Right, okay.
- There's the gun.

1312
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,652
Here we go.

1313
01:19:55,725 --> 01:19:58,455
Come along, come along.
We haven't got much time.

1314
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:02,123
- I'm worried about fooling Neville.
- Neville's gonna be tough.

1315
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:04,599
- Oh, my God!
- Hello, Willa.

1316
01:20:04,668 --> 01:20:07,637
Hello, Neville! Hello!

1317
01:20:07,704 --> 01:20:12,971
Hello, Neville. Excuse me, I'm going
to go have a pee. I'll be right there.

1318
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:16,240
- Right, boss.
- Hi! Great to seeyou.

1319
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:18,474
Hello. Willa Weston.

1320
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:21,210
ChiefSuperintendent Masefield,
Sgt. Scott and Sgt. Irving.

1321
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:24,185
- Rod will be with you in a moment.
- I'll be a moment.

1322
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:30,625
Power!
Gets 'em every time.

1323
01:20:30,694 --> 01:20:33,185
Oh, yeah. That's better.

1324
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:40,067
Thankyou, my dear.

1325
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:43,401
Hello, Neville.
Hello, Inspector.

1326
01:20:43,473 --> 01:20:46,636
I'd like to introduceyou
to Inspector Masefield.

1327
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,871
G'day. Good on ya.

1328
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:51,539
- Good outfit.
- It's an honor to meetyou, Mr. McCain.

1329
01:20:51,615 --> 01:20:54,982
Well, goody.
Hello, Neville.

1330
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:57,884
- Hello, Rod.
- Hello, Nev.

1331
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:04,156
- Haveyou spoken to Vince?
- Yes, I have.

1332
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:07,094
- Shall we arrest him now, sir?
- No, that won't be necessary.

1333
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:10,360
Vince and I have had a long talk.

1334
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:13,834
Between ourselves,
it was quite emotional.

1335
01:21:13,904 --> 01:21:16,099
You haven't killed him,
haveyou, Rod?

1336
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:18,106
Nobody's killed anybody!

1337
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:23,770
Moron! No, I mean...

1338
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:25,678
that we've had a reconciliation.

1339
01:21:25,749 --> 01:21:28,411
- Isn't it wonderful?
- A reconciliation?

1340
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,010
That's right, Neville.
Back, Neville.

1341
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:35,990
- Soyou're not pressing charges?
- On the contrary, Inspector.

1342
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,152
Not at all.
But I would likeyour assistance.

1343
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:40,890
I'vejust made out a new will
and I'd likeyou to witness it.

1344
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:43,262
- A new will?
- Bend down, Neville.

1345
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,631
- It would be a privilege, Mr. McCain.
- Thankyou.

1346
01:21:45,702 --> 01:21:47,966
What doyou mean, a new will?

1347
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:51,940
As a result ofmy talkwith Vince,
I've decided to leave Octopus to him.

1348
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:54,476
- What?
- Hold still!

1349
01:21:54,544 --> 01:21:57,809
- Leave Octopus to Vince?
- Shut up! He's a good boy.

1350
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:00,816
Good boy?
He's a total wanker, Rod!

1351
01:22:00,884 --> 01:22:02,818
I won't haveyou
talk about him like that!

1352
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:07,388
Rod, he steals from you.

1353
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:10,654
That's only to get the attention I
should've given him when he was a child!

1354
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:13,628
Butyou can't leave Octopus
to that asshole!

1355
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:17,258
That asshole is my son!

1356
01:22:19,636 --> 01:22:21,160
I love him.

1357
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:24,229
Butyou're always saying
what a complete wuss he is.

1358
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:25,672
I am not--

1359
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:30,806
going to letyou
talk about him in that way.

1360
01:22:47,618 --> 01:22:49,848
- Areyou all right, mate?
- I'm feeling emotional.

1361
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,512
What's that?

1362
01:22:52,856 --> 01:22:56,622
- It's where I keep my Kleenex.
- He's very depressed, Neville.

1363
01:22:56,694 --> 01:22:59,527
Isn't it wonderful to see a man
get in touch with his feelings?

1364
01:22:59,597 --> 01:23:01,861
- There's something going on here.
- Oh, I hope so.

1365
01:23:01,932 --> 01:23:05,891
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I need to be alone.

1366
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:09,736
Feeling a bit suicidal.

1367
01:23:09,807 --> 01:23:14,073
What?
This isn't like Rod!

1368
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:17,676
Hey! He's in the shed!

1369
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:20,581
- What?
- He's in the shed!

1370
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:24,412
Gentlemen, I admit it.

1371
01:23:24,488 --> 01:23:28,049
I behaved disgracefully
to my son in the past.

1372
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:30,491
I don't know ifI can
live with myself.

1373
01:23:30,561 --> 01:23:33,928
So, going to the shed.

1374
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:36,990
Mother always said that when
you're naughty, you go to the shed.

1375
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:38,762
And I've been naughty.

1376
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:42,638
God, I'm depressed!

1377
01:23:52,049 --> 01:23:53,346
Going to the shed.

1378
01:23:57,354 --> 01:23:59,447
- It's going well. Where's the body?
- Over there.

1379
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:04,259
Come on, come on! Give it here.
Let's go! We gotta go!

1380
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:08,124
What is going on?

1381
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:11,565
- He and Vince did get very upset.
- It was so touching.

1382
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:15,799
Oh, God. I've undervalued
Vince's talent all theseyears.

1383
01:24:15,873 --> 01:24:19,468
And his extraordinary charm.
Let's not forget that.

1384
01:24:19,543 --> 01:24:22,808
What a dear boy he was,
myVince, and still is.

1385
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,214
Good-looking young lad.
Christ, he's attractive.

1386
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:29,479
- Such style!
- Where is Vince?

1387
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:33,045
- That's a good question.
- Vince?

1388
01:24:33,123 --> 01:24:36,923
I neverwent to one ofmy
birthday parties, the bastard!

1389
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:40,657
- His! His!
- His birthday parties, the bastard!

1390
01:24:40,731 --> 01:24:45,361
I'm the bastard! I'm such a bastard
I can't stand it anymore!

1391
01:24:45,436 --> 01:24:49,372
I can't face it! Oh, the shame!
I feel terrible!

1392
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,069
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I've got a pretty shrewd idea...

1393
01:24:53,143 --> 01:24:55,407
it's not gonna be very nice!

1394
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:58,277
- I'm taking the wuss's way out!
- Is he all right?

1395
01:24:58,349 --> 01:25:00,977
He's probably in one
ofhis black moods.

1396
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:02,848
What black moods?

1397
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:08,290
End ofthe road! I can't take it
any longer! I'm going to finish it now!

1398
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:11,021
My God!

1399
01:25:11,095 --> 01:25:13,529
- Has he got a gun?
- Gun? What gun?

1400
01:25:13,597 --> 01:25:15,758
Where's the gun?
The gun!

1401
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,959
What?

1402
01:25:18,502 --> 01:25:22,131
I'm at the end ofthe road!
I'm very near the end.

1403
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,731
I'm gonna--
I can see the end ofthe road.

1404
01:25:24,808 --> 01:25:27,936
I'm makin' up my mind.
It's not an easy--

1405
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:30,707
He's forgiven you.
Be sensible!

1406
01:25:30,781 --> 01:25:33,978
At least it looks like
the end ofthe road.

1407
01:25:34,051 --> 01:25:36,212
Now I'm thinkin' about it.

1408
01:25:39,857 --> 01:25:41,324
I'll make my mind up
any moment now.

1409
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:56,165
I loveyou, kid.
Forgive me.

1410
01:26:19,897 --> 01:26:22,024
Hurry! Hurry!

1411
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:24,795
One! Two! Come on!

1412
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:31,699
- Oh, no!
- Don't look!

1413
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:34,710
- Whywereyour men so slow?
- Sorry, we didn't realize--

1414
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:36,803
- This isn't Rod McCain.
- What?

1415
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,476
I spent 1 5 years working at Octopus,
and this isn't Rod McCa--

1416
01:26:41,552 --> 01:26:43,486
I was in the garden
when I heard a gunshot--

1417
01:26:43,554 --> 01:26:46,284
- Father!
- I'm afraid he's dead.

1418
01:26:46,356 --> 01:26:47,618
- No!
- Yes.

1419
01:26:49,993 --> 01:26:52,621
- What areyou doing?
- He shot himself.

1420
01:26:52,696 --> 01:26:54,664
No! Why?

1421
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:57,291
He wasn't in one ofhis
black moods, was he?

1422
01:26:57,367 --> 01:27:00,131
Hejust couldn't live
with what he'd done toyou.

1423
01:27:00,204 --> 01:27:02,263
- But I'd forgiven him.
- I know.

1424
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:05,968
Oh, Dad! Dad! Dad!

1425
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:08,508
- Vince.
- What?

1426
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:10,513
- There's something you should know.
- What?

1427
01:27:10,581 --> 01:27:13,243
He left Octopus toyou.

1428
01:27:15,419 --> 01:27:18,445
So he did love me after all!

1429
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,924
You're fired.

1430
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:02,264
Rollo, there's something
I need to askyou.

1431
01:28:02,332 --> 01:28:04,596
It's about sex.

1432
01:28:04,668 --> 01:28:06,329
What?

1433
01:28:06,403 --> 01:28:09,236
Look, I know whatyou like.

1434
01:28:09,306 --> 01:28:12,742
When we first called,
you had three women in your bed.

1435
01:28:12,809 --> 01:28:18,076
- What?
- Remember Mitzi and Suzie and Cindy?

1436
01:28:18,148 --> 01:28:21,777
And then
when we came toyour room...

1437
01:28:21,852 --> 01:28:24,548
you had at least four girls
in the bathroom.

1438
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:29,857
Theywere all overyou
in the cage.

1439
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:32,452
And then the other night in the hotel,
you had two girls...

1440
01:28:32,529 --> 01:28:35,726
as well as the--

1441
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:40,995
Look, Willa--

1442
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:45,269
Look, Rollo,
I really likeyou.

1443
01:28:45,342 --> 01:28:48,834
But I wasjust wondering
ifone woman...

1444
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:52,177
could ever be enough...

1445
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:55,013
for a man likeyou.

1446
01:28:58,088 --> 01:29:01,080
Oh, what the hell.
Let's give it a try.

1447
01:29:10,734 --> 01:29:12,793
- But I have to warn you, Wanda--
- Willa.

1448
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:21,268
I haven't slept with one woman
for a very, very long time.
