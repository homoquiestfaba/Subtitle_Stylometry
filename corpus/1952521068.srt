00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:35,533
[dramatic piano music]

00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:41,437
" "

3
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:45,603
- You know, there's been a lot
of talk about Abraham Lincoln.

4
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,408
But the president we need today
is not Abraham Lincoln.

5
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:51,712
The president we need
today is Thomas Jefferson.

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,413
He said that we needed
a revolution every generation.

7
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,422
Thomas Jefferson said
you have to be ready

8
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,321
in order to preserve
the vitality

9
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,189
of your liberty
and your freedom

10
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:03,888
to defend it not by
overthrowing anything else

11
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,295
except for what you
have been holding in your head

12
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,095
that may not be
applicable anymore.

13
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:10,396
We've gotten very lazy.

14
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,130
We're many generations overdue

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,001
for a revolution
in our thinking.

16
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,007
I'm not talking about
blood and violence;

17
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,169
although I'm afraid
that's already happening.

18
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:20,769
I'm talking about a revolution

19
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,177
that's probably
the hardest kind,

20
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,307
the kind that takes place
inside the human soul

21
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,010
and the human mind,

22
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,746
to be able
to tear everything down,

23
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,151
throw everything out,

24
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,018
and start with a completely
fresh piece of paper

25
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:34,082
and say, "Okay, how do we
solve this problem? "

26
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:43,157
[people speaking indistinctly]

27
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,873
- Can you talk to me
a little bit, like

28
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,977
I mean, who are you?

29
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,455
- Listen, this is not a plan

30
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,520
that would make sense to anybody
except God.

31
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:15,931
You know, I gave up trying to
figure that out a long time ago.

32
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,129
I was born into a family
deeply connected

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,637
to the U.S.
intelligence community.

34
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,298
My mother had been
a cryptanalyst

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,776
at the Army Security Agency
and NSA in World War ll.

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,007
Her work product went
to the President Roosevelt

37
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:34,542
and to Secretary of War Stimson
and Cordell Hull at State.

38
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:37,248
My father was
an Air Force aviator

39
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,484
who went to work
for Martin Marietta

40
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,617
on contracts for the ClA
and the Air Force,

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,025
namely the Titan lllC

42
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:47,623
which put out the ClA's
Keyhole spy satellites.

43
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,726
At age 1 9 when I was interning
for LAPD,

44
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,168
I was pulled into
the chief's office

45
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:54,172
because somebody discovered
I had a Q clearance.

46
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,764
I didn't know anything about it.

47
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,172
I went home,
and I asked Dad he said,

48
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,904
"Yeah, because you're my son,

49
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,071
"and, you know,
they have to do that

50
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,274
because I might leave
my briefcase open."

51
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:05,715
But a Q was a secret
compartmentaliZed clearance

52
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,742
above top secret.

53
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,589
I went through UCLA
as a Republican

54
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,615
who didn't like anything
about the war in Vietnam,

55
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,684
who didn't like anything
about government

56
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:19,026
with this naive belief that,
you know,

57
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,190
you can get inside the system

58
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,097
and change it from the inside.

59
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:28,373
I became an L.A. policeman,

60
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,432
worked in South Central
Los Angeles in The Jungle,

61
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,272
and the ClA tried unofficially

62
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,175
to recruit me
into an operation

63
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,077
where they were smuggling drugs
into the country

64
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,480
back in 1 976, 1 977,

65
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,644
and I wouldn't get involved
in that.

66
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,653
You know, I thought,
"Well, jeeZ, this must be

67
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:45,121
"an isolated incident
of corruption.

68
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:46,419
"This must be something

69
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,517
"that everybody is gonna
want to correct right away.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,152
My God."

71
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,958
And of course
that was a mistake.

72
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,726
Basically my life disintegrated

73
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,427
because I was betrayed
by a woman

74
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:59,028
who worked for ClA,
who was my fiancée,

75
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,936
and when I said I wouldn't
get involved in drugs,

76
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:03,372
she disappeared, and people
started shooting at me,

77
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,899
and then it was
a matter of saving my life,

78
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:09,505
and the tools which
I acquired to save my life then,

79
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,108
which were, you know,
writing letters to congressmen,

80
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,412
getting on the record,

81
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:15,545
trying to get
newspaper stories written,

82
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,452
those were survival skills,

83
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,789
but it was also a part
of learning how things worked.

84
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,159
I was a mapmaker if you will,
a cartographer,

85
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,858
going out to try and map
how the world really worked

86
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:30,095
as opposed to the way
we were told it worked.

87
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,433
And the map that we have made

88
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:36,805
has proved so startlingly
accurate over ten years

89
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,833
whether they had to do
with gold prices

90
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:44,372
or geopolitical developments
or economic events.

91
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,644
The only thing that amaZes me

92
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:49,347
is the speed with which things
are falling apart,

93
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,615
and that message now

94
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,715
is the single most
important thing in my life.

95
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:54,986
It's the only thing in my life,

96
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:59,258
well, except for rock and roll
music, good music,

97
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:02,130
playing with my dog,
and long walks on the beach.

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,906
Rags, come here.
Rags, come here.

99
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,673
[dog whimpers]

100
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,010
[shushing]

101
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:22,145
I first became focused
on energy issues in late 2001,

102
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,917
just maybe a month or two
after 9/1 1.

103
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,151
I was contacted by a geologist,

104
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,990
a brilliant guy named
Dale Allen Pfeiffer,

105
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:32,326
who introduced me to the concept
of peak oil

106
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,229
and the basic issues
about energy

107
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,494
and helped me to realiZe

108
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,833
that there was a great deal
of evidence in 2001,

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,168
not only that peak oil
was very real

110
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,266
but that government agencies
were acting

111
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,675
and responding
as if it was very real.

112
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:54,543
All plastic is oil.

113
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:58,989
Most paints, all pesticides
are made from oil.

114
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:05,088
Everything from toothpaste to
tooth brushes is made from oil.

115
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,122
There are seven gallons of oil
in every tire.

116
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:12,000
There is nothing anywhere
in any combination

117
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:16,440
that will replace the edifice
built by fossil fuels.

118
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,339
Nothing.

119
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,042
Peak oil is probably now
very easy to explain,

120
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,018
much easier
than it was a long time ago.

121
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:32,854
People have felt what
$1 47 a barrel oil feels like.

122
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,525
Essentially peak oil is like if
you know what a bell curve is.

123
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:40,292
Goes up, comes down.

124
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,061
Peak oil is the point
of oil production

125
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,034
when you're at the top
of the bell curve.

126
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,401
And essentially
what that means is,

127
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:50,431
you've used up
half of the resource.

128
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,568
In the case of oil or
any other substance like that,

129
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,307
no matter how much money
you throw at it,

130
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,611
you're never going
to be able to increase

131
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,743
oil production above
where it was at peak.

132
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:08,856
As of 2008, the lnternational
Energy Agency has admitted

133
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:12,954
that there is a global 9%
decline rate in oil production.

134
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,729
That's the equivalent of
about 8 million barrels a day.

135
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:20,135
There is no way, having plucked
all the low-hanging fruit

136
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,036
and found the big reservoirs

137
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:26,476
that we are gonna able
to offset a 9% decline rate.

138
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,839
From a detective's standpoint,

139
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:36,047
if you are trying
to assemble a case, you know,

140
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,783
the multidimensional aspects
of a case-

141
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,415
means, motive, opportunity-

142
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,486
to understand what kind of force
drives events,

143
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,626
peak oil was almost
with the stroke

144
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,829
of, like,
a diamond cutter's knife

145
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,065
the single piece which started
to make

146
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,074
everything resonate
and make sense together.

147
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,238
- An economy
that runs on petroleum,

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,771
some 20 million barrels of it
a day.

149
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,580
- You will recall that when the
Bush administration took office

150
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,315
in January of 2001,

151
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:13,586
a National Energy
Policy Development Group,

152
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,990
the NEPDG, was formed

153
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,620
and placed under
the exclusive, private,

154
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:21,496
absolute control
of Vice President Dick Cheney.

155
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,932
Its records were kept a secret,

156
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,867
its minutes were kept a secret,

157
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,236
seven pages were released
as a result of two lawsuits,

158
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:32,004
and it clearly shows that that
task force was looking saying,

159
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,305
"How much oil is there?

160
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,210
Where is it?
Who owns it?"

161
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,975
They knew that this was coming
for a long time.

162
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,245
It has been known
that this event,

163
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,548
this collapse,
this crash, was coming.

164
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,575
- Who they were,

165
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,917
we can't even get information

166
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,719
as to who was involved
and what they were doing.

167
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,727
- First of all, if you think
there might be oil someplace,

168
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,422
then what you do is,
you go drill a test well.

169
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,954
Then what you have to do

170
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,431
is to take that one well
in the center,

171
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,197
and then you drill a series
of appraisal wells

172
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,430
around that well

173
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:02,440
to determine where the oil field
might go.

174
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,203
You don't know how much oil
you're gonna get,

175
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,836
how deep it is, what kind of oil
it's gonna to be.

176
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,436
There are many different grades
of oils,

177
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,506
a lot of which
are more expensive to refine.

178
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,744
So all of that has
to do with how long it takes

179
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,980
to make something produce,

180
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,851
how much energy do you get back

181
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,347
for how much energy
you invested.

182
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,725
When oil was seeping out
of the ground in Pennsylvania,

183
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:27,027
you got a return of,
I don't know, 200 to 1.

184
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,226
When you have to go offshore,

185
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:33,499
to deep water drilling
in 1 5,000 feet of water

186
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:38,441
and your first well costs
$1 50 million to build,

187
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,036
all that's energy that's being
invested to get energy,

188
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,842
and the moment you start
burning more energy

189
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,042
to get a barrel of oil out
of the ground than it's worth,

190
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,072
forget about it.

191
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,649
The world's been
thoroughly explored

192
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,314
over the last 1 20 years.

193
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,688
There's no major
oil finds left.

194
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:57,024
As a matter of fact,
no field the siZe of Ghawar,

195
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,790
the largest field
in Saudi Arabia,

196
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,354
has ever been discovered since.

197
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,998
Saudi Arabia has 25%

198
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:07,402
of the known oil reserves
on the planet.

199
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,168
25%.

200
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,438
Why, if Saudi Arabia has all
these untapped reserves on shore

201
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:15,378
are they moving heavily
into offshore drilling?

202
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,541
Now, if it's 5, 1 0, 50 times
more expensive

203
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,414
to drill offshore
than on land,

204
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,113
doesn't that tell you
that Saudi Arabia

205
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,781
knows they've got
no more oil to find?

206
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:29,123
It's axiomatic that if
Saudi Arabia has passed its peak

207
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,889
and is in decline,
the whole planet is

208
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,193
just because of the siZe
of the reserves that are there.

209
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:40,699
Iraq is oil
that's not only accessible,

210
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,467
it's right close
to the Persian Gulf,

211
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,532
which means it's
a short distance to ships.

212
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,702
They can put the pipelines.

213
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:48,871
They can get that into
the global supply stream

214
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,108
as everything else declines.

215
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,783
And lraq was all about the oil.

216
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,257
A lot of people have admitted
that, and like, duh.

217
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,317
1 1 days after 9/1 1,
when there was no clear evidence

218
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,591
that Saddam Hussein had anything
to do with 9/1 1-

219
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,858
of course, he didn't-

220
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:10,299
the plans were started
to invade lraq, of course.

221
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:14,931
That was the objective,
get control of that oil.

222
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,066
Because Saddam Hussein
had been talking about

223
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:20,100
pricing his oil in Euros,
taking it away from the dollar.

224
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:21,168
We got in there.

225
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,474
We restructured everything.

226
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:25,074
We put in a friendly government
using the U.S. dollar,

227
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,176
and we assured
the oil companies

228
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:32,656
their "fair access"
and fair share of lraqi oil.

229
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,319
- lnternational oil companies
into lraqi oil fields

230
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,261
- We have no intention
of leaving lraq.

231
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,924
We're never gonna
leave lraq.

232
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:43,593
Going back to 2004,
we started building the largest,

233
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,866
most permanent military bases,
three of them, in the world,

234
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,840
plus the largest embassy
compound that's ever been built.

235
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,968
We built an embassy compound
in Baghdad

236
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:55,673
that's bigger than Vatican City.

237
00:11:55,713 --> 00:12:00,377
That's not a temporary deal.

238
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,010
Nobody is gonna take
that oil.

239
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:05,489
We are sitting on it.

240
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:09,960
But there is not enough oil
in lraq to change anything.

241
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:12,986
Iraq probably has around
90 billion barrels

242
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,089
of recoverable oil.

243
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,123
That sounds like a lot of oil.

244
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,727
But when you consider that in
2008 the world was consuming

245
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,328
85 million barrels a day,

246
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,736
that means
a billion barrels of oil

247
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,400
only last for about 1 1 1/2 days,

248
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,738
so that ain't that much oil.

249
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,334
- That's only the first
of the good things

250
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,743
that will come to lraq,
thanks to oil.

251
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,477
- They knew exactly
what was coming.

252
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,612
That's what's in
the National Energy Policy

253
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,986
Development Group report
that's been classified,

254
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,321
because if that report
were declassified,

255
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,726
we would be building scaffolds
to hang Dick Cheney

256
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,696
and everybody in that
administration tomorrow.

257
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,001
Let's assume
just for the sake of discussion

258
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,565
that there's 600 billion barrels
in the Arctic.

259
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:01,170
First of all, it happens
to be under the polar ice cap.

260
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,645
That's a problem.

261
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,513
The polar ice cap happens to be
on, what, 1 0,000,

262
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,178
1 5,000 feet water.

263
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,347
The problem with the polar ice
cap is, it floats; it moves.

264
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,482
So you can't drill a well
on Tuesday

265
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:16,288
and expect it to be in
the same place on Thursday.

266
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:20,320
That's why a lot of conservative
think tanks and oil companies

267
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:24,768
are cheering the melting
of the polar ice caps.

268
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:27,828
- Developing this tiny section
of ANWR,

269
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:29,863
could eventually yield up
to a million...

270
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,431
- If there is oil in ANWR

271
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,206
there's no more than about
a six-month supply

272
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,679
for the entire United States.

273
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,148
There are no pipelines
across a thousand miles

274
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,413
of tundra that's melting due
to global warming,

275
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,852
which means you can't sink pipes
to support

276
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:47,187
a pipeline in tundra
that's turned to mud.

277
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:50,285
There's no tanker routes,
the wells aren't drilled,

278
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:56,267
and yet we are spending our
future as if that oil is there.

279
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:01,965
We got to drop all this lying
right now.

280
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:04,201
We don't need transparency
about anything

281
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:07,234
other than about
how much oil is really left,

282
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,745
because we don't know.

283
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,338
Oil is a commodity;
it's an asset.

284
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,542
You make loans based upon
what's in the ground,

285
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,448
so you have all these
accounting terms:

286
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,953
possible reserves,
proven reserves,

287
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,853
ultimately recoverable reserves,

288
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,415
verified reserves, estimated-

289
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,121
But actual reserve estimates
are state secrets.

290
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,653
The Saudis don't dare announce
that they've passed

291
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:27,790
their peak of oil production.

292
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:28,821
Why?

293
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,391
They have a very
restive population

294
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:33,461
that have been sold
an expectation

295
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,267
of a rising standard of living,

296
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:37,797
and the moment Saudi Arabia
acknowledges it's past peak,

297
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,639
it may well have a revolution.

298
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,771
Now, what happens if there's
a revolution in Saudi Arabia

299
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,873
with 25% of the world's
known oil?

300
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,645
Where is that oil going
to get replaced from?

301
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,414
It can't be.

302
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:50,478
Very complex problem.

303
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,489
It's a very complex situation.

304
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,355
- Just start working now,
otherwise we won't have time.

305
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:02,491
We're gonna be out
of oil within a few years.

306
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,934
- In doing this sort of pulling
archival footage for this film,

307
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,906
I found at least ten examples
of people in the late '70s

308
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,841
talking about,
this is the end of oil.

309
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,242
This is, like,
end of a way of life,

310
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,506
we are hitting a new era.

311
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,537
- This situation is destined
to continue.

312
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,140
- People look at that footage,

313
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:22,516
and I think they can feel
that it's somewhat alarmist,

314
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,350
given that we were able
to continue

315
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:28,222
our way of life
for another 30, 35 years.

316
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,990
Do you see any parallels
between that time and now?

317
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:41,601
- The '70s was really
a critical decade.

318
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,506
In the '70s,
Marion King Hubbard,

319
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:47,443
the original prophet
of peak oil,

320
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,276
in late 1 949 he did the math

321
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:54,580
and said U.S. domestic oil
production will peak in 1 970.

322
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:58,419
So that's not some feat
of Nostradamus

323
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,481
communicating with some entity.

324
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,187
It's math; it's science;
it's simple.

325
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:06,856
But in the '70s, M. King Hubbard
testified before Congress.

326
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,729
That was 1 974.

327
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,792
In 1 976,
President Jimmy Carter said,

328
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:15,670
"Man, we cannot use as much
energy as we have been using."

329
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,139
- To use energy
more efficiently.

330
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,574
- That's when solar panels
went up.

331
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,236
That's when he start-he knew.

332
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,973
They have known in Washington.

333
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,310
I have-

334
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,942
I have published on my website,
as have others,

335
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:30,283
declassified ClA documents
from 1 976

336
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:34,223
showing that ClA was perfectly
aware of peak oil.

337
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,919
In those days, of course,

338
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,861
when the situation appeared
to be normal,

339
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,887
when people had jobs,
they had vacations,

340
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,695
they had credit cards,
they had credit lines,

341
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,724
everybody is talking about
growth, growth, growth,

342
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,999
buy, buy, buy,
spend, consume, consume,

343
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,665
and everything seemed
to be working,

344
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:51,937
yeah, we were called alarmists.

345
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,137
We don't live
in that world anymore.

346
00:16:57,181 --> 00:17:02,744
- Americans were on the way
to owning millions of cars.

347
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:05,415
- 800 million internal
combustion-powered vehicles

348
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,048
on the planet.

349
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:09,355
They all run on oil.

350
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,829
It takes uncounted barrels
of oil

351
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,425
to make those cars and engines
in the first place,

352
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,197
and you cannot plug
any new technology

353
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:22,104
into an internal combustion
powered engine.

354
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,300
With seven gallons of oil
in every tire,

355
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,536
nobody will ever make

356
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:28,511
800 million new
internal combustion anything

357
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,480
because there ain't gonna be
enough oil.

358
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:37,618
Ethanol is an absolute...

359
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,815
joke.

360
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,788
First of all, a very brilliant
scientist, David Pimentel,

361
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,092
took the concept of net energy,

362
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,495
how much energy do you invest

363
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:50,056
versus how much
do you get in return,

364
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,094
and he concluded
about a decade ago, I guess,

365
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:57,403
that it takes more energy
to make ethanol

366
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,774
than you get from burning it,
which is absolute stupidity.

367
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,609
Because you drive the
oil-powered machines, etcetera,

368
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,411
you irrigate,
you use the fertiliZers,

369
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,418
you're burning all that oil
and natural gas to grow it.

370
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,420
Then you make steam which is-

371
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,115
which is more
hydrocarbon energy,

372
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,555
you add more chemicals,

373
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:16,424
and you come up with ethanol,
which you can put in a car.

374
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,362
Now, the Bush administration
had announced a goal

375
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:23,993
of having 1 5% of all fuel
in the United States

376
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:27,300
made from ethanol, I think,
by the year 201 5.

377
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,737
They forgot to tell you that

378
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,867
that would take all the arable
land used to grow corn to do it.

379
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,307
Canadian tar sands is an oil.

380
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:43,219
it is a very, very thick,
sticky, obnoxious substance

381
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,518
that's mixed in with sand

382
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:49,925
at levels 200, 300, 400,
500 feet in layers

383
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:50,950
beneath the soil.

384
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,394
This is in Alberta.

385
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,265
And they literally strip mine
thousands of tons a day.

386
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,599
They put them in these huge,
oil-powered dump trucks

387
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:03,095
and drive them to a place
where they then wash the sand.

388
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,133
They take millions and billions
of gallons of fresh water,

389
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,043
which we're running
out of everywhere,

390
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,015
and they boil it
by burning natural gas.

391
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:15,314
There is not
a possibility anywhere

392
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,344
that Canadian tar sand's
production

393
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:20,824
will exceed maybe 3 million,
3.5 million barrels a day.

394
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,085
The first thing
that the uneducated mind

395
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,619
that's in denial says,

396
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:27,892
"Well, what about hydrogen?

397
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,194
Can't we make electric cars?"

398
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,723
Then I have to bring them back
to the fact

399
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,736
that there's seven gallons
of oil in every tire,

400
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,262
that there are thousands
of gallons of oil in every car,

401
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,969
in the plastics, the paints,
the resins, everything.

402
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,204
All of that is made by oil.

403
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,871
The oil that's used
to manufacture the car

404
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,608
and ship it around, to heat
the metals, etcetera, etcetera.

405
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:48,778
There will never be 800 million
electric powered vehicles,

406
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:52,755
and electricity is not
an energy source.

407
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,816
Electricity is generated
by burning

408
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,829
or using some other kind
of energy.

409
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,735
- Today freedom and power
are woven together.

410
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:13,767
The invisible battalions
of electric power...

411
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,371
- It's clear that electricity

412
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,611
is the key
to industrial civiliZation

413
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:23,552
in that it powers
our refrigeration.

414
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,147
It runs the water pumps
that pump water out

415
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,750
of the New York subway
system every day.

416
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,125
It allows us
to commute electronically,

417
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,925
charge our cell phone batteries,

418
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:37,593
preserve food,
run operating rooms, etcetera.

419
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:44,772
The subject
of alternative energies.

420
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:52,575
There is no such thing
as clean coal,

421
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,107
and there never ever will be.

422
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,779
Why?

423
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,551
Carbon sequestration
is enormously expensive.

424
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,024
What it says essentially is,
you capture the CO2

425
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,721
and any other
greenhouse gases emitted

426
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,525
in the burning of the coal,

427
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:10,796
you exert enormous amounts
of energy to compress it,

428
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:14,464
then you move it over
enormously long distances,

429
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:18,965
and you pump it into some
airtight chamber in the ground

430
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,842
where somebody will figure out
with technology

431
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,676
what to do with
the greenhouse gas in 1 0,000

432
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,147
or 1 5,000 thousand years.

433
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,046
Nuclear process
requires something

434
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,247
Iike 1 0 to 1 3 years
of incubation

435
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,746
to get the permitting done,
all the regulations satisfied,

436
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,124
and the construction
of nuclear power plants

437
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,493
is one of the most
energy-intensive processes

438
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,758
in the world.

439
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,732
The steel, the lead containment,

440
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:46,293
the enrichment of uranium
is a horribly intensive process.

441
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,305
You just don't throw
a rock of uranium in

442
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,863
and start making nuclear energy.

443
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:50,896
Can't do that.

444
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,434
The first and obvious
problem with tidal energy is,

445
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:59,177
it has to be generated
or collected near a coastline.

446
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:01,707
Salt water
is extremely corrosive.

447
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:06,746
There's an enormous energy cost
in manufacturing the machines.

448
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,258
There are only two
alternative energies

449
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:12,888
which can really have
an immediate impact,

450
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,921
an immediate benefit.

451
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:21,060
Now, the problem with plans
like enormous wind farms

452
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:24,472
in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado,

453
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:26,135
the fundamental law
with electricity is,

454
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:30,443
is that it's drawn off
right where it's used first.

455
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,450
Yes, you can transmit
electricity over long distances,

456
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,315
but people don't think
about the energy

457
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:36,614
that goes into transformers,

458
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,781
and how much copper
is in power lines,

459
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:41,655
and all the maintenance
that has to go to that grid.

460
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:45,253
So when you see really
ridiculous commercials

461
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:50,427
that say we could have a solar
array 96 miles in the desert,

462
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,128
they don't even think about
the fact

463
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,535
that that electricity is going
to get used in California

464
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:56,437
before it goes any place else.

465
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:02,407
- Just, you know,
ifyou saw this movie

466
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,346
and you didn't know
who you were,

467
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:05,780
and you wanted-

468
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:07,681
you were just curious
what your credentials are

469
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:12,451
in terms of understanding
this information.

470
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:21,159
- I have a bachelors degree
in political science

471
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:26,659
with honors from UCLA, 1 973.

472
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:31,334
Graduate of the Los Angeles
Police Academy, Valedictorian,

473
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,310
class of 1 1 73,

474
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:39,214
was sent to do DEA Narcotics
Enforcement School by LAPD.

475
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,845
I have 30 years of experience
as an investigative journalist.

476
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:47,619
I've broken major scandals
that have had national impact.

477
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:50,684
Of course, I got to know
many members of Congress.

478
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,754
I had been trying to testify
for a long time,

479
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:56,231
and actually I have
never testified in Congress.

480
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,598
I did, at the request of

481
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,432
the Senate Select Committee
on lntelligence,

482
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,062
submit written testimony,

483
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:02,834
but after they read
the written testimony

484
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:03,897
that I was going to submit,

485
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,875
I never got a call to testify.

486
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:07,376
I have written two books,

487
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,278
one of which is in the
Harvard Business School library.

488
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:13,909
I've lectured at universities
all over the country

489
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,885
and in many countries.

490
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,386
People wonder, you know,

491
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:20,822
how this guy with
a bachelors degree from UCLA

492
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,052
came to know all this shit.

493
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:26,392
Well, this comes from 30 years
of learning

494
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,524
how to scan mainstream media
and read it,

495
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:33,366
a way of finding stories
from around the world

496
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:37,135
that tell you all the things
that are really going on

497
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:40,701
that are not played
on the headlines-

498
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,143
but they're the kind of stories

499
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,878
that people who really make
decisions know how to look for-

500
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:49,909
and then how to connect them,

501
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:52,183
how to place the dots
close enough together

502
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,689
so that they can be connected.

503
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,200
The soil is the place from which

504
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:17,077
all plant matter
gets its nutrients,

505
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:19,378
and if you keep sucking
the nutrients out,

506
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,441
the soil is useless.

507
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,251
For all of history,
the way the soil was replenished

508
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,725
and the nutrients were returned
in some measure to the soil

509
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,954
was that plant matter
was allowed to decay,

510
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:34,122
to compost, to restock the soil.

511
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,359
That's why crop rotation
is so important.

512
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,992
You may have one crop
of celery

513
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:41,493
which will suck certain
chemicals out of the soil.

514
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:44,632
Another crop,
wheat or something else,

515
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,269
may return those same chemicals
to the soil.

516
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,575
So the soil maintains a balance.

517
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:58,012
It's kind of sad,
because we as a species

518
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,683
have become so disconnected
from the earth.

519
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,749
We don't have any
real contact with the earth.

520
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,727
We don't have any sense
of its functions,

521
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,230
its feel, its nature,
its seasons, its timing.

522
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:13,334
First of all, the topsoil
on which food is grown now

523
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,204
is nothing more than a sponge
onto which we pour chemicals

524
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,903
that we get from oil
and natural gas,

525
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,604
and without those chemicals-

526
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:23,613
the soil has been turned
into a junkie;

527
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:27,276
the soil is worthless.

528
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:29,217
So when you plant a crop now,

529
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,881
what happens is you drive
an oil-powered machine.

530
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,049
Drives along, and it plows.

531
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:36,855
Then you drive another
oil-powered machine,

532
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:39,590
and it drives along,
and it plants.

533
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,154
And then you irrigate.

534
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,222
Well, how do you irrigate?

535
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,666
Well, that water is pumped
by pumps

536
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,191
that are powered by electricity.

537
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:47,863
Where's that electricity
come from?

538
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:51,033
In the United States,
it's either coal or natural gas.

539
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:52,735
So next thing you do
is come along,

540
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:54,004
and you fertiliZe it.

541
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:57,912
All commercial fertiliZers
are made from ammonia,

542
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:02,749
and the feedstock for ammonia
is natural gas.

543
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,277
So you have ammonium nitrate
fertiliZers

544
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:08,291
that are then sprayed on
by another oil-powered vehicle.

545
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:11,488
Then the crop dusters come along
that are powered by oil

546
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:16,227
that spray pesticides that are
all made from petroleum.

547
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,530
Then when it's time to harvest
the food, what do you do?

548
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,127
You drive another
oil-powered machine,

549
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,569
and you harvest it.

550
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:24,506
You use another oil-powered
machine to drive it to a place

551
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,065
where it's processed.

552
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:28,100
Then you wrap it up in plastic,
which is oil,

553
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,136
and you put it in
another oil-powered machine,

554
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,205
and you drive it x number
of miles

555
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:33,910
to a food distribution warehouse

556
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,078
and an oil-powered machine
to your supermarket.

557
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,218
The way food is grown, produced,

558
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,818
and moved around
the world today,

559
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:46,853
it's an enormous waste
of hydrocarbon energy

560
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,592
which doesn't make sense.

561
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,657
Why do we have strawberries
from Chile?

562
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,464
Why do we have
spinach from China?

563
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,596
Why do we ship anchovies
halfway around the world

564
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:59,098
to be packaged in tin cans?

565
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:03,841
There are ten calories
of hydrocarbon energy

566
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:07,078
in every calorie
of food consumed

567
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,550
in the industrialiZed world.

568
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:21,564
Three times in my life

569
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:27,662
I tried to walk away from,
forget about,

570
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:29,968
the things
that I had seen

571
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:33,943
that were so out of whack,

572
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:37,640
that were so craZy,
that were so wrong.

573
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,582
You know, and that is what
many people urged me to do.

574
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:43,381
But what inevitably happened
every time

575
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,289
I tried to walk away from this
path that I have walked

576
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,849
was that everything else
in my life

577
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,053
would be taken away from me

578
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:54,291
so that this path
was the only thing left.

579
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,697
I had no other choice.

580
00:28:56,733 --> 00:29:00,499
And, yeah, anger and resentment
do build up,

581
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:04,098
especially when you see
and document as much corruption,

582
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,369
as much dishonesty,

583
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,072
as much illegality,
as much murder, as much betrayal

584
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:14,641
as I have from people
who pretend to be otherwise.

585
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:15,879
And I reached a point-

586
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,719
it was about 1 993
when I first became involved

587
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:23,522
or learned of the murder
of Marine Colonel Jim Sabow

588
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,551
at El Toro Marine Air Station.

589
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,690
He was the chief of Air Ops,
and he had caught ClA C1 30s

590
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,530
flying 2,000 and 3,000 kilos
of cocaine on to his base,

591
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:33,968
and he was suicided.

592
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,029
I crossed my own Rubicon
at that point.

593
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:40,066
There was no turning
back for me,

594
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,442
and I knew that wherever
this path was gonna go,

595
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,639
I had to follow it.

596
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:52,221
In the '80s, because I had
some skill as a writer,

597
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:54,246
I started freelance writing.

598
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,553
I got published a few times.

599
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:59,221
I realiZed
that I could be a writer.

600
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:04,427
I wrote about 1 09 mysterious
deaths or suicides

601
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,800
in the U.S. military
in a very short period of time,

602
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:10,739
and I found that most of those
were connected

603
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:15,143
to covert operations
in one way or another.

604
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:17,373
The next real evolution
came in 1 996

605
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:20,508
after my confrontation
with ClA Director Deutch,

606
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,882
John Deutch
at Locke High School.

607
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,320
You know, I remember standing up
saying something like,

608
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:29,348
"l am a former Los Angeles
police narcotics detective.

609
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:30,917
"l worked South Central
Los Angeles,

610
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,394
"and I can tell you,
Director Deutch,

611
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:34,056
"emphatically
and without equivocation

612
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,622
"that the agency
has dealt drugs in this country

613
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,656
for a long time,"

614
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,397
and the room exploded.

615
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:46,103
I had been saying that ClA
was dealing drugs for 1 8 years.

616
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:47,667
I mean, I'd been shot at for it.

617
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,201
I'd been forced out of LAPD.

618
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,235
I'd been trashed.

619
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,679
I'd been called craZy.

620
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:53,706
If, in the course
of the lG's investigations

621
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,217
and Fred Hinson's work,

622
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,710
you come across evidence
of severely criminal activity,

623
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:03,522
will you tell
the American people the truth?

624
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,961
- We will bring the people
to justice

625
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,294
and make them accountable.

626
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,026
- Like so often,
when they promise justice,

627
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,056
there isn't any.

628
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,001
It was whittled
and tweetered down.

629
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:15,800
There were some
very mysterious deaths involved.

630
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,864
Congressmen Julian Dixon,
who was at that meeting,

631
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:22,277
had a very sudden
heart attack...

632
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:25,645
which led to the publishing of
the first issue of my newsletter

633
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,082
in May of 1 998,
From the Wilderness.

634
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:31,781
I sat down
and wrote a few pages out,

635
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:33,153
Iike, eight pages I think.

636
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,681
I mailed it to 68 names,

637
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,318
and over the next
8 1/2 years,

638
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,386
From the Wilderness grew
to have

639
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,129
as many as 60 members
of Congress as subscribers,

640
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:47,363
professors at universities
around the world,

641
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:50,373
government officials.

642
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,671
One of my first exposés
after ClA and drugs

643
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,075
was that I proved CNN
was absolutely lying

644
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:58,639
in something called
the Tailwind Scandal of 1 998

645
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,479
where CNN had
correctly reported-

646
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,382
their producer April Oliver
had reported

647
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,217
that ClA had used sarin gas
in Laos

648
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,244
during the Vietnam War,

649
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:07,688
and Henry Kissinger
authoriZed it.

650
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:10,852
- Four different A-1
pilots who dropped the gas.

651
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,885
- In spite of
what the Pentagon said.

652
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:14,829
- CNN, you know, rolled over.

653
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:16,059
Henry Kissinger called.

654
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:20,365
Oliver was fired.

655
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:24,499
Pat Tillman series
that I broke in my newsletter.

656
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,999
All seven parts, that was what
broke the Pat Tillman exposé

657
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:31,912
that brought down nine officers
or got them disciplined.

658
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:35,475
- The government violated
its most basic responsibility.

659
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,784
- But my
economic predictions then,

660
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:39,811
we had it so right.

661
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:41,687
The problems are several-fold

662
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,420
behind the economic crash
that is coming

663
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,396
that will be nothing
like we have ever seen before.

664
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,424
In 2006, we said,
"Get out of debt right now.

665
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,959
"Check your mortgage carefully,

666
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,529
"especially if you have
an A.R.M.

667
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:57,835
"Get into gold.

668
00:32:57,874 --> 00:33:00,536
"Reduce debt
as much as possible.

669
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:02,772
"Stay away from any kind
of financing

670
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,212
and heavy credit card."

671
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:06,272
We issued a whole series
of warnings.

672
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:07,943
How many people have ever heard
of the fact

673
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:10,350
that they're trading pools
of mortgage-backed securities?

674
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:13,015
Like mutual funds,
but it's all mortgages.

675
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,752
Those books are as cooked
as the books on Enron.

676
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:17,419
But it was like 1 1, 1 2 days

677
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,325
after we issued
that economic alert

678
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,023
in the middle of running
the Tillman series

679
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:22,998
that our offices
were burglariZed.

680
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,501
All seven computers smashed

681
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:27,765
and a whole chain of events
took place up there

682
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:31,433
which was-which actually
worked out okay,

683
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,774
because I needed to evolve,
and I have since then.

684
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,809
There was a period after,
you know, so many years

685
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:46,914
of deliberate attempts
to sabotage my operations,

686
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:50,859
four of which we connected in
one way or another to the FBl.

687
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,094
I published that I had retired.

688
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,899
I said officially
that I had retired.

689
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:04,839
What I had-and at that point,
given the way I felt,

690
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:11,041
that was
a pretty honest statement.

691
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,776
I didn't know
that I would bounce back

692
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:15,114
or that there was a third
or a fourth wind

693
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:16,584
to come inside of me,

694
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,421
but that also is the image
that I wanted out there

695
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,857
just to take the heat off me

696
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,760
at least until Bush and Cheney
got out of the White House,

697
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,559
because that's where
the heat was coming from.

698
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,862
- From them personally?

699
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,301
I mean,
from their administration,

700
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:35,566
or, you know, the people
that ran the ClA,

701
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,095
that ran the FBl?

702
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,335
Who was that pressure
coming from?

703
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:42,834
- I have absolutely no doubt
that Richard Cheney

704
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,679
and Donald Rumsfeld took an
intense personal interest in me

705
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,343
and what my newsletter
had published

706
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:51,013
for all the years
of the Bush Administration.

707
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:54,455
That's about as specific
as I care to get.

708
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:05,528
There was a guy named
von ClausewitZ

709
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:08,128
who said that war
is a continuation of politics

710
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,298
by other means.

711
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,674
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

712
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:22,511
To understand all of this mess,
you need to understand one term.

713
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,986
It's a big financial term that
is real simple to understand.

714
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,989
It's called a derivative.

715
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:31,517
A derivative is
any financial instrument

716
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,394
which is derived
from the inherent value

717
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,059
of something else
that is tangible.

718
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,933
In other words,
an ear of corn has value.

719
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,995
A barrel of oil has value.

720
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:45,007
If you have a house
and a mortgage, that's fine.

721
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,441
When you start doing
mortgage-backed securities,

722
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:49,911
packaging, and bundling,
that's called a derivative.

723
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,481
As of the start of the collapse,

724
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,182
which let's peg
at September of 2008,

725
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:04,091
there were derivatives
with a notional value,

726
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,118
meaning that if you added up
all the pieces of paper,

727
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:09,996
were worth $700 trillion.

728
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:12,024
In other words,
if they all cashed out at once,

729
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,298
you would need to have
$700 trillion in cash,

730
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:16,100
and of course,
there isn't that much money.

731
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:23,801
So with all of these hedges and
derivatives and puts and calls,

732
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:24,905
those are all derivatives,

733
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:27,075
and all these other things
they do,

734
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:29,415
all they cared about was making
the minimum monthly payment

735
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:30,612
on the credit card bill.

736
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:33,850
In other words, to service
the $700 trillion

737
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,051
in notional-valued derivatives,

738
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,492
they had to pay a certain amount
of cash every month,

739
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,257
and God forbid they should
all come due.

740
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:42,355
What's happening
with all of these bailouts,

741
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,095
which are now around
$1 1 trillion

742
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,968
if you add up
all the U.S. bailouts,

743
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:51,963
they're chasing a $700 trillion
derivatives bubble

744
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,738
down the drain.

745
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:13,259
The people who have run
the monetary paradigm,

746
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:16,356
the economic paradigm,
since money was first invented

747
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,832
have wanted to mystify it

748
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,357
and to make everybody believe

749
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:22,496
that only some expert could
understand the mumbo jumbo

750
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,099
of the priesthood of money.

751
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,302
Three things only anybody
needs to know

752
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:29,470
about the way money works
around the world today.

753
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:31,139
One: fiat currency.

754
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,170
What is money?

755
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:38,811
If I were to take a bill
out of my wallet,

756
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:41,915
and I reach in my wallet,
and I pull out this bill,

757
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,391
it's $20.

758
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:45,018
Wow. Okay.

759
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,585
Can I eat it?

760
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:47,823
Can I roll it up and chew it?

761
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:49,627
Do I get calories and vitamins?

762
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,792
No, I don't.

763
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,665
Can I crumple it up,

764
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:54,101
throw it in my gas tank?

765
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,468
Is the car gonna go anywhere?

766
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,269
No, it's gonna clog
the fuel injectors, maybe.

767
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:00,242
This is only a symbol.

768
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:01,937
This doesn't mean anything.

769
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:02,967
It's fiat.

770
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:04,274
It's created out of thin air

771
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,305
because somebody turned on
a printing press.

772
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,978
That's all it is.

773
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,887
Before the great growth
of population

774
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:16,483
which occurred
with the advent of oil

775
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:19,757
came this revolution in
the monetary system as well.

776
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,491
There was a time
when the pound sterling

777
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:24,898
actually meant
a pound of sterling silver.

778
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:26,902
There was only so much silver
out of the ground.

779
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:27,925
It was tangible.

780
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,233
You couldn't print silver.

781
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:32,969
It was something real.

782
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,239
You cannot print any more money

783
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:38,406
than there is energy
to back it up.

784
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,439
That simple.

785
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,386
So we have fiat currency.

786
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:48,413
Then we have something called
fractional reserve banking.

787
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:54,961
If you were to bring me
a $1 0 deposit,

788
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:58,695
I could make $90 worth of loans

789
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:01,067
based on just having
that $1 0 in my drawer,

790
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:03,334
because it's all calculated
on the premise

791
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:04,806
that not everybody's
gonna come in

792
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:06,001
and want their cash all at once.

793
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,067
That's called a run on the bank.

794
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,204
So they have calculated
the odds,

795
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:13,977
much as Vegas odds makers do,
and said,

796
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:16,485
"Okay, well, you know,
there are very little odds

797
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,215
under normal conditions."

798
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:25,990
When I lend now a total of $1 00
based on that $1 0 deposit,

799
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:30,227
that's more money
that I create out of thin air.

800
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,962
Well, gee, that means
that in order to pay off,

801
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:36,130
whoever gets that money
has to make more money still

802
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:38,072
to feed in at the bottom
to pay the bank

803
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:41,133
so that the bank
can create still more money.

804
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,541
You know, I think it's probably
pretty safe

805
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,983
at this point in time with the
collapse of the U.S. economy

806
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,486
to say that pretty much
everybody is understanding

807
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,614
how compound interest works.

808
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:56,420
The higher the interest rate
on your credit card,

809
00:39:56,459 --> 00:40:00,156
for those people who had 20%,
25% cards,

810
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:02,562
that means they are creating
that much more money

811
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,467
if they don't pay cash
every month.

812
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:11,405
What I have just described
is a pyramid scheme.

813
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:14,604
We live in
an infinite-growth paradigm

814
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,441
which requires growth forever.

815
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,380
It's not that Bernie Madoff
was a pyramid scheme

816
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:22,441
or Stanford was
a pyramid scheme.

817
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,851
The whole economy
is a pyramid scheme.

818
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,856
The whole global economy
cannot be sustained.

819
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,518
It requires infinite growth.

820
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,553
But infinite growth collides
with finite energy.

821
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:36,064
First law of thermodynamics,

822
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:38,499
energy can neither be created
nor destroyed.

823
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:39,694
The second law:

824
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,897
energy converts
in only one direction:

825
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,133
from usable to unusable.

826
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,538
That's called
the law of entropy.

827
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,701
Things break down.

828
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:49,211
And in every energy transaction,

829
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,873
some energy is always lost.

830
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,381
So you have finite energy

831
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:55,384
and you have
a financial paradigm

832
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,045
which demands infinite growth,

833
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:59,213
and we are at the point
of human history

834
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:01,985
where the infinite growth
paradigm collides with something

835
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,220
that is more powerful
than money is.

836
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:20,503
By 2006, I knew that
the collapse was very imminent,

837
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:22,977
that there would be a major
implosion of the U.S. economy.

838
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:25,207
I actually missed it
by about a year,

839
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,237
maybe a little bit more.

840
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:27,715
I thought it was
gonna happen sooner,

841
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,513
but it happened.

842
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,486
And now that it is happening,

843
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,284
these pieces are falling exactly

844
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:36,383
as if everything else
we had written, said, done-

845
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,552
all the peak oil activists,

846
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:42,087
all the sustainability
advocates-

847
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:44,429
our map was proving
deadly accurate.

848
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:57,712
Things don't break up;
they break down.

849
00:41:57,747 --> 00:42:01,706
When a government collapses,
what happens?

850
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,184
Mail stops getting delivered.

851
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:05,449
Air traffic controllers
don't get paid,

852
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:06,853
so they don't go to work,

853
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:09,221
which means planes don't fly.

854
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:12,318
Bridges and highway inspections
don't get made.

855
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:15,991
Food and Drug Administration
inspections don't get made.

856
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,296
Maintenance is going
to be defrayed.

857
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:21,462
Law enforcement stops working.

858
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,698
I mean, it's no secret now.

859
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:23,967
You see the headlines every day.

860
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:27,635
California is bankrupt,
Michigan is bankrupt, Ohio.

861
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:31,511
They're shutting down services
left and right.

862
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,879
There are tent cities springing
up all over the country.

863
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:36,146
There are homeless
displaced people.

864
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:40,588
A great many billionaires,
who we would call the elites,

865
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:44,252
a great many very, very wealthy
people are getting crashed,

866
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:46,887
burned, and eaten alive.

867
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:50,421
What you don't hear is the fact
that, all over the world,

868
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:54,527
economies are collapsing much
faster than the U.S. economy.

869
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,603
Britain is an absolute
basket case.

870
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:05,103
There is a curtain of despair
descending

871
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:09,710
across Eastern Europe.

872
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:11,617
There's a revolution under way
in Greece.

873
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:12,951
It's not riots.

874
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:16,584
It's not civil unrest;
it's a revolution.

875
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,719
Drug violence right across
the border in Mexico,

876
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,092
this is all part
of the collapse.

877
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:23,963
Pakistan, Afghanistan,
there's lots of violence.

878
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,901
The people who have run
the planet to this point

879
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:30,633
and who are running the planet
now are losing control.

880
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,616
Have I ever been called
a conspiracy theorist?

881
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,087
Of course I've been called
a conspiracy theorist.

882
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,679
But I don't deal
in conspiracy theory.

883
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,088
I deal in conspiracy fact.

884
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,328
Somebody once said to me
a long time ago,

885
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:03,338
and this was probably
back in '84,

886
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:07,502
"Climb down off the cross,
asshole, we need the lumber!"

887
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:09,238
I am not a Messiah.

888
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:11,906
I am not responsible
for saving anybody.

889
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:16,282
The only person I am
responsible for saving is me.

890
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,587
What I see now is the end
of a paradigm

891
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:23,490
that is as cataclysmic
as the asteroid event

892
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:26,393
that killed almost all the life
on the Earth

893
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,124
and certainly the dinosaurs.

894
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:32,066
Now, the dinosaurs were
kings of their paradigm,

895
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,069
and a paradigm is
what you think about something

896
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,536
before you think about it.

897
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:37,436
Somebody talks about money,

898
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:40,738
and you automatically accept
without thinking

899
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:43,836
that compound interest,
factional reserve banking,

900
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,142
and fiat currency is okay,

901
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,239
and we have to protect that,

902
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,715
because if we don't
protect that,

903
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,846
it's gonna be bad for us.

904
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:54,015
If you know anything
about Darwinism,

905
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:55,489
basically what it said was

906
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:58,517
is that those species
that had evolved

907
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:02,691
or were able to adapt
to changing circumstances

908
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:04,029
were the ones that survived,

909
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:05,499
and those that were not equipped

910
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:08,766
or had been-
become evolutionary dead ends

911
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:11,466
were destined to die.

912
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:12,974
"Mike, you better be careful.

913
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:16,809
It sounds like you're advocating
Social Darwinism."

914
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:19,371
I'm not advocating
Social Darwinism.

915
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,145
I am witnessing
actual Darwinism.

916
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:29,050
If you are in a camp
with a bunch of campers

917
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:31,559
and a bear attacks,

918
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:34,529
you don't have to be faster
than the bear.

919
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:37,499
You only have to be faster
than the slowest camper.

920
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:49,334
There is one and only one
graph image

921
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,812
that I have used

922
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:57,547
in I would guess 60 to 70
lectures in eight countries,

923
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:00,055
and that's a graph
of human population,

924
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:03,650
and if one looks at that graph,

925
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,491
what you see is human population

926
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:11,523
roughly stable at around
a billion people or so

927
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,728
with maybe a little bit more
at around the time of Christ.

928
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:17,671
Then it stays pretty stable
until we get to the bubonic-

929
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:21,143
it starts to rise some as some
primitive technology emerged,

930
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:22,667
but then you get
to the Bubonic plague.

931
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,304
There's a little dip.

932
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:25,746
Then after the bubonic plague,

933
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:29,683
you begin the start of what
we would call the Renaissance

934
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,018
and the early stages
of the lndustrial Revolution,

935
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:35,546
the discovery of steam.

936
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:38,890
The population starts
to go like this.

937
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:40,020
The introduction of coal,

938
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:42,087
the population
starts to go like this.

939
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:45,931
But around 1 900, around the turn
of the 20th century,

940
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:49,131
what you see as oil
became ubiquitous

941
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,698
was that the population
went like this,

942
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:55,939
and it goes up
to 6.5 billion people.

943
00:46:55,978 --> 00:46:58,037
We may be at 7 billion people

944
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,880
by the time anyone
sees this interview.

945
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:06,752
All of those people exist on
this planet only because of oil.

946
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:08,120
That's it.

947
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,990
So it's axiomatic
that if you take the oil away,

948
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:13,222
the population
must go away also.

949
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:16,459
In all of science,
in all of biology,

950
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:19,263
there is no case
where any population,

951
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:23,431
be it bacteria in a petri dish
or caribou in an Arctic island,

952
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:26,270
runs into a set
of favorable circumstances

953
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:31,245
and goes to that point
without an immediate crash down.

954
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,406
It's a law.

955
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:33,881
It's a law
as fundamental as gravity.

956
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:36,441
It's a law as fundamental
as thermodynamics,

957
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:37,747
and if one thinks about it,

958
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:40,688
it might also be viewed
as true of the stock market

959
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:41,747
or the financial markets,

960
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:42,780
which go like this,

961
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:43,917
and when they go like this,

962
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,324
they automatically go like this.

963
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,090
That's the history
of every bubble.

964
00:47:58,374 --> 00:48:04,802
I think it's a mistake
to ask, "lf people,"

965
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:11,582
and make all people
the same as one entity,

966
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,054
if they will understand it.

967
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,619
I don't care
if all people understand it.

968
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:22,153
When you're faced
with an overwhelming,

969
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,688
Iife-threatening crisis,

970
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:27,260
as in the Titanic being hit
by an iceberg,

971
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:29,999
and you happen to be aware
before anybody else is

972
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,165
that the ship is gonna sink

973
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:33,505
and there aren't
enough lifeboats

974
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,669
and you know
how to build lifeboats

975
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,645
and you tried
to deal with that

976
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,343
in however long the Titanic
had before it went down,

977
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:45,046
you're likely to run across
three types of passenger

978
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:46,315
on the Titanic.

979
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:48,289
You'll run across a type

980
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:51,020
that's basically
deer in the headlights.

981
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,652
"Ship's been hit?
What does that mean?

982
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:54,094
"What do I do?
I don't know what to do.

983
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,119
"l don't where to go.
Should I do that?

984
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:56,153
I don't know."

985
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,187
That's one group.

986
00:48:57,233 --> 00:49:00,498
There's another group that says,

987
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,163
"We get that the ship
is gonna sink.

988
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,365
"We get that we're all gonna die

989
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,271
"unless we make some lifeboats
and do it fast.

990
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:08,173
Show us what to do."

991
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,802
Then you have a third group
that says,

992
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:10,869
"This is the Titanic.

993
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:13,438
"It's absolutely unsinkable.

994
00:49:13,482 --> 00:49:15,814
"Un-fucking-sinkable.

995
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:17,648
"So we're going back to the bar
for a drink,

996
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:20,678
and all you doomsday sayers
can actually just take a hike."

997
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:22,850
Now, if you're the one who knows
how to build lifeboats,

998
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:25,122
which group of people
are you gonna help?

999
00:49:29,131 --> 00:49:31,759
Certain things
are inevitable right now.

1000
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:35,066
FDlC insolvency,
I will tell you, is coming.

1001
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:37,800
Insolvency of
the Federal Reserve is coming.

1002
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,001
Federal Reserve can go bankrupt.

1003
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,203
T-bill defaults.

1004
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:45,236
We're looking
at major bankruptcy,

1005
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:46,942
starvation, dislocation.

1006
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:49,849
All these things
are already on the way.

1007
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:54,986
Everything is
gonna break down

1008
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,618
differently in different places.

1009
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,753
The best that I can do
is give you some ideas

1010
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:03,959
of some markers
that are gonna come.

1011
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:07,662
The bumpy plateau has been
described by peak oil activists

1012
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:09,534
and researchers
for many, many years,

1013
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:11,870
and it's actually happening.

1014
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:17,368
Basically you come up
the growth curve of oil prices,

1015
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:21,406
and the oil prices go up until
you start running out of oil.

1016
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,214
Then what happens is,
you have to destroy demand,

1017
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,084
which is what's happening
with this collapse.

1018
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:28,817
Demand gets destroyed;
the price of oil drops.

1019
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:31,418
But as you start a recovery
you start back up again,

1020
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,918
and you collide again
with the finite oil

1021
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:36,488
and the rising energy prices,

1022
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:37,931
which shuts
everything down again.

1023
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,800
This is the bumpy plateau.

1024
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:43,669
I think it's fairly certain

1025
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,972
that the mortal blow to human
industrialiZed civiliZation

1026
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,173
will happen
when oil prices spike again

1027
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:53,613
and nobody can afford
to buy that oil,

1028
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:56,083
and everything
will just shut down.

1029
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:03,253
The collapse must happen fast

1030
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:06,659
in order to leave
infrastructure standing.

1031
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:09,095
We have all heard the stories
about infrastructure, you know,

1032
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:12,464
the sewers and the bridges
and the roads and all that.

1033
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:13,832
Well, the point is,

1034
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,329
is that as economic collapse
continues or accelerates,

1035
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:23,744
those structures will fall
into more and more disrepair.

1036
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,144
There's not gonna be
any money

1037
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,943
or anything running
to fix those,

1038
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:31,442
so what you want to have
is the change to a new paradigm,

1039
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,318
getting the old one
out of the way

1040
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,687
while there is still
infrastructure left

1041
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,249
to start building something new.

1042
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,263
We have to survive
the transition phase

1043
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,699
of human civiliZation,

1044
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:49,966
which I anticipate could last
anywhere between 20 years-

1045
00:51:50,005 --> 00:51:54,942
and oh, my God,
would that be fast and hard-

1046
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:56,808
you know, to 50 years
or 1 00 years

1047
00:51:56,845 --> 00:52:01,544
before some kind of stable
civiliZation starts to emerge.

1048
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,448
You need to survive
the transition phase.

1049
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:04,782
So don't panic.

1050
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,549
Don't freak out.

1051
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:08,419
Use your heads.

1052
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:12,120
AnalyZe your local situation
where you live,

1053
00:52:12,161 --> 00:52:14,129
don't worry about
rebuilding sewers.

1054
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:16,859
You're gonna be able
to get water for a few years.

1055
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:22,233
People say there's either oil
or no oil.

1056
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,762
There's either food or no food.

1057
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:26,297
And people say,

1058
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:28,708
"Well, we're gonna have food
in the supermarkets on Tuesday,

1059
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,143
and we're never gonna
see it again."

1060
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,612
That's not the way
it's gonna happen.

1061
00:52:31,647 --> 00:52:35,811
As things break down,
we will see specific shortages

1062
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:38,911
in specific areas
for periods of days

1063
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:42,515
before it gets to the point
where there's nothing left.

1064
00:52:42,558 --> 00:52:45,152
So what you need to prepare for
is not the end result,

1065
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:47,560
but you need to prepare
to survive the transition.

1066
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:52,490
When people say, "Okay,
I'm gonna run for the hills.

1067
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:53,728
"I'm gonna go build a cabin.

1068
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:56,067
I'm gonna buy ten million cans
of baked beans."

1069
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:58,005
Well, they're probably gonna be
the first to die.

1070
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,974
Number one, it's too late.

1071
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,567
If you don't know
how to live off the land,

1072
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,874
and if you're not already
on the land right now,

1073
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:05,106
don't even try to go,

1074
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,411
because you're gonna
fail miserably,

1075
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,939
and you might be shot
by the people

1076
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:10,611
who got there ahead of you.

1077
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:16,521
- You know, the one factor

1078
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:18,116
that you're not including
in some of this

1079
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,288
is just sort of discounting
human ingenuity,

1080
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,960
or our ability
to sort of problem solve.

1081
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:31,837
- Because my father was an Air
Force aviator combat veteran,

1082
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:35,401
he was very much trained
in a military style

1083
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,036
of decision making and analysis

1084
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,207
where it's motivated
by life-and-death decisions,

1085
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:42,740
where you are trained
how to think critically

1086
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,276
and respond critically
in response to emergency.

1087
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,118
So I was trained at an early age

1088
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:50,921
in the skill
of critical thinking,

1089
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,290
and maybe I have a gift
for it too.

1090
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:53,658
I believe there are some people

1091
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:55,993
who have a gift
for critical thinking.

1092
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:57,794
In my own experience
on the streets

1093
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,267
in South Central Los Angeles
as a cop,

1094
00:54:00,302 --> 00:54:01,826
there were quick decisions,

1095
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:07,672
sometimes decisions
which changed people's lives

1096
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:09,609
or could end people's lives,

1097
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:13,240
and it gave me an ability
to respond and think

1098
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,716
to separate the ice cream
from the bullshit.

1099
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,379
Probably one of
the biggest impediments

1100
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,320
I removed
to critical thinking was,

1101
00:54:20,355 --> 00:54:23,654
I stopped taking mainstream
media seriously a long time ago.

1102
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:30,123
- We were talking about
human ingenuity.

1103
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:39,136
- No amount of technology
and no amount of human ingenuity

1104
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:41,699
can possibly overturn
the laws of physics,

1105
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:44,735
the laws which govern
this planet.

1106
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,079
Those are intractable,
immutable, real,

1107
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:49,948
and science has never
been able to do that.

1108
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:52,681
Man's great arrogance,
I believe,

1109
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:54,746
and one for which
he is paying a price now

1110
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,258
is to believe that mankind
really could become God

1111
00:54:57,292 --> 00:55:01,854
and even turn over and upset
and revoke somehow

1112
00:55:01,897 --> 00:55:03,296
the laws of the universe.

1113
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:09,732
I am a great advocate of buying
and owning physical gold,

1114
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:10,999
not paper gold.

1115
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,064
You buy gold, you own it.

1116
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:15,906
When hyperinflation occurs
after deflation here,

1117
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:18,003
and all these trillions
of dollars come back

1118
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:21,379
and we are wheeling wheelbarrows
of thousand dollar bills

1119
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,351
to buy a loaf of bread,

1120
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:26,684
the only thing people
will accept for goods

1121
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:28,656
is gonna be gold.

1122
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,816
Do whatever you can

1123
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:32,088
to reinsulate your house
if you need to.

1124
00:55:32,127 --> 00:55:34,459
If you have a house,
if you have soil,

1125
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:36,794
you immediately
get it off petrochemicals

1126
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:39,062
and start learning
how to restore it.

1127
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:41,865
What I do in the yard
where I am renting,

1128
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:43,769
I'm mixing barbeque
and wood ash

1129
00:55:43,805 --> 00:55:45,500
and then I go out
and pee on everything,

1130
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,031
because then you get
the root elements

1131
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:50,943
of ammonium-nitrate that
starts to bring the soil back.

1132
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:55,416
If you are dependent upon
a cell phone, get a land line.

1133
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,441
All the
telecommunications companies

1134
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:59,477
that operate the satellites,
the cell towers,

1135
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:00,954
the fiber optic cables,

1136
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:03,651
and all this stuff that makes
your wonderful cell phone work

1137
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:06,752
are cutting back on maintenance
as the stock market collapses,

1138
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:10,128
and we're gonna see failures
in cell phone service.

1139
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:14,625
A land line is a redundancy
that can help you.

1140
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:19,004
Get books on first aid
and holistic medicine.

1141
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,271
Moderate fresh water supply,

1142
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,676
a reasonable amount
of food storage.

1143
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:25,373
You can't store enough
to live on.

1144
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,974
What you need to store is seeds.

1145
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:30,576
Seeds that are not manufactured
by Monsanto,

1146
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:31,950
that are not Frankenseeds,

1147
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,512
that only work one time
you plant them

1148
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,183
and then you got to go buy more.

1149
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:39,058
You get good organic
whole seeds,

1150
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:40,755
and you store them.

1151
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:44,288
That could be a great
currency in the future.

1152
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,864
Unlike the Great Depression,

1153
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:55,809
this is a vastly
different scenario.

1154
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,438
We do not have infinite
resources left to be tapped.

1155
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,314
We don't have lots of land,
we are at peak everything,

1156
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:05,286
all the commodities,
everything else.

1157
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,155
What they had in the 1 930s that
my grandparents told me about

1158
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:12,888
was the ability to grow food
right where they live,

1159
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:15,260
and local food production
is perhaps

1160
00:57:15,297 --> 00:57:18,130
the most fundamental key
to human survival

1161
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:21,294
in the collapse
of industrialiZed civiliZation.

1162
00:57:29,878 --> 00:57:33,143
We've had examples of what
happens when oil disappears

1163
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:34,808
and how civiliZations respond

1164
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,374
and what works and what doesn't.

1165
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:39,285
In 1 991,
the Soviet Union collapsed,

1166
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:41,846
and there were two nations
that were absolutely

1167
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,586
and totally dependent upon
Soviet oil for their survival

1168
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:45,991
because they had none:

1169
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:48,622
Cuba and North Korea.

1170
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:52,327
And what they did in response
to that was completely opposite,

1171
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:54,835
and the proof, as the say,
was in the pudding.

1172
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:02,942
North Korea was a rigid,
hierarchical, top-down,

1173
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:06,812
Soviet-style,
bureaucratic regime

1174
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:08,873
where everything came
from the central government.

1175
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:12,944
They managed everything,
and North Korea starved.

1176
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:18,449
I mean, it was-in human terms,
the suffering was amaZing.

1177
00:58:18,493 --> 00:58:19,858
All of a sudden,
there's no oil.

1178
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:20,919
There's no natural gas.

1179
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:21,951
There's no fertiliZer.

1180
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:22,986
Cars don't run.

1181
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:24,259
Trains don't run.

1182
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:26,494
You get to a point where
you can run trains on some days

1183
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:28,162
or generate electricity
on others,

1184
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:29,966
but you can't do both
at the same time.

1185
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:36,570
But the Cuban government
reverted

1186
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:38,602
to one of the purest forms
of capitalism.

1187
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:42,413
It said, "Everybody start
restoring the soil

1188
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:43,440
"and grow food.

1189
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:45,385
"You will grow food
where you live.

1190
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,513
"lf you find any piece
of arable land

1191
00:58:47,556 --> 00:58:49,524
"that is not being used,
you occupy it,

1192
00:58:49,558 --> 00:58:50,616
"and you start farming it,

1193
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,025
and you start growing food
right now."

1194
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:54,858
The Cuban government
did everything it could

1195
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:58,024
to liberate local food growing,

1196
00:58:58,066 --> 00:58:59,055
and what happened was,

1197
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:01,262
is after a very tough period,

1198
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:05,763
the Cuban people were eating
better than they had ever eaten,

1199
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:09,004
because they were free of
this whole agri-biZ, you know,

1200
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:10,636
Frankenfood nightmare.

1201
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:12,169
Everything was organic,

1202
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:15,377
and you had every square inch
in Havana that had soil,

1203
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:20,650
on rooftops or in flower boxes,
was growing food,

1204
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:22,520
and there was a degree
of sustainability.

1205
00:59:22,557 --> 00:59:24,184
Everything became organic,

1206
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:27,195
and all you had to do
was separate the people

1207
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:30,221
from the way money worked
and top-down control,

1208
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:32,199
explain to them,
you grow it where you eat it,

1209
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:33,223
and you're gonna make it,

1210
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:34,997
and Cuba survived and thrived.

1211
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:42,335
And that's the essence
of where everything is going to

1212
00:59:42,377 --> 00:59:44,345
in the new human paradigm.

1213
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:46,370
Everything will be local.

1214
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:55,212
Jack London was one
of my favorite writers,

1215
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:58,317
and he wrote about animals
a lot.

1216
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,918
One thing you know about animals

1217
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:01,360
is that they all want to go home

1218
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,159
when they know that
they're gonna face death.

1219
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:05,257
They all want to be
in their tribe

1220
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,928
or their pack or whatever it is.

1221
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,436
They want to be
on familiar ground.

1222
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:12,770
It's a natural animal instinct.

1223
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:16,437
In Dubai, the economic crash
has hit so hard

1224
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:19,641
that lndians who were living
and working in Dubai

1225
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:21,080
Iost their jobs,

1226
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:23,346
and they just drove
to the Dubai airport

1227
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:25,080
and abandoned their cars.

1228
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,748
There was a story talking about
all the cars that were abandoned

1229
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:31,691
as these lndians caught a
one-way ticket home to go home.

1230
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:33,694
It's happening in Britain too.

1231
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:36,595
You have lots of Poles
and Eastern Europeans,

1232
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:38,462
who were the latecomers
into E.U.,

1233
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,525
fleeing Britain to go home.

1234
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,538
Now in some areas, and certainly
in the southern California basin

1235
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:47,235
with 1 3, 1 4 million people
and a four-day food supply,

1236
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:50,301
it's clear that people are going
to migrate out of this area,

1237
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:51,778
because it's not sustainable.

1238
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:54,441
We get most of our water
from Northern California.

1239
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:57,577
That's a problem.

1240
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:00,179
We get a lot of our electricity
from Hoover Dam

1241
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:01,416
out in Las Vegas.

1242
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:02,889
Hmm.

1243
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:06,360
Phoenix, for God's sake,
Las Vegas,

1244
01:01:06,394 --> 01:01:08,760
those people have to
worry about where to go,

1245
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:15,532
and community
is what will save us.

1246
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,435
You are gonna have to do it
in conjunction

1247
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:19,064
with your neighbors
and your family

1248
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:21,632
and the people around you.

1249
01:01:21,676 --> 01:01:23,439
You will fail
as a rugged individual.

1250
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:26,311
You will survive as a member
of a tribe or a family.

1251
01:01:30,218 --> 01:01:31,515
I have emotion about this.

1252
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:34,454
I'm losing it.

1253
01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:56,301
We have waited-

1254
01:01:56,344 --> 01:02:01,111
have waited for so long
for somebody to listen to us.

1255
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,621
When the mainstream press
and the government says

1256
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,124
nobody could have
predicted this,

1257
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:14,788
they're lying through
their fucking teeth.

1258
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:17,798
We all saw exactly
what was gonna happen

1259
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,424
and how it was gonna happen

1260
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:22,197
and, remarkably,
when it was gonna happen.

1261
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:23,864
None of us expected the collapse

1262
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:25,805
to be as severe
as it's proving to be

1263
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,308
or as fast
as it's proving to be.

1264
01:02:28,343 --> 01:02:29,867
But we've been screaming
for years,

1265
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:31,606
and we've been watching
everything we said

1266
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:32,635
come to pass,

1267
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:38,483
and we have felt so angry.

1268
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:53,358
[people speaking indistinctly]

1269
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:56,461
I haven't lost
emotional connection to it.

1270
01:02:56,504 --> 01:02:59,769
What I have learned to do
over the course of my life

1271
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:03,938
is to balance the-

1272
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:08,075
the horror with love,

1273
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:12,644
with play,
with making people smile.

1274
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,450
I take my dog out for a walk,

1275
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:18,118
and we count how many smiles
we can inflict

1276
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,251
in the course of one walk.

1277
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:20,727
I walk through downtown
Culver City,

1278
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:23,560
and, you know, I usually
come home, you know, and say,

1279
01:03:23,598 --> 01:03:26,726
"That was 23 smiles
we created today."

1280
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:28,702
And for some reason
at this moment in time,

1281
01:03:28,737 --> 01:03:30,705
that's a very precious
little treat for me.

1282
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:40,109
There was a psychologist-
psychiatrist,

1283
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,082
EliZabeth Kübler Ross,

1284
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:45,086
who talked about
the five stages of grief,

1285
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,109
and when you're hit with

1286
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:49,453
an overwhelming
life-changing situation.

1287
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:50,924
The first is denial.

1288
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:52,358
"This can't possibly
be happening.

1289
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:55,852
It's not true;
no, it's not happening."

1290
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:58,559
And you stay in denial,
and you fight to stay in denial.

1291
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,830
Then comes anger.

1292
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:07,035
I really believe that mankind
is now entering just barely-

1293
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:11,171
it has just barely crossed the
threshold of the anger phase.

1294
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:26,957
We have to get through
the anger phase.

1295
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,190
And how we get through
that anger phase

1296
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,255
is going to be critical.

1297
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:34,962
The way we're going
under current government

1298
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:37,369
and monetary rule,

1299
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:39,669
the only kind of anger
that's going to be produced

1300
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,006
is the destructive kind,

1301
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:45,672
borne of absolute frustration
and bitterness

1302
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:47,682
that nothing
that's being sold to us

1303
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:48,808
as being a solution

1304
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:52,479
is making us feel
any goddamn better.

1305
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,919
Then, of course, after that,

1306
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:55,252
you know,
we have the bargaining.

1307
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,384
Well, the bargaining
is kind of going on now too.

1308
01:04:58,426 --> 01:05:00,326
"Maybe I could've
done something different.

1309
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:01,988
"Maybe I should have
thought of this.

1310
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,090
Maybe if I do this now,
it won't be different."

1311
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:06,964
Then you go through
the bargaining,

1312
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,026
and you finally get to a place
of depression,

1313
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,560
where it's really starting
to sink in,

1314
01:05:10,605 --> 01:05:12,197
and these are all
emotional stages

1315
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,264
that one goes through

1316
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:14,468
whether they're an individual

1317
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:17,034
or a culture
or a civiliZation.

1318
01:05:17,078 --> 01:05:19,672
And the final stage
is acceptance,

1319
01:05:19,714 --> 01:05:21,147
and it's really only when people

1320
01:05:21,182 --> 01:05:23,582
have reached
the point of acceptance

1321
01:05:23,618 --> 01:05:25,609
that you can find those people
who are like

1322
01:05:25,653 --> 01:05:27,553
part of the ones
on the Titanic saying,

1323
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:29,784
"Okay, show us
how to build a lifeboat."

1324
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:35,992
- You know, there's different
ways to look at-

1325
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,759
you can find stories
that support arguments

1326
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:39,130
that you want to make,

1327
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:41,032
just because there's
different authors

1328
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:42,934
that sort of support
your world view,

1329
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:44,336
and there's other ones
that don't.

1330
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:47,671
Is it possible to sort
of create a reality

1331
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:51,076
based on picking news stories
that support your world view?

1332
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:01,081
- I don't do debates anymore,

1333
01:06:01,122 --> 01:06:03,022
and the reason why
I don't do debates anymore

1334
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:06,254
is because I don't have to.

1335
01:06:06,294 --> 01:06:08,455
At some point, you have
to acknowledge the fact

1336
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:10,157
that what I've been
writing about

1337
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:11,392
and what I've been saying

1338
01:06:11,432 --> 01:06:13,866
is actually happening
all around us.

1339
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:17,531
So why do I need
to debate anything?

1340
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:19,665
Why does the peak oil movement,

1341
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:22,107
why does
the sustainability movement,

1342
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:24,407
need to debate anything?

1343
01:06:24,445 --> 01:06:26,208
Everything that we said
was gonna happen

1344
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:28,511
is taking place right now.

1345
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:41,518
Every aspect of human existence
is on the table.

1346
01:06:41,563 --> 01:06:45,124
As far as political parties go,
they're all anachronisms.

1347
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:50,126
They're all products
of centuries gone by.

1348
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:53,038
The human race now
is only going to be concerned

1349
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:54,268
not with an ideology

1350
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,004
but what allows them to survive.

1351
01:06:57,478 --> 01:07:00,538
Capitalism, socialism,
and communism are all terms

1352
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:02,948
that need to be tossed
in the trash can immediately,

1353
01:07:02,984 --> 01:07:04,918
because all of them were created

1354
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:08,480
on the assumption
of infinite resources.

1355
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:12,015
Not one of those ideologies
that are now dead dinosaurs,

1356
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,527
archaic fossils,

1357
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,961
and no longer relevant
to our way of life,

1358
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:19,057
not one of them recogniZes
that there must be a balance

1359
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,333
between growth and the resources
and the planet.

1360
01:07:24,372 --> 01:07:27,364
So forget the idea that you can
have as much as you want,

1361
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:30,775
because until mankind
surrenders to the fact

1362
01:07:30,812 --> 01:07:32,643
that it lives
on a finite planet

1363
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,910
and it must have balance
with that planet,

1364
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:37,076
with the planet's resources,
with the animal life,

1365
01:07:37,118 --> 01:07:38,210
and all the other life,

1366
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:40,653
there can be no happiness
for anything.

1367
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:42,553
Anything.

1368
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:45,457
It's all about
getting balance back.

1369
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:49,953
And who sold me the idea
that it was my destiny to grow?

1370
01:07:49,998 --> 01:07:51,397
Nothing grows forever.

1371
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:53,195
There's no such thing
as infinite growth.

1372
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:54,724
It's not possible.

1373
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:57,169
Look around at everything you
see around you that's living.

1374
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:58,900
There is a cycle:

1375
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,842
birth, growth, maturation,
decline, and death.

1376
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:04,936
The challenge being faced
by the human race now

1377
01:08:04,979 --> 01:08:06,139
is either evolve or perish,

1378
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,408
either grow up or die.

1379
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:08,540
God doesn't care.

1380
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,073
God's not gonna play babysitter
for us.

1381
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,678
The challenge is either
you grow up and mature,

1382
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,278
change your minds
and the way you think,

1383
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:16,187
or you're gonna perish.

1384
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,919
Everything is on the table now.

1385
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:19,187
God is on the table.

1386
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:22,526
Every religion in the world
is on the table now.

1387
01:08:22,563 --> 01:08:24,690
They'll all be measured
as standards by,

1388
01:08:24,732 --> 01:08:27,326
"This is reality, and this is
what the religion says,"

1389
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:28,528
and every religion in the world

1390
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:31,094
is gonna be under
a huge microscope.

1391
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:33,039
This is gonna be
the greatest age of evolution

1392
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:35,269
in human thinking
that's ever taken place.

1393
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,342
You walk towards your fear.

1394
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:41,609
You embrace your fear.

1395
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,140
You don't try to hedge it,

1396
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:46,619
that a part of real living
as a human being,

1397
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:47,916
as a spiritual being,

1398
01:08:47,956 --> 01:08:51,221
is to embrace and encompass
your fear, your love,

1399
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:53,659
and not run away from anything,

1400
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:56,562
because that's
the life experience,

1401
01:08:56,597 --> 01:08:58,326
and it's in that richness

1402
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:00,596
that I think we find
the most beautiful art,

1403
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,068
the most beautiful music.

1404
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:05,800
We find the richness of
what the human soul can offer,

1405
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,176
and I see all that richness
buried under such bullshit.

1406
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:21,019
- Can you talk about
your own spirituality?

1407
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:23,216
You talk about
a lot of different religions.

1408
01:09:23,257 --> 01:09:29,196
How do you define
your own spirituality?

1409
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:32,859
- I quote a Christian,
St. Timothy,

1410
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:38,361
and I find it to be true
what he said,

1411
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:43,343
that the love of money
is the root of all evil.

1412
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:46,779
That's the end result of my
spiritual intellectual quest.

1413
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,042
It is the end.

1414
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:50,846
It is the fundamental truth
that I have verified

1415
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:56,152
through three decades of
empirical, investigative, legal,

1416
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,284
academic research,

1417
01:09:59,327 --> 01:10:01,420
trying to answer
some fundamental questions

1418
01:10:01,462 --> 01:10:04,226
about human existence
and why we behave the way we do,

1419
01:10:04,265 --> 01:10:05,459
why we think the way we do,

1420
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,195
we we act the way we do.

1421
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:09,203
The love of money
is the root of all evil,

1422
01:10:09,237 --> 01:10:10,397
and it is the love of money

1423
01:10:10,438 --> 01:10:13,100
which has the potential
to exterminate,

1424
01:10:13,141 --> 01:10:17,237
to render extinct
the entire human race.

1425
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:34,153
All right,
so here we have this-

1426
01:10:34,195 --> 01:10:37,187
this likeable,

1427
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:42,828
sincere guy
in the White House,

1428
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:47,807
and he is as imprisoned
as we all are.

1429
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:48,831
I need to cut.

1430
01:10:48,876 --> 01:10:50,537
I need to cut.
I need to cut.

1431
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:53,843
I'm just having a real powerful
wave of emotion right now,

1432
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:57,214
because a whole new realiZation
is opening to me

1433
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:58,775
about what I'm actually saying,

1434
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,617
and this is some
serious fucking shit,

1435
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:04,113
so I got to get my head
around it for a second.

1436
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:06,149
Fuck.

1437
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:13,431
Okay, I'm ready.

1438
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:14,799
He is a prisoner of government.

1439
01:11:14,836 --> 01:11:15,894
He's a prisoner of politics.

1440
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,404
He's a prisoner of economics.

1441
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:19,838
He's a prisoner of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

1442
01:11:19,874 --> 01:11:21,671
He's a prisoner
of the Federal Reserve.

1443
01:11:21,709 --> 01:11:24,940
He's a prisoner
of a governmental system

1444
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:28,278
that's archaic
and not quickly responsive,

1445
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:33,811
so we should not make
the success or failure

1446
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:39,259
of human civiliZation
rest on his shoulders.

1447
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:47,632
The only thing in the world that
you and I can possibly change

1448
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:49,636
to give ourselves
a chance of survival

1449
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,467
and to give our children
a chance

1450
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:58,309
at some kind of human
civiliZed life is our minds.

1451
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:04,012
You have to believe, not wish,
not hope, not pray, not beg.

1452
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:06,383
You just have to believe
that there's a way out of it,

1453
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,047
and you're gonna find it.

1454
01:12:08,089 --> 01:12:10,649
This is perhaps
the greatest part

1455
01:12:10,691 --> 01:12:12,090
of the American character is,

1456
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,218
when we get pissed off

1457
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:14,956
and we put our minds
to something

1458
01:12:14,996 --> 01:12:16,896
and we clearly understand
what needs to be done

1459
01:12:16,931 --> 01:12:18,159
and we believe in it,

1460
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:20,565
we really can change things.

1461
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:26,267
I plan on living joyfully and
happily for the rest of my life,

1462
01:12:26,307 --> 01:12:28,070
a free man.

1463
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:30,100
Shit.

1464
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:32,669
How can you possibly say
there's no hope?

1465
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:36,012
Just change your mind
and see what we see.

1466
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,779
Stop thinking like dinosaurs.

1467
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:43,981
- So do you feel that the work
that you do,

1468
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,356
you're just gonna do it

1469
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:47,384
regardless of what the
possible consequences are?

1470
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:50,727
It just would be so much easier
to have walked away.

1471
01:12:55,069 --> 01:13:04,307
- If there was a German
in 1 932, 1 933,

1472
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:06,472
who had the foresight
to look ahead

1473
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:09,039
and to see what
the inevitable end result

1474
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,779
of the Third Reich would be,

1475
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:14,049
if there was somebody
who had seen that coming,

1476
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:17,216
do you honestly think that
they could in good conscience

1477
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:18,850
turn around
and walk away from it

1478
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:21,623
and pretend it wasn't there?

1479
01:13:21,662 --> 01:13:24,825
When every passing day,

1480
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:26,526
from the first election
of Adolf Hitler

1481
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,398
as Chancellor in 1 933,

1482
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:32,031
to Kristallnacht,
to the Night of the Long Knives,

1483
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:35,372
to Anschluss,
the occupation of Austria,

1484
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:37,843
to Sudetenland, Poland,

1485
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:40,608
as all of those things happened
that were right on the map,

1486
01:13:40,648 --> 01:13:43,515
how do you think that person
would have felt?

1487
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:47,681
Do you think that person
could have walked away?

1488
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:51,385
We are all collectively
as a species responsible

1489
01:13:51,425 --> 01:13:56,328
for what may be the greatest
preventable holocaust

1490
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:58,832
in the history of planet Earth.

1491
01:13:58,866 --> 01:14:02,427
Our own suicide.

1492
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:06,099
How do you walk away from that?

1493
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,904
How do you sleep at night?

1494
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:12,003
Who is anybody?

1495
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:17,380
Who are you to tell me

1496
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:21,047
it would have been easier
to walk away?

1497
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:22,715
You aren't in my skin.

1498
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:25,248
It was never easier for me
to walk away

1499
01:14:25,293 --> 01:14:28,387
because to walk away
would have meant to compromise.

1500
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:32,763
To walk away would have meant
selling out.

1501
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:43,999
You know, I'm still a guy who,
30 years ago,

1502
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:46,605
approached his government
as a citiZen

1503
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:49,207
asking for redress of grievance.

1504
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,683
I caught the ClA dealing drugs.

1505
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:51,844
It's wrong.

1506
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,353
Somebody needs
to talk about this,

1507
01:14:53,387 --> 01:14:56,083
and I'm still that same guy.

1508
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:59,422
I'm still the 27-year-old
about to be promoted,

1509
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,258
perfect record,
perfect rating report,

1510
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:06,630
LAPD-
dedicated, clean LAPD cop.

1511
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,191
He's still alive in me,

1512
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:12,262
and he very much wants
some answers.

1513
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:40,259
There is a legend or a fable
that really speaks to my life

1514
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:41,632
about the 1 00th Monkey.

1515
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:54,173
A long time ago
in the late '40s, early '50s

1516
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,240
when atom bombs and H-bombs
were in vogue

1517
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:59,446
with above-ground testing,

1518
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:03,082
we set off an atom bomb
on an atoll in the Pacific,

1519
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:04,921
and then we waited
a number of years,

1520
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:07,325
because we wanted
to answer questions like,

1521
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:09,625
"Gee, how soon after we
nuked something

1522
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:12,826
would it be possible to get
any kind of life started again?"

1523
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:16,893
So they went back
to this island,

1524
01:16:16,937 --> 01:16:19,633
and they decided
to repopulate it with monkeys,

1525
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:22,073
and the monkeys ate coconuts.

1526
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:24,100
Everything was pretty healthy

1527
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:26,443
except for the fact that
the husks of the coconuts

1528
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:31,383
were slightly radioactive.

1529
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:35,253
So the scientists took
ten monkeys or so

1530
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:38,122
and taught them
to wash the coconuts

1531
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,686
in a fresh water stream
on the island

1532
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:44,163
before they cracked them open

1533
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:48,134
and turned the whole thing loose
to see what would happen.

1534
01:16:48,169 --> 01:16:49,466
Well, you know, pretty soon,

1535
01:16:49,503 --> 01:16:52,370
maybe 1 2 monkeys out of
a population of 1 0,000

1536
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:53,839
were washing their coconuts

1537
01:16:53,874 --> 01:16:57,037
and then 20,
and then 47.

1538
01:16:59,146 --> 01:17:01,979
But a funny thing happened.

1539
01:17:02,016 --> 01:17:03,711
As soon as the 1 00th monkey

1540
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:05,378
started washing
his coconut husk,

1541
