1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:04,366
(potato chips crunching)

2
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,241
(crunching continues)

3
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:30,866
Um, yeah, as you know,
I'm a heavy drinker.

4
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,991
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.
But the Norwegians put me
to shame.

5
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,199
Yeah.
They said the food was good,
but I don't remember anything.

6
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,699
Well... (laughs)
But...

7
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,699
Mmm...
Anyway, we missed you.

8
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:44,699
Aw, man, I know.
But, uh, you know,

9
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,407
I gotta save my air miles,
and Oslo's fucking expensive,

10
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,657
everybody's getting
married in far-off places,

11
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:53,449
like, it's just--
and Annie wants to go
to Mexico this year, so...

12
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,449
I see how it is.
Soon, I'll be flying
to your wedding.

13
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,074
That's the idea.
Hey, baby.

14
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,782
Annie:
Hey, babe.
I'm talking to Chad.

15
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,074
Oh, fun!

16
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,949
Hey, Chad. How you doing?

17
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,782
Annie, I love your turban.
Thank you.
It's just for you.

18
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,449
How was that wedding
that you were at?

19
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,324
The wedding was beautiful.

20
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,699
A wonderful expression of love.
Mm...

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,407
And, uh, another one
bites the dust.

22
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,199
Aren't you coming
next week to Dinah's?

23
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:20,074
Mm-hm. Yeah, uh, Chad's
gonna crash with us, baby.

24
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,407
Oh, get out.
That's so fun.

25
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:25,907
Wait, I thought you
were gonna stay at the
little FIT girl's house?

26
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:27,699
The little anorexic one.
Nope.

27
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,949
We had a bit
of a falling out, let's say,

28
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:32,449
when she came
to visit me in Phnom Penh.
Mm...

29
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:34,699
Yeah. She's immature.
So...

30
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:37,824
Well, yeah, you're obviously
welcome here at all times.

31
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,949
Yeah.
We're just so boring.

32
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,949
We're gonna have a great time.
Yeah.

33
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,699
It's gonna be a good time.
Yeah, actually, I have
to get ready for work now,

34
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:46,449
but I guess I'll
see you next week.

35
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,032
Annie, great to see you.
Good to see you, Chad.

36
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,699
(Kabir laughs) Okay, man.
I'll-- I'll see you later.

37
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,157
I'll talk to you soon,
all right?

38
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,574
Kabir, thank you
for waking up early

39
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,157
to talk to me
over the Internet.

40
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,324
Ah, I've been up for an hour.
Annie: Kabir!

41
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:02,074
You left fucking crumbs
on the bed again!

42
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:04,824
Man on radio:
I would not have spent
New Year's Eve...

43
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:08,449
Chad:
You didn't hang up.

44
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,324
Oh, shit, Kabir, still?
(air mattress pump whirring)

45
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,324
Do you remember
that time after Dillo Day

46
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,782
he ate that whole baked ham?
With the dipping sauces!

47
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,199
Kabir: Yes, yes.
(laughter)

48
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,157
Yeah! And you were like,
"Who ate my ham?"

49
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:20,699
You did!
We were watching you!

50
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,449
Oh, that was so cute!

51
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,199
We have to put alarms
on the kitchen cabinets again.

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,824
Little baby locks.
Little baby locks.
I never-- that's--

53
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:29,574
Stop. I'm not baby locks.

54
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,032
Um, why don't we go out
and get a night cap?

55
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:34,282
I got to be
at the hospital, like, 9:00.

56
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:36,907
Look, I'm, like, eight hours
ahead right now, so I'm awake.

57
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,282
I mean, I have
to be up super early.
I would otherwise.

58
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,449
I met up with Berit
before I boarded the plane.
Oh, shit.

59
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,699
The hot 43-year-old?
Baby! Come on.

60
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,991
We had an interesting time.
Kabir:
Yeah, I know what that is.

61
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,949
We had three
interesting times.

62
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:52,741
That's our cue
to go to bed.
Yeah, we, uh...

63
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,241
We, like, need
a serious eight hours.

64
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,116
Oh, I heard
about people like that.

65
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,491
And that's a joke,
Annie, and I like you.

66
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,241
Um, can I get the keys?

67
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,616
What's your name?
Rachel.

68
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,949
What's your name?
Sh! Chad.

69
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,866
(Chad, Rachel moaning)

70
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:18,199
(air mattress pump whirring)

71
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,116
Kabir:
I know, I know, all right?

72
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,199
The hospital was crazy,
but I'll be five minutes.

73
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,866
It's fine. Don't worry. Just
the car is coming in 20 minutes.

74
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:27,116
So can you wake him up?
What? Chad, dude.

75
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,991
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Dinah's wedding!

76
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,866
He can take his own car.
Dinah's wedding!
Fifteen minutes!

77
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,991
He can take his own car.
Kabir: He's not gonna
take his own car.

78
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,241
It's snowing!

79
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,866
Thank you so much,
Dinah's cousin. (coughs)

80
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,241
There.

81
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,199
It's Isabelle.

82
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,741
And no problem.

83
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,991
You want some, dude?
No.

84
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,116
Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:02,366
Annie:
Kabir! What are you doing?

86
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,241
Can we get out of here, please?

87
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,366
(laughs)
Hey.

88
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,074
Yo, I think we might
stay out a little while.

89
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,241
Yeah.
Um, can I get your keys?

90
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,116
Yeah, okay.
Annie: Kabir!

91
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,491
Okay.
Annie: It's really cold.

92
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:16,241
Thank you.
Bye!

93
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,616
Hurry home.
(laughs) Run!

94
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:23,366
(both laugh)
So on which side
are you cousins? Of Dinah?

95
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,116
Isabelle: My mom.
I mean, the mom. Moms.

96
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:27,199
The mom. The mother.
Moms are sisters.
Sister-moms.

97
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,366
(Chad, Isabelle moaning)
Isabelle: Yeah.

98
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,991
(Kabir snores)

99
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,116
Isabelle:
Oh my god. Stop.

100
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,866
Looks like my flight's
been canceled.

101
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:47,741
(electric pump whirring)

102
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:50,241
Whoo!
Yeah!

103
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,199
Well, well, well!

104
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,449
Under-arm, please, Annie.

105
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,449
I have my own style, Chad.
Okay?

106
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,241
Chad:
Well, it's illegal
in this game.

107
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,491
I mean, are we keeping
track of rules? They're fine.

108
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,866
Chad: Kabi, this spring
do you wanna do the
Mont Blanc trail with me?

109
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,866
Whoo!
There you go!
Her style works.

110
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,741
Kabir:
Like, climbing a mountain?

111
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,866
It's not all climbing.
Sometimes you descend and--

112
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,116
you in?
Oh, yeah?

113
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,574
Uh, you know, we gotta--

114
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:16,074
We actually have
been planning the Mexico trip

115
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,366
for a whole year now, so...

116
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,366
Yeah, we're gonna
go to Mexico.

117
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,616
Yeah.

118
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,741
(clanks)
Nice!

119
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,991
Okay.

120
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,741
Mystery of the ages.

121
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,824
So... ta-da!
That's for you.

122
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:32,491
So is this, like,
some pickup-artist shit?

123
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,991
Uh, no, I don't do that.
I'm a proud asexual.

124
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,866
Huh.
Yeah, I just love magic.

125
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,241
Wow. I don't think
I've ever met an asexual.

126
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,491
You definitely have.
We're all over the place.

127
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,949
(phone chirps)
Very interesting.

128
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,366
Yeah. Psst!
Hold on one second.

129
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,866
Hi, Isabelle.
Here's some literature.

130
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,741
Isabelle: Hey, dude.
I'm not at home.
Thank you.

131
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:50,991
Can you come
to my friend's house?

132
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,241
Yeah, I'll come out there.

133
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,741
The Guy:
Dude, whatever you are making

134
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,241
smells fucking amazing, man.

135
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,574
Oh, thanks.
It's just root vegetables

136
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:58,741
in the pressure cooker.

137
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,741
That's just root vegetables?
That's it.

138
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,866
I'm making a soup.
Why don't you stick around?

139
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,616
I'm making more
than we could eat.
Oh, no, no.

140
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,366
Why? You totally should stay!

141
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,866
You should totally stay.
Stay. Why not?

142
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,324
Come on.
You have somewhere else to be?

143
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,116
Yeah, where do you have to be?
Stay. Totally stay.

144
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,366
Why not?
You must stay.

145
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,366
Okay, fuck it, dude!
I'll stay.

146
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,366
I'm making a chocolate
cardamom space cake

147
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,491
for dessert.
Delicious.

148
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:20,116
Is he inviting
this guy to dinner?

149
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,866
Yeah, I think it
sounds like that.

150
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,574
He's, like, a pot dealer.

151
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,616
Hey, baby?
Mm-hm?

152
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,449
What's up?
Are you happy?

153
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,324
Am I happy?
With us?

154
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,616
Yeah, I'm super happy.
Aren't you happy?

155
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,991
I'm really happy.
I love you.
I'm incredibly happy.

156
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,824
I love you.
What's this about?
I just--

157
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:43,991
I don't know, I just feel
like we don't go out anymore.

158
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:46,991
We haven't had sex
in, like, a month.

159
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,699
I've been trying.
You're always--

160
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,116
Look, things have been crazy,
okay, with work
and with your LSATs.

161
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,366
And, you know,
we've got a plan. That's...

162
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,241
All right. Well,
I just want you to know that

163
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,282
if you want to go
on the long trail

164
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,949
in Mont Blanc,
I want you to go.

165
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,074
I don't wanna go.
Okay, good.

166
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,282
I didn't want you to go anyway.
Of course not.

167
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,824
But if you want to go,
you can go.
We're going to Mexico.

168
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,449
I want to go
to Mexico with you.

169
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,157
Holy shit, dude.
That was fucking delicious.

170
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:18,574
Fucking delicious.
Thank you.

171
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:22,032
Who's ready for some
chocolate cardamom space cake?

172
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:25,699
Dude, I'm so stoned.
That would just put me to sleep.

173
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,824
Chad, I wanna vomit just so I
can taste your food again, man.

174
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,449
(laughs) Okay, that's gross.

175
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,074
Yeah, that's a weird thing.
I'm gonna go there.

176
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,699
I said a weird thing.
That's okay.

177
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,949
I'm gonna leave this place.

178
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,199
Thank you so much. Isabelle,

179
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,407
please call me again.

180
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,782
I will.
Guys, nice to meet you.

181
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,574
See you guys!
All: Bye!

182
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:43,699
Annie, I'm assuming you're
a big "no" on the space cake.

183
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,074
You're psychic, Chad.
But, uh, Kabir?

184
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,449
No, man. I'm on call
tomorrow, so I can't.

185
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,949
Do you want just a puff?
No, because I'm on call, so...

186
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,074
You guys hear that Dinah's
family spent $60,000
on that wedding?

187
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:00,157
Yeah.
Chad: I think
that's disgusting.

188
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:02,949
$60,000?
Kabir:
Yeah.

189
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,824
That's insane.
That's a lot.

190
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:08,074
When I got married,
we just went to City Hall,

191
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,782
and then had a barbecue
in the park,

192
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:14,282
and it was only $400,
and it was awesome.

193
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:17,824
Wait, so you're currently
married, or you were married?

194
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:19,407
She's in an open marriage.
Present day.

195
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,074
She's in an open marriage.
Oh...

196
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,157
Don't even think about it.
Whoa. Don't.

197
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,199
You don't need to look at me.
You're smiling.

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,449
Well, you know, it's--
uh, it's interesting.

199
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,824
I think it's beautiful.
Annie: You would think
that's beautiful, Chad.

200
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,199
I would, and I do.

201
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,699
So, like, your husband
knows that you're here,

202
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,449
and he's fine?
Isabelle: Oh, yeah, yeah.

203
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,907
He's on the Coachella Cruise

204
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,199
with our really
good friend Chloe right now.

205
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,824
They're having a blast.

206
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,574
So, like, you don't ever

207
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,782
feel, like, a little jealous
or resentful?

208
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,074
You're making it negative.

209
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,574
Kabir: No, she's not--
I'm not jealous.

210
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:50,824
Annie: I'm entitled
to my own opinion, Chad.

211
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,324
Of course. Of course.
Negative opinion.

212
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,574
People ask a lot of questions,

213
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,324
and that's
totally valid and fair,

214
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:59,657
but it's really lovely.
We mostly just date our friends.

215
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:02,324
It's just like--
it's all love, you know?

216
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,199
That kind of thing.

217
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:07,157
I mean, you guys used to fuck,
and that's not a problem?
No.

218
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,449
Kabir: What?
No.

219
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:09,449
No?

220
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,199
What's she talking about?

221
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,282
Is she--
is she fucking serious?
(Chad clears throat)

222
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,282
(knock on door)

223
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,199
I'll get the door.

224
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,157
Kabir:
Wait, is she serious?

225
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:24,407
When? When did you
used to fuck?

226
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:26,324
Annie: Baby.
It was sophomore year,

227
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,657
and I thought someone
would have told you.
Annie: I honestly forgot.

228
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:29,949
Kabir: Someone didn't tell me.
Yeah.

229
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,824
Chad: I thought she
would have told you by now.

230
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,949
Hey, guys, I forgot
about the money... (laughs)

231
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,532
Oh, shit.
So, uh...

232
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:39,699
Sorry, man. Kabir,
I'll get you back for this.

233
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,074
(shouts)
What the--

234
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,157
(phone rings, buzzing,
speaks indiscernibly)

235
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,949
(computerized voice)
Fuck. Hello?

236
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,449
(woman on phone)
Dr. Kahn?
Yeah? Uh, yes? No.

237
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:53,824
Woman: Dr. Brenner's
trying to locate you.

238
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:55,574
Did you receive our page?
Well, y-- yeah.

239
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,324
Woman: Can we let him
know you're on your way?

240
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:58,782
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yes, yes.

241
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:00,824
Of course.
Woman: He said to let you
know that it's urgent.

242
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,824
(coughs) No...
Woman: Everything okay?

243
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:04,782
I was-- okay.

244
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:06,657
I'm, uh, on my way.
I'm on my way.

245
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,324
Woman:
Very good. We'll let him know.

246
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:09,824
Fuck!

247
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,324
Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

248
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:15,949
(door opens, closes)

249
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,574
Kabir:
Oh, shit.

250
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:22,157
(rock music plays)
