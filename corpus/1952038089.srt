1
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:36,007
Dreams are
like stars.

2
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,784
You can't touch them,
but if you follow them,

3
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,918
they will lead you to your destiny.

4
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:46,261
I used to dream of being the first
dogmonaut to walk on the Moon.

5
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:50,935
And now, I dream of going home
to my boy, Sasha.

6
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,099
It's incredible.

7
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:28,470
[groans quietly]

8
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,736
You two astronauts
need to get some sleep.

9
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,041
- You've got a big day tomorrow, Sam.
- It's gonna be the coolest.

10
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:36,173
I've never seen
a real spaceship before.

11
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,287
[groans]

12
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,913
I wish you could come too.

13
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,584
But I've already asked school
like 12 times.

14
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,752
No pets.

15
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,830
Look, a shooting star, Buddha.

16
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,527
[barks]

17
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,600
Make a wish.

18
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,838
I wish to one day touch the Moon.

19
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,877
Sam, honey, come to bed.

20
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,540
Goodnight, Buddha.

21
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,876
[Buddha groans]

22
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,680
Launch. [mimics rocket]

23
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,153
I wish that all your dreams come true.

24
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:31,166
Sorry you can't come, Buddha.

25
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,467
Namaste.

26
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,101
Not to worry.
I have a plan of my own.

27
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,475
[whimpers]

28
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,912
[kisses, blows]

29
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:50,012
- [girl] Catch!
- [groans]

30
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,387
Bye, Rosebud!

31
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,758
Rosebud, where are you?

32
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,758
Come on, sis. I've got a plan
for a rainy day field trip.

33
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,895
Gross! No way I'm going out
in that rain. It'll wreck my furdo.

34
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,268
Come on, let's go!

35
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,431
[Rosebud sighs]

36
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,578
OK, Budderball,
see you after school, big fella.

37
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,741
[groans]

38
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,911
Oh, sweet mama.

39
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:27,850
[barking]

40
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,258
[Buddha] Psst, Budderball.

41
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:33,928
We're on a journey
of ginormous proportions.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,764
I'm about to eat some
ginormous proportions myself.

43
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,133
I'll see you guys later.

44
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,729
Budderball, there's no time
for breakfast.

45
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,298
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day!

46
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,037
[Buddha] Come on!

47
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,305
Oh, bother.

48
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:49,242
[groans]

49
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:52,546
[hip-hop music plays]

50
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,314
[music scratches]

51
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,948
[barks]

52
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:59,286
[boy] A little moonwalk.

53
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,293
[barking]

54
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,328
[groans]

55
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,460
Hit it, B.

56
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,002
[groans]

57
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:15,641
See ya. I've gotta bounce.
I've got a field trip today.

58
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,969
[humming]

59
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,010
[music continues]

60
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,979
[grunting]

61
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,490
- B-Dawg!
- [gasps]

62
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:36,859
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

63
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,832
Pshaw. You didn't scare me.
I was just busting a new move.

64
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,368
What's the hip-hop happening,
home dogs?

65
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:46,837
We're not really sure, but
Buddha sure is excited about it.

66
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:49,932
All I can say is it's gonna be a blast.

67
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,645
Who put the Red Bull
in Buddha's doggy bowl?

68
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,277
Let's go!

69
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,560
[whimpers]

70
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,222
Not again!

71
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:15,756
You've gotta have a B-A-T-H
before Mum and Dad see you.

72
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,769
B-A-T-H... [gasps]

73
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,738
You just spelled the B word!

74
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,667
Mudbud, come back!

75
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:28,240
Dude, step away from the couch.

76
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,145
[whimpers]

77
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,150
[gasps]

78
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:34,049
[barks]

79
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,014
[both gasp]

80
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,751
- Oh!
- [gasps]

81
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,159
[whimpers]

82
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,492
[barks]

83
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:55,665
Looks like he got a time out.

84
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:58,472
When it rains Mudbud gets grounded.

85
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,102
He's a repeat offender.

86
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,739
Remember the time I sampled
the Thanksgiving turkey?

87
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,783
I got a serious time out for that too.

88
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,617
Sample schmample. You ate
the whole Butterball turkey, dawg.

89
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,452
Kind of embarrassing
to be named after a turkey.

90
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:13,856
Guys, what about Mudbud?

91
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,859
[groans]

92
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,394
Am I ever glad to see you dudes.

93
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:28,906
Shh. I've gotta jimmy the lock.

94
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:32,342
Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry.
We might miss it.

95
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:39,909
[all groan]

96
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:42,614
- Watch it, dude!
- Move over, guys!

97
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,787
Hurry! There's not a minute to spare!

98
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:48,821
Oh, yeah!

99
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,022
[Buddha] Come on,
Mudbud, we've gotta go!

100
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,460
[woman] Come along, people!

101
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:58,595
The launch won't wait on us
if we're tardy now, will it?

102
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,663
The window of opportunity
is upon us. Let's seize it.

103
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,742
[groans]

104
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,947
We are the one lucky Fernfield class

105
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,649
who is going to see a real, live

106
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:20,454
- spaceship launch.
- [all] Yeah!

107
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:22,426
So that's where
you're taking us, Buddha?

108
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,587
Surprise!

109
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,690
Vision Enterprises is going to make
space travel available to anyone.

110
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:31,635
I'm in bagged lunch heaven.
Oh, Mama!

111
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:33,194
Budderball, quiet!

112
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,571
- [zipper opening]
- [gobbling]

113
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,542
[continues gobbling]

114
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:45,912
[sneezes]

115
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,782
Oh, my goodness!

116
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:51,221
My allergy to dander
is really acting up. I...

117
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,418
[sneezes]

118
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:03,457
Come on.

119
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,562
[squeaks]

120
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:08,765
Ready, Gravity?

121
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,070
Let's go do this, old buddy.

122
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,478
[clicks teeth]

123
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:20,412
On behalf of everyone
at Vision Enterprises,

124
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:23,614
we would like to thank you
for your continued support

125
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,520
on the Vision One project.

126
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:29,493
And gentlemen, we give you
the Vision One spacecraft.

127
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,094
She's...
she's beautiful, isn't she?

128
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,656
[squeaks]

129
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,868
Uh... The... The Vision One

130
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:46,742
The... The design is an amalgamation
of an air travel vehicle

131
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,838
and space design rocket.

132
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:52,043
The vehicle will
comfortably carry two pilots

133
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:55,178
and four passengers into space.

134
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,746
The Vision One will land on the Moon,

135
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,556
permitting our customers the opportunity

136
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,119
to walk on the surface.

137
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,029
Hi, Finkel.

138
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,590
- Dr. Finkel, nice of you to join us.
- Of course.

139
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,432
Dr. Finkel. Dr. Finkel.

140
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:15,399
It is my pleasure, Mr. Wolfson,

141
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,308
until you fail and I take over,
of course.

142
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:19,639
[growls]

143
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,236
Gravity, behave.

144
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:22,406
[growls]

145
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,416
I don't know what's more unsettling,

146
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:27,920
that you accessorize
with that brainless rodent,

147
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,114
or that you converse with it too.

148
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,315
[man laughs]

149
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,982
I like ferrets.

150
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,789
I've never been terribly fond
of rats or weasels.

151
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,524
Nothing personal.

152
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:42,056
Well, out with the old,
in with the new, as they say.

153
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:46,036
Let's get on with it. Karl, why is
a cappuccino not touching my lips?

154
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,732
- Uh...
- Don't speak.

155
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:53,335
Uh, let me introduce you
to some members of our team.

156
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:55,346
<i>[woman's voice]</i>
<i>Fueling in progress.</i>

157
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:59,282
Uh, Slats Bentley
is our Flight Dynamics Officer.

158
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,650
He will give you some details
on today's mission.

159
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:04,349
<i>[voice]</i>
<i>Executing override sequence.</i>

160
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,983
...approximately four days
to get to the Moon and back.

161
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,460
Once we land on the surface
we'll stay for 30 minutes,

162
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,862
then re-launch back into space
and head back home.

163
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,490
Good. Uh, over here.

164
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,502
Uh, this is Astro Spaulding.

165
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,028
Uh, she is our pilot for the mission.

166
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:24,304
The pilot will be flying the spacecraft
using a vectra system,

167
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,868
vision-enabled control
technology response array.

168
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:31,781
Um, the, uh, systems will be
controlled with the blink of an eye,

169
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,843
It just scans your retina.
It's all hands-free.

170
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:38,288
I thought there were no life forms
on this mission, not even a pilot.

171
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:41,724
Astro will remotely pilot
Vision One from Mission Control.

172
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:46,231
Ultimately, when we begin
commercial travel, uh... uh...

173
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,426
...the remote system
will serve as a backup

174
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,698
in the event of a malfunction
or a pilot illness or...

175
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,433
Sir, there's been a break
in the weather.

176
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,873
Ah, well, excuse us, gentlemen.

177
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,411
Uh, this is our big moment.

178
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,577
Dr. Finkel, could you check and see
if the tour group has arrived,

179
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,881
and then greet them and help
the kids if they have any questions.

180
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,854
Certainly, Mr. Wolfson.

181
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,679
Sir!

182
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,055

00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,593

184
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:22,100
OK, people, off the bus.
Don't forget your lunch...

185
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:24,261
- [kids scream]

186
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,830
OK, stop right here, kids.

187
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:32,207
Welcome to Vision Enterprises.
Everyone in. Don't touch anything.

188
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:34,838
We don't want to miss
the launch. This way!

189
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:38,111
[woman screams]

190
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:41,582
My! Oh, dog germs!

191
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:48,319
Again, please refrain from touching
anything with your hands,

192
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,591
you slimy,
little germ-infested creatures.

193
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,791
OK.

194
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:56,733
Our goal here, at Vision
Enterprises, for some reason,

195
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:00,431
is to make space travel
accessible for everyone,

196
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,100
including the family pet.

197
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,234

Let's hide over there, dudes.

198
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,074

00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,013
This is awesome.

203
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:27,059
As you can see, we have some
specifically designed space suits.

204
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,362
...and then do whatever you'd like...

205
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,098
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

206
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:36,471
Please step away from the circle.

207
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,943
That device scans a life form
and determines the right size suit.

208
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:42,845
It is highly sophisticated.
So please step away.

209
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:45,748
Can I get a picture with the suit?

210
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,252
No, you cannot have a picture
with the suit.

211
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,151
Please, just take it off immediately.

212
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,890
Uh, all right, you know what?
It's fine, it's fine.

213
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,397
You can keep the suit on.
You probably already contaminated it.

214
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,399
- Just come back to the group.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,493
Children, this portion of the tour
is over. Please follow me.

216
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,437
Thank you.
Excuse me. Thank you.

217
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,536

00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:16,513

Whoa, dudes.

225
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:47,736
Will one of you boys zip me up?

00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:57,311

So, how do I look?

230
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,766
Uh, like our sister in a space suit.

231
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,495
I know I look tight.

[groans]

233
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:15,498
Mine's a little too tight.
Someone give me a paw.

234
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,800
Don't pull his paw!

235
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,643

239
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,927
Let's go see the spacecraft up close.

240
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,936
Golly gosh, maybe we could stop
at the lunch pad for a snack,

241
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,266
if it's on the way.

242
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,330
Budderball, that says "launch pad".

Oxidize and loading is complete.

244
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,509
And voila,

245
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,013
the spacecraft.

246
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,174
T-minus three minutes to launch.

247
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:37,412
Wow. I wish Buddha
was here to see this.

248
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,150
Let's just take a quick look inside,

249
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,253
then we'll come back
and watch the launch.

250
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,524
Uh...

251
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,259
Do you think it's safe?

252
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,302
You never know how deep
a puddle is until you jump in.

253

Huh?

254
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:55,598
Uh... I'll be right back.

have to do with the spaceship?

256
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,606
Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah!

257
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:03,978

260
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,729

a little more.

00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:36,904

OK, guys, we've seen
the ship. We better go.

Dude, you shouldn't
be touching those.

268
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:54,596
I could fly this thing, no problem.

269
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,328
Piece of cake.

270
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:57,426
Yeah, there's cake.

Ooh, donut!

But I think I'll start with
the chili cheese dog, then steak

273
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:04,071
and finish with a bean burrito.

274
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:05,303

353
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:51,819
Good. Stay on course. Um...

354
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:57,062
OK... We have some time to solve
this, people. I need solutions.

355
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:59,296
Buddha, I'm home.

356
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:06,043
- Buddha?
- Yo, B-Dawg.

357
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,841
I'm back in the crib.
Let's bust some moves.

358
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:13,377
Rosebud, come on,
let's go get a mani pedi

359
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,317
and a blow dry.

360
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:16,820
Rosebud?

361
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:19,652
Budderball, I have your favorite dinner.

362
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,249
Budderball?

363
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:29,930
I knew we shouldn't have
made him take a bath.

364
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:39,270
I think we're getting further
and further away from home.

365
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:42,108
And further and further
away from dinner.

366
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,171
I take full responsibility.

367
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:58,357
Sir, I think we may have finally
figured out a solution.

368
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,399
Great. I... I... knew you would.

369
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,127
Nice work. Let's hear it.

370
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:08,070
OK, we think that we can refuel at
the old Russian research space station.

371
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,937
But that space station disintegrated

372
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,408
into the Earth's atmosphere
like years ago.

373
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:15,776
Well, yeah, but you said to check
everything, so I checked everything,

374
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:19,305
including the conspiracy websites,
which said the station, still in space.

375
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:22,251
The reason that no one has been
able to find the space station

376
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,585
is because it's not
in it's original position.

377
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:27,625
Somehow, it has gotten out
of geostationary orbit.

378
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,957
And one of the Russian
cosmonauts, he survived,

379
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,588
and he's still living onboard, alone.

380

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,846

390
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:05,026
In exchange for the 3,000 pounds
of fuel, uh, I would like to offer...

<i>No, comrade, in return</i>

to have visitors. Good.

Oh, don't worry, old pal.

They promised not to tell
anyone about us.

400
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:35,823
So we are free to live
peacefully in space

401
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,055
forever and ever and ever!

Dudes, what is this place?

404
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,636
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.

405
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,110
I hope it's not an alien's house.

406
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,204
Not that I'd be scared,
or anything.

407
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,578
I hope it's a Denny's.

408
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:00,812
I could sure go for a Moons
Over My Hammy right about now.

409
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:05,585
OK, Yuri, are you ready
to receive the spacecraft. Over.

Oh, right, uh...

Let's switch from autopilot
to remote pilot.

Broaden our horizons?

00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:35,111
We're lost in space, dawg.

435
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,410

Though I suppose if I stay in space
any longer I may qualify.

00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:35,262
The name is Spudnick.

468
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,064
We're the Buddies. The pup
in the chicken suit is B-Dawg,

469
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:41,628
the dirty dude is Mudbud,
the Zen pup is Buddha

470
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,367

And I'm starving.

Nice to meet you.
I'm a Russian dogmonaut.

473
00:29:49,614 --> 00:29:51,878
We kind of got on the ship by accident.

474
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,976
And now, we have no idea where we are.

475
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:56,918
You're aboard the RRSS,

476
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:59,752
the old Russian Research Space Station.

477
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:01,382
You want me to show you around?

478
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,119
Follow me.

479
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,802
In this module, we have our garden,

480
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,169
where we grow all our food in space.

481
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,267
The added benefit is the plants
filter out CO2 gas and produce oxygen.

482
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,677
And we also use them
to create fuel for the station.

483
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:33,513
Now this joint is
off the chain insane, cuz.

484
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,252
Yes, we've been off the orbital grid

485
00:30:35,326 --> 00:30:37,294
for quite some time,
if that's what you mean.

486
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:40,695
Over here, we have our solar panels,
which produce all our energy.

487
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:45,862
So you can keep the stereo
pumpin' 24l7. That's wicked.

488
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:51,999
Right over here is the kitchen.

00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,454
Hmm. Where's the beef?

- Space juice.

00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:20,193
Pee-yoo! It stinks.
Who'd wanna drink that?

495
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:23,468
Well, Yuri seems to like it.
And we use it for fuel.

496
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,667
Who's Yuri?

497
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,711
He's the Russian cosmonaut
I live with up here.

498
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,803
How long have you been up here, dude?

499
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,747
Not really sure. It's all
one long night in space.

500
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:34,842
I was only supposed to be
on this station for a six month mission

501
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,080
but I'm sure it's been years and years.

502
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,281
Spudnick?

503
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:44,195
Spudnick? Where has
my little puppy puppy gone?

504
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:45,786
Spudnick...

505
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,268

Can you believe it, Spudnick?

509
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:02,476
Our American comrades
have given us a surprise gift!

510
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:07,280
Five fluffy puppies to keep us
company here in space.

511
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:09,877
[speaks Russian]
Thank you! Thank you!

512
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:11,888
He doesn't understand, Spudnick.

513
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:13,947
We're not staying long.

514
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,357
Where that spaceship goes, we go.

515
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:18,554
- All right, come on, Spudnick.
- [groans]

516
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,063
Good.

517
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:24,227
We will finish refueling
and then... we will celebrate.

518
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:26,270
Dude, you have to help us.

519
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:28,362

Puppy puppies!

522
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:38,581
Dudes, we've been hoodwinked.

523
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,586
You're telling me!
OK, this food is all vegetables.

524
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,121
Now what?

525
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:48,057
Uh, we'll be ready to leave

and then bid them farewell
for eternity.

772
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,477

we can't leave them there.

Um, hey, guys...

876
00:56:21,104 --> 00:56:24,198
I'm Slats.
I'm the flight dynamics officer.

877
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:26,242
That's, uh, FIDO for short.

878
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:28,004
Oh, and over there, that's Astro.

879
00:56:28,078 --> 00:56:32,674
She actually is the pilot of
the Vision One. How cool is that, huh?

880
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:35,377
I'm Sam.
My pup is Buddha.

881
00:56:35,452 --> 00:56:37,977
That's Pete.
His bro is Mudbud.

882
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:40,022
Bartelby's fella is Butterball.

883
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,490
Billy's homepup is B-Dawg

884
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,891
- and Alice's BFF is Rosebud.
- Mm-hmm.

885
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:48,590
Slats, why don't you get them up
to speed on the current plan.

886
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:52,931
Um, yeah. Oh, yeah, guys, come on
over here. Check this out. Very cool.

887
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:03,240
OK, well, all the vital stats
are on the big board as we call it.

888
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:07,511
The ETA is tomorrow morning
at 1100 hours.

Oh! I thought our course was set
to avoid the meteor shower.

908
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:10,573
I don't know, sir. Somehow
the telemetry has been modified.

909
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:14,674
Well, looks like we're going
to test our auto-avoidance system.

All our system tests confirm

935
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:45,067
that the data communication
antenna is damaged.

936
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,200
All we have left is
audio communication

937
00:59:47,277 --> 00:59:48,869
and that doesn't help us at all.

938
00:59:48,945 --> 00:59:50,276
And the only way to fix it,

939
00:59:50,346 --> 00:59:52,678
is for an astronaut to do it externally.

945
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:08,562
I should go. I've been in space
the longest and know this stuff well.

946
01:00:08,631 --> 01:00:11,794
Dude, if something happens
to you, we're all doomed.

947
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:15,736
I'll do it! The sooner we get home,
the sooner I'll get some food.

948
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,397
I was just gonna raise my paw.

949
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:19,942
But, you beat me to it, dawg.

950
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:22,569
As far as we can tell,
all the functions of the Vision One

951
01:00:22,645 --> 01:00:25,045
are normal and the hull is intact
but its telemetry

952
01:00:25,114 --> 01:00:27,844
has been diverted
and it's way off course

953
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,545
and our re-entry angle
is dangerously shallow.

954
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,918
The Vision One could skip off
into the atmosphere

955
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:34,388
and tumble out into space.

956
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:41,353

Well, for the sake

...we cannot give up.

959
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,971
We can't.

960
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:59,812
The puppies along
with their Russian comrade

961
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:01,908

Your left front paw, you go right.

973
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:40,984
Look, you'll be tethered to the ship

974
01:01:41,057 --> 01:01:43,719
so you don't float off
into outer space. Got it?

975
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:46,387
Uh, which one is my left paw again?

976
01:01:46,462 --> 01:01:47,622
We're doomed.

977
01:01:47,697 --> 01:01:50,097
What? It's not my fault I'm dyslexic!

978
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:53,795
Just remember, your right back leg,
you lift to take a wizzo.

979
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,566
Left back, you use
to scratch your tummy.

980
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,437
Left front paw,
you use to beg for food.

981
01:01:59,509 --> 01:02:02,307
And the right front paw,
is for snackin'.

982
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:05,245
OK, scratch, forward.
Wizzo equals backwards.

983
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:07,180
Begging, go right
and snacking go left.

984
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,808
See, I got it.

985
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:11,547
The target is a data
communications antenna.

986
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:13,179
Place it back into position

I'm a nervous eater.

990
01:02:21,764 --> 01:02:24,927

<i>[Spudnick]</i>
<i>OK, what does it look like?</i>

1046
01:05:28,017 --> 01:05:30,349
It kind of does a dog leg
to the wizzo side.

1047
01:05:30,419 --> 01:05:32,080
<i>He means it's crooked to the right.</i>

1048
01:05:32,155 --> 01:05:34,282
See if you can move it
back into position.

1049
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:35,824
Roger that.

Let's not, uh, celebrate too much here.

1060

We still have a ship
to get back on course. Slats?

1061
01:06:10,827 --> 01:06:13,557
Telemetry correction
uplink underway, sir.

1062
01:06:13,629 --> 01:06:18,532

correction to 152.2 over 5.

OK, Slats?

1065
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,303

gotten so off course.

- I don't know, sir.

1067

Doesn't make any sense.

1068
01:06:28,578 --> 01:06:31,445
We were on course to avoid
the meteor shower.

1069
01:06:31,514 --> 01:06:33,778
The last print-out showed us
right on track. Look!

1070

1071
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:39,312
Wait a minute.
The log shows an adjustment...

1072
01:06:39,388 --> 01:06:42,516
...made from the main terminal,

Main terminal?

1074

Please, you can't be serious.

1078

You don't think I would
ever do such a thing?

1079
01:07:01,444 --> 01:07:03,241
Are you sure, Sam?

1080
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:05,337
I saw him at the computer earlier.

1081
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:07,314
I knew he was up to something.

1082
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:09,010
Oh, is that right?

1083
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:12,885
[stammers] Pi, you can't
believe him over me.

1084
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:15,150
He's an ignorant child.

1085
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:20,054
OK, then what's this?

1086
01:07:21,464 --> 01:07:23,022
[stammers] Uh, I'm not...

1087
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:26,034
I don't know what is.
I've never seen that before.

1088
01:07:26,102 --> 01:07:29,162
- It's your USB key, sir.
- Please, Karl, don't speak.

1089
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:30,227
Sorry, sir.

1090
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:35,668
Ah! Hm. Security?

1091
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:40,148
Can you give me playback of yesterday
19:49 hours of the main terminal?

1092
01:07:40,216 --> 01:07:42,343
Put it up in the Mission Control
large screen.

1093
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:44,511
Oh, and security,
you might want to join us.

1094
01:07:44,587 --> 01:07:46,555
That won't be necessary.

1095

- Oh!
- [Wolfson] Security!

1103
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:12,205
Take Dr. Finkel away.

1104
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:14,875
Bye-bye, Dr. Stinkel.

1105
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:15,940
It's Finkel.

- Finkel!
- [door shuts]

Aw, dude, I can't believe
you ate the whole thing.

course with our spaceship.

- Take evasive action! Stat!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. OK.

1128

It's the Cosmopod, Yuri.

- Is that Yuri?

1132
01:10:00,122 --> 01:10:02,147
He must have had an escape pod.

1133

- Slats, any ideas.
- Negative, sir.

01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:08,058
The Russian pod is out of control.

change his trajectory.

- I'm taking over.
- Whoa, I've lost control.

1141
01:10:21,444 --> 01:10:25,005
I'm going to have to dodge
the Cosmopod to change it's course.

All right, we've made contact.

It's crucial you level off
the Cosmopod at 30 degrees.

Give me a countdown on re-entry.
I'll pull up at the last second.

furry friends had more to do

1214
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,655
with this mission's success
than we will ever know.

1215
01:14:38,734 --> 01:14:40,497
Come on, come on.

1216
01:14:40,569 --> 01:14:42,833
[squeaking]

1217
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:48,271
Come on, kids,
let's go greet the new heroes.

1218
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:49,333
- Let's go.
- Come on!

1219
01:14:49,411 --> 01:14:50,935
- Yeah!
- [laughing]

1220
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:54,742
[sirens blare]

1221
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,827
Here you go, Gravity,
greet your new friends.

1222
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:16,564
[squeaking]

1223
01:15:22,411 --> 01:15:25,312
Welcome home, Buddies.
Spudnick, that was some fancy

1224
01:15:25,381 --> 01:15:27,679
seat-of-the-pants aviation
you demonstrated.

1225
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,718
Whoa, you're a ferret?

1226
01:15:29,785 --> 01:15:31,776
Yo, dawg, you mean to tell me

1227
01:15:31,854 --> 01:15:34,687
we had a rodent
as our flight director?

1228
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:35,849
Hey, I'm not a rodent.

1229
01:15:35,924 --> 01:15:38,085
I'm related to the mustela
family of mammals,

1230
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,526
which includes minks and skunks.

1231
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:43,190
Hey, I'm told I'm related to skunks too.

1232
01:15:43,265 --> 01:15:45,995
We couldn't have made it home
without your help, Gravity.

1233
01:15:46,068 --> 01:15:47,126
Thank you, comrade.

1234
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:48,430
[squeaks]

1235
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:51,736
[whimpers]

1236
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:55,072
[cheering]

1237
01:15:55,144 --> 01:15:56,372
- [barking]
- Budderball.

1238
01:15:56,445 --> 01:15:58,003
Rosebud! Mudbud!

1239
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,413
- B-Dawg! B-Dawg!
- Namaste Buddha!

1240
01:16:01,483 --> 01:16:04,884
[laughs] Hey!
Oh, I'm so happy you're home.

1241
01:16:04,953 --> 01:16:07,683
- [laughing]
- [squeaks]

1242
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:12,193
- [laughing] Yeah.
- B-Dawg! B-Dawg!

1243
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:15,321
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1244
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:17,558
Oh, and one last thing...

1245
01:16:17,633 --> 01:16:21,262
It seems a boy named Sasha
is trying to contact you.

1246
01:16:21,336 --> 01:16:22,428
Really?

1247
01:16:22,504 --> 01:16:23,937
He's been waiting for you.

1248
01:16:25,641 --> 01:16:29,202
Oh, hey, hey. Oh.

1249
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:31,769
Where am I? What?

1250
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,679
Mother Russia.

1251
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:39,243
[laughing]

1252
01:16:41,457 --> 01:16:46,019
How are you? Nice to see you.
I come from space.

1253
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:48,085
How are you?

1254
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:53,390
[cheering]

1255
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:17,220
This is more like it.
I feel much prettier in pink.

1256
01:17:19,194 --> 01:17:21,253
Aw!

1257
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:35,577
[harmonica sounding]

1258
01:17:40,249 --> 01:17:41,876
[music stops]

1259
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:47,244
Uh, thank you.
Thank you for being here.

1260
01:17:47,322 --> 01:17:50,587
I would like to present wings,

1261
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:55,096
the symbol of true heroism in space...

1262
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:56,687
...to our dogmonauts.

1263
01:17:56,765 --> 01:17:59,165
[cheering]

1264
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:01,361
Here they are. The Space Buddies.

1265
01:18:01,436 --> 01:18:04,564
[cheering]

1266
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:09,336
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1267
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:11,845
- [laughing]
- Yeah!

1268
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:14,178
Ah! Rosebud.

1269
01:18:14,249 --> 01:18:16,376
Congratulations.

1270
01:18:16,451 --> 01:18:17,679
And B-Dawg.

1271
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:21,555
Budderball.

1272
01:18:21,623 --> 01:18:23,853
[laughing]

1273
01:18:23,926 --> 01:18:26,360
Ah, Mudbud. [chuckles]

1274
01:18:26,428 --> 01:18:28,020
I'm gonna miss Spudnick.

1275
01:18:28,096 --> 01:18:31,554
Spudnick is now officially
part of my entourage.

1276
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:34,727
I'll never forget he taught me
to eat my vegetables.

1277
01:18:34,803 --> 01:18:36,896
He was a rad comrade.

1278
01:18:36,972 --> 01:18:39,634
He'll have a space
in our hearts forever.

1279
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,007
[cheering]

1280
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:51,650
[gasps]

1281
01:18:54,122 --> 01:18:55,714
[gasps]

1282
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,691
[Sasha laughs]

1283
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,328
Spudnick!

1284
01:19:11,273 --> 01:19:14,242
[clapping]

1285
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:15,708
[whimpers]

1286
01:19:15,777 --> 01:19:18,837
I always dreamt I'd hold you
in my arms again.

1287
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:20,472
Aw.

1288
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:35,186
[crickets chirping]

1289
01:19:47,943 --> 01:19:49,672
Whoa.

1290
01:19:52,848 --> 01:19:54,611
This rock.

1291
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:57,948
Is from the Moon?

1292
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,612
[barks]

1293
01:20:02,624 --> 01:20:05,092
I got to touch the Moon too.

1294
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,960
I guess dreams really do come true.

1295
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:29,413
I fulfilled my dream of being the first
dogmonaut to walk on the Moon.

1296
01:20:29,484 --> 01:20:33,386
But in returning home,
I realized it is the journey

1297
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,913
and the new friendships
I made that matter the most.
