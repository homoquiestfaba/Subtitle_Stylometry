1
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,879
Head cocked to the left.

2
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,389
Partial deafness in ear.

3
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:42,325
First point of attack.

4
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,142
Two. Throat, to paralyze vocal cords,
to stop screaming.

5
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,732
Three. Could be a heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:55,701
Four. Finally, drag the
left leg. Fist to patella.

7
00:02:56,554 --> 00:03:00,480
Summary/prognosis... conscious in 90 seconds.
Martial efficacy. Quarter of an hour at best.

8
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,756
full faculty recovery...
Unlikely!

9
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,735
- I liked the hat.
- Oh, I just picked it up.

10
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,007
You remember your revolver?

11
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,601
Oh, I knew I had forgotten something.

12
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,535
- I thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

13
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,581
I think that's quiet enough.

14
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,113
You're a doctor, after all.

15
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:39,209
Always nice to see you,
Watson.

16
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,865
Where's the inspector?

17
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,011
He's getting his troops lined up.

18
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,147
That could be all day.

19
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:48,557
Sherlock Holmes.

20
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,339
And his loyal dog.

21
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,652
Tell me, doctor

22
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,685
As a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

23
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,132
Let me show how much
I've enjoyed it.

24
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,778
Watson! Don't!

25
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,529
Observe.

26
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:11,947
How did you see that?

27
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:14,446
Because I was looking for it.

28
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,407
Lord Blackwood!

29
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,469
You seem surprised.

30
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,484
I say the girl deserves
your attention more than he.

31
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,261
Indeed.

32
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,603
Oh, I'd leave that alone if
if I were you, boy.

33
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,760
Good lad.

34
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,261
Impeccable timing,
Lestrade.

35
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:46,762
We've one for the doctor,
and one for the rope.

36
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,105
- Clarky?
- Sir?.

37
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,128
This woman needs
a hospital immediately.

38
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,985
- Put it in the back of the mariah.
- c'mon lads.

39
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:58,872
Careful! Pick it up lads.

40
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,923
If you don't mind.

41
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:05,326
Get him out of my sight.

42
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,140
Then you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

43
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,454
If I had,
you would be clearing up the corpse!

44
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,141
chasing a ruler.

45
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:21,501
Besides, the girl's parents
hired me, not The Yard.

46
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,452
Why they thought you'd require any
assistance is beyond me?!

47
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:28,391
Well... London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed.

48
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,006
- Congratulations, Lestrade.
- Bravo, Inspector.

49
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,448
Have a cigar.

50
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:33,949
Gentlemen...

51
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,553
Cheeze!

52
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,605
156 over 80.

53
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,791
Very good.

54
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,877
My valves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

55
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,325
Oh, Tell me something..

56
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,876
Your new premises...
when are you moving in?

57
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,618
I shall be
within a week.

58
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:27,594
Cavendish Place.

59
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:29,732
And there will be a woman's touch,
too.

60
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:31,574
Oh, that's marvelous indeed.

61
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,468
Good... God!

62
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:38,471
- That was gunfire!
- No... no,no.

63
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,858
Hammer on nail,
wasn't?

64
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:43,981
My colleague's, probably just...
pre-op painting.

65
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,047
I'll go check.

66
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,485
- Your colleague?
- Yes

67
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:50,707
Won't be moving with you,will he?

68
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,132
No, he won't.

69
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,845
Mrs. Hudson...

70
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,942
I won't go in there by myself.
No one has got a gun in this house.

71
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,532
You won't have to in there at all,
Give me the paper.

72
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,067
What will I do when
you leave, Doctor?

73
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,378
He'll have the whole house down.

74
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,859
He just needs another case
that's all.

75
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:09,674
Oh, couldn't you have a longer engagement?

76
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,101
I smell gunpowder. It's not right you know!
Not in a domestic environment.

77
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,299
Thank you, Captain Phillip.

78
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,284
Perhaps a nice
cup of tea...

79
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,978
Same time next week.

80
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,249
Come on, Captain.
It's quieter downstairs.

81
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,046
Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.

82
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,803
Permission to enter
the armory.

83
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,656
Granted.

84
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:46,093
Watson, I'm in the process of inventing
a device

85
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,205
that supresses the sound of a gunshot.

86
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:52,928
It's not working.

87
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,493
Oh, can I see that?

88
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:07,098
You know it's been three months
since your last case?

89
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,678
Gently. Gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me.

90
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,195
Taking it's time
you found another one.

91
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,383
I can't but agree.

92
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,161
My mind rebels this technician,
give me problems,give me work.

93
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,569
The sooner the better.

94
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,257
- Paper.
- Thank you.

95
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,964
Let's see then.
There's a letter here...

96
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,879
from.. Mrs. Ramsey... of... Queenspark.

97
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,473
Her husband's dissapeared.

98
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,249
He's in Belgium, with the scurry maid.

99
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,228
Is it November?

100
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,133
Yes, Holmes.
What?

101
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,632
Lady Rathford reports...

102
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,892
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

103
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,380
Insurance swindle...

104
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,540
Lord Rathford likes fast women
and slow ponies.

105
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,777
Oh, I see you're the attending physician at
Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,089
Yes

107
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,594
It was our last case together

108
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,055
and I wanted to see it through the end.

109
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,130
A Mr. Louis...

110
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:15,421
.. is seeking... There's one case
that intrigues me at present

111
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,353
The Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson...

112
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:19,418
The absentee landlady...

113
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,476
I've been studying her
comings and goings.

114
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:25,711
They appear most.. sinister.
- Tea, Mr. Holmes?

115
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,479
Is it poisoned, "nanny"?

116
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,541
There's enough of that in you,already.

117
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,117
Don't touch.
Everything is in it's proper place.

118
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,977
As per usual, "nanny".

119
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,243
Oh,he's killed the dog...
again.

120
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,759
What have you done to Gladston,
now?

121
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:43,469
I was simply testing the
new anaesthetic.

122
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:45,572
He doesn't mind.

123
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,032
Holmes...

124
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,538
as your doctor...

125
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,071
You be rightous to tribute at no time.

126
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,448
As your friend...

127
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,485
You've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

128
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:02,220
There's nothing of interest,
for me, out there on Earth,at all.

129
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:06,671
- So, you're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

130
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,101
- Dinner?
- Wonderful.

131
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,543
- The Royale?
- My favorite.

132
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,949
Mary's coming.

133
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,407
- It's not fair.
- You're meeting her, Holmes!

134
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,357
Have you proposed yet?

135
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,577
No, I haven't found the right ring.

136
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:21,857
Oh,then it's not official.

137
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,658
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

138
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,074
8:30 the Royale.

139
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:27,801
- Wear a jacket.
- You wear a jacket.

140
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:05,175
Holmes!

141
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,293
You're early.

142
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:10,737
Fashionably!

143
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,476
Miss Mary Morstan.

144
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,203
Ah, my goodness. What a pleasure.

145
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:19,763
For the life of me, I don't know why it's
taken him so long to introduce us properly.

146
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,201
Pleasure is mine.

147
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:28,873
It really is quite a thrill to
meet you, Mr. Holmes.

148
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,169
I've heard so much about you.

149
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:35,223
I have a pile of detective novels
at home... Wilkie Collins, Poe...

150
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,485
It's true.

151
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,645
It can seem a little far-fetched though,
sometimes...

152
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,251
making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details.

153
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,831
That's not quite right,
isn't it?

154
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:47,195
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

155
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,291
- Take Watson...
- I intend to.

156
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:58,382
You see this walking-stick, a
rare African snakewood.

157
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,208
hiding a blade.. five tenths of steel..

158
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,975
A few were rewarded to veterans
of the Afghan war,

159
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,455
so I can assure you he's
a decorated soldier.

160
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,757
Strong, brave,
born to be an adventurer.

161
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,801
and neat,
like all military men.

162
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,303
Now, I check his pockets.

163
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,397
A stub from a boxing match.

164
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:21,895
Now, I can infer he's a bit of a gambler.

165
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:24,125
I'd keep an eye on the dowry
if I were you.

166
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,053
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

167
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,292
It's cost us the rent,
more than once.

168
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,995
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
You know John very well.

169
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,270
What about a complete stranger?

170
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:36,958
What can you tell about me?

171
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,487
- You?
- I don't think that's...

172
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,007
- I don't know if that's...
- Not at dinner.

173
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,337
- Perhaps some other time.
- I insist.

174
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,022
- You insist?
- You remember when you first...

175
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:44,478
The lady insists

176
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,648
- You are a governess.
- Well done.

177
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,041
Yes, well done.
Shall we... Waiter!

178
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,400
Your student...
It's a boy of eight.

179
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,648
Charlie is seven, actually.

180
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,043
And he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

181
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:08,765
- Oh, Is there ink on my face?
- There's nothing wrong with your face.

182
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,768
There're two drops on you ear, in fact.

183
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,009
India Blue is nearly
impossible to wash off..

184
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,759
Anyway, a very impetuous
act by the boy

185
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,896
but you're too experienced
to react rashly

186
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,424
which is why the lady for whom you work,
lent you that necklace.

187
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,295
Oriental pearls, diamonds,
flawless ruby, hardly...

188
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,583
.. the gems of a governess.

189
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,027
However, the jewels are not why it tells us more..

190
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,512
- Holmes!
- You were engaged.

191
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:36,889
The ring is gone, but the lighter skin
which upon it sats, suggests

192
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,045
you spent some time abroad
while you proudly

193
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:41,900
that is until you were informed of
it's true net and what it's worth

194
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:44,447
at which point you broke of the engagement
and you returned England

195
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,685
for better prospects.

196
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:48,952
A doctor, perhaps?

197
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:57,859
You're right on all counts
Mr. Holmes, but for one.

198
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,195
I didn't leave him.

199
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,261
He died.

200
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,095
Well done, old boy.

201
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:44,947
Stand up and fight!

202
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:46,241
Come on!

203
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,112
Come on, you...

204
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:50,113
Get up..

205
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,269
That's your dream man, I'm done.

206
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:05,493
You won. Congratulations.

207
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,098
Oye, we ain't done yet.

208
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,159
This mustn't register on
an emotional level.

209
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,997
First, distract target.

210
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,037
Then block his blind jab.

211
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:24,498
Counter with cross to left cheek.

212
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,639
Discombobulate.

213
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:31,619
Dazed, will attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block.

214
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:33,805
And body shot.

215
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,102
block farrow left.

216
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,586
Weaken right jaw.

217
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:40,679
Now fracture.

218
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,132
Break cracked ribs.

219
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:45,979
Traumatize solar plexus.

220
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,810
Dislocate jaw entirely.

221
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,198
Heel kick to diaphragm.

222
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,967
In summary: ears ringing,

223
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:59,929
jaw fractured, 3 ribs cracked, 4 broken,

224
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:01,548
diaphragm hemorrhaging.

225
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,133
Physical recovery -6 weeks.

226
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,416
Full Psychological recovery -6 months.

227
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:07,374
Capacity to spit at back of head...

228
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:09,205
Neutralized.

229
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,229
Where did that come from?

230
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,792
What the hell's going on here, Charley?

231
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,629
Lord Blackwood put him under some
kind of spell, sir.

232
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,655
Like he's burning
from the inside out!

233
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:31,607
Shut up!

234
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:33,921
Charley. Charley!

235
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,499
Take this man to the infirmary!
Now!

236
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,905
What's this all about then, Blackwood?

237
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,165
There's someone I want to see.

238
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,204
- Watson?
- Right.

239
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:21,934
Let's go.

240
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,684
What started really as an
experiment

241
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,247
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

242
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,908
Now, If I play a chromatic scale.

243
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,206
there's no measurable response.

244
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,219
You do know what you're drinking is
meant for eye surgery.

245
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:37,861
But... now,

246
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:39,486
and this is remarkable...

247
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:42,468
if I change to a Tone Cluster

248
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,373
Voila!

249
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,373
They fly in counter-clockwise,

250
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,259
synchronized concentric circles,

251
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:50,758
as though a regimented flock.

252
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,187
Watson,this is exemplary.

253
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:56,125
I, using music theory,
have created order, out of chaos.

254
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:00,101
How do you lure them in?

255
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:01,560
Excellent question.

256
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,725
Individually
I've been at it for six hours.

257
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,122
And what happens if I do this?

258
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:12,695
Clean youself up.

259
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:14,788
You are Blackwood's last request.

260
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,165
Look at those towering structures.

261
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:33,534
It's the first combination of Berceuse
suspension bridge ever attempted.

262
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,354
Most innovative.

263
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:40,480
What an industrious empire!

264
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,387
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

265
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,751
You weren't there, so I made you
a customary bet.

266
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,248
You're right.
I'll keep it with your checkbook,

267
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,794
locked in the safe in my drawer.

268
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,638
Did you know the opera house
is featuring "Don Giovanni"?

269
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:02,197
I could easily procure a couple of tickets

270
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:04,815
If you had any
cultural inclinations this evening.

271
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:10,126
You have a grand gift of silence,

272
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,513
Watson, that makes you quite
invaluable as a companion.

273
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,391
I knew she'd been engaged.

274
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,642
She'd told me.

275
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,219
So, that's 'No' to the opera, then.

276
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:28,997
That was my waistcoat.

277
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,816
I thought we agreed
it's too small for you.

278
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,601
- I'd like it back.
- I thought we agreed.

279
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,079
I want it back.

280
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:08,461
This way, Mr. Holmes.

281
00:24:10,522 --> 00:24:14,240
Blackwood certaintly seems to have got the
crowd in something of a fear frenzy.

282
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:16,898
I'm sure they'll dispersed once
the feet have stopped twitching.

283
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,239
Care to come along?

284
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:21,080
No, you are on your own, old cock.

285
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,887
I have no business with him
whilst he's alive.

286
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,415
Suit yourself, 'mother hen'.

287
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:40,304
It seems you have a lot of rooms in there.

288
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,229
We had to move the prisoners, sir.

289
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:44,617
Otherwise we're going to
have a riot in our hands.

290
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:48,618
It has a... peculiar effect on the inmates.

291
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:52,918
As though... he can get inside their heads.

292
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:59,153
I'm sure I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

293
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,310
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you, sir.

294
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:10,164
And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea,

295
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,934
having seven heads and ten horns,
and upon his horns ten crowns,

296
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,592
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

297
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,955
And they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast:

298
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,156
and they worshipped the beast, saying,

299
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:19,560
Who is like unto the beast?

300
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:21,264
And the beast which I saw was
like unto a leopard,

301
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,127
and his feet were as the feet of a bear,
and his mouth as the mouth of a lion:

302
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,894
and the dragon gave him his power,
and his seat, and great authority.

303
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,987
I love what you've done with the place.

304
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:34,081
So glad you can accept my invitation.

305
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,722
I just have a small point ofconcern.

306
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:39,531
How can I help?

307
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,314
I rarely follow the motives,
with some interest in..

308
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:43,912
one my heart and primarily,
to the families of the victims

309
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:45,849
I couldn't quite notice
your criminal mastery.

310
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,692
in a stroke of a brush.

311
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:49,843
You're too kind.

312
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,911
However, by comparison,
your work in the crypt

313
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:54,710
was more I can do with finger painting.

314
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:00,850
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot?

315
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:02,755
Either that or...

316
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,570
Shortly, my friend will pronounce
you dead

317
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,101
not while I'm to keep him company.

318
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:10,692
Your mistake is to imagine...

319
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:12,567
that anything earthly has led
to this moment.

320
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:15,640
Your error of judgement is to assume
that I'm holding the brush, at all!

321
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,106
I'm merely the channel.

322
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,852
My only wish is that if I could
have caught you sooner.

323
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,842
You see? Five lives
might have been spared.

324
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,093
Those lives were a necessity.

325
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:28,970
Sacrifice.

326
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:32,794
Five otherwise meaningless creatures,
called to serve a greater purpose.

327
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:35,511
I wonder if they'll let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

328
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,291
After you're hanged, of course.

329
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:43,012
I wager that some deformity that will
be scientifically significant.

330
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,468
Then you too, could serve
a greater purpose.

331
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,949
Holmes, you must widen your gaze,

332
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:54,610
I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity
of coming events.

333
00:26:56,201 --> 00:27:00,295
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

334
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:04,753
But beneath your mask of logic I
sense a fragility...

335
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,577
that worries me.

336
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,670
Steel your mind, Holmes.

337
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:13,603
I need you.

338
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:16,391
I say, you've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

339
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,861
Then, I will rise again.
"Bon voyage".

340
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,172
Pay attention!

341
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:22,225
Three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them.

342
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:25,036
You must accept that this
is beyond your control.

343
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,723
By the time you realize you made
all of this possible

344
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,015
it will be the last sane thought
in your head.

345
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,190
What did he want?

346
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:43,802
I'm not sure.

347
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,665
But I don't think you'll need it, Father.
Not for this one.

348
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:52,769
Lord Henry Blackwood,
you are sentenced to death...

349
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:55,459
for the practice of black magic,

350
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,319
the unholy murder of five
innocent young woman,

351
00:27:58,354 --> 00:28:01,880
and the attempted murder of a sixth.

352
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,448
Do you have any final words?

353
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:09,615
Death... is only the beginning.

354
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:47,400
That is the end of
Lord Blackwood.

355
00:29:09,737 --> 00:29:11,623
London's so bleak this time of the year.

356
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,403
Not that I'm pining for
New Jersey,

357
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:18,282
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

358
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:24,249
Here, I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.

359
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:27,718
I found these exquisite dates from Jordan.

360
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:29,189
and your favorite...

361
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,897
Olives from the Cyclades.

362
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,327
I thought we might have a little tea party.

363
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,595
and while I was setting the table,
I found this.

364
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,334
A file with my name on it.

365
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,831
Theft of Velasquez portrait
from King of Spain...

366
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,585
a missing navel documents led to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister,

367
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,238
scandalous affair ends engagement of...

368
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,108
Sorry.

369
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,731
perhaps a prince to
Romanov Princess.

370
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,471
Or simply studying your methods.

371
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,848
Should the authorities ask
me to hunt you down.

372
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:10,130
But I don't see my name in any
these articles.

373
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:11,913
But you signature was clear.

374
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:15,551
Is this the maharajah's missing diamond?

375
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,945
Or just another souvenir?

376
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,272
Let's not dwell on the past.

377
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,059
Shall we?

378
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,335
Now, by the looks of things,
I would say that you are between jobs.

379
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,685
And you between husbands.

380
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,413
How much did you get for the ring?

381
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,322
Oh, he was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

382
00:30:36,716 --> 00:30:40,977
I'm Irene Adler, again.

383
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:49,886
Thank you.

384
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,966
I need your help.

385
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,439
I need you to find someone.

386
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:04,693
Why are you always so suspicious.

387
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,439
Should I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

388
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:10,542
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

389
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,824
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

390
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:19,980
Who are you working for?

391
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:23,890
So, I'll have to find out the hard way.

392
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,046
Keep your money,
I didn't say I'll take the case.

393
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:29,264
Well, consider it a wager that
you will.

394
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,955
You remember the Grand?

395
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,769
They gave me our old room.

396
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,533
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.

397
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:16,290
Calm!

398
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,365
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

399
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,261
That's precisely why
I hired you.

400
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,786
I wager he'll have our man within
the next 24 hours.

401
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:31,512
He'd better.

402
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,285
Reordan is the key to what
Blackwood was doing.

403
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:36,966
He's essential to my plan.

404
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,365
What are you doing?
Can you not see where you're going?

405
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,388
Get off front of me!

406
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:50,432
A little rifle raid should go a long way,sir.
Rather than kellish's all fish German.

407
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,889
God save the queen!

408
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:56,433
God save the queen, sir.

409
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,679
Get off front of me.

410
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,801
Look at you?

411
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,830
Why is it the only woman
you ever cared about

412
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:06,103
a world class criminal?

413
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,285
Are you a masochist?

414
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,433
Allow me to explain...

415
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:09,608
Allow me!

416
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:12,674
She's the only adversary, to
have ever outsmarted you. Twice.

417
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,156
Made a proper idiot out of you.

418
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:16,589
Right, you've had your fun.

419
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,781
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.

420
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:20,521
What could she possibly need?

421
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:22,347
Doesn't matter.

422
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:25,159
You know why? A beard...
a human canoe.

423
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:28,003
She can sit on your back and
paddle you up.. The Thames.

424
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:31,424
That's of no consequence to you,
please, dear Watson

425
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,752
We've done our last case together...

426
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,970
I've already read it.

427
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:36,626
Missing Person.

428
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,316
Luke Reordan.

429
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:41,317
Four foot ten, red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.

430
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,442
You obviously not had time.

431
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,193
She likes ginger dwarfs.

432
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:46,438
Midgets...

433
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:47,881
- So, you agree.
- No, I don't agree.

434
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:50,539
It's more than technicality, you see.

435
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:53,903
You're misrepresenting the dimensions of
foreshorten peoples.

436
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,440
I said too much.
I can tell I've upset you.

437
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:58,194
No, I'm simply stating that one has to...

438
00:33:58,229 --> 00:33:59,846
What were you doing?

439
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:02,248
- Won't you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

440
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:28,253
- Holmes? What are you doing?
- Nothing.

441
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,622
- Are you wearing a...
false nose? No.

442
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:33,922
Tell me, that that wasn't...

443
00:34:34,346 --> 00:34:37,513
Holmes! Where you going?

444
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,265
Watson?

445
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:46,375
Help! Watson!

446
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,894
I got some flowers for you, sweetheart.

447
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:10,146
Cut you a deal,
because you're so pretty.

448
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:13,291
Oh, my lucky day!

449
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,812
And I goosed you're going
to say that for me.

450
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:22,709
Don't move!

451
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:27,952
Now,what have we got here?

452
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:34,836
Thank you.

453
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:37,649
That's the Irene I knew.

454
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,538
This man intrigues me, Watson,
he's got her on edge.

455
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,204
And she's no mean feat.

456
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,380
She's until did it,
She's scared of him.

457
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,100
if you work for him.

458
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:40,617
Right.

459
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:44,678
It's nothing to do with me but I advise you...
Leave the case alone.

460
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,183
But I may not have a choice..

461
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:50,136
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon. Thanks to you.

462
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,115
Get that out of my face.

463
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,572
It's not in your face, it's in my hand.

464
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,355
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

465
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,184
- Mr. Holmes!
- Clarky!

466
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,602
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade says
you should come with me at once.

467
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:01,729
What's he do now?
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?

468
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:04,653
Watson grab a compass.
He means us.

469
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:06,420
No, you means you.

470
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,187
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He a...

471
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:13,191
Well... it appears he's come
back from the grave,sir.

472
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,394
Most engaging.
Very clever.

473
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:26,750
I pronounced the man dead myself.

474
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,220
What are the facts?

475
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:33,360
Groundskeeper claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard, just this morning, sir.

476
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,034
I leave this in your capable hands.

477
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,784
I've an appointment with Mary.

478
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:40,955
It's not my reputation is at stake here.

479
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,098
Don't try that.

480
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:45,048
Have the newspapers covered it yet?

481
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,643
No, that's what we are trying to avoid, sir.

482
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:47,906
Certainly.

483
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:52,413
- What's the major concern?
- Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

484
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,710
Indeed.

485
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:55,553
You're not taking this seriously,
are you, Holmes?

486
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:57,679
Yes, as you should.

487
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,992
It's a matter of professional integrity.

488
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:02,918
No girl, wants to marry a doctor..

489
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:05,047
who can't tell if a man is dead or not.

490
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:23,757
Who do you think won the match,
Clarky?

491
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,798
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

492
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,511
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

493
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:33,248
Yes, but at least they never
missed an opportunity...

494
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:34,999
doing is an opportunity..

495
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:40,000
You took the time, Holmes.

496
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:42,049
And on the third day...

497
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:47,270
These slabs of sandstone are half a tonne
each were each if they are pound...

498
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:49,769
and these were smashed
open from the inside.

499
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,094
Lestrade. What of the coffin?

500
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,000
We are in the process of
bringing it up now.

501
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:55,820
Listen...

502
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,473
Heed.

503
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,342
Right.

504
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:01,533
But at what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

505
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,587
And how is our witness?

506
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,223
He's over there.

507
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:11,349
And apparently he's cata...

508
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:12,412
Catatonic, sir.

509
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:14,879
He's not feeling very well.
- Yes

510
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,588
Until you don't stop behaving like a bunch of
quivering milkmaids,you're on double time.

511
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:24,727
Now, you get down there and bring
that coffin up. Now.

512
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:25,628
Sorry, sir!

513
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,629
Good day, sir.

514
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,948
Look.

515
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,736
It's alright..

516
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:34,996
I'm a doctor.

517
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,909
The man's in shock.

518
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,415
He may need a few moments.

519
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,142
The witness stated that he saw Lord
Blackwood rise from the grave.

520
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:54,889
Well?
Well?

521
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,739
You pronounced him dead.

522
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:59,576
He had no pulse.

523
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,439
Good lord!

524
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,552
That's not Blackwood.

525
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:30,580
Well, now we have a firm
grasp of the obvious.

526
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:36,896
Time of death?

527
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:41,131
Maggots here is...

528
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:45,957
approximately...
two thirds of an inch...

529
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:49,210
which would put the time of death
at between ten and twelve hours ago.

530
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:52,117
May I borrow your pen?

531
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,855
That guys a dwarf.
Midget.

532
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:11,093
I know what I saw!

533
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:13,877
It was Blackwood.

534
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:16,922
As clear as I see you.

535
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:21,344
And when the dead walk...

536
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:25,235
the living will fill these coffins!

537
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:29,299
Well...

538
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,240
Right. Put the lid on and clean this up?

539
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:38,648
Do you really believe he was resurrected?

540
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,468
The question is not 'if' but 'how'.

541
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:41,469
The game's afoot:

542
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:44,314
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge

543
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,696
Cry 'God for Harry, England,
and St. George. '

544
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,008
There you are.

545
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,085
Why that certain fish and chips stall,
I don't understand.

546
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:58,926
No, there's a particular beer they use
in their batter... a northern stout

547
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:00,649
You know, Holmes

548
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,230
I see things in war
I don't understand.

549
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:05,761
In India, I once met a man
who predicted his own death

550
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:09,433
right down to the number and the
placement of the bullet that killed him.

551
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,120
You have to admit, Holmes

552
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:17,453
that a supernatural explanation
to this case, it is theoretically possible.

553
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:19,383
- No.
- Agreed.

554
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:23,097
But it is a huge mistake to
theorize before one has data.

555
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:26,300
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts
to shoot theories...

556
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,872
Instead of theories
to shoot facts.

557
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:31,155
That said, I believe
Adler's mission is the key to this.

558
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,707
Right. Scratches near the keyhole
where the watch is wound.

559
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:37,996
What does that tell you?

560
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:39,808
The man was most likely
a drunk.

561
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:42,781
Every time he wound the watch his hand
would slip and scratches appeared

562
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:44,435
- Yes
- Very good, Watson.

563
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,629
You have developed considerably
deductive powers of your own.

564
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:51,407
Let's see now. There are several
sets of initials scores...

565
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,784
Pawn broker's marks.
- Excellent.

566
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:56,643
Most recent which are
M.H. M.H. M.H. is for...

567
00:42:57,004 --> 00:42:58,912
Maddison and Haig.

568
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,201
I should be able to get us an address.

569
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:11,411
What a coincidence.

570
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:15,483
One thing you failed to deduce
from the watch, Holmes.

571
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:16,738
I think not.

572
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:18,128
The time.

573
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:19,601
I have to get back, Holmes.

574
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,415
Taking tea with the in-laws.

575
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,768
Beckon your future, sir?
Absolutely not.

576
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:25,950
No, thank you, ma'am.

577
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,404
You need to hear what I
have to tell you.

578
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,134
We have no need of your
lucky heather, gypsy woman.

579
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,823
Even if it has to do with Mary.

580
00:43:37,976 --> 00:43:40,189
Oh, I see two men.

581
00:43:41,147 --> 00:43:44,210
Brothers. Not in blood, but in bond.

582
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,364
What of Mary?

583
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:53,586
And for Mary, from marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

584
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:55,108
Go on.

585
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:58,957
Oh, I see patterned table cloths and

586
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,110
oh, china figurines and

587
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,559
oh, lace doilies

588
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:05,474
doilies?

589
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,221
Lace doilies, Holmes.

590
00:44:09,735 --> 00:44:13,184
Does your depravity know no bounds?
No.

591
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:16,340
Oh, she turns too fat and
oh, she has a beard..

592
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:17,372
What of the warts?

593
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,219
Oh, she's covered with warts.
Enough.

594
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:22,112
Are they extensive?
Please, enough!

595
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:27,940
It's the most apt prediction
before us made Indians.

596
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:30,521
And precisely, the reason you
can't find a suitable ring.

597
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,283
Do you have my money?

598
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:34,711
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre..

599
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:35,831
Do you have my...

600
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:37,495
Admit it, admit it!
Give me, my money!

601
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,922
Holmes.

602
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:42,273
"Large Selection of Engagement
Rings for Every Wallet"

603
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:43,491
I see.

604
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,286
Thank you.

605
00:44:52,696 --> 00:44:56,455
Well, You've got your ring and I've got
my address for the ginger midget.

606
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,429
Should be just there.

607
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,215
I think she'll really like this.

608
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:03,452
And I have some change in my pocket.

609
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,737
- Should I look after it for you?
- No, no.

610
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:13,308
- Don't give it away, here.
No.

611
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:15,329
I have to go see Mary.

612
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:17,282
Give her my best.

613
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,987
And the family as well.

614
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:03,378
It does make a considerable difference
to me having someone with me..

615
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:05,683
on whom I could thoroughly rely on.

616
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,163
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly ten minutes.

617
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:13,590
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

618
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:15,392
Something did.

619
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:18,339
Irene Adler was here,

620
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:22,094
Either that or the ginger midget wore
the same Parisian perfume.

621
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,355
Aah... Putrifaction.

622
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:36,186
Ammonium sulphate,
among other aromas.

623
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:41,890
Phosphorus.

624
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:44,897
Formaldehyde.

625
00:46:56,983 --> 00:47:01,649
It looks like he was attempting
to combine

626
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,542
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

627
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,382
More importantly...

628
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:17,979
mess here he was trying to dispose of.

629
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,229
Potassium and magnesium.

630
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:22,582
Sulfuric acid.

631
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:25,783
It certainly ironed right out the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

632
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:42,934
Peculiar.

633
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:47,004
Hydrated rododendron.

634
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:16,020
Holmes.
Look at the crest.

635
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:19,422
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

636
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:20,752
'Course he was.

637
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:23,609
Questions to what end.

638
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,534
Everything he was working on,
he clearly suceeded.

639
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,159
How so?

640
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:34,425
Otherwise, he'll still be alive.

641
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:37,868
Which is why Miss Adler is
so desperate to find him.

642
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:38,808
Yes

643
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:42,694
There's one odour I can't
quite put my finger on.

644
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:44,184
It's candyfloss,
Molasses.

645
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:46,257
Lip syrup,

646
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,523
Barley sugar,

647
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:48,740
Toffee Apple.

648
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:56,404
Let me guess.

649
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,843
Judging by your arsonist tool kit

650
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,934
You're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

651
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:04,916
Just one minute, boys.

652
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,544
O, Dredger?

653
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,503
Is there a problem?

654
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:28,956
Meat...

655
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,709
or potatoes?

656
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,523
My ten minutes are up.

657
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:06,863
One moment, please.

658
00:50:07,373 --> 00:50:08,607
I'm in no hurry,

659
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,566
You alright?

660
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:23,015
One moment, please.

661
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:44,549
Holmes.

662
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:46,644
What is this?

663
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:48,475
I don't know.

664
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:50,833
Come along my brother.

665
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,408
Who sent you?

666
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,150
You know very well.

667
00:52:57,722 --> 00:52:59,971
Strange that you should still be

668
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:02,221
doing a dead man's dirty work

669
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:05,285
He's back from the dead.

670
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:07,626
Resurrected or not.

671
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:09,508
Tell me where to find him,

672
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:12,976
There are far greater things to fear,

673
00:53:14,102 --> 00:53:15,900
than you and your little toy.

674
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,298
Run little rabbit, run.

675
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,155
With pleasure.

676
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,205
Holmes!

677
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:10,604
Watson...

678
00:56:11,523 --> 00:56:13,469
What have you done?

679
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:26,279
I haven't slept all night

680
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:28,368
Not a wink.

681
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:31,698
Why I ever believed...

682
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:36,393
.. that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents..

683
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,513
...is beyond me. Having been
talked into going with you.

684
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,245
We were set upon
man it was self-defense.

685
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:46,078
I've been reviewing my notes on our
exploits over the last in seven months.

686
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:47,344
Would you like to know my conclusion?

687
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,959
I'm psychologically disturbed.

688
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:51,158
How so?

689
00:56:51,185 --> 00:56:55,052
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

690
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:58,977
where you deliberately withhold your plans from me.

691
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:00,492
Why else?

692
00:57:01,012 --> 00:57:04,224
You never complained about
my methods before.

693
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:06,008
I'm not complaining.
You're not?

694
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:06,904
What do you call this?

695
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,469
How me complain? I never complain.
When do I complain about...

696
00:57:09,504 --> 00:57:12,019
you pratising the violin at
three in the morning.

697
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:14,719
Or your mess, your
general lack of hygiene,

698
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:16,149
or the fact that you steal my clothes.

699
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:17,313
Ah, we have a barter system.

700
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:20,189
When do I complain about you
setting fire to my rooms?

701
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:20,827
Our rooms.

702
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,788
The rooms. When do I complain that
you experiment on my dog?

703
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:24,777
Our dog.

704
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:26,932
It's our dog.

705
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:32,271
But I do take issue, is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

706
00:57:40,044 --> 00:57:40,990
I understand.

707
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:42,790
Do you?
I do.

708
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,494
I don't think you do.
You're over tired.

709
00:57:47,508 --> 00:57:49,070
Yes.
You feel a bit sensitive.

710
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:50,805
I'm not sensitive.

711
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,683
What you need is to rest.

712
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:55,309
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small state near Chichester...

713
00:57:55,344 --> 00:57:57,509
beautiful grounds... has a falling

714
00:57:57,544 --> 00:58:00,256
We threw a lamb on the spit..

715
00:58:00,788 --> 00:58:03,680
We? Holmes, if I was to go to the country
it would be with my future wife.

716
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:04,933
Well, certainly if we must...

717
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,664
No, Not you, Mary and I!

718
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:09,486
- You are not...
- What? Invited?

719
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:11,973
Why would I not be invited to my
own brother's country home.

720
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:13,907
Watson, now you are the
one not making any sense.

721
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:15,091
- You're not human!

722
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:18,574
- John Watson?
- Yes

723
00:58:19,547 --> 00:58:21,232
Your bail's been posted.

724
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:28,549
Mary!

725
00:58:32,226 --> 00:58:33,612
Just Watson.

726
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:45,131
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

727
00:58:55,937 --> 00:58:57,325
Back off! Back off!

728
00:58:57,897 --> 00:59:01,071
To which the barman says:
"May I push in your stool?".

729
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,836
Right you, you're out.

730
00:59:06,648 --> 00:59:09,700
- Until next time, Big John.
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

731
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:14,389
Thank God you're here, Lestrade
I almost ran out of jokes.

732
00:59:14,424 --> 00:59:16,497
You know in another life,you would
have made an excellent criminal.

733
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:18,049
Yes, and you, sir,
an excellent policeman.

734
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:19,464
Topski! Thank you.

735
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:22,802
Now, please tell me you have answers.

736
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:25,226
All in good time, Lestrade.
LONDON IN TERROR

737
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,749
All in good time, what is this
some part of the game

738
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,750
where we have to guess
what you're thinking?

739
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,036
I've got a public in frenzy out there...

740
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:32,791
now, if you don't fill me in,
I'll have you in there..

741
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:35,425
playing " Victoria and Albert"
quicker than a bookie's run!

742
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:39,096
And clean up and make youself presentable.

743
00:59:39,824 --> 00:59:40,665
Why?

744
00:59:41,185 --> 00:59:42,743
Friends in high places...

745
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:44,470
They are the ones who
bailed you out.

746
00:59:56,243 --> 00:59:58,785
I'm terribly sorry to
inconvenience you, sir.

747
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:01,341
But I'm going to have
to put this on you.

748
01:00:05,711 --> 01:00:09,492
Mr. Holmes, apologies for
summoning you like this.

749
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:13,561
I'm sure, it's quiet a mystery of
where you are and who I am.

750
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,047
As to where I am...

751
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:19,685
I was initially lost through a moment,
between Charing Cross and Holborn,

752
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,057
but I was saved by the
bread shop on Saffron Hill.

753
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,699
The only baker to use a certain French
glaze on their loaves, a Britanny sage.

754
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:30,451
After that, the carriage forked left and right

755
01:00:30,913 --> 01:00:32,420
the Tilt Hill bump to fleet conduit.

756
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:34,464
And as to who you are that took

757
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:36,885
every ounce of my not
inconsiderable experience.

758
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:40,245
The letters on you desk are addressed
to a Sir Thomas Rodrum.

759
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:42,668
'Your Chief Justice',that
would be the official touch.

760
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:47,360
Who are you really are... is
of course another matter entirely.

761
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,041
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring..

762
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:52,330
your cross is the secret head of the
Temple of the Four Orders

763
01:00:52,365 --> 01:00:54,188
in whose head quarters we now sit.

764
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:57,486
On the northwest corner of
St. James Square, I think.

765
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,050
That's a mystery, the other mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

766
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:07,966
Yes, well..
Standard procedure, I suppose.

767
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,206
I dare say we have the
right man, gentlemen.

768
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:14,246
Sherlock Holmes.

769
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:17,428
Ambassador Standish from America and
Lord Coward, Home Secretary.

770
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:22,430
I suppose you already have some
notion as to the practices of our order.

771
01:01:23,006 --> 01:01:24,024
Yes

772
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,783
They... are practically interesting.

773
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,749
Be as skeptical as you like,
But our secret systems

774
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:32,682
have steered the world towards
a greater good for centuries.

775
01:01:32,717 --> 01:01:36,036
The danger is, they can also be
used for more nefarious purposes.

776
01:01:36,618 --> 01:01:39,604
What some call the dark arts
or... practical magic.

777
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:42,745
We know you don't believe in magic,
Mr. Holmes

778
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:46,051
we don't expect you to share our faith

779
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:47,606
merely our fears.

780
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:49,561
Fear is the more infectious condition.

781
01:01:50,642 --> 01:01:52,120
in his instance.

782
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:56,563
Fear for your own child.

783
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,548
Blackwood is your son

784
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:06,737
You have the same irises, a rare dark
green, the diamond shaped hazel flex,

785
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:09,031
together with identical
outer ears or pinna.

786
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:11,165
Which are only passed down
through direct bloodline

787
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,264
which makes you by necessity
either brothers or

788
01:02:14,086 --> 01:02:16,934
or in this case, more
likely... father and son.

789
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,604
Very few people have
paraded that information.

790
01:02:24,919 --> 01:02:26,801
And we want to
keep it that way.

791
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:33,907
He was concieved
during one of our rituals.

792
01:02:33,942 --> 01:02:35,386
His mother wasn't my wife.

793
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,825
But she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner.

794
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:43,592
Though not enough to
survive giving birth to him.

795
01:02:45,045 --> 01:02:47,144
Death followed him
wherever he went.

796
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:50,052
Those five girls were not
the first to be butchered.

797
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:52,925
He killed many more using
them to enhance his powers.

798
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:55,827
No one could prove anything
of course, but we all knew.

799
01:02:58,012 --> 01:02:59,378
The boy was a curse.

800
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:02,438
We've done our best to stop him
ourselves, but it's not enough.

801
01:03:02,473 --> 01:03:04,092
His power grows daily.

802
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,405
His resurrection is evidence of that.

803
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,976
But what he does next
will be far more dangerous.

804
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:13,798
The secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

805
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,397
He's going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of the world.

806
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:20,131
I want you to find him and
stop him before he does.

807
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,623
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

808
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:28,682
As home secretary, I have a
considerable influence over the police.

809
01:03:28,753 --> 01:03:32,580
- Oh, yes
- So...

810
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:36,380
Name your price?

811
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:38,861
Well, a great benefit to be a
consulting detective,...

812
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:41,730
...is that, I can pick and
choose my clients.

813
01:03:42,097 --> 01:03:44,017
So, consider it done, I'll stop him.

814
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:49,549
But not for you... and
certainly not for a price!

815
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,167
I do have a parting
query, SirThomas.

816
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:56,462
What is that?

817
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:58,882
If the rest of his
family is dead...

818
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,268
how long do you expect to survive?

819
01:04:01,907 --> 01:04:03,399
Food for thought!

820
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,425
Well, perhaps you'll have
better luck opening that.

821
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,820
Margot '58.
comet vintage.

822
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:39,099
How fascinating, that an astronomical
event can effect the quality of...

823
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:42,325
How is it going with our
case that you refused to take?

824
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,458
...wine.

825
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:46,762
Or I've hit a dead end. Literally.

826
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,480
I found your man. He's
buried in Blackwood's tomb.

827
01:04:53,912 --> 01:04:55,500
If you still need him.

828
01:04:57,532 --> 01:04:59,093
Oh dear...

829
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,490
Hope my client doesnt
come looking for a refund.

830
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:06,522
He's a professor, isn't he?

831
01:05:06,557 --> 01:05:09,591
I couldn't see his face, but I spotted
a bit of chalk on his tappan.

832
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:13,957
I've never known a professor to carry a
gun, and on such a clever contraption.

833
01:05:17,457 --> 01:05:20,452
Eyepatch. Nice touch...

834
01:05:21,237 --> 01:05:23,682
So... case closed.

835
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:26,482
Which makes this a social visit.

836
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:29,450
No. It's 'you're in over
your head Irene' visit.

837
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:32,383
Who ever killed Reordan was
covering their tracks...

838
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:36,036
which makes the next
loose end to be snipped.

839
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:38,596
Let it breathe.

840
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,746
I've never been in over my head.

841
01:05:41,781 --> 01:05:45,501
Leave now, dissapear.
You're good at that.

842
01:05:45,966 --> 01:05:49,461
Or stay, and volunteer
for protective custody.

843
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:56,194
If I'm in danger,
so are you.

844
01:06:00,068 --> 01:06:01,229
Come with me.

845
01:06:04,402 --> 01:06:06,455
What if we trusted each other.

846
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,148
You're not listening. I'm taking
you, to either a railway station

847
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,907
or the police station.

848
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:26,332
So...

849
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:33,410
What is it to be?

850
01:06:34,436 --> 01:06:36,717
You decide, which will it be?

851
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,276
I told you to let it breathe.

852
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,351
Can you taste the comet?

853
01:06:50,086 --> 01:06:52,685
Why couldn't you
just come away with me?

854
01:08:41,143 --> 01:08:44,235
Madam, I need you to remain calm,

855
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:47,313
and trust me, I'm a professional,
but beneath this pillow,

856
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,228
lies the key to my release.

857
01:08:51,072 --> 01:08:53,818
Of course, she misinterpreted
my intention entirely.

858
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,553
Naturally sir.

859
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,642
Thats why I find this modern
religious fellow so troubling.

860
01:08:57,677 --> 01:08:59,040
There's no latitude
for misunderstandings.

861
01:08:59,485 --> 01:09:00,860
It runs right over reason, sometimes.

862
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:03,373
And chambermaids were
once such a liberal breed.

863
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,999
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

864
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,999
Anyhow, its a good thing she was a friend,
otherwise we may never have found you.

865
01:09:12,034 --> 01:09:15,305
The inspector's been over to Baker
Street himself this morning, sir.

866
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:21,397
Just joking about the wife, sir.

867
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:29,309
We've checked everything, sir.
There's no sign of a break in

868
01:09:29,519 --> 01:09:31,159
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

869
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:35,011
So body in the bath tub,
his eyes were wide open

870
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:36,593
and the only thing missing was...

871
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,157
His ring, sir.

872
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:58,031
Why did you drain the water?

873
01:09:58,066 --> 01:09:59,528
Out of common decency.

874
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,131
Crime is common.
Logic is rare.

875
01:10:02,677 --> 01:10:06,012
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer,
not to provide conflict of cause.

876
01:10:20,794 --> 01:10:22,222
What is that?

877
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:28,233
Jasmine bath salt, sir.

878
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:30,729
Superb. Probably comes
from a larger container.

879
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:32,904
It would either be in the pantry,

880
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:37,513
high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

881
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:40,771
And constable, you could do worse
than to check the ground

882
01:10:41,059 --> 01:10:43,531
under the rear window, for any signs
of footprints, not your own.

883
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,318
Data, data, data. I cannot
make bricks without clay.

884
01:11:45,154 --> 01:11:46,389
Charles?

885
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:56,602
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

886
01:11:57,489 --> 01:11:58,740
It was in the pantry, sir.

887
01:11:59,712 --> 01:12:01,398
I don't know what to make of this.

888
01:12:02,168 --> 01:12:03,686
Excellent work.

889
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:05,086
Adieu.

890
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,657
What's the meaning of this, Coward?

891
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:47,485
Why have you called this meeting?

892
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:49,483
Sir Thomas is dead.

893
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:54,484
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the Order.

894
01:12:57,925 --> 01:12:59,511
Have you lost your mind?

895
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,434
You know damn well
what his capable of.

896
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:03,742
Of course he does.

897
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:08,255
That's why we're here.

898
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:10,910
That's why we're all here.

899
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:20,118
My powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose.

900
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:24,928
Magnificent was a simple purpose.

901
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,377
To create a new future.

902
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:33,888
A future ruled... by us.

903
01:13:36,694 --> 01:13:41,186
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

904
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,176
Magic will lead the way.

905
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:46,854
Once the people of England
see our new found power..

906
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,707
they'll bow down in fear.

907
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:57,720
Across the Atlantic, lies a
colony that was once ours.

908
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,159
It will be again.

909
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:02,317
The civil war has
made them weak.

910
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:07,748
Their government is as corrupt
and ineffective as ours.

911
01:14:08,601 --> 01:14:09,825
So we'll take it back.

912
01:14:11,617 --> 01:14:13,578
We will remake the world.

913
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:17,775
Create the future.

914
01:14:19,405 --> 01:14:22,389
These men are with me,
Standish.

915
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:25,841
But... are you?

916
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,531
No, sir. I am not.

917
01:14:30,784 --> 01:14:32,703
These powers that you're
playing with...

918
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:35,206
no man can control.

919
01:14:37,982 --> 01:14:42,698
Well, gentlemen... Someone
has to stop them

920
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,266
even if you won't.

921
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:48,566
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

922
01:15:12,057 --> 01:15:15,189
Gentlemen... don't be afraid.

923
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:20,829
As you can see,
we are protected.

924
01:15:23,456 --> 01:15:24,920
Come... drink your allegiance here.

925
01:15:31,842 --> 01:15:34,641
You control the
police, now use them.

926
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:48,967
I didn't know you were here.

927
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:52,066
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

928
01:15:53,358 --> 01:15:54,451
Be my guest.

929
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:58,969
- In here chaps.
- Where shall we put him, sir?

930
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:00,262
Anywhere's fine.

931
01:16:11,459 --> 01:16:12,316
Who is he?

932
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:14,749
He's the man who tried to kill
you at Reordan's lodgings.

933
01:16:15,216 --> 01:16:18,361
I suppose his neck didn't survive the
impact of Dredger landing on him.

934
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:21,585
Yes... Thanks for that by the way.

935
01:16:24,557 --> 01:16:26,375
But there is still some consolation
in the knowledge

936
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,193
that he can still be of service
to his fellow man.

937
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,253
Elbow is now stained with blood.

938
01:16:34,664 --> 01:16:36,279
But it's older than his own injuries.

939
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:47,806
None of it human. There's
an odd butcher. Let me see...

940
01:16:58,309 --> 01:17:00,133
Yellow Flame. Green bursts.

941
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,305
An industrial worker.

942
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,286
Coal. Hint of silt.

943
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:12,512
And the strike on his trousers,
should put him squarely in...

944
01:17:12,547 --> 01:17:13,949
Nine Elms.

945
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:15,316
Sorry what?

946
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:17,456
The area you're looking
for is Nine Elms.

947
01:17:19,748 --> 01:17:22,294
Do you remember where I put the
Lord's register of members interests?

948
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:24,144
It's on the step ladder.

949
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:38,887
Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

950
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:41,444
Woolidge Arsenal,

951
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,314
Limehouse Chemical Works,

952
01:17:43,349 --> 01:17:44,739
Probably be a factory
by the river.

953
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:45,978
What's that?

954
01:17:47,177 --> 01:17:48,244
Never mind.

955
01:17:50,549 --> 01:17:52,226
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

956
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,852
No, not a clue.

957
01:17:54,706 --> 01:17:56,663
Queensithe slaughterhouse.

958
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:58,384
Nine Elms.

959
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:00,250
A factory by the river.

960
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:03,534
Well done, Watson. That should
lead us right to Blackwood.

961
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:05,016
Dead or Alive.

962
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:05,827
Not us.

963
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:09,858
You.

964
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,410
Yes...

965
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,548
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

966
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,722
He's left it there on purpose.

967
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,604
More coal doctor.

968
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:54,329
That's a good one.

969
01:18:57,412 --> 01:18:59,435
Glad to see you two
are working hard then.

970
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:02,202
And I thought you were
trying to be discrete.

971
01:19:02,713 --> 01:19:05,685
You would not last
one day in the navy.

972
01:19:08,897 --> 01:19:10,553
Holmes, are you
sure there is no

973
01:19:10,588 --> 01:19:13,000
alternative means of
water transportaion than that.

974
01:19:13,035 --> 01:19:15,413
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

975
01:19:16,726 --> 01:19:18,270
Tanners practically a fish himself.

976
01:19:19,016 --> 01:19:20,262
He certainly drinks like one.

977
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,163
Oh, you've found your
sense of humour, doctor.

978
01:19:22,696 --> 01:19:24,308
If only just a sense.

979
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:28,626
I better take over.
A bit tricky down here.

980
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,468
Come on.

981
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:08,810
Look familiar?
Yeah.

982
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:10,248
All that's missing is the ginger midget.

983
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,632
They cleared something away from here.

984
01:20:25,652 --> 01:20:27,014
Not minutes ago.

985
01:20:27,049 --> 01:20:28,185
Like what?

986
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:31,210
I'm not sure. Something mechanical.

987
01:20:32,488 --> 01:20:35,114
Holmes, look at this.

988
01:20:59,405 --> 01:21:01,216
1:18
Chapter and verse.

989
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:04,247
Revelations 1:18.
'I am he that liveth...

990
01:21:04,282 --> 01:21:07,686
...and was dead. '
- ' and, behold, I am alive for evermore,'

991
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:12,262
I warned you, Holmes, to accept

992
01:21:12,297 --> 01:21:13,988
that this was beyond your control.

993
01:21:14,642 --> 01:21:16,801
Beyond what your rational
mind could comprehend.

994
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,558
What a busy afterlife you're having.

995
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:22,472
I want you to bear witness.

996
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:27,954
Tomorrow, at midday, the
world as you know it, will end.

997
01:21:28,173 --> 01:21:30,695
Show me your face and it will
be the end of your world right now.

998
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,081
Save the bullets, Watson.

999
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:34,747
A gift for you.

1000
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,225
What was that about saving bullets?

1001
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,532
She followed you here, Holmes.

1002
01:21:51,892 --> 01:21:54,202
You led your lamb to slaughter.

1003
01:21:57,798 --> 01:21:58,756
Holmes!

1004
01:22:00,593 --> 01:22:02,141
This game is designed to hurt.

1005
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,175
Watson!

1006
01:22:19,757 --> 01:22:21,506
It's warm in here, Watson!

1007
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:29,861
In over your head yet, darling?

1008
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,423
Hold on there!
I can't.

1009
01:22:39,695 --> 01:22:41,821
Let me take your weight.

1010
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:43,674
Put this leg up, old boy.

1011
01:22:46,769 --> 01:22:49,440
These German locks always
give me trouble.

1012
01:22:54,487 --> 01:22:55,817
It's a band saw!

1013
01:22:59,284 --> 01:23:00,927
No matter. We have plenty of time.

1014
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,364
Holmes...

1015
01:23:12,304 --> 01:23:13,582
It's not working.
Keep calm.

1016
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,770
Holmes! Hurry up.

1017
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,608
Don't get exited!

1018
01:23:34,249 --> 01:23:35,563
Turn of that valve.

1019
01:24:00,394 --> 01:24:01,725
It'll bounce in.. Three...

1020
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,085
...two,

1021
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:04,497
...one.

1022
01:24:15,404 --> 01:24:16,792
Thank you.

1023
01:24:17,575 --> 01:24:18,800
I'm gonna get after, Blackwood.

1024
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:29,816
Thank you.

1025
01:24:30,929 --> 01:24:32,806
We should go help the doctor.

1026
01:24:45,428 --> 01:24:46,866
Holmes!

1027
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,456
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

1028
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:55,655
Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go.

1029
01:27:13,148 --> 01:27:14,914
Will the train be departing on time?

1030
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:16,680
The train's been delayed, madam.

1031
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:19,283
Shouldn't be long, now though.

1032
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:38,581
The train will depart
when I tell it too.

1033
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:44,049
And you will leave my
employment, when I allow you to.

1034
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:50,649
I fulfilled my contract.

1035
01:27:51,012 --> 01:27:52,521
I found Reordan.

1036
01:27:52,556 --> 01:27:54,325
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

1037
01:27:54,822 --> 01:27:56,187
So that's me finished.

1038
01:27:56,634 --> 01:27:59,915
Your job was to manipulate
Holmes' feelings for you.

1039
01:28:00,604 --> 01:28:02,069
Not succumb to them.

1040
01:28:05,735 --> 01:28:07,113
You have fulfilled nothing.

1041
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:09,856
I want what Reordan
was making for Blackwood.

1042
01:28:10,342 --> 01:28:15,623
Finish the job or the next dead
body, will be Sherlock Holmes.

1043
01:28:43,558 --> 01:28:45,215
The surgeon should
be along shortly.

1044
01:28:50,345 --> 01:28:51,831
He should be
able to rest now.

1045
01:28:55,593 --> 01:28:57,084
Excuse me.

1046
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,935
Is that the best you can do?

1047
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,528
Yes, for now.

1048
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:06,981
I must attend to
my other patients.

1049
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:10,243
Doctor...

1050
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:12,055
Doctor!

1051
01:29:12,549 --> 01:29:14,267
Please!

1052
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,671
I know that you care
for him as much as I do.

1053
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,385
This is not your responsibility,
It was his choice.

1054
01:29:26,632 --> 01:29:28,787
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1055
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:37,329
Solve this.

1056
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:39,977
Whatever it takes.

1057
01:29:55,168 --> 01:29:56,638
It's Lord Blackwood, sir.

1058
01:29:56,942 --> 01:29:58,669
I've never been in over my head.

1059
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:01,443
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd
advise you, leave the case alone.

1060
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:03,154
You're not taking this
seriously are you, Holmes.

1061
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:05,793
I told you to accept, this
was beyond your control.

1062
01:30:06,012 --> 01:30:09,261
Tomorrow at mid-day, the world will end.

1063
01:30:09,296 --> 01:30:10,528
Holmes.

1064
01:30:36,824 --> 01:30:40,343
You and I, are bound together on a journey,
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1065
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,509
Steel your mind, Holmes.

1066
01:30:44,061 --> 01:30:45,886
He's going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of the world.

1067
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:47,159
His power grows.

1068
01:30:47,194 --> 01:30:48,368
This is the source of his power.

1069
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,474
I need you.

1070
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:51,245
The secret lies in the book of spells.

1071
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,472
Three more will die...

1072
01:31:23,002 --> 01:31:24,798
and there's nothing
you can do to save them.

1073
01:31:26,345 --> 01:31:28,281
We know you don't believe in magic.

1074
01:31:30,075 --> 01:31:31,794
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1075
01:31:38,529 --> 01:31:40,825
The only thing missing
was his ring.

1076
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:49,950
Give up, Holmes.

1077
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,198
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1078
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:02,042
Good morning.

1079
01:32:05,476 --> 01:32:08,354
Now, you need to work.

1080
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,508
Familiar artwork?

1081
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,366
You look gorgeous.

1082
01:32:18,243 --> 01:32:20,070
Some how, I knew you wouldn't leave.

1083
01:32:27,197 --> 01:32:28,875
Sherlock Holmes
WANTED

1084
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,506
You made the front page.

1085
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:32,102
Only a name, and no picture?

1086
01:32:33,369 --> 01:32:37,214
So it looks like, you'll be needing
to work outside the law now,

1087
01:32:37,431 --> 01:32:40,774
and that's my area of expertise.

1088
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:41,847
I feel safer already.

1089
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:45,944
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1090
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:48,848
Yes...

1091
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:51,518
I took the shrapnel out myself.

1092
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:54,339
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1093
01:33:00,555 --> 01:33:03,335
Well I'm... I'm just so...

1094
01:33:03,957 --> 01:33:08,115
very glad that you're
um... well, with us.

1095
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:16,569
Now that youre sitting
comfortably, I shall begin.

1096
01:33:18,082 --> 01:33:20,992
My initial approach
was far to narrow.

1097
01:33:21,317 --> 01:33:23,378
When Blackwood invited
me to Pentonville prison

1098
01:33:23,413 --> 01:33:25,204
he suggested I widen my gaze.

1099
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:26,852
and at minimum, I have done just that.

1100
01:33:27,422 --> 01:33:32,266
In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands
of years of theological disparity.

1101
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,848
But that's for another time.

1102
01:33:37,037 --> 01:33:39,867
Blackwood's method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system

1103
01:33:39,902 --> 01:33:42,792
that's been employed by the Temple
of the Four Orders for centuries.

1104
01:33:42,827 --> 01:33:46,180
To fully understand the
system, to get inside it,

1105
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:49,534
I reinacted the ceremony
we interupted at the crypt,

1106
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:51,901
with a few enhancements of my own.

1107
01:33:53,103 --> 01:33:56,443
my journey took me so much further down
the rabbit hole than I intended

1108
01:33:56,478 --> 01:33:59,341
and though I dont need
my fluffy white tail.

1109
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:01,905
I have emerged, enlightened.

1110
01:34:02,943 --> 01:34:05,743
The fraternity who
decidedly control the empire

1111
01:34:05,778 --> 01:34:08,741
who shared the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old,

1112
01:34:09,026 --> 01:34:11,807
that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension.

1113
01:34:12,036 --> 01:34:13,941
A gateway to immeasurable power.

1114
01:34:14,227 --> 01:34:15,587
It's made up of four parts.

1115
01:34:15,839 --> 01:34:19,023
The foot of a lion, the tail of
an ox, the wings of an eagle

1116
01:34:19,532 --> 01:34:20,941
and the head of a man.

1117
01:34:21,282 --> 01:34:24,375
In Sir Thomass secret chamber,
I found a bone of an ox

1118
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:27,422
the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and a hair of a man.

1119
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:29,000
Map.

1120
01:34:32,997 --> 01:34:35,558
The points of the star represent
the the five murdered girls,

1121
01:34:35,873 --> 01:34:38,049
but the cross is what
were now intrested in.

1122
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:43,839
Its a wildly held belief, that within
the architecture of the great cities

1123
01:34:43,874 --> 01:34:46,120
are coded references to the system.

1124
01:34:46,965 --> 01:34:49,550
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood's killed three men.

1125
01:34:49,886 --> 01:34:54,030
Each murder was committed at a location
that has a direct connection with the temple,

1126
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,455
therefore the system.

1127
01:34:56,867 --> 01:34:58,364
Reordan, the ginger midget.

1128
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:00,905
represents man. We found his body here.

1129
01:35:02,688 --> 01:35:06,059
Sir Thomas... master of the
temple, wore the ox ring.

1130
01:35:06,178 --> 01:35:07,699
He died here.

1131
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:12,402
Standish, the ambassador to America,
Where the eagle has been a national

1132
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:14,245
emblem over a hundred years.

1133
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,211
The headquarters of the Temple of the
Four Orders, where he died,

1134
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:19,901
...is here.

1135
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:24,080
Correspondingly, the map will tell
us the location of Blackwood's final act.

1136
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,113
So we have man, the ox,
eagle and the lion remaining.

1137
01:35:30,107 --> 01:35:31,907
Right here.

1138
01:35:33,157 --> 01:35:34,483
Parliament.

1139
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:44,095
Alright, you four stay here and
the rest of you, come with me.

1140
01:35:46,189 --> 01:35:47,572
Right this way.

1141
01:35:50,971 --> 01:35:52,450
Ladies First.

1142
01:35:55,451 --> 01:35:56,884
Follow these instructions.

1143
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:03,977
Hello, hello, hello...

1144
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:06,958
Did the devil turn up?

1145
01:36:08,161 --> 01:36:10,820
Well, never mind.

1146
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:13,747
You've got the next best thing.

1147
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:40,848
Beg your pardon my lord,
I know its unorthodox...

1148
01:36:42,525 --> 01:36:46,942
But Mr. Holmes here, he's been making
some serious accusations about you..

1149
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:51,081
and The Order.

1150
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:54,176
I see.

1151
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,960
Well, at least this solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.

1152
01:37:03,613 --> 01:37:04,984
Excuse me, my lord.

1153
01:37:06,046 --> 01:37:08,589
But I've been wanting
to that for a long time.

1154
01:37:08,986 --> 01:37:12,019
Well inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement.

1155
01:37:12,964 --> 01:37:15,994
So why dont you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy.

1156
01:37:19,306 --> 01:37:20,775
Thank you, Lestrade.

1157
01:37:21,547 --> 01:37:22,820
My lord...

1158
01:37:28,835 --> 01:37:31,771
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders.

1159
01:37:32,116 --> 01:37:34,178
or just the one I prevented?

1160
01:37:35,354 --> 01:37:37,493
Very distinctive, those hand
made shoes of yours.

1161
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:43,802
But the price of quality is often,
the leaking print they leave.

1162
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:48,864
Nonetheless I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1163
01:37:49,938 --> 01:37:52,322
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1164
01:37:54,003 --> 01:37:56,430
Fortunately, theres nothing
more stimulating than a

1165
01:37:56,465 --> 01:37:57,989
case where everything
goes against you.

1166
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:02,304
How many members of parliament do
you intend to murder, at noon today.

1167
01:38:03,047 --> 01:38:07,502
Man, ox, eagle, lion. The
lion's the parliament, isn't it?

1168
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:11,407
Very clever.

1169
01:38:12,356 --> 01:38:14,264
But it's not murder,
Mr. Holmes.

1170
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,511
It's mercy.

1171
01:38:16,879 --> 01:38:19,229
We are giving the weak
masses a strong Shepherd.

1172
01:38:19,762 --> 01:38:21,468
Don't you see,
it's for their own...

1173
01:38:25,164 --> 01:38:27,725
No. But I don't care
much what you think.

1174
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:30,842
I just simply wanted to know the
location of Blackwoods final ceremony.

1175
01:38:30,877 --> 01:38:32,429
And now you've given it to me.

1176
01:38:32,464 --> 01:38:34,031
I've told you nothing.

1177
01:38:34,066 --> 01:38:36,943
But your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope.

1178
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:40,474
The mud smeared on your boots
from where youve been walking.

1179
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:44,149
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where youve been kneeling.

1180
01:38:45,463 --> 01:38:48,472
A small bandage on your thumb
from where youve been vowing.

1181
01:38:48,878 --> 01:38:52,081
A faint aroma of excrement from
where youve been standing.

1182
01:38:55,209 --> 01:38:58,552
You and Blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the sewers..

1183
01:38:58,587 --> 01:38:59,780
beneath parliament,

1184
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:01,375
less than an hour ago.

1185
01:39:02,294 --> 01:39:03,923
Both houses meet today.

1186
01:39:04,717 --> 01:39:06,675
The whole government will be present.

1187
01:39:16,434 --> 01:39:18,903
It's a shame you made an
enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1188
01:39:20,181 --> 01:39:21,838
You would have
made a valuable ally.

1189
01:39:29,555 --> 01:39:31,335
How terrible is wisdom,

1190
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:33,836
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1191
01:39:35,295 --> 01:39:37,036
We take power at noon.

1192
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,056
Then isn't anytime to waste then.

1193
01:39:39,091 --> 01:39:40,900
Guess not?

1194
01:40:06,836 --> 01:40:09,022
I told you hed be coming out of
that top window, soldier boy.

1195
01:40:09,057 --> 01:40:11,259
There isn't any way hed be
coming out of that terrace.

1196
01:40:11,753 --> 01:40:14,675
Technically, that isnt the
top window, is it? Sailor boy.

1197
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:17,638
What is it?
Well, it's the middle window.

1198
01:40:17,673 --> 01:40:22,206
Anyway, youll be pleased to know
that Lestrade performed his role perfectly.

1199
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,053
In fact, I think
I rather enjoyed it.

1200
01:40:24,265 --> 01:40:26,022
I hope you know what
you're doing, Holmes.

1201
01:40:26,493 --> 01:40:27,927
Here's the key.

1202
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:29,863
You got what you
needed from, Coward?

1203
01:40:29,898 --> 01:40:31,881
Yes, I smoked him out
of the room, with ease.

1204
01:40:33,255 --> 01:40:34,498
Taylor?
Sir?

1205
01:40:34,533 --> 01:40:37,305
If you would, captain,
take us onto the bridge.

1206
01:40:37,768 --> 01:40:39,629
Portside. Approximately 100 yards
beyond that,

1207
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:42,328
you will find a tunnel, that leads
us to the sewers.

1208
01:40:42,363 --> 01:40:43,305
Right away, sir.

1209
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:56,432
Blackwoods come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1210
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,129
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1211
01:41:46,662 --> 01:41:47,688
What does it do?

1212
01:41:47,723 --> 01:41:49,068
It's a chemical weapon.

1213
01:41:49,538 --> 01:41:50,676
The first of its kind.

1214
01:41:50,879 --> 01:41:51,872
You deduced that, how?

1215
01:41:52,838 --> 01:41:53,942
From my pocket.

1216
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:57,338
I snipped this off a rather common
rat at the slaughterhouse.

1217
01:41:57,929 --> 01:41:59,212
Notice the bluish discolouration.

1218
01:41:59,412 --> 01:42:03,162
The faint smell of bitter almonds
and tell-tale traces of cyanide.

1219
01:42:08,309 --> 01:42:09,785
Now we know what the
ginger midget was working on.

1220
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,937
- It will revolutionise warfare.
- Yes, killing a lot of people.

1221
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:16,194
Now, there's 7 minutes until
noon. What are we gonna do?

1222
01:42:19,353 --> 01:42:21,042
Right,...

1223
01:42:23,841 --> 01:42:25,747
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1224
01:42:59,218 --> 01:43:01,607
Shoot him! Now please!

1225
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:23,199
My lords! My lords! Time has come for any of
those who believe, to remain.

1226
01:43:24,789 --> 01:43:27,802
Behold... Lord Blackwood.

1227
01:43:41,326 --> 01:43:42,779
You seem surprised.

1228
01:43:45,247 --> 01:43:48,744
I have returned from beyond the
grave to fulfil Englands destiny.

1229
01:43:50,163 --> 01:43:52,720
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1230
01:43:56,909 --> 01:43:59,208
Listen to the rabble outside.

1231
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:01,145
Listen...

1232
01:44:01,546 --> 01:44:02,922
to the fear.

1233
01:44:03,309 --> 01:44:05,869
I will use that as a
weapon to control them...

1234
01:44:07,513 --> 01:44:08,995
and then the world.

1235
01:44:13,272 --> 01:44:15,395
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1236
01:44:19,321 --> 01:44:21,632
Its specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it.

1237
01:44:24,818 --> 01:44:27,547
These cannoli appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1238
01:44:27,582 --> 01:44:29,373
Electromagnetic waves?

1239
01:44:29,627 --> 01:44:31,731
When triggered, the electrodes
will send a charge

1240
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:33,651
converting the chemial into gas.

1241
01:44:33,854 --> 01:44:35,629
and the gas will travel up that shaft

1242
01:44:35,664 --> 01:44:38,821
and filter through the ventilation
system that leads directly to parliament.

1243
01:44:39,431 --> 01:44:41,282
Within seconds of it's administration,

1244
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:44,127
the most powerful men in the
world will be choking on death.

1245
01:44:44,568 --> 01:44:46,146
Blackwood must have
some sort of transmitter

1246
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:47,852
that connects them remotely.

1247
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,461
Three minutes and ten seconds.

1248
01:44:49,496 --> 01:44:53,652
I will create an empire that
will endure for a millennia.

1249
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,490
Indestructible and eternal.

1250
01:44:57,897 --> 01:45:00,270
Move it! Move it!

1251
01:45:00,578 --> 01:45:05,962
We don't actually have to disarm the device,
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1252
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:07,779
Yes

1253
01:45:07,814 --> 01:45:13,106
Except that they're welded in. What
we need is a controlled expolsion.

1254
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:17,285
We need a container to direct the blast,
my clay pipe should service that ambition.

1255
01:45:33,778 --> 01:45:37,649
Did you miss me?

1256
01:45:37,684 --> 01:45:40,201
I rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.

1257
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:50,164
On the twelfth chime, I will
summon the dark powers.

1258
01:45:52,033 --> 01:45:55,139
All of those who are with
me shall be protected.

1259
01:45:56,325 --> 01:45:58,905
All others will perish.

1260
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:07,992
I need your pipe.

1261
01:46:11,346 --> 01:46:13,003
Nut him!

1262
01:46:39,134 --> 01:46:39,674
What?

1263
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:40,434
Coat!

1264
01:46:40,469 --> 01:46:41,160
Got him.

1265
01:47:19,989 --> 01:47:23,445
A new order... begins now.

1266
01:47:30,064 --> 01:47:30,861
Woman?

1267
01:47:31,762 --> 01:47:33,042
What are you waiting for?

1268
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,103
That..

1269
01:47:48,965 --> 01:47:50,380
Apprehend Coward!

1270
01:47:52,892 --> 01:47:54,637
- Can you manage?
- Of course I can.

1271
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:24,678
Relax. I'm a doctor.

1272
01:49:36,474 --> 01:49:38,261
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?

1273
01:49:40,737 --> 01:49:42,192
We're safe now.

1274
01:49:43,128 --> 01:49:44,549
Interesting assessment.

1275
01:49:46,882 --> 01:49:48,311
Run off.

1276
01:49:51,373 --> 01:49:53,030
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1277
01:49:54,647 --> 01:49:56,100
Fare thee well.

1278
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,533
I don't want to run anymore.

1279
01:50:06,007 --> 01:50:07,786
I'll tell you everything.

1280
01:50:08,193 --> 01:50:09,348
I wish you would.

1281
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:33,567
No!

1282
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:41,617
There was never any magic.

1283
01:51:43,519 --> 01:51:45,378
Only conjuring tricks.

1284
01:51:49,654 --> 01:51:51,369
The simplest, involved
paying people off.

1285
01:51:51,917 --> 01:51:54,696
Like the prison guard who pretended
to be possessed outside you cell.

1286
01:51:55,382 --> 01:51:57,598
Your reputation and the
inmates fear did the rest.

1287
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,559
Others required more
elaborate preparations.

1288
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:04,462
It was sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1289
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,615
You had it broken before your burial

1290
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:09,900
then put back together
using a mild adhesive.

1291
01:52:11,544 --> 01:52:13,322
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.

1292
01:52:14,052 --> 01:52:18,771
A mixture of egg and honey, that
was to be washed away by the rain.

1293
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:25,561
Holmes!

1294
01:52:25,935 --> 01:52:28,001
Arranging for your father to
drown in his own bathtub

1295
01:52:28,036 --> 01:52:30,470
required more modern science.

1296
01:52:30,505 --> 01:52:32,774
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic..

1297
01:52:32,809 --> 01:52:36,439
that was activated by the
combination of copper and water,

1298
01:52:36,474 --> 01:52:40,549
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1299
01:52:40,946 --> 01:52:42,696
It would have been
quite a challenge for me,

1300
01:52:42,731 --> 01:52:46,912
had he not also tested it on
some unfortunate amphibian.

1301
01:52:51,512 --> 01:52:53,859
The death of Standish
was a real mystery

1302
01:52:53,894 --> 01:52:58,022
until you used the same
compound, to blow up the wharf.

1303
01:52:58,330 --> 01:53:01,515
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid.

1304
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:04,701
Yet, it burned with an unusual
pinkish hue.

1305
01:53:06,216 --> 01:53:08,449
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple.

1306
01:53:08,484 --> 01:53:12,449
All it took was a spark.

1307
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:18,724
A simple rigged
bullet in his gun.

1308
01:53:20,574 --> 01:53:21,811
Ingenious.

1309
01:53:21,846 --> 01:53:25,822
Like all great performers, you saved
your Pice de rsistance for the end.

1310
01:53:25,857 --> 01:53:28,507
A chemical weapon,
distilled from cyanide,

1311
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:30,340
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1312
01:53:30,746 --> 01:53:34,319
Had it worked, your followers in
parliament would have watched unharmed,

1313
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:37,131
as their colleagues were
dying around them.

1314
01:53:37,956 --> 01:53:39,815
They didn't know that you'd
given them the antidote.

1315
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:42,750
Instead they would have
believed it was magic.

1316
01:53:42,785 --> 01:53:45,187
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1317
01:53:45,721 --> 01:53:49,839
And the world would have followed. Fear,
being the most powerfull weapon of all.

1318
01:53:51,449 --> 01:53:53,869
You'd better hope that it's
nothing more than superstition,

1319
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:56,804
as you performed all
the rituals perfectly.

1320
01:53:57,648 --> 01:53:59,675
The devil's due a soul, I'd say!

1321
01:54:01,614 --> 01:54:04,454
For god's sake,
Holmes, cut me loose!

1322
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:17,478
First, the world will see
you for what you are.

1323
01:54:17,852 --> 01:54:19,467
A fraud.

1324
01:54:19,836 --> 01:54:22,648
Then you'll be hanged
properly this time.

1325
01:54:23,012 --> 01:54:25,444
It's a long journey
from here to the rope.

1326
01:55:16,973 --> 01:55:19,407
I've never woken up
in handcuffs before.

1327
01:55:20,584 --> 01:55:22,017
I have.

1328
01:55:23,538 --> 01:55:25,020
Naked.

1329
01:55:29,217 --> 01:55:30,795
A storm's coming.

1330
01:55:31,699 --> 01:55:34,086
Well... we've still got a moment.

1331
01:55:39,023 --> 01:55:41,189
Moriarty...
What?

1332
01:55:42,345 --> 01:55:43,989
That's his name.

1333
01:55:44,723 --> 01:55:46,339
And he is a professor.

1334
01:55:48,682 --> 01:55:50,524
Everyone has a weak spot.

1335
01:55:51,544 --> 01:55:53,363
And he found a mine.

1336
01:55:55,111 --> 01:55:57,009
What was it precisely?

1337
01:56:07,931 --> 01:56:09,741
Please don't underestimate him.

1338
01:56:11,261 --> 01:56:13,084
He's just as brilliant as you are.

1339
01:56:13,957 --> 01:56:15,942
and infinitely more devious.

1340
01:56:16,507 --> 01:56:17,800
We'll see about that.

1341
01:56:34,462 --> 01:56:36,659
You'll miss me, Sherlock?

1342
01:56:39,292 --> 01:56:42,265
Sadly... yes.

1343
01:57:10,594 --> 01:57:14,361
Afternoon, sir. I put the notebooks
in this one, sir. Thank you.

1344
01:57:14,396 --> 01:57:15,711
What's in these, John?

1345
01:57:16,015 --> 01:57:17,776
Scribbles.
Scribbles?

1346
01:57:18,163 --> 01:57:19,834
Notes.
They're your adventures!

1347
01:57:20,303 --> 01:57:21,554
I'd like to read them.

1348
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:29,597
Come on, what's wrong?

1349
01:57:29,762 --> 01:57:32,105
I think his finally come
to terms of you leaving?

1350
01:57:32,449 --> 01:57:34,978
Mary, look at the
ring his given us.

1351
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:38,150
Now five minutes here,
and we'll go home.

1352
01:57:38,816 --> 01:57:39,879
Our home.

1353
01:57:40,536 --> 01:57:41,782
Count those stairs.

1354
01:57:50,153 --> 01:57:51,478
Don't worry, dear.

1355
01:57:51,513 --> 01:57:55,973
Suicide is not in his repertoire. He's
far to fond of himself for that.

1356
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:57,781
Holmes!

1357
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,682
Good afternoon.

1358
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,231
I was trying to deduce the manner in which
Blackwood survived his execution.

1359
01:58:06,648 --> 01:58:08,200
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1360
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,583
But it had a surprising
suffocating effect on, and

1361
01:58:11,618 --> 01:58:13,484
I was carried off in
the arms of Morpheus.

1362
01:58:13,952 --> 01:58:16,474
like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.

1363
01:58:17,128 --> 01:58:18,512
Get on with it, Holmes.

1364
01:58:19,341 --> 01:58:21,592
Cleverly concealed in the
hangman's knot was a hook,

1365
01:58:23,077 --> 01:58:25,874
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen
asleep I should probably come down.

1366
01:58:25,909 --> 01:58:27,485
John, shouldn't we
help him down?

1367
01:58:27,712 --> 01:58:30,548
No, no, I hate to
cut him off midstream.

1368
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:31,842
Carry on.

1369
01:58:32,927 --> 01:58:34,996
Well the executioner
attached it to a harness.

1370
01:58:35,031 --> 01:58:37,933
Thus lowering the weight
contributed around the waist and

1371
01:58:37,968 --> 01:58:40,199
the neck to remain intact.

1372
01:58:40,605 --> 01:58:42,172
Oh my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.

1373
01:58:42,207 --> 01:58:44,191
Might we continue
this at ground level?

1374
01:58:44,426 --> 01:58:46,020
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1375
01:58:46,376 --> 01:58:49,671
I managed it with braces, belts and
a coat hook.

1376
01:58:50,542 --> 01:58:53,251
Please, Watson, my tongue is going, it
would be of no use to you at all.

1377
01:58:53,413 --> 01:58:55,424
Worse things could happen.
- John.

1378
01:58:58,605 --> 01:59:01,481
None of this, explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1379
01:59:01,516 --> 01:59:01,800
Right.

1380
01:59:03,275 --> 01:59:04,819
Now the medical mystery.

1381
01:59:05,112 --> 01:59:07,922
We must restore your reputation,Watson.

1382
01:59:08,394 --> 01:59:12,026
There is a toxin refined from the
nectar of Rhododendron ponticum.

1383
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:15,618
It's quite infamous in the region of Turkey,
bordering the Black Sea, for it's

1384
01:59:15,653 --> 01:59:18,147
ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis.

1385
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:22,251
Enough to mislead a medical mind,
even as tenacious as your own.

1386
01:59:22,662 --> 01:59:23,827
It's known locally as...

1387
01:59:23,862 --> 01:59:24,993
What's wrong with Gladston?

1388
01:59:25,028 --> 01:59:26,457
Mad honey disease.

1389
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:30,324
His demonstrating the very
effects that I just described.

1390
01:59:31,467 --> 01:59:32,944
He doesn't mind.

1391
01:59:35,551 --> 01:59:37,838
Mary don't worry.
he's seen far worse.

1392
01:59:38,772 --> 01:59:40,155
Mr. Holmes?

1393
01:59:42,029 --> 01:59:43,295
Doctor, Miss Mary...

1394
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:46,149
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks
you come with me right away.

1395
01:59:47,734 --> 01:59:49,227
What is it this time, Clarky?

1396
01:59:49,451 --> 01:59:51,517
Its one of our sergeants, sir.

1397
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:54,245
He went missing in the sewers the
day, you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1398
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,938
Im afraid the sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1399
01:59:58,413 --> 02:00:00,999
We believe the sergeant,
was our first man on the scene...

1400
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:03,519
Can I help you, officer?

1401
02:00:04,111 --> 02:00:05,575
Shot in the head.

1402
02:00:06,753 --> 02:00:08,837
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1403
02:00:09,554 --> 02:00:10,126
Yes.

1404
02:00:12,568 --> 02:00:14,281
Was there powdered
burns on his eyebrows?

1405
02:00:14,746 --> 02:00:16,023
Indeed, sir.

1406
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:19,975
Point blank range.

1407
02:00:20,415 --> 02:00:22,000
Moriarty.

1408
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:24,482
Professor Moriarty.

1409
02:00:27,742 --> 02:00:29,235
There's a good boy!

1410
02:00:29,616 --> 02:00:30,958
Everything's gonna be fine.

1411
02:00:32,504 --> 02:00:34,097
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1412
02:00:34,132 --> 02:00:35,659
Secret Service have it, sir.

1413
02:00:35,694 --> 02:00:37,187
They've taken over the case.

1414
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:38,989
I bet there's a piece missing.

1415
02:00:41,907 --> 02:00:44,547
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine.

1416
02:00:45,299 --> 02:00:46,436
Not the poison.

1417
02:00:46,471 --> 02:00:48,645
Theres nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1418
02:00:49,164 --> 02:00:51,475
The wire free invention
was the game all along.

1419
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:53,843
And Adler was just the diversion.

1420
02:00:54,217 --> 02:00:55,492
He knew I'd chase after her,

1421
02:00:55,527 --> 02:00:57,364
thereby leaving the machine accessible.

1422
02:00:57,764 --> 02:01:00,771
The technology of that kind can
be worth an untold fortune.

1423
02:01:01,736 --> 02:01:03,769
Imagine being able to control
any device simply..

1424
02:01:03,804 --> 02:01:06,651
by sending a command via radio waves.

1425
02:01:07,783 --> 02:01:09,443
It's the future, Watson.

1426
02:01:12,835 --> 02:01:14,741
I've loaded the last
of your boxes, sir.

1427
02:01:18,487 --> 02:01:19,952
Well...
Well...

1428
02:01:21,121 --> 02:01:22,281
Gladston!

1429
02:01:22,316 --> 02:01:23,781
Stop him before he
gets to the front door.

1430
02:01:24,839 --> 02:01:26,303
Clarky?

1431
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,280
Case reopened.
