that I just don't want to know about.

467
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,348
And knowing this,

468
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,583
you wisely decide to keep it from me

469
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,957
as a favor to protect me
from unnecessary harm.

470
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,494
Now, should something like this develop

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,727
when you already bear
the burden of three secrets,

472
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,360

one of the older ones in

483

484
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,712

00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,499
And then we brainwash each other.

556
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,524
[laughs]

557
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,804
I've been wanting to try that.

558
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,269
Uh-huh.

559
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,400
[snickers]

561
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,282
this secret reserve of love in me.

[sighs]

563
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,115
l mean, this nonmonogamy,

564
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,645
it's clearly the path

565
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,386
to opening up our hidden
potential as human beings.

566
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,415
Right.

567
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,495
So?

568
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,657
Can I go on another date with him?

569
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,590
With who?

570
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:31,237
With my dirty, grimy,
filthy stowaway boyfriend?

571
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,011
That's better.

572
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,036
[children play distantly]

573
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,805
Can l?

574
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,008
Of course.

575
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,756
There is no scarcity of love in the world.

576
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,665
lt's almost heroic.

577
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,031
Egalitarian.

578
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,035
Even though Lou

579
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,468
still is the captain.

580
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:03,406
Now, is she on board for the
charting of these new waters?

581
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,408
Yeah, I mean,

582
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,002
she agrees
monogamy is death,

583
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,103
suffocation.

584
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,773
You know, honey,

585
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,874
when I asked your father
for an open marriage,

586
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,906
he agreed.

587
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,546
But, uh, if truth be known,

588
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,758
it wasn't really what he wanted.

589
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,760
Mom.

590
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,557
That was your way of ending things.

591
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,585
Maybe.

592
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,159
But like Communist Russia,

593
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,566
in theory it's great,

594
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,902
but in practice it gets kind of messy.

[unplugged electric guitar strums]

597
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,585
So you negotiate this with your primary?

598
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,065
Your captain?

599
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,430

lf you do want to be a top,

602
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,377
you have got to quit it
with that doe-eyed bottom act.

603
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,616
Are you really
into this rough sex thing?

604
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,641
l hate to break your illusions

605
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,153
about how rough it is,

606
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,385
but the problem with SM
is it's too fucking safe.

607
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,617
Safe?

608
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,684
Yeah.

609
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,161
This whole, "Oh, I'm so scared

610
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,530
you're going to do this thing
to me that I told you to do."

611
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,556
lt's boring.

612
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,268
So you don't want to play with me?

613
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,969
[sighs]

614
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,167
l think that you need
to learn a few things.

615
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,109
You really want me to hit you?

00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,775
l want you to take me somewhere.

619

620
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,781
it's fine.

621
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,482
But you can really turn that around

622
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,150
and just access

623
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,283
this hidden power.

624
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,423
I'm sorry; am I scaring you?

Oh!

636
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,156
Wouldn't it be cool

637
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:41,359
if we could just walk
into each other's lives one day?

638
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,493

went on vacation,

A seal named Charlie?

Guess again.

653
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,976
Mmm, a dolphin named Fred?

Guess again.

One day at a time, right?

You will have a cupcake party

This is all about agreements, right?

721
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,947
Of course.

722
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,045

No, Sassy.

725
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,257
lt is silly to worry about her.

kind of relationship.

Being a daddy isn't always easy.

No way.

00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:27,714
Right.

931
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,561
lt's just a phase.

932
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:34,158
lt will pass.

933
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:37,690
Right.

934
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:43,402
Well, got to go.

935
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,499
Val's waiting.

936
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:45,839
Got a date tonight.

937
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:47,902
Got to keep the old relationship spiced up.

938
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,312
You two aren't having troubles, are you?

939
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:52,806
No.
[laughs]

940
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:54,318
No, no, no, no, no.

941
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:55,319
[laughs]

942
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:56,320
No.

943
00:44:56,354 --> 00:44:57,844
Nothing like that.

944
00:45:00,558 --> 00:45:01,547
Toodles.

945
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:06,228
Yeah, to--toodle too.

946
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:08,821
[door clicks]

947
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:30,047
You know, you can go further.

948
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:32,750
l was just worried it was twisted.

949
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:36,526
l guess I'm twisted, then,
'cause I like it.

950
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:37,687
[laughs]

951
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:39,060
Did I do okay?

952
00:45:39,097 --> 00:45:42,692
l never played the grown-up part before.

953
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:43,701
[laughs]

954
00:45:43,735 --> 00:45:44,724
Yeah.

955
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:48,839
[laughs]

956
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:50,602
You just wait.

957
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:53,270
One of these days, I'm going
to kick your terrible ass.

958
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,278
[laughs]

959
00:45:54,312 --> 00:45:56,473
You're all right, Sandy Patterson.

960
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:59,711
(Lou )
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

961
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:03,710
l smell the blood of a fisherman.

962
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:04,722
l better get the hell out--

963
00:46:04,756 --> 00:46:06,917
No, let's keep playing.

964
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,220
Okay, we're on a role.

965
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:13,255
[whispers inaudibly]

966
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,322
[laughs]

967
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,838
You will do things for him.

968
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,105
You will polish his boots.

969
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:29,045
You will do his laundry

970
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,947
and the things like that.

971
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:37,014
Likewise, he will be good to you.

972
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,455
What if I don't want to?

973
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:41,686
Then you just must be
all the better to him.

974
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:43,216
And what if I'm bad?

975
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:45,161
(Lou )
Well, well, well.

976
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:48,227
Lookee here.

977
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:55,334
Daddy, I want you to meet my son,

978
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:59,104
which is your grandchild,

979
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,271
Micky Penny.

980
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:02,574
Sir.

981
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,377
So this is the kid.

982
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:07,851
Well, put him in a box.

983
00:47:07,886 --> 00:47:08,511
What?

984
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,611
A box.

985
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:10,621
What?

986
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:12,247
You heard me; a box.

987
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,019
Haven't we got some sort
of a box around here

988
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:15,116
that we can put him in?

989
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,086
ls this okay with you, Micky?

990
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,561
Yeah, I'm into it.

991
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,723
Ah, here's just the thing.

992
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:21,754
clunk!

993
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:26,029
And an old fishing net...

994
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,037
[inhales]

995
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:29,437
Smelling only slightly of shrimp shit.

996
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,442
[laughs]

997
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:33,239
Yeah, that's nice and secure.

998
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,411
Are you okay, my baby boy?

999
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:38,779
[laughs]
Yeah, I'm having fun.

1000
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:39,976
Sassy my lassie,

1001
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:42,452
come sit on Daddy's knee and tell me

1002
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,478
how you were united with your son tonight.

1003
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:47,953
l thought you didn't want
to hear about it, Daddy.

1004
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,721
Oh, no, it's fine.

1005
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:52,355
l want to hear all about your exciting night.

1006
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:56,295
lt was no big deal.

1007
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:57,528
No big deal.

1008
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:58,536
Look at him over there,

1009
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,798
all tied up.

1010
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:01,600
You want to tell me it was no big deal

1011
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:02,901
in front of his face?

1012
00:48:06,411 --> 00:48:09,710
Well, we--it was that-- um, there was--

1013
00:48:09,747 --> 00:48:13,581
Micky was a bad, bad boy,

1014
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:16,712
and so I had to punish him.

1015
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:20,485
And then there was-- there was that part,

1016
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,390
and we just came home.

1017
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,994
Well, then, let's do away with him.

1018
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:28,089
[gasps]

1019
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:29,326
You don't mean...

1020
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:32,163
Throw him overboard.

1021
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:33,966
Make him walk the plank.

1022
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:35,734
Send him to a watery grave.

1023
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:37,172
No!

1024
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,904
Oh, you mustn't hurt my son.

1025
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:44,347
l have two beams of light
coming out of my heart,

1026
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,249
one for you and one for him.

1027
00:48:50,355 --> 00:48:53,085
You don't want me anymore,
do you, Sassafras?

1028
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:56,690
Make me choose at this moment?

1029
00:48:57,595 --> 00:48:58,562
[groans]

1030
00:48:58,596 --> 00:49:00,655
You will regret it.

1031
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,706
[rapid surf pounding]

1032
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:15,974
[bird cries]

1033
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:26,421
(Lou)
The one thing about not knowing
your compass is broken--

1034
00:49:26,457 --> 00:49:28,391
at least you don't know that you're lost.

1035
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:32,730
[rock music]

1036
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,039
(Consuelo Emerson)
# Say, "Hey, hello." #

1037
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:51,114
# Say "Hello." #

1038
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:54,084
# Take it real slow. #

1039
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,484
# And talk and talk and talk and talk #

1040
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:59,081
# and interrogate my mind. #

1041
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:04,561
# And I will unwind. #

1042
00:50:04,595 --> 00:50:13,094
# And I will unwin-n-n-nd. #

1043
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:14,502
# Make it dark. #

1044
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:18,236
# Make it bad. #

00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,210
# Keep it fresh. #

1046
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:22,974
# Give me everything you have. #

1047
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:25,812
# Tell me everything you want #

1048
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,182
# and what you feel inside. #

1049
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:33,486
# And I will subside. #

1050
00:50:33,524 --> 00:50:40,692
# Then I will confide. #

1051
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:45,398
# Lay, lay me down. #

1052
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:49,602
# Drive it slow and hard. #

1053
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,370
# Take me underground. #

1054
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,607
# Hey, lay me down. #

1055
00:50:57,915 --> 00:50:59,678
# Take me under. #

1056
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:02,185

00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:24,165
# You can try and hide. #

1060
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:29,373
# I want to give. #

1061
00:51:29,414 --> 00:51:31,314

# Make you long, girl, #

# till I satisfy. #

1064
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,721
Louie, honey, get real here.

1065
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:49,197
You know, to me, you're more than a friend.

1066
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,326
l don't want to be rude,

1067
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:54,634
but it seems like you're under
a lot of pressure to save face.

1068
00:51:56,507 --> 00:51:58,600
And Sassafras has her hot new thing,

1069
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:01,669
and you don't want to be left behind.

1070
00:52:01,712 --> 00:52:02,736
l can understand that.

1071
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,611
You know, it's not like that.

1072
00:52:04,649 --> 00:52:07,174
Louie, I am being a friend to you now.

1073
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,084
This situation really sucks for you.

1074
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:14,091
Yeah, well, I'm not ready
to give up on it yet.

1075
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:19,354
Do you know why this works when it works?

1076
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:20,364
[laughs]

1077
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:21,990
I'm sure
l have no idea.

1078
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:24,365
Brutal honesty.

1079
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:25,664
l never lied.

1080
00:52:25,703 --> 00:52:27,534
Not to her.

1081
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:29,199
But what about to yourself?

1082
00:52:30,842 --> 00:52:31,934
Ah, shit.

1083
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:36,904
Do something to take care of yourself,
all right?

1084
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:39,712
You're a good kid.

1085
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,217
l like you.

1086
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:43,980
[laughs]

1087
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:45,545
Aw, shucks.

1088
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,058
You're a good little pup too.

1089
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,491
Ruff-ruff.

1090
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:52,561
Very obedient.

( Ginny )
Bridget, would you please speed up the tempo?

1092
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:03,064
(Bridget)
Well, why don't you come in
when you're supposed to?

1093
00:53:03,107 --> 00:53:04,472
[laughs]
l did come in when I was--

1094
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:05,476
No, you did not.

1095
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,306
Yes, I did.

1096
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:07,333
No, you did not.

1097
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:08,470
Yes, I did; l wrote the song.

1098
00:53:08,513 --> 00:53:09,377
Yeah, you should know when you come in,

1099
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:10,277
and that wasn't it.

1100
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:11,303
That's my point.

1101
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,782
Oh, I'm gonna--uh.

1102
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,375
Fine, let's just do this again.

1103
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:15,385
One more time.

1104
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:17,046
Let's do this 100 times.

1105
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:19,283
Fine, till you get it right.

1106
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:20,290
Fine; l don't care.

1107
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:21,018
I'm ready.

1108
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:22,491
Fine; fine.

1109
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,085
Well, you're not coming in
