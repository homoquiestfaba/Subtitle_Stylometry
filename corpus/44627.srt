1
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:30,115
'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...

2
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:33,076
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

3
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,912
For the story that you
are about to be told...

4
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,957
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

5
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:42,461
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

6
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:46,673
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!

7
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,816
Boys and girls
of every age

8
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,652
Wouldn't you like to see
something strange

9
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,530
Come with us
and you will see

10
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:13,367
This our town
of Halloween

11
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,244
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

12
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,122
Pumpkins scream
in the dead of night

13
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,000
This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene

14
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,920
Trick-or-treat till the
neighbor's gonna die of fright

15
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,756
It's our town
Everybody scream

16
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,133
In this town of Halloween

17
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,803
I am the one hiding
under your bed

18
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,764
Teeth ground sharp
and eyes glowing red

19
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:38,600
I am the one hiding
under your stairs

20
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,645
Fingers like snakes
and spiders in my hair

21
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:44,481
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

22
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,401
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

23
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,655
In this town we call home

24
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,491
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

25
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:57,452
In this town
Don't we love it now

26
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,330
Everybody's waiting
for the next surprise

27
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:03,166
'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can

28
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,670
- Something's waiting now
to pounce and how you'll
- Scream

29
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,006
- This is Halloween
- Red and black
- And slimy green

30
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,758
- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine

31
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,720
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

32
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,556
Ride with the moon
in the dead of night

33
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:20,642
Everybody scream
Everybody scream

34
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,686
In our town of Halloween

35
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,522
I am the clown
with a tear-away face

36
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,358
Here in a flash
and gone without a trace

37
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:31,278
I am the who
when you call who's there

38
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,156
I am the wind blowing
through your hair

39
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,992
I am the shadow
on the moon at night

40
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:39,786
Filling your dreams
to the brim with fright

41
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:42,748
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

42
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,625
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

43
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,340
Tender lumplings everywhere

44
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,343
Life's no fun
without a good scare

45
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,179
- That's our job
- But we're not mean

46
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:00,057
In our town of Halloween

47
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,934
In this town
Don't we love it now

48
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,771
Everyone's waiting
for the next surprise

49
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,315
Skeleton Jack
might catch you in the back

50
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:11,777
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin

51
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,154
This is Halloween
Everybody scream

52
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,240
Won't you please make way
for a very special guy

53
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:20,118
Our man Jack is king
of the pumpkin patch

54
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,996
Everyone hail
to the Pumpkin King now

55
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,957
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

56
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,835
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,131
In this town we call home

58
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:36,009
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

59
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,679
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

60
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:41,765
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

61
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,184
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

62
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,521
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee

63
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,869
- It's over!
- We did it!

64
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,456
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

65
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,750
Great Halloween, everybody.

66
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:13,380
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

67
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:15,424
No! Thanks to you, Jack.

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,551
Without your
brilliant leadership--

69
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,555
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.

70
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:26,601
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.

71
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:31,064
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

72
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:36,194
- The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!

73
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:40,907
- You're not ready
for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!

74
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:44,119
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!

75
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:50,667
Come back here, you foolish--

76
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,253
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.

77
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,091
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

78
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:02,220
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!

79
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:07,309
Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.

80
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:10,270
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

81
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:13,148
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

82
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,485
Our second and
honorable mention...

83
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:20,322
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.

84
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,165
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

85
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,460
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...

86
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,463
and the year before that,
and the year before that.

87
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:21,299
There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best

88
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:25,595
For my talents
are renowned far and wide

89
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:30,017
When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night

90
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:34,187
I excel without ever even trying

91
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,481
With the slightest little effort

92
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,775
Of my ghost-like charms

93
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:42,988
I have seen grown men
give out a shriek

94
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:47,534
With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan

95
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:51,872
I have swept the very bravest
off their feet

96
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,791
Yet year after year

97
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,461
It's the same routine

98
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:02,466
And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams

99
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:07,429
And l, Jack
the Pumpkin King

100
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:13,018
Have grown so tired
of the same old thing

101
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,899
Oh, somewhere deep

102
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,943
Inside of these bones

103
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,030
An emptiness

104
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:28,033
Began to grow

105
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,620
There's something out there

106
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:34,289
Far from my home

107
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,751
A longing that

108
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,006
I've never known

109
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,677
I'm the master of fright

110
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,679
And a demon of light

111
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:53,016
And I'll scare you
right out of your pants

112
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:57,521
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky

113
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:01,733
And I'm known throughout
England and France

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,071
And since I am dead
I can take off my head

115
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:10,367
To recite Shakespearean quotations

116
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:14,996
No animal nor man
can scream like I can

117
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:19,376
With the fury
of my recitations

118
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:22,212
But who here

119
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,631
Would ever understand

120
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:29,636
That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin

121
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:34,808
Would tire of his crown
lf they only understood

122
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,144
He'd give it all up

123
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,399
If he only could

124
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:45,819
Oh, there's an empty

125
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:48,530
Place in my bones

126
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,616
That calls out for

127
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:54,703
Something unknown

128
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,873
The fame and praise

129
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,876
Come year after year

130
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:04,880
Does nothing for

131
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:10,844
These empty tears

132
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,227
Jack.

133
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,189
I know how you feel.

134
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,629
Sally!

135
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,966
You've come back.

136
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:53,804
- I had to.
- For this!

137
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,685
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?

138
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:15,992
That's twice this month
you've slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off.

139
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,037
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!

140
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:23,458
I made you with my own hands.

141
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,294
You can make other creations.

142
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,172
I'm restless. I can't help it.

143
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,801
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

144
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:36,471
We need to be patient, that's all.

145
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:39,224
But I don't want to be patient.

146
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,521
No, Zero, not now.

147
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,232
I'm not in the mood.

148
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:52,070
All right.

149
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,364
Here you go, boy.

150
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,802
Mornin', gents!

151
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:39,993
Jack, you home?

152
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:52,964
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

153
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:57,177
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

154
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:00,555
Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.

155
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:04,184
I can't make decisions by myself.

156
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:07,229
Jack, answer me!

157
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:14,194
- Huh?
- He's not home.

158
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,406
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

159
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,544
Where are we?

160
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,302
It's someplace new!

161
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,521
What is this?

162
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:36,443
Whoa-oa-oa!

163
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:43,617
Whoa!

164
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:29,621
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere

165
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,832
What's this
There's white things in the air

166
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,543
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming

167
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,628
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this

168
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:42,217
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong

169
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:45,053
What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this

170
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,557
The streets are lined
with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy

171
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:51,810
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this

172
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:54,855
What's this

173
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:57,691
There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads

174
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:00,777
They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead

175
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:03,822
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes

176
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,824
And in my bones
I feel the warmth

177
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:09,870
That's coming from inside

178
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,831
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe

179
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:15,751
They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired

180
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,753
They're gathering around
to hear a story

181
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,589
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this

182
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:26,261
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer

183
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,221
And who would ever think
And why

184
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:30,223
They're covering it
with tiny little things

185
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,393
They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone

186
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,271
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun

187
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,857
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this

188
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:44,112
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep

189
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,239
But look
There's nothing underneath

190
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,368
No ghouls, no witches here
to scream and scare them or ensnare them

191
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:54,873
Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland

192
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,837
What's this

193
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,715
The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found

194
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,677
And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around

195
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:09,513
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air

196
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:15,185
The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

197
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:18,939
The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around

198
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,108
I've never felt so good before

199
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:24,820
This empty place
inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

200
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:27,447
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own

201
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:30,909
I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found

202
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:33,829
What is this

203
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,461
Christmas Town?

204
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,296
Hmm.

205
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,967
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

206
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:50,971
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

207
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,556
Hmm.

208
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:55,308
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

209
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,561
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

210
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,689
Stand aside. Coming through.

211
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:09,114
We've got to find Jack!

212
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:13,326
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

213
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,287
Three sixty-four!

214
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:18,832
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

215
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,418
I looked in every mausoleum.

216
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,503
We opened the sarcophagi!

217
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,423
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

218
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,301
I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.

219
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:31,887
I did! But he wasn't there.

220
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:34,723
It's time to sound the alarms!

221
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,381
Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.

222
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,474
Bitter!

223
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:22,562
Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?

224
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:27,150
Sally? ls that soup ready yet?

225
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,405
Ah. Coming!

226
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,248
Lunch!

227
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,794
Ah, what's that?

228
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,840
Worm's wart! Mmm!

229
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,676
And frog's breath?

230
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:56,930
Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought
you liked frog's breath.

231
00:18:57,097 --> 00:19:00,600
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

232
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:05,522
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

233
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,442
I'm not hungry. Oops.

234
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:12,029
You want me to starve...

235
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:16,950
an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

236
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:21,038
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

237
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:23,790
Oh, don't be silly.

238
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:30,005
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!

239
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:42,100
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

240
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,728
Oh, this morning.

241
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:50,275
- Hear that?
- Ah, what?
- Shh.

242
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,154
Zero!

243
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:59,242
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!

244
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,840
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll
tell everyone all about it.

245
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,885
- When?
- Immediately!

246
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:26,853
Town meeting! Town meeting!

247
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,441
Town meeting tonight!

248
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:36,947
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!

249
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:57,384
Listen, everyone!

250
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,388
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

251
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,894
There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed

252
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:11,440
All around things
to tantalize my brain

253
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,901
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen

254
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:18,405
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe

255
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:21,950
Like a most improbable dream

256
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:25,454
But you must believe
when I tell you this

257
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,959
It's as real as my skull
and it does exist

258
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:34,004
Here, let me show you.

259
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:38,091
Ooh!

260
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,719
This is a thing
called a present

261
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:42,763
The whole thing
starts with a box

262
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,349
- A box
- Is it steel
- Are there locks

263
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:48,810
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox

264
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:50,270
If you please.

265
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:52,981
Just a box with
bright colored paper

266
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:55,650
And the whole thing's
topped with a bow

267
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:59,071
- A bow
- But why
- How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it

268
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:00,864
That's the point of the thing
Not to know

269
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,575
- It's a bat
- Will it bend
- It's a rat
- Will it break

270
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:06,411
Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake

271
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,955
Listen now
You don't understand

272
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:12,626
That's not the point
of Christmasland

273
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:16,505
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock

274
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:19,257
And hang it like this
on the wall

275
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:21,259
Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot

276
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:24,513
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook

277
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,223
Um, let me explain.

278
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,101
There's no foot inside
but there's candy

279
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,645
- Or sometimes it's filled
with small toys
- Small toys

280
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:34,022
- Do they bite
- Do they snap
- Or explode in the sack

281
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:36,858
Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys

282
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,486
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun

283
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:42,322
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

284
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,825
Everyone, please
Now not so fast

285
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,994
There's something here
that you don't quite grasp

286
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,414
I don't know.
Do you get it?

287
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,750
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

288
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:57,546
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last

289
00:22:57,713 --> 00:23:01,008
For the ruler
of this Christmasland

290
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:04,553
Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice

291
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,015
Least, that's what
I've come to understand

292
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,518
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold

293
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:15,022
Like a lobster huge and red

294
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:18,567
When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on

295
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:22,070
Carting bulging sacks
with his big great arms

296
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:25,449
That is so I've heard it said

297
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:29,286
And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight

298
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:34,791
He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky

299
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,378
And they call him

300
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:43,592
Sandy Claws

301
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:50,223
Well, at least they're excited

302
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,893
But they don't understand

303
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,564
That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland

304
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,567
Oh, well.

305
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,245
Hmm.

306
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,713
Hmm.

307
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:37,896
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

308
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:55,038
You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.

309
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:06,883
Oh, my head!

310
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,223
The door is open!

311
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,144
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!

312
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,232
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some
equipment.

313
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,986
Is that so? Whatever for?

314
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:29,531
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

315
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:32,659
How perfectly marvelous!

316
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:36,997
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

317
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:41,168
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

318
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,879
Hmm. Experiments?

319
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:49,468
Zero, I'm home!

320
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:58,495
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?

321
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,058
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

322
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,519
Sally?

323
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,145
Sally?

324
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:50,440
Oh, gone again!

325
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,623
Hmm.

326
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,673
Oh!

327
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:23,075
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

328
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:28,121
Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back

329
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,335
He's all alone up there
locked away inside

330
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:38,632
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died

331
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,635
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

332
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:52,979
Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull

333
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:56,066
Will it let me be
I cannot tell

334
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:59,236
There's so many things
I cannot grasp

335
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:02,364
When I think I've got it
and then at last

336
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,492
Through my bony fingers
it does slip

337
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,203
Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip

338
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,915
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting

339
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:15,460
Like a memory
long since past

340
00:31:15,627 --> 00:31:17,504
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash

341
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:20,966
What does it mean
What does it mean

342
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,344
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked

343
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:28,765
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

344
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:32,686
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door

345
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:38,108
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see

346
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:40,861
What does it mean
What does it mean

347
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:43,697
What does it mean

348
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:48,952
Hmm. Hmm.

349
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,913
I've read these Christmas books
so many times

350
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,042
I know the stories
and I know the rhymes

351
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:58,128
I know the Christmas carols
all by heart

352
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:01,465
My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart

353
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,509
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong

354
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:07,554
It's so hard to put
my bony finger on

355
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:11,141
Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think

356
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:14,478
Am I trying much too hard

357
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,438
Of course
I've been too close to see

358
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:19,816
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

359
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:23,612
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air

360
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:27,240
Invisible but everywhere

361
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:31,745
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

362
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:35,374
You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems

363
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,835
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone

364
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:42,673
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree

365
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,134
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime

366
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:51,640
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do

367
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,144
Eureka!

368
00:32:56,311 --> 00:33:00,899
This year,
Christmas will be ours!

369
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:10,659
Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.

370
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,872
Dr. Beetlestein.

371
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,959
Your Christmas assignment
is ready.

372
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:25,549
Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.

373
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,140
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

374
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,976
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!

375
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:37,853
I knew it!

376
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,523
Doctor, thank you for coming.

377
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,067
We need some of these.

378
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,319
Hmm.

379
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:49,990
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

380
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:53,493
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

381
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,204
No! How jolly!

382
00:33:56,371 --> 00:34:00,250
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

383
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:06,173
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

384
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,300
- Specifically.
- By name.

385
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:11,053
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.

386
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,140
Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.

387
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:19,728
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick or treaters.

388
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:23,190
The job I have for you
is top secret.

389
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:26,193
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

390
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,446
And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.

391
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:34,785
Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!

392
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,661
Now.

393
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:41,041
Tree.

394
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:44,711
Christmas Town.

395
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,382
Ow! Hmm.

396
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,884
And one more thing.

397
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:54,471
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

398
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:56,223
Whatever you say, Jack.

399
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,394
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

400
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,374
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

401
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:27,504
- I wanna do it
- Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together

402
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,923
- Three of a kind
- Birds of a feather
- Now and forever

403
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,719
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

404
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:37,097
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

405
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:40,726
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight

406
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:44,229
Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights

407
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:47,774
First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait

408
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:51,278
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

409
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:54,573
Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man

410
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,243
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

411
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,705
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box

412
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:05,208
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks

413
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:10,464
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man

414
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,925
Can take the whole thing
over then

415
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:17,304
He'll be so pleased I do declare

416
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:20,223
That he will cook him rare
Whee

417
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,816
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then

418
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:33,487
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

419
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:36,907
You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up
to smithereens

420
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:40,327
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green

421
00:36:40,494 --> 00:36:43,705
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag

422
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:46,792
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

423
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:50,837
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around

424
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:56,051
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town

425
00:36:57,803 --> 00:37:01,264
He'll be so pleased
by our success

426
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:04,768
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet

427
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:08,188
Perhaps he'll make
his special brew

428
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:10,107
Of snake and spider stew

429
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:13,443
We're his little henchmen
and we take our job with pride

430
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,988
We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side

431
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:19,741
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one

432
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,535
- You're no fun
- Shut up
- Make me

433
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:24,913
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see

434
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,542
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read

435
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,878
Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity

436
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:35,590
Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three

437
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:38,927
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick

438
00:37:39,094 --> 00:37:42,556
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick

439
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:46,018
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits

440
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,563
Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks

441
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,066
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see

442
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:56,695
Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key

443
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,455
Sandy Claws, huh?

444
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:15,589
It goes something like this.

445
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:23,347
How about it?
Think you can manage?

446
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,849
A-one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a--

447
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,360
- Next!
- Fantastic!

448
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:40,280
Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.

449
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,867
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

450
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:47,079
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

451
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:50,791
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

452
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:55,003
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.

453
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,715
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.

454
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:04,429
And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

455
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:08,058
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.

456
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:11,395
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

457
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,605
This part's red.
The trim is white.

458
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:17,067
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

459
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:19,903
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

460
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,655
- Next!
- I have...

461
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:23,907
- Oh.
- every confidence in you.

462
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:28,578
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

463
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:31,456
This device
is called a nutcracker.

464
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:34,167
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!

465
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:37,462
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!

466
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,926
That's not Sandy Claws!

467
00:39:43,093 --> 00:39:45,429
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
