00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,729
Hey, everyone,
it's Bobby Leiber,

3
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,597
and welcome to
your favorite podcast,

4
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,431
<i>The 11th Brick at Stonewall.</i>

5
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,100
Because we all know
a butch lesbian

6
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,434
or a trans woman of color

7
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,370
probably threw the first brick
at Stonewall,

8
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,507
but it was a cis, white, gay
man who threw the 11th brick.

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,276
And today, as always,
I will take you on a journey

10
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,312
throughout LGBTQ+ history
and, much more importantly,

11
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,081
my own problems and whatever
I feel like talking about.

12
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,183
And this is a big day,
because, as of today,

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,321
<i>The 11th Brick</i> is celebrating
one million subscribers.

14
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,290
And in honor of
all this exciting news,

15
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,492
I am taking your questions live.

16
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,427
-First question.
-FEMALE CALLER: Hi, Bobby.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,296
Any chance for
more children's books?

18
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,164
Oh, not at the moment,
but thank you.

19
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,300
As some of you know, I wrote
a series of children's books

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,770
to help parents teach kids
about gay history,

21
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,304
which no one bought.

22
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,606
Turns out a four-year-old
didn't want to hear

23
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,841
a bedtime story about
Martina Navratilova.

24
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,877
Hey, parents, thanks for
teaching your kids about

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,278
Santa Claus, a straight man
that doesn't exist,

26
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,248
and not Martina Navratilova,
a lesbian who does.

27
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,184
In other news, I finally got
the footage from my audition

28
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,186
to be part of the next cast
of <i>Queer Eye,</i>

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,189
and you can watch that
on the app right now.

30
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,491
(hosts gasping)

31
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,493
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my...

32
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,597
(hosts crying)

33
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm sorry. This is not sad.

34
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,434
It's just not sad.

35
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,537
You gave him a haircut
and a pair of pants.

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,872
I mean, he looks fine.

37
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,674
-Not great.
<i>-Next caller.</i>

38
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,610
MALE CALLER: What ever happened
to that movie you wrote?

39
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,143
Oh, yeah. The movie.

40
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,646
These big movie producers
came to me and said,

41
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,481
<i>"We want you to write a rom-com</i>
<i>about a gay couple.</i>

42
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,316
<i>"Something the whole world</i>
<i>would enjoy.</i>

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,885
<i>"Something that a straight guy</i>
<i>might even like</i>

44
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,654

<i>I said,</i>

45
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,322
<i>"Something a straight guy</i>

46
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,257
<i>"Am I gonna be in the middle</i>

47
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,326
<i>"and then all of a sudden</i>
<i>fall in love with Ice Cube?</i>

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>"Am I gonna get butt-fucked</i>
<i>by Jason Momoa</i>

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,733
<i>while we're both, I don't know,</i>
<i>worrying about a volcano?"</i>

50
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,301
<i>And he said, "Bobby,</i>
<i>we just want to make a movie</i>

51
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,204
<i>"that shows the world</i>
<i>gay and straight relationships</i>

52
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,305
<i>"are the same.</i>

53
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,340
<i>Love is love is love."</i>

54
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,175
<i>I said, "Love is love is love?</i>

55
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,678
<i>"No, it's not. That's bullshit.</i>

56
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,279
<i>"That is a lie we had to</i>

57
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,915
<i>"to finally treat us fairly.</i>

58
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>"Love is not love.</i>

59
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,518
<i>"Our relationships</i>

60
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,352
<i>Our sex lives are different."</i>

61
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,921
<i>And he said, "Bobby,</i>
<i>we were just trying to make</i>

62
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,390
<i>a nice movie</i>
<i>about nice gay people."</i>

63
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,860
<i>And I said, "Well,</i>
<i>there's your first mistake,</i>

64
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,596
<i>because not all gay people</i>
<i>are nice."</i>

65
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,797
<i>And I got up and left.</i>

66
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,364
<i>Anyway, it's totally fine.</i>

67
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,867
I'm not the right person
to write a rom-com anyway.

68
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,834
MALE CALLER:
Why not?

69
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,469
Um, I don't know.

70
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,406
I mean, I'm 40 years old.
I've never been in love.

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,942
I've never even had a serious
relationship, which is fine.

72
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,744
You know, I love my life.
I love my freedom.

73
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:59,614
I love my independence,
but, (chuckles) you know,

74
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,214
probably means
I'm not the right person

75
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,550
to write a love story.

76
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,419
In exciting news,
I remain very horny,

77
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,356
and tonight I am being honored
at the LGBTQ+ Pride Awards.

78
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,592
-(applause)
-(band playing fanfare)

79
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,564
Being in the NFL, I never
thought I could come out.

80
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,802
For years, I had to suffer
as a hot, ripped, gay person,

81
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,369
living my life in private.

82
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,806
But this last year
has really shown me

83
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:29,711
how amazing life can be when
you are finally publicly hot.

84
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,478
-(cheering, applause)
-(fanfare playing)

85
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,580
Thank you.

86
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,682
ANNOUNCER (over speakers):
And now, please welcome

87
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,719
Emmy and Tony Award winner
Kristin Chenoweth.

88
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,319
Good evening.

89
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,723
What an honor for me
to be here tonight.

90
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:45,760
On my head is a hat
depicting the Stonewall riots,

91
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,462
where the queer liberation
movement began.

92
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:53,501
And now, the award for cis,
white, gay man of the year.

93
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,337
Please welcome Bobby Leiber.

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,873
-(cheering, applause)
-Thank you.

95
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,007
Oh, my goodness.

96
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,677
Thank you, New York! Thank you!

97
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,312
Thank you.

98
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,881
Meet Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum,

99
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,050
the Bert and Ernie
of Ancient Egypt.

100
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,686
Many scholars believe
that they are

101
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,956
the first recorded
same-sex couple in history.

102
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,692
Yet to this day,
there are historians

103
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,528
who refuse to believe
that these men were lovers

104
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,730
and insist that
they were brothers instead.

105
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:27,034
Thus began 5,000 years
of queer love stories

106
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,636
erased from the history books.

107
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,005
No gay love stories
to teach us about love

108
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,573
and how to love each other.

109
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:36,511
Well, I'm happy to say
this erasure ends today.

110
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,479
And I am thrilled to announce
I have accepted a position

111
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,916

I'm sorry, you guys.
I have to go.

173
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,620
A late shift at the bar.

174
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,055
But it was great
meeting you guys.

175
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,590
-LUCAS: Nice to meet you.
-And congratulations, boys.

176
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,891
-LUCAS: Thank you.
-Bye, Marty.

177
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,293
-See you later. Text us.
-Bye, y'all.

178
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,694
Wait, so what's happening?

179
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,129
Didn't you guys have
an announcement?

180
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,265
Okay, uh, so, I totally know
this is a little weird

181
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,868
and unexpected,
but the reason we've been

182
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,170
hanging around with Marty
so much is that

183
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:27,274
we are kind of dating him.

184
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,275
-Oh.
-Okay.

185
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,710
Wait a second.

186
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,278
-Wait, wait, wait.
-(laughter)

187
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,813
What do you mean
you're dating him?

188
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,982
I mean, together,
like, as a couple.

189
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,317
We're seeing him.

190
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,286
I guess it's kind of like
a throuple situation.

191
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,888
-(laughter)
-BOBBY: Hold on.

192
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,990
So, wait, what does
that mean exactly?

193
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,559
Like, are you guys just having
threesomes or something?

194
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,795
Well, we hooked up,
but then we started spending

195
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,330
a bunch of time together after.

196
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,132
It turns out
we have a lot in common.

197
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,167
It's more than just sex.
We genuinely like each other.

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,569
-(laughs) -Wait, wait. So, how
long has this been going on?

199
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,904
-Six months?
-Oh.

200
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,606
Six mon-- You're in a throuple
for six months

201
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,807
and you didn't tell me?

202
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,642
We didn't know
it'd get that serious.

203
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,210
How serious is it gonna get?
You're in a throuple.

204
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,212
What are you gonna do next,
tell your grandparents?

205
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:06,647
Hi, Grandma.

206
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,149
Oh, hi, honey.

207
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,751
-I have some news.
-Yes?

208
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,853
Peter and I are jointly fucking
a third person!

209
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,255
(shouts happily)

210
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,956
Oh, my goodness!

211
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,792
It's Paul.

212
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,227
He and Peter are
jointly fucking someone else!

213
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,229
Oh, how wonderful.
It's a throuple.

214
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,697
-Oh.
-(laughs)

215
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,032
-(laughter)
-We'll be fine.

216
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,068
We really trust each other
enough to do this.

217
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,235
BOBBY:
Just be careful.

218
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,270
I know a lot of guys
who've done this,

219
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,805
and it's a slippery slope.

220
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,073
These things are fragile,
and, you know, we're men.

221
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,942
Okay? Men dating men.
Love is not love.

222
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,745
We are horny and selfish
and stupid. I am, too.

223
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,914
Yeah, someone called into my
show the other day and asked me

224
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,949
why I'm still single.
I said, "You want to know why?

225
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,684
"Because I've been gay
my whole life,

226
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,686
and I don't trust
these gay motherfuckers."

227
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,688
I support them,
but I don't trust them.

228
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,224
-And are you happy?
-Who's so happy all the time?

229
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,692
Uh, a lot of people.

230
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,260
Well, I really don't trust
those people.

231
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,695
-(laughter)
-Mr. Leiber?

232
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,996
Sorry. I love your podcast.

233
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,265
-Can I, can I get a selfie?
-Oh, sure.

234
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,967

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,235
Thank you.

236
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,803
-(phone dings)
-Mm-hmm. -BOBBY: Shit.

237
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,705
I told Henry I'd meet him
at this launch party.

238
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,141
Ugh, I wanted to go home
and change first.

239
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,376
Aren't you guys just gonna take
your shirts off anyway?

240
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,712
No, we're not just gonna
take our shirts off.

241
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,214
It's not 2003.

242
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,983
You have a very clichéd view
of what gay men do at a party.

-Oh, I'd use that.

Bobby, I had sex
with a 65-year-old.

252
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,741
Sixty-five?

253
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,743
He didn't have an age
on his profile.

254
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,412
He was really nice,
he had an amazing body,

255
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:47,248
but he had this, like,
big, white beard.

256
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,016
I felt like Mrs. Claus.

257
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,751

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,335

-Oh.

267
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,308

270
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,212
Fair enough.

271
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,780
It was honestly kind of boring.

00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,116

This is Bobby.

276
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,822
Do you boys need another drink?

277
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,991
-I'm getting a shitrocket.
-What the hell's a shitrocket?

278
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,960
It's like a Red Bull
but with protein.

279
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:33,894
Oh.

280
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,930
Shitrocket and vodka, I guess.

281
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,065
Move, boys. Daddy needs a drink.

282
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,833
Thank you.

283
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,106
(Aaron sighs)

284
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,475
You look angry.

285
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,110
Me?

286
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,312
Well, I'm not.

287
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,980
That's just the way I look.

288
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,082
I know. People always come up
to me and tell me that,

289
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,117
but I'm not.

290
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,687
I'm not angry.

291
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,121
I listen to your podcast.

292
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,456
Oh, really?

293
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,058
Oh, that's cool.

294
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,761
I hear you're boring.

295
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,463
Who said that? I'm not boring.

296
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,232
I don't know.

297
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,399

298
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,101
Cool.

299
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,105
I'm sorry. That was mean.

300
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,175
I'm very bad at flirting.

301
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,811
And I'm also the type of person
who tells you I'm flirting,

302
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,513
which is so sexy.

303
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,348
It's okay.

304
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,851
What do you do?

305
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,520
Uh, for work?

306
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,922
I do probate law.
I'm an estate planner.

-Do you like it?
-Oh, sure.

309
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,562
When I was a kid,
first thing I would think

310
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,096
when I would meet someone is,
"Who's that person

311
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,198
gonna leave their shit to
when they die?"

312
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,202

the legal logistics of that.

00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:48,883
That is old-fashioned,

521
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,417
heteronormative nonsense.

522
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,619
We need to get people
to rethink history

523
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,621
through a queer prism,
not comfort them

524
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,556
with another
fucking gay wedding, all right?

525
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,424
It's a museum.
It's not <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

526
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,458
-Ooh, I like <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>
-But I--

527
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,761
Oh, I love <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

528
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,495
-That show has layers.
-BOBBY: All right.

529
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,764
Everyone loves <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>
Great. Okay.

530
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,332
That's who you remind me of.
Eugene Levy.

Yes.

00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,302
Okay, Mr. Funk.

533
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,371
How can I help you today?

534
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,306
I need to adjust my will.

535
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,042
Okay. Can I ask you why?

536
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,744
Because I'm dying.

537
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:17,979
I have cancer.

538
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,514
I'm so sorry to hear that.

539
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,449
I just need to figure out
where my money's going.

540
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,052
Okay, uh, do you have
a partner or spouse?

541
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:26,788
No and no.

542
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:27,922

-No.

-Not anymore.

Okay, um...

546
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,764
well, uh, sometimes it helps
to close your eyes

547
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,501
and think about who means
the most to you in the world.

548
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,073
Uh, who is it?

549
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,075
Cher.

550
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:53,080
Okay, so you want
to leave $100,000...

551
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,549
to Cher?

552
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:57,384
Do you really think
that she needs that?

553
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,554
She has a huge staff.

554
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:00,822
-Uh, okay.

Mrs. Bailey passed away.

like ten years ago.

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

627
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,497
What's your favorite movie

628
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,233
What's my favorite movie
of all time?

629
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,501
I don't know.

630
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,136
Why? What's your favorite movie?

631
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,838
<i>The Hangover.</i>

632
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:33,841
<i>The Hangover</i> is your favorite
movie of all time?

633
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,743
How many movies have you seen?
One?

634
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,878
-It's a funny movie.
-Yeah, kinda.

635
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,281
And you remember one of
the first lines of that movie?

636
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,116
"Paging Dr. Faggot."

637
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,617
-Remember that?
-Yes.

638
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,252
"Paging Dr. Faggot"
is one of the first lines

639
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,121
of the highest-grossing comedy
of 2009,

640
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,556
and-and no one talks about it.

641
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,124
Right?
And it wasn't that long ago.

642
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,892
You know, we're just supposed
to, like, laugh it off.

643
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:54,762
It doesn't bother me.
I'm not sensitive like that.

644
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,697
I think you just like
getting angry at things.

645
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,699
Getting angry at things
is, like, your brand.

646
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,569
What?! No, it's not! Fuck you!

647
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,137
Getting angry at things
is my brand?

648
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,605
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

649
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:05,873
You just don't like
to complain about it

650
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,274
because that means
your feelings were hurt,

651
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:08,609
and that means
admitting you're weak.

652
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,877
And that's too vulnerable.

653
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,645
And as much as
we go around saying

654
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,247
men should be vulnerable,
you and I both know

655
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,648
that is such bullshit.

656
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,083
Because for
a lot of these gay guys,

657
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:18,619
sweetness and vulnerability
are wonderful and lovely,

658
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,788
but they can also be
a real boner killer.

659
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:24,058
You're very intense.

660
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:25,626
Yes.

661
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,662
-I was kidding, by the way.
-About what?

662
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:31,565
<i>The Hangover.</i>
It's not my favorite movie.

663
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,334
-No, you weren't.
-Yeah, I was.

664
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,703
I just like seeing you
get riled up.

665
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:38,773
-I don't believe you.
-I was kidding.

666
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:42,043
Hmm.

667
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,911
I don't like this.

668
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,917
Okay.
Let's see what we have here.

669
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,152
Mm-hmm.

670
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh, <i>The Treasure Inside</i>

671
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,088
is supposed to be
really good, actually.

672
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,623
AARON:
What's that about?

673
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:56,924
It's about
two closeted gay frontiersmen

674
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:59,760
in the California Gold Rush
of 1849.

675
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,729
But really it's about two
straight actors playing gay,

676
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,064
trying to win an Oscar.

677
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,800
I never tire of watching
two very straight actors

678
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,002
really transform themselves
into being sad and gay.

679
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,704
Gay actors playing gay--
that's not even acting.

680
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:12,006
Oh, I totally agree.

681
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,774
If they ever make a movie
about my life,

682
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:15,309
they better hire
a straight actor.

683
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,044
I like to think of
my life story as

684
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,280
just another way for Benedict
Cumberbatch to really score.

685
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:22,683
Okay, if we don't see this
movie, what are we gonna do?

686
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,685
Well, I didn't say
I didn't want to see the movie.

687
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,153
-Oh.
-I'll see the fucking movie.

688
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:29,023
I'm dying to.

689
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,759
I'd put it way above
<i>Call Me by Your Name</i>

690
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,195
but sort of below <i>Dallas Buyers.</i>

691
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,796
Well, it got me in the end.

692
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,798
Yeah, but why does it always
have to be so tragic?

693
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,267
I don't know.
<i>Philadelphia, Milk, Brokeback.</i>

694
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,902
Happy endings don't win Oscars.

695
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,205
Straight people love
seeing us miserable.

696
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,373
-Mm.
-JOSH: Wait, Aaron Shepard?

697
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,142
-(chuckles)
-AARON: Josh Evans?

698
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:51,112
-Holy shit! What is up, dude?
-Hey, man. Bro!

699
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:53,114
-Nice to see you.
-It's been for-fucking-ever.

700
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,882
Aaron and I-- we played hockey
in high school.

701
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,383
This is my fiancée Samantha.

702
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,219
-Hey. Nice to meet you.
-Hey. (chuckles)

703
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:59,854
Uh, this is, uh, Bobby.

704
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:00,921
-Hey.
-JOSH: Hey.

705
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,323
We just saw <i>The Treasure Inside.</i>

706
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:04,191
It's about
closeted gay frontiersmen.

707
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,759
Oh. Okay. Nice.

708
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,828
(stammers) It's just,
like, some dumb movie.

709
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:09,330
SAMANTHA:
Oh, wait. I want to see that.

710
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,065
Gay guys are my jam.

711
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,666
-Hmm.
-(chuckles)

712
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,235
So what are you guys doing here?

713
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:15,736
Just a little trip.

714
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,104
It's her first time
in New York City.

715
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:18,172
This city is sick.

716
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,941
-It really is.
-Yeah.

717
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,409
Well... awesome.

718
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:23,777
-Yeah.
-Uh, nice to meet you, Bob.

719
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,279
BOBBY:
Nice to meet you guys.

720
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,847
That is crazy.

721
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,283
I never run into anybody
from my hometown.

722
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,885
Oh, yeah, bro. Totally, bro.

723
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:33,420
Just some dumb movie, bro.

724
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,422
I had the biggest crush on him
in high school.

725
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:37,424
Yep. That tracks.

726
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,829
Well, like the bearded lady
in <i>The Greatest Showman,</i>

727
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:44,198
-this is me.
-(phone dings)

728
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:46,867
Oh.

729
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,403
The faux Chicago Cub?

730
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,305
Yeah. His husband
just sent me that.

731
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,308
Wow. They are extremely hot.

732
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,710
Yeah, Mike and Doug-- they're
these roided-out meatheads.

733
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:58,879
They're not the brightest,
but they're really sweet.

734
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:00,981
Do you want to go over there?

735
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,783
Wait. Are you ditching me again

736
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,919
to go fuck the baseball
cosplayer and his husband?

737
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,254
No, I'm not ditching you.
I'm inviting you.

738
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:08,822
(chuckles)

739
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,457
Why don't you
just come upstairs?

740
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:14,195
Ah, I don't really do the whole
relationship thing very well.

741
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:16,063
Relationship?

742
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:19,266
When did I say I wanted to be
in a relationship with you?

743
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,202
We literally hung out one day.

744
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:22,469
Yeah, but if I go upstairs,

745
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:24,471
it becomes, like,
a whole thing and...

746
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,106
Whatever.
We should just go over there.

747
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,341
It'll be fun.

748
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,742
I'm not gonna go,
but you should go.

749
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,110
Can I ask you one thing, though?

750
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,079
Why did you text me
if you didn't want to hook up?

751
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:34,481
I'm not angry.
I'm just honestly curious.

752
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:37,851
I didn't say
I didn't want to-- I...

753
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,988
I guess I had fun
talking to you at the club,

754
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,490
and I wanted to say,
"Hey, what's up?"

755
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:45,192
"Hey, what's up?"

756
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,061
So, basically you texted me
when you were feeling hungover

757
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,363
and lonely in that moment,
but you're not actually into me,

758
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,831
but you went on the date anyway.

759
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,000
Why are gay guys so weird?

760
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,903
Actually, you know,
we're not weird.

761
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,972
We're just constantly catering
to our own whims and needs,

762
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,140
which can change on a dime,
but we never even think about

763
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:02,142
the emotional consequences
of the other person.

764
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:06,046
Anyway, it's been a blast
catering to your whims.

765
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,983
And, honestly, I can't
really say anything about it

766
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,352
because I do the same thing
to people all the time, so...

767
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:13,521
(inhales deeply)

768
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,090
-Fun day. And, um...
-Fun day.

769
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:18,259
-Yeah.
-Have fun with those guys.

770
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,327
Okay. Bye.

771
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,564
("Dreaming with a Broken Heart"
by John Mayer playing)

772
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,131
Bobby, wait.

773
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:33,040
♪ When you're dreaming
with a broken heart... ♪

774
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,109
I had a really nice time today.

775
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:36,076
Me, too.

776
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,178
I never go on dates,
but that was really fun.

777
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:41,048
Yeah.
I had a really good time, too.

778
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,386
(moaning)

779
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,961
Hey, I'm gonna go.

780
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:56,030
(gasps) Oh, really?

781
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,131
Yeah.

782
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,600
Is everything okay?
Is this weird?

783
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,568
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's fun. It's great.

784
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:02,036
I just-- I'm just gonna go.

785
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,904
-Okay.
-Okay. I'll see you.

786
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,406
-Okay. Bye.
-Okay.

787
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,874
Bye.

788
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,309
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go.
Thank you so much.

789
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,177
-No. You're leaving?
-Yeah, I got to go.

790
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,613
All right, man.
It was nice meeting you.

791
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,180
-Yeah, you, too. It was lovely.
-Yeah.

792
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:15,115
-Thank you.
-All right. Good night.

793
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,350
Okay. Okay.

794
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,453
Thanks for coming.
We're convinced Brian's gay,

795
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,589
and I think it's good for him
to have his gay uncle around.

796
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,257
Oh, my God. Of course.

797
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,159
I'm always here to be a good
"guncle" to my "g-nephew."

798
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,629
-Aw. -Uncle Bobby,
will you read my report?

799
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:29,129
It's about Freddie Mercury.

800
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,998
He's obsessed with
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

801
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,466
Oh, my God, I love this.

802
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,234
And like that movie,
does your report take a story

803
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:35,936
about one of the great
gay icons and make it about

804
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,971
that one time
he maybe had sex with a woman?

805
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,306
I thought Freddie Mercury
was bi.

806
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,642
He had a wife.

807
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,276
Yeah, well, so did Jesus,
and he was gay.

808
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,278
This is excellent
and an improvement on the film.

809
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,312
Good job!

810
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:46,648
(phone whooshes)

811
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:48,650
What are those GIFs
from <i>The Hangover?</i>

812
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,217
Nothing.

813
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,252
This guy I went out with
won't stop texting me.

814
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:54,221
A guy? Really?

815
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,023
-Like a Grindr guy?
-No, shockingly.

816
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:58,092
I actually met this one
in real life.

817
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,527
Bobby!

818
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,961
That's fantastic!

819
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,162
You think you're gonna
see him again?

820
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,231
No. He told me
he prefers group sex

821
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:06,568
to one-on-one because
one-on-one is too intense

822
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,168
and makes it a whole thing.

823
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,237
We went on one date, and
we had sex with three people.

824
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,039
Gay relationships these days
are like a clown car.

825
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:14,441
Oh, there's another one.
Oh, look, another one.

826
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,310
Oh, another one?
It's ridiculous.

827
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,011
Plus, I don't think
I'm his type.

828
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,913
-How do you know?
-Because I know.

829
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,382
He told me
he likes country music

830
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,651
and his favorite singer
is Garth Brooks.

831
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,018
What kind of gay man says

832
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,353
his favorite singer
is Garth Brooks?

833
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:27,388
That scares me.

834
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:28,523
Plus, I see the guys he likes.

835
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,257
They all look exactly like him.

836
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,228
They're all these, like, big,
hot, straight-acting dudes.

837
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:35,129
It's just not me.

838
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,598
Well, is he a top or bottom?

839
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:38,232
What does that
have to do with anything?

840
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,567
Maybe you're both bottoms,
and that's the problem.

841
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,202
I'm not always
the bottom, Edgar.

842
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,538
Bottom dance!

843
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,072
-Ooh, bottom dance!
-EDGAR: Yeah!

844
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,408
(Tina and Edgar scatting)

845
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,543
BOBBY:
Oh, my God.

846
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,144
Gay sex was more fun

847
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,012
when straight people
were uncomfortable with it.

848
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,247
Fucking <i>Schitt's Creek.</i>

849
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,549
Maybe we should
stop talking about

850
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,150
anal sex
in front of your children.

851
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:58,252
-Nah. -Oh, please.
It's a natural part of life.

852
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,287
Bobby, ask him out again.
You never like anyone.

853
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,089
He is so handsome.

854
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:04,391
-So are you.
-Y-You're a hottie.

855
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:07,127
He is, like, on another level.
He's like gay Tom Brady.

856
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,163
When I'm with him,
I feel like friggin' Elphaba.

857
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,165
I bet he's as intimidated
by you as you are by him.

858
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:13,167
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm telling you.

859
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,468
He's just scared
of being vulnerable.

860
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,069
Gay guys from your generation

861
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,038
still have all these
pent-up masculinity issues,

862
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,440
and you all just need
to get over it already.

863
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,676
Half the kids in Brian's class
are nonbinary.

864
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,010
Well, it's not fair, Tina.

865
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,646
We had AIDS, and they had <i>Glee.</i>

866
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,680
(chuckles)

867
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,615
But there is a work thing

868
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,183
I was thinking of
maybe inviting him to.

869
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,185
-Maybe.
-EDGAR: What, a work thing?

870
00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:33,721
With lots of celebrities
and fancy people?

871
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,023
Now, are you gonna peacock
to impress him?

872
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,357
No. It's just a big fundraiser

873
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,992
for the museum,
and I need to bring someone.

874
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,728
Are you gonna be onstage?

875
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:43,063
No, I am not going to be
onstage, okay?

876
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,399
I am not some sort of
narcissistic sociopath.

877
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,268
-Thank you, Doja Cat.
-(cheering, applause)

878
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:52,740
Everyone, there are
rock paintings in Zimbabwe

879
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:54,241
which depict homosexuality

880
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:57,277
that date back to the year
2000 BCE.

881
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,213
If only the men
on those paintings

882
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:02,282
had lived another 4,000 years
to see a character come out

883
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,619
on <i>It's Always Sunny</i>
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

884
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,688
-(light laughter)
-Who did your chin?

885
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,288
Oh, no. It's real.

886
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:09,691
(scoffs) Yeah.

887
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,291
Mine, too.

888
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,127
Please continue to
give generously so the museum

889
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,797
can tell all the stories
in between

890
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,231
that have never been told.

891
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:19,601
Thank you very much. Good night.

892
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:22,002
(cheering, applause)

893
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,772
Hey, I'm so sorry
I left you alone.

894
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:26,273
-Things got a little crazy.
-No.

895
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,141
Hey, dude, you-you were,
you were awesome.

896
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,611
I mean, I could never do that,

897
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,378
-speaking in front of a bunch
of people like that. -Oh.

898
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:32,647
You move in
some pretty fancy circles.

899
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,214
I had no idea.

900
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,083
Oh, trust me,
it's not always this glamorous.

901
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:39,086
-Bobby, that was amazing,
as always. -Oh.

902
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,420
-Thank you, Charles.
-Congrats on everything.

903
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,055
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.

904
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,156
Thank you.

905
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,626
WOMAN:
Great speech, Bobby.

906
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,093
Thank you so much.

907
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,394
Hey, do you want to see
the museum?

908
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:49,229
-I can give you a private tour.
-Oh, sure.

909
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,598
I-I don't want to drag you
away from all this, though.

910
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:51,766
Oh, no, it's fine.

911
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,800
-Here. That way.
-(chuckles): Okay.

912
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,368
This is The Legends Pavilion.

913
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,705
Unsung heroes
from LGBTQ+ history.

914
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,675
Marsha P. Johnson
and Sylvia Rivera.

915
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,309
Usually, Stonewall
is the only thing

916
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:04,378
straight people know
about queer history.

917
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,813
Truthfully, no one really knows

918
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,549
who threw the first bricks
at Stonewall.

919
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,817
But it was trans women of color
like Marsha and Sylvia

920
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:12,687
who drove the earliest days of
the queer liberation movement.

921
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,556
So what do you think?

922
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,356
It's pretty incredible, right?

923
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,493
Yeah. I mean, it's-it's-it's
really impressive.

924
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:21,194
But?

925
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,130
But it's kind of depressing.

926
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:25,232
It's depressing?
It made you depressed?

927
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,570
It's AIDS and Nazis
and homophobia.

928
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:31,438
All of it's just--
it's kind of a downer.

929
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,173
Okay.
Well, what were you expecting?

930
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,776
<i>A Night at the Museum?</i>

931
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,410
Honestly, my family
loves that movie.

932
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:37,344
Oh, okay.

933
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,146
Oh, what if you did
something like that?

934
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,782
Where-where the things,
they come alive,

935
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,416
and they, like, talk at you.

936
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,118
"Where the things come alive,
and they talk at you"?

937
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,788
-Yeah.
-Like what exactly? Oh, oh.

938
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,322
What if we had, like,

939
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,657
-a bust of Eleanor Roosevelt,
right? -Yeah.

940
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,358
And you get really close,
and then all of a sudden,

941
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,661
you realize
that's not Eleanor Roosevelt.

942
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:55,128
It's Amy Schumer.

943
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,463
-Oh.
-No!

944
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:59,601
It's a museum.
It's not supposed to be fun.

945
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,402
WANDA:
Bobby.

946
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,204
We've got Debra Messing's
agent on a Zoom.

947
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:05,673
It's urgent.

948
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:07,875
Debra's worried that she's
on the verge of being canceled.

949
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,510
She said in an interview
that she was

950
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:11,813
the Viola Davis of Tufts,
and people are mad.

951
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,514
-(chuckles)
-Her agent is saying

952
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:15,850
that she may give a very big
donation to the museum

953
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:16,918
to save face.

954
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:18,853
Who's Debra Messing?

955
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,588
From <i>Will & Grace.</i> Oh, my God.

956
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,422
-WANDA: Yes.
-Okay, wait. This is amazing.

957
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,891
-Yes. -Stay right here.
I'll be back in five minutes.

958
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,259
-Sure. Yep.
-Let's go. -Okay.

00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:54,454

962
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:11,539
Aaron?

964
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,681

-Say hi to your brother.

00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,386
ANNE:
Jason's staying here

967
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,689
while he figures out
where to live.

968
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,389
Never get divorced, Aaron.

969
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:31,291
-JASON: Never get married.
-Okay, Mom.

970
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,695
I'm sorry. I'm at work, so
I-I should probably get going.

971
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:36,463
ANNE: (gasps) Oh,
I almost forgot to tell you.

972
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,432
Do you remember Josh Evans?

973
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,967
Yeah, Josh Evans
from high school.

974
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,903
I actually ran into him
and his fiancée

975
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,437
on the street the other day.

976
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,239
Well, they just broke up.
And you want to know why?

977
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:48,375
Because he's gay.

978
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,879
Josh Ev-- No.

979
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,581
I'm definitely embarrassed

980
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,348
about how long
this has taken me,

981
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,452
but I'm told people do this
in their own time.

982
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:01,622
I've been empowered by my hero,
Colton Underwood,

983
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:05,593
to say that, as it turns out,
I'm gay.

984
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,896
And like this post
if you like that I'm gay.

985
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,898
Peace.

986
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,333
Holy shit.

987
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,303
So we started going
back and forth for a while,

988
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,672
and then at the end,
I was just like,

989
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:19,640
"Why don't you call the album
<i>Lemonade?"</i>

990
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:22,275
(sighs)

991
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,845
WANDA:
(clears throat) Bobby?

992
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,278
When you're ready.

993
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,648
-What?
-When you're ready.

994
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:28,850
Sorry.

995
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,752
Okay. People wonder

996
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,320
if America is ready
for its first gay president.

997
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,890
I say we already had one.

998
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,725
For the final wing,
please consider

999
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,361
The Lincoln Letters:
A Gay American Love Story.

1000
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,897
For years, historians have

1001
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,732
speculated about
Lincoln's sexuality.

1002
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,367
He shared a bed and
exchanged intimate letters with

1003
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,370
multiple men over the years,
including Joshua Speed

1004
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:51,806
-and David Derrickson. Speed...
-Okay, I'm stopping you.

1005
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,509
Bobby, it won't work.
You can't say Lincoln was gay.

1006
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,911
-Why?
-There's no way to confirm

1007
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,513
those were sexual relationships.

1008
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,347
There's no evidence of love.

1009
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,315
Well, of course there's
no evidence of love, Robert.

1010
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,483
We weren't allowed to exist.

1011
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:05,418
How would we have
enough evidence?

1012
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,922
Okay, Lincoln was married to
a woman and had four children.

1013
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,991
He was not gay, Bobby.

1014
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:11,424
He might have been bi.

1015
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,760
I am telling you!

1016
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:14,796
We have let the world
erase gay love stories

1017
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,063
since the beginning of time.

1018
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,833
This is our chance
to reject the shame

1019
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:20,400
and restore the truth.

1020
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,836
And if we don't do this,
we're letting them win.

1021
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,071
We're letting the
heterosexual terrorists win.

1022
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:25,640
The heterosexual terrorists?

1023
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,042
-That's right.
-There are also gay terrorists.

1024
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,944
And there are
bi terrorists, okay?

1025
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,479
There are
many bisexual terrorists.

1026
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:33,714
Okay, there are
trans terrorists, too.

1027
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,482
-Caitlyn Jenner.
-(fingers snapping)

1028
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,518
Enough, people.
Let's vote on it.

1029
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,122
Okay.

1030
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,624
Looks like we have two votes

1031
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:45,760
for The Great Bisexuals
of the World.

1032
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,128
Thank you, someone.

1033
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,563
WANDA: And three votes
for The Lincoln Letters.

1034
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:49,997
-Lincoln wins.
-Yes!

1035
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,600
-Thank you! Thank you.
-(knocking)

1036
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:55,036
Debra Messing is
in the building.

1037
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:56,571
(all gasp)

1038
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:58,773
ROBERT:
Yes! My girl.

1039
00:38:58,806 --> 00:38:59,974
WANDA:
Are you okay?

1040
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,075
-Yeah.
-Debra Messing.

1041
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,777
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1042
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,580
Okay. Wish me luck.

1043
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,650
-Miss Messing.
-Oh, please call me Debra.

1044
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,118
-Oh.
-Oh.

1045
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,954
I love this space.

1046
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:14,889
How did you find it?

1047
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,991
Oh, God. How did we find it?

1048
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,660
Um, I don't know. I'm sorry.

1049
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:22,063
Are you okay, dear?
You seem a little flustered.

1050
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,598
-(chuckles)
-Trust me.

1051
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:26,734
I know I'm Debra Messing,
but I'm only human.

1052
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,002
(laughs) Right.

1053
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,469
Um, no, I'm fine.

1054
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,471
It's a-- I'm so sorry.
It's boy problems.

1055
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,472
It's nothing. It's stupid.

1056
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,108
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1057
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:35,475
He was actually here last night.

1058
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:36,744
He came to
the fundraiser with me,

1059
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,579
and then out of nowhere,
he left, you know.

1060
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:39,614
And I keep texting him,
and he doesn't text me back.

1061
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,148
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1062
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:43,751
-How are you?
-I am so excited for this tour.

1063
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:44,986
Can I just ask you
really quickly?

1064
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,453
Because I actually think

1065
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,055
you're, like,
the perfect person to ask.

1066
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:49,590
What is going on?

1067
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:51,424
You know, like,
is he not interested in me

1068
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,160
or did something really come up?

1069
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,629
And why am I
thinking about it so much?

1070
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,097
That's what's so annoying.

1071
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,032
You know, because I'm never
distracted like this, okay?

1072
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,033
This is not who I am.

1073
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,501
And it's like, what do I do now?

1074
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,469
Do I text him again?
Do I call him?

1075
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:05,039
Do I go to his house, you know?

1076
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,041
What do I do, Debra?

1077
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,810
You know, for the last 25 years,

1078
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:13,180
I have been listening
to every gay man on earth

1079
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,849
complain to me.

1080
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:16,083
I am not my character.

1081
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,619
I am not every gay man's
best friend.

1082
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:21,055
I am simply out in the world,

1083
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:25,059
thinking that I'm gonna get
a tour of a museum, but no. No!

1084
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,796
Did I waltz in here
and lay all my shit on you?

1085
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:31,933
-Answer me! Answer me!
-I'm just-- I...

1086
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,067
Shut up!

1087
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,669
I am a divorced single mother.

1088
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,469
You want to hear
what that's like?

1089
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,205
I'm so sorry about this.
I'm terribly embarrassed.

1090
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,840
Please let me,
let me start again. I...

1091
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:42,475
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wh-What's going on in here?

1092
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,711
Do you have some personal shit

1093
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,146
you want to complain
to me about?

1094
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,847
-No.
-Of course not.

1095
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:51,686
Because lesbians
have their shit together.

1096
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,955
I got to go.
I lose my sitter in an hour.

1097
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,790
Miss Messing, please come back.
I'm so sorry.

1098
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:59,927
I am not Grace!

1099
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,963
It is a character.

1100
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,598
I won an Emmy for it.

1101
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,934
I even beat
Sarah Jessica Parker.

1102
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:08,869
People forget!

1103
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:10,838

It was a little scary.

Well, I like it.

1255
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:21,008
It's like a tiny birdbath.

00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,377
It's like a birdbath?

-Mm.
-Great.

1258
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,548
I always wanted my chest

1259
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,182

a tiny birdbath.

God, I never thought
I would date someone who gets

1268
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:48,302
more excited about Austin
Powers than Debra Messing.

1269
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:51,004
Where did I go wrong?

1270
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,273
Wait. Are-are we dating?

1271
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:58,312
No.

1272
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,347
We're not dating. Please.

1273
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:01,949
I was joking.

1274
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,284
You don't date people.
I don't date people.

1275
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:06,387
We don't date people.

1276
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:09,957
-Remember?
-I remember.

00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,945

1286
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:47,060
-Hmm? -I hate getting
work emails on a Sunday.

1287
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:50,532
Your job is really intense.

1288
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:52,933
Yes, and I hate it.

1289
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:56,036
It's fucking stressful
and depressing

1290
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:58,740
and so fucking boring. I-I...

1291
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,543
I fucking hate it.

1292
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:03,444
-(sighs)
-I'm sorry.

1293
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,548
Was there something else
you wanted to do?

1294
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:11,418
Bobby, I need
to tell you something.

1295
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,354
(sighs)

1296
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,059
When I was younger...

1297
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,998
-What happened?
-I...

1298
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,468
(sighs)

1299
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:30,237
You can tell me.

1300
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,475
(Aaron inhales deeply)

1301
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:38,412
When I was younger, I wanted
to make little chocolates.

1302
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,717
You wanted to make...

1303
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,284
-little chocolates?
-Yes.

1304
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,220
I used to tell my parents
I was going to the arcade

1305
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,322
at the mall, but
I would sneak off to Godiva.

1306
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:51,258
I just loved how all
the chocolates were wrapped.

1307
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,628
And I thought about how I would
design my own chocolates,

1308
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:55,162
how each little chocolate has

1309
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,231
its own specific,
unique design on it,

1310
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,533
and that little design tells you

1311
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:00,200
what they're gonna taste like.

1312
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:04,606
So I would draw my own
chocolates in-in a notepad.

1313
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,240
It's all I thought about.

1314
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:08,676
Tiny little pretty chocolates.

1315
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,377
That's good.

1316
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,514
What was I gonna do
with that, though?

1317
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:14,414
What was I gonna be?

1318
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,251
A chocolatier?

1319
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:20,187
Bobby, I wasn't gonna be
a fucking chocolatier.

1320
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,256
I don't know. Why not?

1321
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,057
It seemed kind of faggy.

1322
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,594
Oh, my God, Aaron.

1323
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,829
Faggy?

1324
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,764
It's not faggy
to spend your life

1325
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:31,265
making pretty little chocolates.

1326
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:33,133
-Bobby.
-Okay, fine.

1327
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,135
But so what?
So you're a big fag.

1328
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:36,436
So am I. It's great.

1329
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,338
Did you not realize that
a few minutes ago

1330
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,374
when you were sticking
your enormous penis

1331
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,476
-into my tiny anus?
-(chuckles) Okay, yeah.

1332
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,546
It-It's kind of cliché,
don't you think?

1333
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:48,282
I'd rather be a cliché
than be miserable.

1334
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:50,284
Well, my 15-year-old brain
in 1995--

1335
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,587
that is all I thought about.

1336
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,690
(sighs)
That was right around the time

1337
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:56,824
that my brother caught me.

1338
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:58,191
-Hooking up with a guy?
-No.

1339
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,595
No, I was making
little chocolates.

1340
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:02,462
Oh.

1341
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:05,465
I lied, and I said
that I was... (sighs)

1342
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,301
making chocolates for this girl

1343
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,303
that I had a crush on at school.

1344
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,437
I'm sorry.

1345
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,540
This is the cutest thing
I've ever heard.

1346
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:14,842
I guess you just have
this big, exciting life.

1347
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:19,379
I just didn't want you to think
that I was some boring schlub.

1348
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,149
I don't think you're boring.

1349
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,818
Your friend said I was boring.

1350
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:27,154
Oh, my God.
You were mad about that?

1351
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,724
-I was joking. I'm sorry.
-(groans)

1352
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:31,458
But, like, I don't understand.

1353
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,528
You don't have to be stuck in
that miserable office all day.

1354
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,163
You could be out in the world,
I don't know,

1355
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,198
making fudge, you know?

1356
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,735
You're like a Keebler elf
with internalized homophobia.

1357
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:42,135
You have to do this.

1358
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:43,538
You have to become
a chocolatier.

1359
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:45,807
-Oh, Bobby. -You have to become
a chocolatier.

1360
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,908
I'm telling you.

1361
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,510
You make that sound so easy.

1362
00:51:49,544 --> 00:51:51,211
Well, no, it's not easy.

1363
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:53,347
Nothing's easy.

1364
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,650
My God. You know what
I have to do this weekend?

1365
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,619
I have to drag my concave chest

1366
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,687
up to Provincetown
and beg donors for money.

1367
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:03,423
I need $5 million
or else the museum can't open.

1368
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:06,226
And it's Pride up there,
so the museum has to have

1369
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,195
a float in the parade,
and that's a whole thing.

1370
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:11,264
I'm telling you, it is not easy.

1371
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,667
It is never easy.

1372
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:16,704
But it's worth it.

1373
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:20,207
Hey, maybe I can come.

1374
00:52:21,576 --> 00:52:23,711
To where?

1375
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:25,278
Provincetown?

1376
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:27,615
Oh.

1377
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:29,917
Yeah.

1378
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:33,588
(both sigh)

1379
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:35,690
♪ ♪

1380
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,293
Come, come, come.
Welcome. I'm Louis.

1381
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,896
Let me show you your bedroom.

1382
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,397
Thank you. Oh, my God.

1383
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,265
-This house is so beautiful.
-Oh.

1384
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:46,701
How long have you had
this place?

1385
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:49,804
Oh, I've been coming up
to P-town since, uh, 1976.

1386
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:51,572
-Wow.
-Who are all these guys?

1387
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:54,274
Oh, well, um, actually,
(chuckles) that's me.

1388
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:56,276
BOBBY:
Oh, my God.

1389
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:57,912
Louis, you were so hot.

1390
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:59,681
-Yeah, I know.
-Wow.

1391
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,649
Do any of these guys
still come up here, too?

1392
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,283
LOUIS:
Uh, no.

1393
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:06,721
By 1996, four of the seven
of them were gone.

1394
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:09,991
I got this place in 1999
when I realized that somehow,

1395
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:11,993
miraculously,
I was gonna survive.

1396
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:13,493
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1397
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,596
So, tell me.
What are you boys up to today?

1398
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,965
Oh, well, I have a work thing
this afternoon,

1399
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:19,567
so I don't really know.

1400
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,669
-Probably just lay low.
-Lay low?

1401
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:22,970
You're in P-town.

1402
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,572
Go out. Have fun.

1403
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,541
You'll be dead soon enough.
Come on.

1404
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:28,943
-Let me show you to your room.
-(chuckles) All right.

1405
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:30,310
Here's your bedroom.

1406
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,979
Oh, my God!

1407
00:53:32,013 --> 00:53:34,281
AARON:
Oh, wow.

1408
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:36,283
And if you want to fuck,
you let me know.

1409
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:39,319
-Oh. Mm.
-Mm.

1410
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:41,656
(shower running)

1411
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,858
Hey, I need to grab something.
Oh, shit.

1412
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:44,992
-Bobby.
-I'm sorry.

1413
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,493
Why are you just
walking in here?

1414
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,995
I'm sorry. I thought
you were in the shower.

1415
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:50,464
It's not steroids.
It's just testosterone.

1416
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:52,265
Isn't that dangerous, like,

1417
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:53,534
for your liver and balls
and stuff?

1418
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:55,770
No. Half the guys I know
do this stuff.

1419
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:58,740
Yeah, but half the guys
you know are roided-out morons.

1420
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,474
Yeah, well, that doesn't
seem to bother you

1421
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:02,710
when you're obsessing
over my body.

1422
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,683
Okay, that's fair.

1423
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:10,551
Um, I'm gonna shower.

1424
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:11,619

What?

1436
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,324
I heard you singing
in the shower.

1437
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,561
Well, that's mortifying.

1438
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,563
Wait, so you're asking
this guy to donate

1439
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,397
the remaining five million?

1440
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,867
No. If I can get one million
out of him, I'll take it.

1441
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,537
You can't scare these people
off by seeming too needy.

1442
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,372
-Kind of like with you.
-(chuckles)

1443
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,708
-Who's Lawrence Grape?
-Larry Grape.

1444
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,710
Biggest gay TV producer
on the planet.

1445
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,979
He's made all this
groundbreaking queer content.

1446
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:13,848
He's major.

1447
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:15,382
Mr. Grape, I'm thinking

1448
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:16,951
the final wing
should be about Lincoln.

1449
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,953
Love that. Love Lincoln.

1450
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,855
Very few people know this,

1451
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:21,989
but our most popular president

1452
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:23,356
was also
our first gay president.

1453
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,959
Sorry. This is a Lincoln museum?

1454
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,761
Is this a Lincoln museum, sir?

1455
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:29,630
This is actually
an LGBTQ history museum.

1456
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,431
It's the first of its kind
on a national level.

1457
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:32,465
We actually s...

1458
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,735
That fucking bush! Come on.

1459
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,469
My neighbors planted that bush,
and it blocks my view.

1460
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:37,738
Can you believe that?

1461
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:39,106
(dog barking)

1462
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,741
Let's go take care of this.

1463
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:42,977
Oh, again with this?
What are you doing?

1464
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,145
This is on my property, Maurice!

1465
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,847
This is a shared borderline!

1466
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,815
This is a fucking disaster.
He won't even listen to me.

1467
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,650
He's too busy getting
his rottweiler ready for Pride.

1468
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,819
Okay, from my experience
at my job,

1469
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:54,088
weird rich people
just want to be listened to.

1470
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,723
Ask him what he's interested in.

1471
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,024
But I don't care
what he's interested in.

1472
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:58,626
I'm here to pitch him my idea.

1473
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,795
Well, then pretend like
you're interested.

1474
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:01,996
Just do a listening face.

1475
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:04,031
-Do a listening face?
-Yeah.

1476
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:07,034
Hmm. Yeah.

1477
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:09,103
-I can't. (groans)
-Yes. Come on. Go.

1478
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,771
Okay.

1479
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:13,908
-Yes. Yeah, that's good.
-Really?

1480
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,076
That looked like I'm listening?

1481
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:16,143
-Totally. Yeah.
-Oh.

1482
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,678
...plant this on my property!

1483
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,513
-It's an indigenous bush!
-Are you going to Pride?

1484
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:20,715
-Of course.
-I'll see you there.

1485
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:22,617
-Love you.
-Oh, I love you, too.

1486
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,652
All right. Listening.
I'll try it. I'll try it.

1487
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,053
Sorry.
I have to get going, boys.

1488
00:56:26,087 --> 00:56:27,922
Oh, Mr. Grape,
let me ask you something.

1489
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:30,157
(smacks lips) Um...

1490
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:35,428
what would you like to see
in the museum?

1491
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,799
A haunted house

1492
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:41,135
of gay trauma.

1493
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:42,803
A haunted house of gay trauma?

1494
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:45,206
Yeah. It's a cart on a track,
and there's...

1495
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,440
I'm sorry. This is a ride?

1496
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:49,476
Yeah, it's a fucking ride!

1497
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,579
(chuckles): So you think
a ride is too much?

1498
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,515
Um, no. N-No.

1499
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:57,551
No, no, no, no. It's perfect.
Please, keep going.

1500
00:56:57,585 --> 00:56:59,520
Okay. We find ourselves in

1501
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:02,924
an intimate little bar
with some young,

1502
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:04,759
hot, animatronic men.

1503
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,194
The men turn to dance with each
other when suddenly-- Boom!

1504
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:08,495
Oh, my...

1505
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:10,064
A cop car
smashes through the wall.

1506
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,899
Police storm out of the cars.

1507
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:14,702
There's sirens and batons
and voices screaming.

1508
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,604
And suddenly, the car takes off
like a roller coaster,

1509
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:18,072
and there's blood everywhere.

1510
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:21,609
And a monster with Reagan's
face on it is chasing you

1511
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:23,577
down the hallway saying,
"Shining city on a hill.

1512
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:24,946
Shining city on a hill."

1513
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:26,981
And then... (gasps)
we shoot out into the light.

1514
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:28,783
And it ends on something happy

1515
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:31,953
like Lil Nas X working out
with pink dumbbells.

1516
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:34,956
Wow.

1517
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:37,525
Um, a gay trauma coaster.

1518
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,961
I-I mean,
it's-it's very provocative.

1519
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,262
I just don't think we can afford

1520
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:42,964
that sort of thing,
unfortunately.

1521
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,199
Right. Well, okay, it was
so lovely meeting you g...

1522
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,635
(stammers) Mr. Grape, Mr. Grape.

1523
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:49,236
I'm not a creative guy.
I'm a money guy.

1524
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,905
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-I-- No, no.

1525
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:53,574
I can tell you,
to accomplish what you want,

1526
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,676
we need more than
just a little donation.

1527
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,713
-No, Aaron...
-We need $5 million.

1528
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:00,715
And you won't just get
the gay trauma coaster.

1529
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:02,783
You get the Lincoln exhibit.
You get all of it.

1530
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:08,823
You rewrite history
for an entire LGBTQ community.

1531
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:13,828
You're a storyteller, Lawrence,
and this is the ultimate story.

1532
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,299
You already pushed
the museum opening back twice.

1533
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:19,867
Is it really happening?

1534
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,936
Yes! It's definitely happening.
I promise.

1535
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:24,305
My entire life
has led up to this.

1536
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:27,608
Right, well,

1544
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:42,823

both too old to be in the pool.

Confidence is
just a choice you make.

01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,430
It's a decision like any other.

1591
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,866
Usually born out of necessity.

1592
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:08,836
You think I have
a good singing voice now?

1593

when I was a kid.

1594
01:01:10,738 --> 01:01:11,972
I was even better.

1595
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:13,774
Had <i>American Idol</i> existed then,

1596
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:15,376
I would've been the gay guy
with an amazing voice

1597
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,744
who comes in second.

1598
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:18,779
-(chuckles)
-And then let's see.

1599
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:24,084
Then I went to college, and
my musical theater teacher--

1600
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,387
he told me that I had
a "gay walk"

1601
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:31,458
and a "flamboyant quality"
which would "limit my options."

1602
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,394
(chuckles)

1603
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:35,229
And then for grad school,
I went to

1604
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:37,298
one of the best journalism
schools in the country,

1605
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:38,933
and my teacher there,

1606
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:41,368
this old, closeted queen
who was married to a woman,

1607
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:45,105
pulled me aside and thought
he was doing me a favor

1608
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,107
when he told me that
I should stick to writing

1609
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:50,211
because my voice sounded
too gay to do the news on TV.

1610
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:52,179
True story.

1611
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:55,482
And then I did stick to writing
and my gay history books.

1612
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:58,819
Every single publisher,
every single one,

1613
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:01,956
told me there wasn't enough
of an audience for it.

1614
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:04,491
I was always too gay,
or I was too niche,

1615
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:07,361
or, you know,
I made people uncomfortable.

1616
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:11,498
Even my dad, who was
so wonderful and supportive--

1617
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:14,835
I remember him saying,
"You know, not everyone

1618
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:18,072
wants to hear this gay stuff
all the time."

1619
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,375
But what was I supposed to do?

1620
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,978
I mean... (chuckles)
I'm a writer.

1621
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:29,216
I wanted to write about
my life, my friends, my world.

1622
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,152
And I'm telling you,

1623
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,021
enough people
tell you things like that,

1624
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,857
no matter how confident you are,

1625
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,859
when you're alone at night,

1626
01:02:38,892 --> 01:02:41,895
you start to think
that maybe they're right.

1627
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:48,570
So... I just...

1628
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:51,071
I put my head down,

1629
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:53,841
and I just worked really hard,

1630
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:57,177
and I just hoped that somehow

1631
01:02:57,211 --> 01:03:01,248
all these other people
were wrong.

1632
01:03:10,324 --> 01:03:12,226
And they were.

1633
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:18,999
And they were.

1634
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,306
(chuckles) I mean, I spent years

1635
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:29,910
watching a wave of mediocre
straight men passing me by.

1636
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:33,213
Men with half the talent,
who worked half as hard,

1637
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,882
who didn't care
as much as I did,

1638
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:36,984
and they got twice as far,
always.

1639
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:38,919
I mean,
that's an old story, but...

1640
01:03:38,952 --> 01:03:42,256
And, you know,
the world caught up with us.

1641
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,292
Didn't catch up fast enough.

1642
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,463
Didn't catch up fast enough
for my parents to see

1643
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,466
all these great things
happen for me.

1644
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,101
Right?

1645
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:57,871
Didn't catch up fast enough
for a lot of people.

1646
01:03:57,905 --> 01:03:59,406
That's the truth.

1647
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:04,612

confidence is just knowing

1710
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,668
It's like seven of us.

1711
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:15,803
Hey, congratulations
on everything.

1712
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:17,572
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, it's been crazy, man.

1713
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:20,274
Cool. So, um, yeah,
what have you been doing?

1714
01:07:20,307 --> 01:07:22,544
HENRY: Louis was like,
"No, I need to see options."

1715
01:07:22,577 --> 01:07:24,679
And then he started sending me
Airbnb options.

1716
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,113
-Am I boring you?
-No, no, no.

1717
01:07:26,146 --> 01:07:27,615
And I'm like,
"No, we deserve this..."

-I want you.

1723
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:41,328
What's up?

1724
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:44,866
Um, where do we stand on this?

1725
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:46,601
Where do we stand on what?

1726
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,803
-"Momogany."
-Oh. (laughs)

1727
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:50,505
On "momogany"?

1728
01:07:50,538 --> 01:07:52,472
Are we open? What are we into?
What are we doing? Like...

1729
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:54,809
Oh, this is just like
<i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

1730
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:56,310
What do you mean?

1731
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:58,245
It's that classic scene
where Billy Crystal

1732
01:07:58,278 --> 01:07:59,847
runs to Meg Ryan
on New Year's Eve and asks her

1733
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,516
if she wants to have
an open relationship.

1734
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:03,518
(both laughing)

1735
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:05,319
-Well, but...
-I mean,

1736
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:08,155
I'm not, like,
into monogamy, you know.

1737
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:09,724
But I don't think
we should be, like,

1738
01:08:09,757 --> 01:08:11,325
constantly fucking other people.

1739
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:12,459
No.

1740
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:14,127
Why do you ask?

1741
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:20,233
Oh, you want to fuck
your little hockey friend.

1742
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,603
No, I want to fuck you.

1743
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:24,438
-Oh, that's nice.
-But maybe he's there, too.

1744
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,240
(both laughing)

1745
01:08:33,548 --> 01:08:34,716
He's very hot.

I don't know. I just...

(sighs) I want to be cool
and free, and, you know,

I don't want to be lame,
but actually seeing you--

I don't know. It just...

They love sightseeing.

1810

I have no idea
what to do with them.

1811
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:16,077

I'll be home

Do you maybe want to spend
Christmas with me and my folks?

1816
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:30,792
Really?

1817
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,927
Because, honestly,
I am totally fine alone.

1818
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,494
That is very sweet
of you, though.

1819
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,564
No, you shouldn't be alone.
That's crazy.

1820
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:38,933
Okay.

1821
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,668
Yeah, that'll be fun.

1822
01:11:40,701 --> 01:11:43,671
And, honestly, no one knows
New York City better than me.

1823
01:11:43,704 --> 01:11:45,940
I will plan the ultimate
New York City Christmas,

1824
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,942
as only
a New York City Jew could.

1825
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:49,342
Amazing.

1826
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:50,678
But just keep in mind, you know,

1827
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:52,345
they're, like, quiet folks
from a small town.

1828
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:54,015
Aaron, I understand.

1829
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,683
You and I come from
different worlds.

1830
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:59,020
I'm from New York City.
You're from Upstate New York.

1831
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:01,589
(laughs) I mean,
they're sweet, but just...

1832
01:12:03,456 --> 01:12:06,527
If you could just
be, like, chill.

1833
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:08,963
I promise I won't embarrass you.

1834
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,132
And, Mrs. Shepard, these are
the first holiday windows

1835
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:13,501
to ever feature
a sex-positive Tiny Tim.

1836
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:14,569
And it's so important.

1837
01:12:14,602 --> 01:12:15,970
We don't get queer characters

1838
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:17,038
in the stories
that we read as kids.

1839
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:18,039
There's no gay Cinderella.

1840
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:20,407
There's no lesbian Rapunzel.

1841
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,976
There's no nonbinary
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1842
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:24,078
Uh, Bobby, I think they get it.

1843
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:26,379
Guys, we've got to go.

1844
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:27,815
I told Josh Evans
we would meet him

1845
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:30,585
at the Hallheart Christmas
movie pop-up village.

1846
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:32,119
We're seeing Josh Evans?

1847
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:34,454
I didn't know.

1848
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:35,422
Let's do it.

1849
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:37,124
Are you a Hallheart fan?

1850
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,860
I dabble.

-Josh! Evans!
-JOSH: Hey, fellas.

1859
01:12:57,612 --> 01:12:59,714
-How's Hallheart Village
treating ya? -Hey.

1860
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:01,481
Did you see the gay movie
that they did?

1861
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:02,884
It was kind of dope.

1862
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:04,752
Yeah, for years they ignored us,

1863
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:06,486
then their audience got
10% less homophobic,

1864
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,889
so they decided
we're a new demographic

1865
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:10,024
they can sell shit to.
I mean, look at these movies.

We've been with my parents
for two hours,

1883
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,059
and you've already talked
about transgender mannequins,

1884
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,727
HIV prevention,

1885
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:48,930
and you pointed out the route
to the 1976 Dyke March.

1886
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:51,464
They're having fun.
They're totally fine.

1887
01:13:51,498 --> 01:13:52,800
What is your problem?

1888
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:53,935
I'm nervous, okay?

1889
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:55,569
I've never
introduced them to anybody.

1890
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:57,004
I just don't want them
to get weirded out.

1891
01:13:57,038 --> 01:14:00,174
I want them to have, like,
a chill, normal time.

1892
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:01,943
So now I'm not normal?

1893
01:14:01,976 --> 01:14:03,476
Bobby, you know what I mean.

1894
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,713
I'm just being myself.

1895
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:07,715
Okay, but maybe
you could just be, like,

1896
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:10,952
a little less yourself
for like three hours.

1897
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:12,787
I want them to like you.

1898
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:16,524
Oh. Yeah.

1899
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:18,125
No, sure. Of course.

1900
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,560
Yeah, I'll just...

1901
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:21,629
I'll just be quiet.

1902
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,764
(chuckles) Okay, thank you.

1903
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:25,700
PETER:
Bobby! Oh, my God!

1904
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:27,001
Hi!

1905
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:28,769
-Hi!
-Jesus Christ.

1906
01:14:28,803 --> 01:14:30,705
We have to go anyway.
We have a dinner reservation.

1907
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:32,273
Where's dinner again?

1908
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:36,210
-♪ I'm flying ♪
-(orchestral music playing)

1909
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:37,678
♪ Look at me, way up high ♪

1910
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:40,915
♪ Suddenly, here am I ♪

1911
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,184
♪ I'm flying. ♪

1912
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:44,952
-(song ends)
-(cheering)

1913
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:47,154
(Anne exclaims)

1914
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:48,823
(clears throat)

1915
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:51,258
Hey, Dad,
how are the Polar Bears doing?

1916
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,994
That's the team
Josh and I used to play on.

1917
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:54,829
They haven't won all year.

1918
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,864
I told Josh they need you boys
to come back.

1919
01:14:56,897 --> 01:14:59,166
(laughter)

1920
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,603
Bobby, you seem quiet tonight.

1921
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:03,871
Is everything all right?

1922
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,640
Oh, yeah, I'm totally fine.
Yeah.

1923
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:08,075
I'm actually--
You know, I'm sorry

1924
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:09,643
if I spoke too much today.

1925
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,278
I just-- I think I got nervous.

1926
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:13,280
This is actually more like
how I usually am.

1927
01:15:13,314 --> 01:15:14,815
I'm very quiet.

1928
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,651
Very quiet and just,
like, weirdly normal.

1929
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,720
-(chuckles)
-Well, thanks again

1930
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:21,756
for planning such a lovely day.

1931
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:23,691
Oh, you're so welcome,
Mrs. Shepard.

1932
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:25,559
Oh, you sound like
one of my students.

1933
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:27,194
Call me Anne.

1934
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:28,629
Okay, I will.

1935
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:30,331
Uh, Mom's been
a second grade teacher

1936
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:31,766
for almost 40 years now.

1937
01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:33,667
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

1938
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:35,569
We need good teachers,
now more than ever.

1939
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:38,305
Thank you. I agree.

1940
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:43,077
And Aaron says you're working
at an American history museum.

1941
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:46,781
Yes. Yes, it is.

1942
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,716
It's an American history museum.

1943
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:49,950
Hmm.

1944
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,786
Mm-hmm.

1945
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:54,221
Well, it's actually
an LGBTQ history museum.

1946
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,924
It's the first major queer
history museum in America.

1947
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:58,692
Do you teach your students
any gay history?

1948
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:00,127
'Cause I know in a few states

1949
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,829
they're finally starting
to do it.

1950
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:06,801
Well, I teach
second grade, so no.

1951
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:08,069
Oh, right.

1952
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,137
No, I understand. Yeah.

1953
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:16,110
Out of curiosity, why not?

1954
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,212
ANNE:
Well, I just think

1955
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:20,281
they're a little young for that.

1956
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:22,183
Oh, of course. Yeah.

1957
01:16:22,216 --> 01:16:24,585
No, I understand that.

1958
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:28,823
(smacks lips)
I don't think so, though.

1959
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:30,791
-Ah, Bobby.
-No, no, no, I'm just saying.

1960
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:33,094
If I may disagree respectfully.

1961
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:34,328
That's actually the best time

1962
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,896
to teach them,
when they're young.

1963
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,832
You know, that way
they develop an appreciation

1964
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:39,400
for queer people before they
all start bullying each other

1965
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,302
or hating themselves
if they're gay.

1966
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,104
Maybe you're right.

1967
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:45,005
Oh.

1968
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:49,076
Feels a little young, though.

1969
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,978
Hmm. Right.

1970
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:52,780
Totally. I get it.

1971
01:16:52,813 --> 01:16:55,249
-I will drop it.
-(laughter) -Yeah.

1972
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:56,317
-Agree to disagree.
-Yeah.

1973
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,018
-Cheers to that.
-Yes.

1974
01:16:58,052 --> 01:17:00,688
Hey, so, uh, when are
you guys heading home...

1975
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,123
It's not really
that young, though.

1976
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:03,657
It's not that young.

1977
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,126
Bobby, can you please drop it?

1978
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,428
No, I can't, because we're
talking about gay kids here,

1979
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:08,863
and it's important.

1980
01:17:08,896 --> 01:17:10,264
One of the things
that saved me is that

1981
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:12,900
my parents exposed me to
gay stories when I was a kid.

1982
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:15,069
When I was 12 years old--
this is true--

1983
01:17:15,102 --> 01:17:17,138
my parents took me
to see a Broadway play

1984
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,672
called <i>Love and Compassion.</i>

1985
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:20,007
It was about a group of gay men

1986
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,009
spending the summer together
in Provincetown.

1987
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:24,011
And all of a sudden,
the curtain goes up,

1988
01:17:24,044 --> 01:17:27,748
and there are seven completely
naked gay men onstage.

1989
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:30,885
And there I am,
sitting between my mom and dad

1990
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:34,722
at age 12,
looking at seven soft penises.

1991
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:36,891
-(snorts) Shit.
-And all of a sudden,

1992
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:38,425
two of the guys
start making out,

1993
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:40,294
and then one of them starts,
like, talking dirty, you know?

1994
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,062
And I remember this so vividly.

1995
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:44,031
There was a sex scene,
and one of the guys is like,

1996
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:46,934
"Pound my prostate.
Pound my prostate."

1997
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:48,435
You know, "Milk me. Milk me."

1998
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:50,171
And I didn't even know
what that was.

1999
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:51,906
I mean, now I do.

2000
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,440
But, you know,
it was incredible.

2001
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:55,309
You know, to know
that I could sit there,

2002
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:58,812
between my mom and dad,
looking at seven penises.

2003
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,314
Seven penises, Anne.

2004
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:01,982
I was 12.

2005
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:04,351
And to know that they were
okay with that, I mean,

2006
01:18:04,385 --> 01:18:05,920
that had a profound effect
on me.

2007
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:07,855
All I'm saying is,
we need to remove the stigma

2008
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:09,356
from that type of thing
so that gay kids

2009
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,325
can feel good about themselves.
That's all I'm saying.

2010
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:13,460
I mean, look at Aaron
and how much he hates his life.

2011
01:18:13,494 --> 01:18:15,496
-Bobby.
-No, all I'm saying is there's

2012
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,064
a direct correlation between
how unhappy you are

2013
01:18:17,097 --> 01:18:18,732
with your life
and what you weren't taught

2014
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:19,800
about your potential as a child.

2015
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,935
Bobby, stop talking.

2016
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:22,303
-Wh...
-Seriously, enough.

2017
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:23,804
I will kill you.

2018
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:26,340
Aaron, you hate your life?

Your brother's
a real chatterbox.

2030
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:53,535
Hey, are you mad?

2031
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:54,835
Me? No, I'm great.

2032
01:18:54,868 --> 01:18:55,970
Josh just texted me.

2033
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,271
I'm gonna meet him at that bar.

2034
01:18:57,304 --> 01:18:58,872
I think we should go home
and talk about this.

2035
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:00,841
Oh, really?
You want to talk more?

2036
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:02,343
Well, I think it's better than
going to party with Josh,

2037
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:04,011
the self-loathing meathead
who took 40 years to come out.

2038
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:05,346
Yeah, well,
not everybody's you, Bobby.

2039
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:06,947
Okay, but 40 years?

2040
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:08,249
J.R.R. Tolkien took less time
with his journey.

2041
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:11,185
God, you are fucking relentless.

2042
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:13,020
"Aaron hates his life"?

2043
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:14,989
God.

2044
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,291
Hey.

2045
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:19,860
Hey!

2046
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:22,830
Fuck!

2047
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:26,233
-(dance music playing)
-(lively chatter, whooping)

2048
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,014
(grunting)

2049
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:42,116
(straining): Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2050
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:43,384
Good man.

2051
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:44,818

But, Aaron,

2264
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,810

change the fact that

2265
01:27:55,843 --> 01:27:57,912

conventional, basic as hell

I know that
what he did was wrong,

Plus, I apologized.
