1
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,060
J' When I need it so bad J'

2
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,073
J' Why do you not come to defend? J'

3
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,529
J' Is that any way to tell me
that you're gonna be J'

4
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,239
J' A terrible friend? J'

5
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,497
J' You remind me of a distant
constellation I

6
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,999
J' The way you cover it up,
but don't even touch J'

7
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,831
J' And now you want to know,
is that important? <i>I</i>

8
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,122
J' Baby, now, well,
it just depends J'

9
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,131
J' It just depends J'

10
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,821
J' And when you come back
uptown J'

11
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,701
J' Remember not to look
for me there J'

12
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,907
J' I gave you one more chance
to make it better J'

13
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,662
J' But you don't seem to care J'

14
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,950
J' You pretend to be accosted
by tradition J'

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,790
J' And now you cover it up,
but tell me you don't J'

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,580
J' Now you want to know,
is nothing sacred? J'

17
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,749
J' Well, I don't want to
have to compare J'

18
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,917
J' They don't compare... J'

19
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,254
( phones ringing )

20
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,061
( chattering )

21
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,065
16-inch radials, the new Nanoprene.

22
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,601
Don't blow smoke
up my rump, okay?

23
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,270
If I don't hear
"1,000 more units"...

24
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,361
Let me just check on
the load index on that for you.

25
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,197
Um, you know, looks like it's--

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,829
What's that? No, everything--
we recycle every tire.

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,864
Man: Okay, okay,
now we are talking.

28
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,955
All right, let mejust pull up
the paperwork here.

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,414
We'll get you squared away.

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,296
Your store needs products, right?
So what's the problem?

31
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,629
It's about safety. It's about safety
for your family, for your customers.

32
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,796
I mean, that's the bottom line.
These are the safest tires on the road.

33
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,929
You know that.
I'm not trying to bullshit you.

34
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,887
You did the right thing.

35
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,392
Bye.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,178
Butch, mark one up
for me, please--

37
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,723
three this morning.

38
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,358
One more for Mike, baby.

39
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,071
How can we be out of donuts?

40
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,573
I mean, it's ridiculous.

41
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,574
And the coffee machine's busted.

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,077
Where are they?
( knocking )

43
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,661
Hey, ladies.

44
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,327
Ladies, ladies, ladies, we have
a very serious problem here.

45
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,710
We're out of donuts.

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,372
Jane, maybe you could get
one of your girls on it ASAP.

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,668
- And the coffee machine's busted.
- And the coffee machine's busted.

48
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,711
These guys are such a-holes.

49
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,879
No, excuse me.

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,423
I already checked it.
It's fried.

51
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,307
You might want to just
call the company.

52
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,685
Oh, look.

53
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,439
Oh.

54
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,226
Where are those donuts? Oh.

55
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,360
Thanks, Jane.
You're the best.

56
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,115
High five?
No.

57
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,947
Low five? No.

58
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,406
Thank you.
Thank you, Jane.

59
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,288
Ken:
You gotta be kidding me.

60
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,199
O'Donnell:
So she's your dream girl, right?

61
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,914
Kline: No, she reminds me
of my dad.

62
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
Ken.

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,292
<i>HEY</i>

64
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,957
Oh, well, well,

65
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,467
I'm surprised you two even show up
to these sales meetings.

66
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,797
How are you doing, Kenny?

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,803
It's Ken, dickhead.

68
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,637
And I know you've been
fudging the numbers.

69
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,142
He knows we've been fudging
the numbers.

70
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,928
Fuck you, Castro.
Our numbers are legit.

71
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,643
But we know you shit your pants
at last year's Christmas party.

72
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,648
Dude, that's disgusting.

73
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,276
I didn't really--
it wasn't like a full-on--

74
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,483
it was a dribble.
( laughs )

75
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,569
It was-- everybody does it.
It was a mistake.

76
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,702
L-- I had bad sushi
and I sharted.

77
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,488
The fart part was intentional,
but I didn't--

78
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,701
( upbeat music playing )

79
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,492
I'm Bob Reilly, owner and CEO
of Reilly Auto Parts.

80
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,002
At Reilly, we carry only
the highest-quality names

81
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,505
like Goodyear, Firestone
and Michelin.

82
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,213
Freeze. Now what's wrong
with this commercial?

83
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,377
Lights.

84
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,307
Come on.
He doesn't mention Treadline.

85
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,094
Mr. Farrell,

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,264
someone was messing
with my chair,

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,434
so it's stuck
in the down position...

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,398
( people chuckling )

89
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,779
...so if I seem petite,

90
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,112
then that is the reason.

91
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,947
Will someone get him
a booster seat?

92
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,032
( laughter)

93
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,199
Now R&D and manufacturing
have done their job.

94
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,868
Now it's up to us in sales
to get these tires on the shelves.

95
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,536
Can you take notes for me?
I forgot my pen.

96
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,045
We've closed deals
with AutoZone, Pep Boys

97
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,456
- and Just Tires.
- Thanks.

98
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,045
Now we're going after
bigger fish--

99
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,631
Reilly Auto Parts.

100
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,102
One last piece
of business here--

101
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,891
it has come to my attention
that some sick individual

102
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,933
in our sales department

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,321
has been spreading pornographic
emails of a homosexual nature.

104
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,447
( Coughing )
Kenny Castro.

105
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,732
Castro.

106
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,276
Are you all right?
He's all right.

107
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,910
No, I wasn't--
( chuckles )

108
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,913
No, I didn't. It wasn't me.
It wasn't-- I didn't do that.

109
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,417
L-- they're trying to say
it was me, but it wasn't.

110
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,453
I didn't-- I wouldn't.

111
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,792
It wouldn't be gay.

112
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,707
I wasn't-- I mean, I'd do--

113
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,252
I mean, I wouldn't even do
regular porno,

114
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,591
but if I did, it would be regular,
is my point.

115
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,390
Come on, Kenny,
get your hands out of your pants

116
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,393
- and put an end to it.
-( laughter)

117
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,931
Now I expect everyone in this room
to step up their effort.

118
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,021
Come on, let's get out there
and kick some ass

119
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,813
and make this the best
sales quarter ever.

120
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,653
( Men cheering )

121
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,068
You know it.
You know it.

122
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,659
Let's work the phones.
Let's do it.

123
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,789
All right, Steve,
so let me tell you

124
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,666
why you need these tires
in your stores, okay?

125
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,793
It's about safety.
Seriously, I would let--

126
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,205
you know, let babies roll down hills
in these things.

127
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,624
Mmmmm.

128
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,918
Tire sizes?

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,837
Bro, you're asking a lot
of complicated questions.

130
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,631
Yeah, I work here.

131
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,391
Yeah, we have maintenance.
Believe me, this tire will leave

132
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,973
a bigger footprint than--

133
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,514
than Bigfoot, right?

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,557
You know 50 Cent?

135
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,227
He absolutely loves our tires.

136
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,646
I mean, you know that.
I'm not trying to bullshit you here.

137
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,780
I mean, listen, want to hear
something crazy?

138
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,409
I have actually rolled babies
down hills in these things.

139
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,114
I'm not lying.

140
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,871
You know, just Google
"50 Cent and tires."

141
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,408
You just did?

142
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,168
It didn't?

143
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,830
Well, I don't know.
Maybe your Google's broken.

144
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,296
Believe me,
as a senior salesman around here,

145
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,176
let's just say I know
a thing or two--

146
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,133
ow! Hang on.

147
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,215
- Hang on one second, please.
- Oh, hey, Joe.

148
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,635
Oh. I'm sorry.

149
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,178
There's-- yeah.
No, no, there's--

150
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,223
we have a faulty air-conditioning unit
in the building.

151
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,437
( Both chattering, laughing )

152
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,021
<i>-</i> Oh, hi.
- Oh, hey.

153
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,028
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you new here?

154
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,155
Yeah, I am-- first day.

155
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,112
Yeah, I thought so.
See, 'cause we don't--

156
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,527
we don't actually get that many
secretaries sitting here.

157
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,789
Mike: This is pretty much
understood as our table.

158
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,745
We eat here every day.

159
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,534
All we do is talk
about sports and fishing

160
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,248
and would probably
bore the hell out of you.

161
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,038
- Yeah.
- Right.

162
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,376
You got that? You good?

163
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,791
- Yeah.
- All right.

164
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,426
Welcome to Treadline.

165
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,428
Welcome to Treadline? What, are you
the official Treadline greeter?

166
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,305
( Fans cheering )

167
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,723
Man over P.A.:
And that's the ball game.

168
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,563
Treadline wins 6-5.

169
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,603
Good comeback, baby.

170
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,237
- Nice. Nice.
- Nice toss.

171
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,569
Lucky catch, McAdams.
I'm surprised you didn't drop it.

172
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,325
Oh, like that pop fly
you dropped in the third?

173
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,780
A fifth grader could
run that down.

174
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,116
Hey, I told you
the lights got in my eyes.

175
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,407
They gotta turn the volume down
on those things.

176
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,871
Hey, can we trade him to another team
for, like, a keg of beer?

177
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,332
<i>-</i> Or just give him away?
-( laughter)

178
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,667
Ha ha ha ha.
You know what, Murphy?

179
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,503
I'm so sick of you.
I really am.

180
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,418
You're about due for a beatdown
UFC-style.

181
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,586
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

182
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,347
- All right, bring it.
- Yeah, let's go.

183
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,927
Come on, let's bring it.
Come on.

184
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,264
Come on, you can do it.
Come on. Come on.

185
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,896
Another great game, guys.

186
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,433
Hey, come on, Kenny,
you're out of uniform.

187
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,101
Tuck that shirt in.
Come on now.

188
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,110
It's just "Ken," sir.

189
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,863
Hey, you two, let's get out there
and celebrate. I'm buying.

190
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,945
- Nice.
- Wow, what a victory.

191
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,610
That double play was
just fabulous.

192
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,326
- Tailor-made. Tailor-made.
- Yeah. Hey, where are we gonna go?

193
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,162
- Both: Flight Club.
- Oh, boy, the Flight Club.

194
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,497
( Rock music playing )

195
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,957
Hi.

196
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,468
Oh, hey, Destiny. Looking good.
Love the new boobs.

197
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,129
Thanks, Rodney.

198
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,638
J' When I was nine years old J'

199
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,266
J' I knew what I was gonna do J'

200
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,893
J' A little bass, drums, guitar,
I put on a show for you... <i>I</i>

201
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,646
We sell tires.
We're Treadline.

202
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,728
Oh-ho-ho. Uh-oh.

203
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,611
J' When all the old folks said, "This
shit gen' bring out the devil in you" J'

204
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,067
J' Rock 'n' roll... J'

205
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,903
- Uh-oh.
- J' It's all I want to do J'

206
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,443
J' Rock 'n' roll J'

207
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,830
J' Rock 'n' roll, it's all I want to do,
it's all I want to do... J'

208
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,832
Treadline!
Treadline in the house!

209
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,538
Good, right--
get out of the office?

210
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,499
- J' Rock 'n' roll... J'
- ( growling )

211
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,790
J' It's all I want to do,
it's all I want to do J'

212
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,800
J' Rock 'n' roll... J'

213
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,889
( panting )

214
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,058
Mm, baby.

215
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,188
Oh, Jesus.

216
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,600
Good morning, Lucy.

217
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,269
Good morning, Ed.

218
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,437
Rodney.

219
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,700
( Footsteps )

220
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,865
( scoffs )

221
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,579
God knows what
our neighbors think.

222
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,962
Oh, Ed and Lucy didn't seem
to mind, trust me.

223
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,632
You know, it's like you still think
you're in your 20s, you know?

224
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,922
But, honey, you're not.

225
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,341
So get over it and grow up.

226
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,054
Yeah, okay.
So, look,

227
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,561
obviously things got a little
out of control last night, okay?

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,270
And I'm-- all I can say is
I'm ashamed.

229
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,025
That's it?

230
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,153
I'm really--
I'm really ashamed.

231
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,155
Wow. Do me a favor--

232
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,533
keep it together for
the engagement party this weekend.

233
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,069
That's it.
That's all I ask.

234
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,737
Okay?

235
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,621
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't be like that.

236
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,003
Don't walk away like this, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

237
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,381
I'm sorry, okay?
It won't happen again, I promise.

238
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,883
And this weekend
I'll be on my best behavior.

239
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,261
I know, but I always let you off
so easy and you can't--

240
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,674
Yes. Yes, I can.
What if I run down the streets naked

241
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,968
professing my love for you?

242
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,388
Don't tempt me,
'cause I might make you do it.

243
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,806
- Fine, do it.
<i>-</i> I will.

244
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,770
- Okay, good. Deal.
- You don't think I will?

245
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,310
- I hope you do.
<i>-</i> I will.

246
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,604
I'm ready.

247
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,114
My father thinks I'm crazy
for marrying you.

248
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,650
Uh, isn't he, like,
on his fourth wife?

249
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,285
It's kind of like getting
marriage advice from Larry King.

250
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,867
Come on.
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,283
You look pretty.

252
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,450
Thank you.

253
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,665
What-- what are you wearing
under there?

254
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,129
( Groans )

255
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,639
Oh, my God.

256
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,515
( Liquid pouring )

257
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,481
Good morning, sweetheart.
How is my baby?

258
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,772
Hung over as shit, Mom,
but thanks for asking.

259
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,066
(sighs )

260
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,156
Find your own place yet?

261
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,492
I'm working on it.
I'm a little short on cash right now.

262
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,329
That's because you spend it all
on booze and strippers.

263
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,585
That is a pack of lies
and you know it.

264
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,495
What kind of a man
do you think I am?

265
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,916
"Just booze and strippers"-
that's outrageous. I'm offended.

266
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,504
'Morning.

267
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,590
Mike: Hey, look who's up.
Good morning, Destiny.

268
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,629
Come on.

269
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,094
What can I get
for you, dear?

270
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,259
I'll take a cup of coffee, thanks.

271
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,020
I rest my case.

272
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,099
<i>-</i> Thank you. Oh.
- There you go.

273
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,314
She's much better
than the one last week.

274
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,696
- Yeah, Mom, this one's a keeper.
- Yeah, I know.

275
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,701
J' It's not the weight
that you carry on your back J'

276
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,861
J' It's not your last laugh J'

277
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,780
J' It's not your game J'

278
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,871
J' It's not the way that you
wear your silent now... J'

279
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,877
Rodney: Destiny went back
to your house?

280
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,755
Mike: She did indeed.
In fact, I think she's still there.

281
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,166
It's all right, though.
My mom's gonna take her shopping.

282
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,755
Rodney:
Oh, that sounds terrific.

283
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,215
You've been going there
for, what, five years?

284
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,051
- You know what?
- You still don't know her real name?

285
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,557
Here's what I do know:
She liked cuddling.

286
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:05,721
You gotta be the only guy I know
who cuddles with a stripper.

287
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,106
What's up with everyone here?

288
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,858
I don't know.
Maybe somebody got fired.

289
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,941
Hey, Kline, what the hell
is going on here?

290
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,730
You didn't hear about Farrell?

291
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,774
Hear about it?
Dude, we were there.

292
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,738
Yeah, the old man was a legend
last night.

293
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,825
He broke Flight Club's
all-time lap dance record.

294
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,581
He's dead--

295
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,993
heart attack.

296
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,754
Does everybody else know?

297
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,918
( Sobbing )

298
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,886
(thunder rumbling )

299
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,227
Priest: The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall lack nothing.

300
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,313
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

301
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,445
Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

302
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,946
I will fear no evil.

303
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,109
You don't think we had anything
to do with his death, do you?

304
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,117
What? No.

305
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,949
No way.

306
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,661
It's not like we forced him to do
all those tequila shots.

307
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,292
No. He's the one who wanted
to dance with the strippers.

308
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,667
Yeah.

309
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,831
J' Oh, yeah J'

310
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,000
J' The bitch wants more... J'

311
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,634
( crowd cheering )

312
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,178
It's the last memory I'm gonna have
of that crazy old bastard.

313
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,184
Shut the fuck up.

314
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,345
Priest: ...follow me all the days
of my life.

315
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,855
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord...

316
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,890
Now that Farrell's dead,

317
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,276
who do you think
corporate's gonna promote?

318
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,938
I don't know.
Probably some real douche.

319
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,607
Aw, looking good, Willy.

320
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,491
<i>-</i> Give that a little polish, eh?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,493
Yeah, when you close.
Okay, good.

322
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,030
( Sighs )
Well, gentlemen,

323
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,664
it's a new day,

324
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,700
a new regime.

325
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,620
I guess seniority
has its perks, huh?

326
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,130
And now guess what time it is.

327
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,667
It's payback time.

328
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,803
See, you two have made
working here a I--

329
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,055
a living hell for me,
all right?

330
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,262
You pretty much did that yourself
by being an asshole.

331
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,598
If this is about me sending
that vibrator to your mom,

332
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,808
I was totally drunk
at the time--

333
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,689
-( Rodney chuckles )
- --gone.

334
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,850
Yeah, he was.
I can vouch for that.

335
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,860
You--

336
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,943
you sent my mother
a vibrator?

337
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,778
Just a little one.

338
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,534
You leave my mother's vagina
out of this!

339
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,287
Are we done here?
I've got tires to sell.

340
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,574
No, we're not done, McAdams.

341
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,913
We have only just begun.

342
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,964
See, I haven't forgotten the humiliation
that you two have put me through.

343
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,250
What humiliation?

344
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,545
Are you serious? How about
that male stripper on my birthday?

345
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,384
J' Give me some more J'

346
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,890
J' Get on the floor,
come on... J'

347
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,096
( laughing )

348
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,135
All right, what about
when you put Ecstasy

349
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,851
in me and Kline's drinks
at the company carnival?

350
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,983
<i>-</i> How are you doing, Mr. Castro?
- Argh! Jesus!

351
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,399
It's not funny.
That's a felony.

352
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,739
That's a felony, all right?
That's a felony.

353
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,530
And I don't have
the lab results yet,

354
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,573
but I'm pretty sure
it was one of you two

355
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,868
who took a dump on the hood
of my car last week.

356
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,162
- Right on his window.
-( laughing )

357
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,080
Shh.

358
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,250
<i>-</i> Oh.
- Dude.

359
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,919
Shut the fuck up.
It's okay. It's okay.

360
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,263
Jesus Christ.

361
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,345
Whoa. Whoa.

362
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,136
Yeah, yeah, ha ha ha.
Laugh it up. Laugh it up,

363
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,100
because the fun's over,
all right?

364
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,437
From now on, this place is gonna be
run by my rules.

365
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,103
I could fire your punk asses
right now, no questions asked.

366
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,442
Yeah, well, then why don't you?

367
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,824
'Cause if this is what it's gonna be
like working for you, we're better off.

368
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,360
You think I'm that stupid?

369
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,120
- ( Both laugh )
- I fire you and you walk out of here

370
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,997
with great, big
severance packages.

371
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,578
- That sounds good to me.
- I bet it does.

372
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,745
Yeah, well, you can kiss that
wet dream goodbye,

373
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,163
'cause you're not being fired.

374
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,299
Instead...

375
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,710
you're being demoted.

376
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,594
Demoted?
Are you kidding?

377
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,630
To what? Interns?

378
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,390
What, are you gonna
make us janitors?

379
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,142
( laughs )

380
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,680
How about secretaries?

381
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,851
Yeah.

382
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,067
( laughs )
Who's laughing now?

383
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,106
Not you two.
Right here,

384
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,241
this is an honest,
genuine laugh.

385
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,448
( laughing loudly )

386
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

387
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,041
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm packing up my shit.

388
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,834
Yeah, don't you think
we should talk about this?

389
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,754
There's nothing to talk about.
Demoted to secretaries? Fuck that.

390
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,672
We're out of here.

391
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,137
I know exactly what you're thinking,
but don't worry.

392
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,677
Everything's gonna be fine.

393
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,517
We're gonna grab some breakfast,
charge up the old batteries,

394
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,272
hit the pavement,
and find some new jobs.

395
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,184
Everything will be hunky-dory.
Who wouldn't hire us?

396
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,441
I'm gonna be honest with you,
gentlemen--

397
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,356
your resumes aren't great.

398
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,524
It does look like you have some
decent sales experience here.

399
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,364
Is there someone I could call
over at Treadline,

400
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,449
maybe a reference
of some sort?

401
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,535
( Clears throat )
A reference?

402
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,792
Yeah, that's-- that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

403
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,123
Our reference sort of died.

404
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,756
( Chuckles )
Yeah, it's a long story.

405
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,792
There was drinking
and strippers

406
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,960
and we might have
inadvertently killed him.

407
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,596
Rodney: No criminal charges
have been filed of any kind.

408
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,052
- We're not sure.
- No, no.

409
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,264
- I'm pretty sure we're in the clear.
- Well, we're not totally sure,

410
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,179
so fingers crossed.

411
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,275
<i>-</i> Get the fuck out of here.
- Thank you.

412
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,408
Mike:
This sucks.

413
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,241
Rodney: What if this is just temporary?
Maybe I can fix this.

414
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,077
A couple of days,
a week or two at the most--

415
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,582
bam!
We get our old jobs back.

416
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,334
What if you can't fix it?
What if we're stuck being secretaries?

417
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,747
Rodney: Relax.
How bad can this be?

418
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,417
We start at 8:00 a.m. sharp,
finish at 6:00,

419
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,211
15-minute breaks
and half-hour lunches.

420
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,597
I hope that's not going
to be a problem.

421
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,428
Yeah, actually, we're more

422
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,763
on the 9:00 to 5:00 schedule.
Farrell was cool with that.

423
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,928
Sometimes 10:00 to 4:00,
depending on if we're hung over.

424
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,473
He's dead.
You're on my schedule now--

425
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,482
8:00 a.m., no excuses.

426
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,393
And try to look
a little more professional.

427
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,437
I prefer comfort
to professional.

428
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,822
Maybe you prefer
my foot up your ass.

429
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,734
Let's motor on.

430
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,154
We're expected to keep this break room
neat and tidy at all times.

431
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,039
Yes, we're the little elves that wash
the dishes in that sink.

432
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,246
We're expected to keep
the donuts stocked

433
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,628
and the coffee fresh
every morning,

434
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,290
which is why we don't drink and eat
all the coffee and the donuts.

435
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,926
The secretaries have
their own break room.

436
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,630
Rodney:
Are you kidding?

437
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,720
Mike: I don't think she's kidding.
Isn't this a storage closet?

438
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,510
Rodney:
There's no TV in here.

439
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,269
How are we supposed to watch
"Sports Center"?

440
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,305
- There's no donuts.
- No.

441
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,225
Donut-free zone.
We're all on diets.

442
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,485
Ugh. This is bad.

443
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,395
No donuts.

444
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,607
The phone system
is a nightmare.

445
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,822
The filing system's even worse.

446
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,488
Our computers are pieces of crap,
so, you know, deal with it.

447
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,908
Oh, and on Fridays,

448
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,327
all the girls like
to get together after work

449
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,917
for a book club.

450
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,002
At least that's what
we tell our husbands.

451
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,008
But...
( laughs )

452
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,547
we usually go to Bennigan's
for happy hour, though.

453
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,057
( Chuckles )

454
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,103
In case you're ever interested.

455
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,185
Oh, thanks,
but we actually have

456
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,225
- our own happy hour spot we go to.
- Oh.

457
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,268
Yeah, one that has
half-naked women

458
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,563
swinging around on poles,
which is awesome.

459
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,482
Well, not just on poles.
They kind of get on all fours and--

460
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,694
If you're into
that sort of thing,

461
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,534
which we're not,

462
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,245
so we only go for the buffet.

463
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,409
Oh, I'm sure.

464
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,213
Well, I think it's time for you
to meet your new bosses.

465
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,546
Well, you know as well as I do,
anything that's gonna boost production

466
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,052
is gonna make me
happy as a clam.

467
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,054
You got it, Chuck.

468
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,590
( Knocks )

469
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,477
Yeah, hey, let me call you back
in a little bit, you old son of a bitch.

470
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,103
All right.

471
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,892
Mr. Frank, I'd like to introduce you
to Rodney McAdams,

472
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,684
your new secretary.

473
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,398
Uh, no, thanks, sweetheart.

474
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,659
Tell Kenny that the manufacturing
department

475
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,491
would like someone
who's just a little bit more

476
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,826
perky on top,
if you know what I mean.

477
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,123
Well, I do, Mr. Frank.
I know exactly what you mean.

478
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,788
Yee-haw.

479
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,754
But unfortunately,
Mr. Castro has asked

480
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,759
that Rodney be assigned to you,

481
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,637
so happy trails.

482
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,473
Well, have a seat, Nancy.

483
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,103
Actually, it's Rodney, sir.

484
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,310
Yeah, whatever.

485
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,770
A male secretary, huh?

486
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,233
Shit, you might as well
just have your balls cut off.

487
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,446
Oh, yeah.

488
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,200
Can I help you?

489
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,165
Hey, sister. Wrong office.
I've already been assigned to this guy.

490
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,296
Excuse me?

491
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,173
This guy's covered, all set.

492
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,959
You'd better go find yourself
another boss.

493
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,298
Would you grab me a cup of coffee
while you're out there,

494
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,304
while I'm waiting around
for this a-hole?

495
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,306
Oh, good.
You're both here.

496
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,435
Mike Murphy, meet Elizabeth Holland--
your new boss.

497
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,940
By the way, this a-hole
likes her coffee black, no sugar.

498
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,317
- ( Yelps )
- ( chuckles )

499
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,854
Thanks.

500
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,318
So who did you get?

501
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,325
Some outside accountant corporate's
brought in to audit the books.

502
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,865
That's what you got to do.

503
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,156
Dude, what the fuck?

504
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,326
<i>-</i> Hey, Castro.
- Rodney: Hey, hey, hey.

505
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,666
<i>-</i> Hey, Castro. Are you guys kidding?
- Oh, whoopsy-doopsy.

506
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,547
Sorry, guys,
I'm afraid there's no more room.

507
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,333
<i>-</i> What's going on?
- No, no, no, Castro.

508
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,673
We always sit here, okay?
Everybody knows this is our table.

509
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,964
Oh, yeah? Is that right?
Well, guess what. Not any more,

510
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,724
'cause maybe I'd like to sit here
once in a while.

511
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,978
You know, why don't you
go sit with the secretaries--

512
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,854
you know, where you belong?

513
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,812
( Chuckles )

514
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,352
Go on.
You'll fit right in.

515
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,816
Oh, one other thing:

516
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,778
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn in
your softball uniforms.

517
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,942
- You're gonna kick us off the team?
- Yeah.

518
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,237
What, is everybody on board
with this?

519
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,747
How about you, Kline?

520
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,828
What did he offer you
to stab us in the back--

521
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,210
a pay raise,
your own private parking spot?

522
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,870
A parking--
yeah, a parking spot

523
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,913
What about you, O'Donnell?
What did you get?

524
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,707
Oh, wait, let me guess-
a hand job?

525
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,257
Look,

526
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,643
Kline and O'Donnell
are smart men.

527
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,929
They know who signs
the paychecks.

528
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,144
Yeah? And they sure as shit
don't want to end up like you two.

529
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,559
And I don't think
they're alone.

530
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:22,026
See, certain people around here
have had to put up with you clowns

531
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,564
'cause they had to,

532
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,530
'cause you were Farrell's
golden boys.

533
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,411
Well, guess what.
That old fucker's dead.

534
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,039
That makes you

535
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,915
just my bitches.

536
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,543
You cannot turn this entire company
against us, Castro.

537
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,579
Oh, yeah? Well, I can
sure as hell try, McAdams.

538
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,589
Now why don't you two beat it

539
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,046
before I have you restocking
the tampon machines?

540
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,801
( laughing )
Whoa! Ta-dah!

541
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,088
Hey, Kline.

542
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,590
Yeah, bye-bye.

543
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,260
- Toodle-00.
- Enjoy the Salisbury steak.

544
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,929
Don't let it hit you on the ass
when the door--

545
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,598
I mean, if you're going out.

546
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,767
Hey, ladies.
How's it going?

547
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,356
Our table's a bit crowded today.
Do you mind if we join you?

548
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,113
Oh, I'm saving these
for somebody.

549
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,990
You boys don't want
to sit here anyway.

550
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,743
All we do is talk
about makeup and diets.

551
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,405
We'd probably bore
the hell out of you.

552
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,291
Don't cry.

553
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,133
They should cry.

554
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,419
Now they get to see
what it feels like.

555
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,087
They did the same thing
to everybody else,

556
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,971
and now they get a taste
of their own medicine.

557
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,175
Mike:
This blows.

558
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,720
It's not great.

559
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,356
J' You'd never met me,
not seen me before J'

560
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,985
J' But you knew all about me
when I walked through the door J'

561
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,193
J' You had me figured,
yeah, you knew J'

562
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,358
J' I'm the kind of boy
to go crazy for you... J'

563
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,493
Let's face it--
Castro's got us by the balls.

564
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,746
That's true.

565
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,156
Oh, shit.

566
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,666
It's Jennifer's dad
and his teen bride.

567
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,748
I know, I know.
I'm gonna get you one.

568
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,878
- Encore.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,005
Mr. Daniels,
looking dapper as usual.

570
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,007
Rodney, at the bar as usual.

571
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,168
Hi, cutie.

572
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,054
- How are you doing?
- Good.

573
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,634
Good.
You're looking good,

574
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,177
really good.

575
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,345
Stop eye-fucking
my wife, son.

576
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,015
- ( Wife chuckles) Oh, J.R.
- Sure.

577
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,478
What the hell
is the matter with you?

578
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,524
Good to see you,
Mr. Daniels.

579
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,655
Wow.

580
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,740
What a prick.

581
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,699
Are you absolutely certain
you want to marry into that?

582
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,289
After all the shit
that's gone down,

583
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,203
J.R.'s just the start
of my problems.

584
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,122
What about you?
You're just as screwed as I am.

585
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,963
- You still live with your parents.
- I do not live with my parents.

586
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,173
I live in an apartment
which they happen to live above.

587
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,134
- You live in their basement.
- It's not their basement, okay?

588
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,391
It's my basement--
a subterranean loft.

589
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,603
Rodney.

590
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,737
Mr. Daniels.

591
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,774
You know, Rodney,

592
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,238
I didn't come in here
because I needed to take a whiz.

593
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,575
<i>-</i> You didn't?
- No, I didn't.

594
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,911
I thought it was time
I had a little chitchat

595
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,576
with my future son-in-law.

596
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,462
Oh, you mind giving me a little
second to finish up here?

597
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,957
Look at me, Rodney.

598
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,252
Sir, I'd really rather not.

599
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,671
You've got your thing going on
over there. I've got my thing--

600
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,464
I said look at me.

601
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,723
<i>Jesus.</i>

602
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,634
- Look at it.
- What?

603
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,677
I said look at it.

604
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,017
I said-- don't you dare
look me in the eyes.

605
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,603
Look at it.

606
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,815
Don't-- don't you look me
in the eyes, I said.

607
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,604
- Look at it.
- This is crazy.

608
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,445
You want to see crazy, son?
Look-- look at it--

609
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,860
- Okay, okay.
- --with both eyes, both eyes.

610
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,996
Now don't you look up.
Don't you even think about looking up.

611
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,202
That's it.
You keep staring at it.

612
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,288
You want to be a real man?

613
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,545
You start by studying
a real man.

614
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,580
That's right.
Take it all in.

615
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,546
Pretty impressive, huh?

616
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,085
You know the sad part, son?

617
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,220
You're smart enough
to be running that place.

618
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,974
But what have you done there,
at that little tire company?

619
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,759
( Muttering )

620
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,020
Last summer,
they were thinking about

621
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,805
giving me my own
parking space.

622
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,646
Just like I thought.

623
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,187
You haven't done shit
and you never will.

624
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,321
Oh, and, Rodney,

625
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,323
I just got you
to stare at my penis.

626
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,655
( laughing )
Unbelievable.

627
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,164
Where have you been?

628
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,497
I was in the bathroom having
a heart-to-heart with your father.

629
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,254
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah. No, we talked.

630
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,132
He threatened me, made me stare
at his penis the whole time--

631
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,635
you know, typical future son-in-law,
father-in-law kind of stuff.

632
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,511
Okay, honey,
what's wrong with you?

633
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,469
You're acting weird.
You're sweating. You're pale.

634
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,349
Are you sick?

635
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,351
No, no, I'm not sick.
I'm just stressed out

636
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,353
with work--
stupid work stuff, okay?

637
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,014
I've been meaning to tell you.

638
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,352
It's just not the right place
to tell you--

639
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,313
- right here, you know?
- What?

640
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,650
Look, something big
went down at work.

641
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,860
Okay '

642
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,367
Why don't you share your big
work news with everybody, Rodney?

643
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,153
Oh, no, that's all right, J.R.
No one wants to hear about that stuff.

644
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,369
Sure, they do-- I mean, especially
if it's about your parking spot.

645
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,875
No, it's all right.
Really, no one wants to hear--

646
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,536
- No, no, no, no.
- ( glass clinks)

647
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,751
Attention, everyone.
Apparently Rodney has

648
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,382
some very big work news
he'd like to share with all of us.

649
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,545
No, no, really, J.R.
It's really not-- it's so boring.

650
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,055
You don't want to hear about it.
Party on.

651
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,715
Baby, it's okay.

652
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,475
We're all family here.
What is it?

653
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,556
Yeah, family, Rodney.

654
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,687
- I got a promotion.
- Oh, honey.

655
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,776
- Yes.
- That's great.

656
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,157
I'm so happy for you.
Why didn't you tell me?

657
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,239
Oh, I wanted to surprise you,

00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,398
'Cause there ain't gonna be
a fucking later.

677
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,158
You're a sorry
piece of shit.

678
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,163
J' We're out on the other side
tonight J'

679
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,871
J' Standing on the edge
and sleeping on tracks J'

680
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,082
J' Falling off the ledge,
slipping through cracks J'

681
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,919
J' Another night,
another night J'

682
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,176
J' Out on the other side... J'

683
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,928
( men lau Qh' om mg )

684
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,017
Ow. My balls hurt
from spilling coffee--

685
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,019
third-degree burns.

686
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,182
Well, at least your hands
aren't covered in paper cuts

687
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,724
from filing all day.

688
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,189
Oh, my God, those are nasty.
You should get that checked out.

689
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,668
Rough week, girls?

690
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,713
See you Monday.

691
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,170
We can't keep going on
like this.

692
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,755
There's got to be
a better way.

693
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,215
No.

694
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,424
<i>Yes.</i>

695
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,385
- No.
- Yes.

696
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,174
It's our only shot.

697
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,014
<i>Let's go.</i>

698
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,559
Fuck.

699
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,853
- He's sensitive.
- He's not.

700
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,068
Hey, guys.
We're here for the book club.

701
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,575
Jane invited us.

702
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,245
I did,

703
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,280
but that was
before Mike said

704
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,324
that he likes
to go to bars with--

705
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,368
I don't know.
What was it?

706
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,084
Half-naked women
swinging on poles?

707
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,748
Oh, no, he didn't.

708
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,418
Ain't no half-naked women
swinging around on no poles here.

709
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,585
Mm-mm.

710
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,925
A couple more of these, and I can
make that happen for you, Betty.

711
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,637
( laughs )

712
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,927
- You know I will.
- Save it.

713
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,972
We just wanted to say
that we realize

714
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,640
that we've treated you
pretty shitty over these years.

715
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,027
<i>-</i> Oh, pretty shitty?
- Okay, fine. Very shitty.

716
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,483
- And we're really sorry for that.
- Yeah.

717
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,149
We had no idea how hard yourjobs
were until this week.

718
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,488
Castro is making our lives
a living hell.

719
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,995
We suck as secretaries.

720
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,781
I mean, look at this guy's hands.
Look at these paper cuts.

721
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,792
We just really are
at the point

722
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,501
that we'd love to have
a little bit of your help, please.

723
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,133
They look infected.

724
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,919
What do you think, Jane?

725
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,097
Well, maybe we could help.

726
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,888
What's in it for us?

727
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,307
An-- anything you want.

728
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,397
<i>-</i> What-- what can we help you with?
- Yeah, what've you got?

729
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,155
I don't want to hear it.

730
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,987
I'm serious.
I'm really upset right now.

731
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,151
Oh, come on, the secretary league
has some good players.

732
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,695
Don't even.

733
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,489
This is some "League of Their Own"
bullshit, and you know it.

734
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,999
See "All My Children" yesterday?

735
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,332
Come on, pretty girl, right here.
Tina, come on--

736
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,665
Have they even won a game?

737
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,381
No, I don't think so.

738
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,341
Well, let's get this over with.

739
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,678
(sighs )

740
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,260
( game playing on TV)

741
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,139
Oh, hi, honey.

742
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,478
<i>- L-ley-
- HEY-</i>

743
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,860
What are you doing
home so early?

744
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,861
I thought tonight was softball.

745
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,024
Yeah, it was. I just didn't feel
like going after, that's all.

746
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,239
- Oh, that's a first.
- Yeah.

747
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,028
Oh, let me get this.
Give me your uniform.

748
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,789
Oh, no, I got these.
They're just covered in mud

749
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,949
You don't want to touch them.
What's all this?

750
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,710
Oh, sample wedding invitations.

751
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,713
I think I have narrowed it down
to the two that I like.

752
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,216
These-- I love the font for sure,

753
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,049
but I don't know.
It might be a little busy. And--

754
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,714
honey, what do you think?

755
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,891
That's incredible.
That's-- that's--

756
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,556
is this Helvetica?
That's a beautiful font.

757
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,225
What is it made from?
Is it, like, papyrus?

758
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,269
You're so full of shit.

759
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,903
- What?
- Go watch the game.

760
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,109
<i>-</i> Really?
- Oh, yeah.

761
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,363
- You're the best.
- I know.

762
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,900
Can I get a kiss?

763
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,443
We'll do this tomorrow?

764
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,906
- Okay.
- Saturday.

765
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,243
Don't turn your uniform
pink again.

766
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,460
It's your wedding.
She wants you to be involved.

767
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,245
So I'm the worst fiancé
of all time.

768
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,414
I'm just not into this
wedding planning stuff.

769
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,129
Use your imagination.
Think of it as, like, a bitchin' party

770
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,168
with neon lights
and techno music.

771
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,463
Mikey, Mikey, we're planning
my wedding, not a frat party.

772
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,257
J' When you want it,
you get it J'

773
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,426
J' 'Cause I am
sugar daddy's little girl J'

774
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,266
J' Sugar, sugar, sugar,
I'm sugar daddy's girl... J'

775
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,773
We get demoted
and he gets a new car?

776
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,774
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

777
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,436
Yeah, it's Ken Castro.

778
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,856
- No, just Ken.
- ( chirps )

779
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,743
Wait, does it come in ultra deluxe?
How about super ultra deluxe?

780
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,825
Hey, somebody want
to pick up that sign?

781
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,242
You know, Betty, there's a rule
against eating at your desk.

782
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,378
And let me tell you,
if you worked as hard as you ate,

783
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,959
maybe you'd get
somewhere in life, maybe.

784
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,591
Unless of course your goal is
to have your own gravitational pull

785
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,922
and become the 10th planet.

786
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,711
Then congratulations,
you're well on your way.

787
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,630
We'll have to clear
the desk out a little bit.

788
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,469
Hey, Castro, why don't you
lay off, man? Come on.

789
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,633
Stay out of this, McAdams.
This doesn't concern you.

790
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,145
Why don't you and Murphy go
jerk each other off in the copy room?

791
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,147
Now from now on,

792
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,650
you eat only at lunch
or on your break.

793
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,651
You got me?

794
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,438
Hey, do you got me?

795
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,491
Yes, Mr. Castro.

796
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,572
Now if you'll excuse me,

797
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,954
I gotta go drop the kids off
at the pool.

798
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,834
Why do you let him
talk to you like that?

799
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,494
You should stand up
for yourself.

800
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,288
What am I supposed to do?
Sue?

801
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,629
I need this job.
Besides, he ain't lying.

802
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,341
Look at me.
All I do is eat.

803
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,049
Rodney:
That's right. Stretch it out.

804
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,345
Are you guys sure about this?
I ain't never worked out before.

805
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,684
Come on, when we're done with you,
you're gonna look like Star Jones.

806
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,350
And that's a good thing?
She got all crazy when she got skinny.

807
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,565
Hey, you gotta take
the good with the bad.

808
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:37,028
Shit, I guess I'd rather be crazy
and skinny than fat and miserable.

809
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,693
- There you go.
- Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

810
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,861
All right, that's our girl.
Come on now, go break a sweat.

811
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,622
<i>-</i> Okay.
- Ready? And go!

812
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,952
- There you go.
- There you go. Light on your toes.

813
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,375
Take it easy at first.

814
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,462
23 minutes, 42 seconds.
One more lap.

815
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,092
Rodney:
Lance Armstrong would be proud.

816
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,221
Good job, Betty.
You run like a champion.

817
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,716
This workout stuff's fun.

818
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,052
I like it.

819
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,971
You think we're pushing her
too hard?

820
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,686
Nah. Look at her.
She's having a ball out there.

821
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,943
She's like a wild stallion.

822
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,445
( Chuckles )

823
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,776
<i>-</i> Oh, Lordy.
- Oh, Shit.

824
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,525
Okay, people,

825
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,242
rules are going to be strictly
enforced at this company now.

826
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,657
It is 8:58, people.

827
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,498
That means you have two minutes
to get inside and get to your desk,

828
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,129
'cause we start at 9:00 sharp.

829
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,632
Oh, hey.

830
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,877
Hey, uh, uh...

831
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,420
Soon-Yi, right?

832
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,089
- It's Olivia.
- Oh.

833
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,757
<i>-</i> Mr. Castro, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

834
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,018
- Who's this little guy?
- Oh, this is my son Jack.

835
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,271
I tried to get him a sitter for today,
but she's in school.

836
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,432
So you're just gonna bring him
up to the office?

837
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,523
- He's so quiet.
- Yeah, he does look quiet.

838
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,438
Hey, I've got a great idea--
get that thing out of here.

839
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,949
Move it. Get it back home.
Get rid of it.

840
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,656
All right, come on, folks,
let's move it.

841
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,659
( Hisses )

842
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,448
Thank you very much.
Have a great day.

843
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,162
Thanks.

844
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,702
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

845
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,121
You're here, like, every freakin' day.
What gives?

846
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,164
Nothing gives.

847
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,333
Why don't you put the bong down
and go make some coffee?

848
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,838
You're, like, their coffee bitch?

849
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,177
What did you just call me?
Coffee bitch?

850
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,217
Ha ha, that's funny, yeah.
No, go ahead, keep talking.

851
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,886
Call me a coffee bitch one more time.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

852
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,057
I will pole-vault over this counter
and shove a cappuccino up your ass.

853
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,725
You got it?
No one calls me coffee bitch.

854
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,644
Whatever.

855
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,653
There he is.

856
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,485
Coffee bitch in the house.

857
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,867
Oh, there's my little girl,
my favorite secretary.

858
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,823
Why don't you take me a memo--
suck my co--

859
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,704
Argh! Jesus!
I told you, double-cup it.

860
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,491
I have very tender fingers.
I need two cups, you dumb dummy.

861
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,331
What took you so long?

862
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,088
This better be decaf. You know,
regular messes up my boner meds.

863
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,168
Oh, shit.

864
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,838
Hey, O'Donnell, I want that report
on my desk in an hour. You got it?

865
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,598
<i>-</i> What-- what report?
- Just do it, O'Donnell.

866
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,010
Shit, did I forget something?

867
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,887
Hi, honey.
What are you doing here?

868
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,978
I don't know. I thought I'd, you know,
stop in and surprise you.

869
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,605
So which one's
your new office?

870
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh, baby, you don't want
to see my office.

871
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,859
- It's so boring.
- I do.

872
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,568
No, please. It's just--
it's a desk. It's a chair

873
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,404
They painted it today.
The fumes are nasty.

874
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,910
Wait, I don't care
if they painted it.

875
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,492
No, but they're really bad.
It's toxic. You'll faint. You'll faint.

876
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,952
I promise.
It's horrible in there.

877
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,288
Oh, God.

878
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,420
Okay, if I can't see your office,
then let me take you to lunch.

879
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,455
Where's Nancy?

880
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,171
Uh, you know what?
Today's really not so good for me.

881
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,335
I've got a lot going on.

882
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,129
I don't think--

883
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,764
<i>-</i> What, you can't take a lunch?
- I'd really like to, but--

884
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,641
- Mr. McAdams.
- What?

885
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,768
They're looking for you
in the conference room

886
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,895
for your lunch meeting.

887
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,935
Oh. Oh, my lunch meeting.

888
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,523
Of course.
Thank you, Jane.

889
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,733
Uh-huh, sure.

890
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,738
Thank you, Jane.
My lunch meeting.

891
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,365
See, I've got this big
lunch meeting.

892
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,242
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just not a good day.

893
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,405
I understand.
Okay, well, I will see you tonight.

894
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,618
Yes. Yes, you will.

895
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,157
- Bye.
- Bye.

896
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,543
So I'm gonna go
back to work.

897
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,579
I'm not gonna like it.

898
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,590
- Rodney.
- Yeah?

899
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,047
I'm so proud of you.

900
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,928
I really am.
The whole promotion and everything--

901
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,432
I'm just-- I just wanted
to tell you that.

902
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,093
Thanks.

903
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,183
Okay, don't work too hard.

904
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,222
Bye.

905
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,440
That was one hell of a save
back there, Jane.

906
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,950
Thanks for that.
What a great bluff.

907
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,110
These idiots should have you
working in sales.

908
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,494
Oh, please.

909
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,156
I've been trying to get in sales
here for 10 years now.

910
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,041
It'll never happen.

911
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,545
In case you hadn't noticed, women
don't get promoted in this company.

912
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,456
Rodney, this is still
an old-fashioned tire company.

913
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,967
It's a boys' club.
You know that.

914
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,045
Your girlfriend
doesn't know, does she?

915
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,136
Oh, no, that's my fiancée.

916
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,641
Oh.

917
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,849
Yeah. And I am
gonna tell her,

918
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,513
maybe.

919
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,521
Well, it's complicated.
Her father wants to crush my nuts.

920
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,651
Well, that'll smart.

921
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,197
She's your fiancée--
priorities.

922
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,030
Take care of that,
nuts and all.

923
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,791
Frank: Nancy, get in here
and light my cigarette,

924
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,793
<i>-</i> you piece of shit.
- Yes, sir.

925
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,043
Okay, this report
is incomplete.

926
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,759
And the pages
aren't even in order.

927
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,059
And is some of this
written in pencil?

928
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,810
Well, the ink on my printer
went out, so...

929
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,017
I don't know how to work
the cartridge thingy.

930
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,022
You're unbelievable.

931
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,058
Okay, yesterday, you spilled

932
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,853
a full box of paper clips
into my paper shredder.

933
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,362
- It was an accident.
- And before that,

934
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,694
you connected my conference call
to a Chinese restaurant.

935
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,530
Ordering your Chinese takeout.

936
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,694
And there were
a lot of lines going,

937
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,363
and one of them was
a three-way call and--

938
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,623
Okay, you know what?
Speaking of three-way,

939
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,206
what about the porn
that you synced to my BlackBerry?

940
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,539
Are you sure that wasn't
already there?

941
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,300
Which, by the way,
I cannot get off.

942
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,926
- ( Knocks on door)
- Yes?

943
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,211
Excuse me, Miss Holland.

944
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,051
I just wondered if I could
borrow Mike for a minute.

945
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,806
I've got an errand
I need him to run.

946
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,967
Don't you have your own
secretary, Kenny?

947
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,351
- Ken.
- It's Ken.

948
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,387
And she's a bit preoccupied.

949
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,728
I got her over at my place
waiting for the cable guy, so...

950
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,268
Fine. Go.

951
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,402
All right, cleaned and pressed
this time, all right?

952
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,983
- And tell them--
- Don't push it, Kenny.

953
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,444
You don't push it.

954
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,156
New secretaries--

955
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,743
sometimes it takes a little bit
to break 'em in, you know?

956
00:44:58,905 --> 00:44:59,997
Not really.

957
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,659
I don't send my secretaries out
on personal errands.

958
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,202
Oh.

959
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,245
Well, you should.
It's fantastic.

960
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,756
It's like having
little elves, you know?

961
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,795
All right, <i>so</i> how's it going?

962
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,257
How are you liking Treadline?

963
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,798
<i>-</i> A fun group, huh?
- Yes, very fun.

964
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,434
Yeah, we try to-- we try to,
you know, have fun.

965
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,311
Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay, thanks.

966
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,097
Sometimes, you know,
we'll go after work

967
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,766
and we'll go to Ding Dongs and--
you know, they have a sports--

968
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,856
- Thank you, no.
- Oh, you gotta go. It's fun.

969
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,862
I was gonna get a group of people--
maybe not even a group.

970
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,820
You don't want to get overwhelmed.
Why don't we go down-- the two of us?

971
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,108
- Huh?
- No.

972
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,949
Anyway, I'm-- you know,
I'm over in that side of the hall.

973
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,079
And my door is always
open to you.

974
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,708
Okay, could you--
could you close my door?

975
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,958
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

976
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,290
You know, I meant that
in, like, a spiritual way,

977
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,876
so that it was like, you know--
it's a symbolic thing.

978
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,964
So the door may be closed,
but, hey, it's open to you.

979
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,299
You know, could you
open the door,

980
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,011
you out, close?
Than ks.

981
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,596
<i>-</i> Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, you're busy.
- Yes, very busy.

982
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,013
Um, okay.
Well, I will let you get to it.

983
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,476
<i>-</i> Okay, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

984
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,357
Goodbye.
Thank you, Ken.

985
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,984
Okay. Hey, do you like
Greek food?

986
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,644
No, no, I don't eat.

987
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,154
- Lamb?
- No.

988
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,565
<i>-</i> A vegetarian, eh?
- Okay. Uh-huh. Bye-bye.

989
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,326
<i>-</i> Ship up, shape out.
- "Ship out." Thank you.

990
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,328
Do you--
do you like movies?

991
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,330
No. No, I don't.

992
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,741
- How about TV?
- No.

993
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,626
All right.
Um, well, if you get hungry--

994
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,958
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- Are you fixed good for cash?

995
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,670
- I'm great. Thank you so much.
- Okay. All right.

996
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,505
Goodbye.

997
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,094
Goodbye. Okay.

998
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,096
- Ken: This will be it.
- That's it.

999
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,303
( Exhales )
Wow.

1000
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,888
You should have seen her.
I mean, she completely bailed me out.

1001
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,598
Well, that is great for you.

1002
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,184
Meanwhile, my boss thinks
I'm an idiot

1003
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,351
and Castro's got me running around
like his personal slave.

1004
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,981
The good news is

1005
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,071
I've dropped, like, two sizes
drinking this stuff.

1006
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,782
(woman sobbing )

1007
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,755
(sniffling )

1008
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,015
So at dinner

1009
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,769
we got really buzzed
off Dreamsicle daiquiris.

1010
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,350
It was really romantic.

1011
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,107
And then we did
the whole movie thing.

1012
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,564
And he put his arm
around me

1013
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,729
and we shared a Coke.

1014
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,773
And I looked up
at the screen.

1015
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,782
There were those cute little
snack guys

1016
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,818
telling you to go
to the lobby

1017
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,783
and get yourselves a treat.

1018
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,664
And so I was like,
"Hell, yeah, he deserves a treat."

1019
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,167
You know, so I just gave him
a quick hand job

1020
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,829
underneath his popcorn bowl.

1021
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,625
And then we went
back to his house.

1022
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,920
And it was so amazing,
you guys.

1023
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,965
We did it twice
on the balcony.

1024
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,304
And the second time
he had me doggy-style.

1025
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,140
And it was so beautiful.

1026
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,805
We were looking over
the city lights.

1027
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,271
And the exact moment
he spooged,

1028
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,481
a shooting star went by.

1029
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,944
It was magical,

1030
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:22,985
like a fucking Disney movie.

1031
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,997
But then I come in here today

1032
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,999
and he completely ignores me.

1033
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:35,834
It's like he just used me
for sex or something.

1034
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,341
All the guys here
are such jerks.

1035
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,003
( Sobbing )

1036
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,352
And she's screaming,
"Oh, O'Donnell, you're so big."

1037
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,639
And I'm like, "Damn straight I am."
And she's like--

1038
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,854
- O'Donnell, O'Donnell,
- O'Donnell, your ass is mine.

1039
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,860
<i>-</i> Hey, what's up, guys?
- Don't "What's up" us.

1040
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,021
We just finished having a little
conversation with our friend Tina.

1041
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,405
You remember
who Tina is, don't you?

1042
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,533
Come on, guys,
I mean, that chick's a whore.

1043
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,194
Everybody in the office
has boned her.

1044
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,408
She's not a whore.
She's an angel.

1045
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,871
- ( Coughing )
- Here's what's gonna happen:

1046
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,410
You're gonna apologize and then
you're gonna buy her some flowers.

1047
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,204
Yeah, big ones.
Two dozen red roses.

1048
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,873
Do you have any idea
how much that's gonna cost me?

1049
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,215
Okay, man, just put down the stapler.
Man, just put down the stapler.

1050
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,095
( Coughing )

1051
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,801
And that goes for the rest
of you clowns.

1052
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,717
Any of you mess with our girls--
you'll have to deal with us.

1053
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,397
Hell, yeah.

1054
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,190
Maybe we can get her into,
like, an AA program

1055
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,025
for women addicted to dick.

1056
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:45,032
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Like DA-- Dicks Anonymous?

1057
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,864
Yeah.

1058
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,447
( Birds screeching )

1059
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,170
This is a great
change of pace, Earl.

1060
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,752
Actually, do you mind if I call
you Earl? Can I call you Earl?

1061
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,462
Actually, no, you can't.

1062
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,844
See, Rodney,

1063
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,096
I ain't like other bosses.

1064
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,222
I like to get out of the office

1065
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,554
every once in a while
and have some fun.

1066
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,846
Oh, I love fun.
Fun and me are like best pals.

1067
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,233
Everybody, this is Rodney.

1068
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,235
Rodney, this here is
the killing crew.

1069
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,773
Rodney, we're gonna give you
approximately--

1070
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,739
what do you think, boys?
About five minutes?

1071
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,246
We're gonna give you
a five-minute head start.

1072
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,578
A five-minute head start
for what?

1073
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,624
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
-( men laughing)

1074
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:43,667
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

1075
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,926
You're our prey today, son.

1076
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,427
You'd best get moving, boy.

1077
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,808
- ( Guns clicking )
- Oh, shit.

1078
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,265
Ow.

1079
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,646
Hmm.

1080
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,398
You know what?
Fuck the five minutes.

1081
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,184
Let's go get some
fresh meat, boys.

1082
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,773
Hooah!

1083
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,486
( Phone ringing )

1084
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,997
- Hello.
- Mike: Hey, where are you?

1085
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,498
It's lunchtime.
I'm starving.

1086
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,159
I'm about ready to eat
this freakin' memo pad.

1087
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,123
Yeah, I'm not actually gonna
make lunch today.

1088
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,788
I've got a bit of a situation
here, Mikey.

1089
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,548
- Are you running?
- Yes, I'm fucking running.

1090
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,010
Oh, fuck.

1091
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,847
Hey, guys.
Hey, you win.

1092
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,008
<i>-</i> Oh, shit.
- Light him up.

1093
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,679
( Rodney screaming )

1094
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,314
Argh! Ow. Ow.

1095
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,697
Paintball? It all just seems
a little macho to me.

1096
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:52,326
Honey, I told you it was a bonding
exercise with my sales team.

1097
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,953
Besides, I'm their boss.

1098
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,160
They have to know
that I'm a great leader,

1099
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:01,044
that I can kick some ass, which,
by the way, is exactly what I did.

1100
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,704
Are you sure it wasn't
the other way around?

1101
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,375
Oh, these?
Are you kidding me?

1102
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,215
You know what these are?
These are defensive wounds, okay?

1103
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,755
I got these
shielding my teammates.

1104
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,800
Oh, okay, so you were--

1105
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,559
you were, like,
protecting them?

1106
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,391
Yes. Yes, hell, yeah.

1107
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,476
- That's hot.
- Yeah. You like that?

1108
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,061
That's really hot.

1109
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,225
Really hot? You want me to show
you exactly how I did it?

1110
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,190
- I do.
- Okay, put that magazine down.

1111
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,730
Here I come.

1112
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,364
<i>-</i> Come here.
- It's all this paint.

1113
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,069
<i>-</i> Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Oh, honey.

1114
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,735
- Ow. Fuck.
- Honey, oh.

1115
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,745
No, no, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

1116
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,872
Can I get you some ice?

1117
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,284
No, I need, like, an ice suit.

1118
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,790
So let me get this straight:

1119
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,954
your boss stalked you through
the woods like a fucking ferret

1120
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,419
and you're gonna tell Jennifer
that it was a training exercise?

1121
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,425
I had to tell her something.
She's getting suspicious.

1122
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,927
- Whoa.
- Oh.

1123
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,135
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh-uh.

1124
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,265
Good morning, ladies.

1125
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,892
Morning, Kenny.
How's your ass?

1126
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,724
Was your boyfriend
gentle on you last night?

1127
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,638
Ha ha, you're a real
comedian, Murphy.

1128
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,274
And it's Ken, God damn it.
How many times I gotta tell you that?

1129
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,811
Oh, we're sorry. How about Fuckface?
Does that work for you?

1130
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,399
Blow a horse, McAdams.

1131
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,280
No, I'm good.
I'll leave the animal rape to you.

1132
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,569
Uh, it's not rape if you blow something.
That's not rape.

1133
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,112
What is with the roadblock?

1134
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,406
Does Treadline have some al-Qaeda
on the loose or what's up?

1135
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,745
You know, corporate asked me
to make some cutbacks,

1136
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,002
so I thought I'd start with
secretary parking.

1137
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,130
- These are all rental spaces.
- Okay, where are we supposed to park?

1138
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,337
All the secretaries are gonna be able
to park on Walnut.

1139
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,673
<i>-</i> Walnut?
- That's, like, a mile walk from here.

1140
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,838
Castro, it's, like, 100
outside today.

1141
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,803
I know.
It's a real scorcher, isn't it?

1142
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,640
I don't know if it's been this hot
in a long time--

1143
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,224
probably global warming.

1144
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,310
You should see what
my nutsack feels like.

1145
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,817
All right, have fun walking,
bitches.

1146
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,359
Castro is gonna pay for this. It's like
the fucking Sahara out here today.

1147
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,995
Tell me about it. I'm definitely
gonna have swamp ass all day now.

1148
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,497
You and me both.

1149
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,329
My front side
ain't doing too good either.

1150
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,799
Yes, Miss Holland would like to know
if she can reschedule her 2:00, please.

1151
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,341
There he is, right on time,
going to take his morning shit.

1152
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,635
Just like clockwork.
This guy is so predictable.

1153
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,640
Good morning.
Mr. Frank's office.

1154
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,900
No, he's not in.
Can I take a message?

1155
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,277
Will do.
Thank you.

1156
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,535
Break it up, ladies.
This isn't "The View."

1157
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,220
( phone rings )

1158
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,597
Hello. Mr. Castro's office.

1159
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,384
- He's in.
- Got ya.

1160
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,119
What the fuck is this?

1161
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,664
<i>-</i> Which one is it?
- How the fuck should I know?

1162
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,549
I'm not a scientist.
This shit's complicated.

1163
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,210
- Whatever. Just turn them all.
- All right.

1164
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,928
' ( Qrunts )
'( Plops )

1165
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,842

1166
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,261
Right there.

1167
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,607
( Pipes clanking )

1168
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,269
Yeah, that's good.

1169
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,701
Oh, fudge.

1170
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,286
( Low rumbling )

1171
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,825
Oh!

00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,133
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus!

1175
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,294
( Screaming )
Oh, Jesus!

1176
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,923
Oh, it's going up my nose.
Oh, mother.

1177
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,430
What the shit?

1178
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,687
Oh.

1179
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,566
No' no, no,

1180
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,778
Oh, shit.

1181
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,109
Oh, my-- fuck.

1182
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,983
Shh. Go back.

1183
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,785
She's got promise.

1184
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,833
J' I've been watching the birds
as they go J'

1185
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,297
J' And I've been keeping
my bank account low J'

1186
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,133
J' I've been keeping
my end of the deal... J'

1187
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,969
- ( crowd cheering )
- J' With St. Anthony and St. Thomas J'

1188
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,680
J' My little sister gave it
a hell of a try J'

1189
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,970
J' You know, I hear it gets worse
when you die J'

1190
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,480
J' I can't believe you got me
waiting for another year J'

1191
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,687
J' But if you ever make it back,
I'll be here J'

1192
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,851
J' And I'll be ready,
I promise <i>I</i>

1193
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,194
J' I promise... J'

1194
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,026
Open all the way.

1195
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,820
J' I hear your voice J'

1196
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,409
J' Say things to me J'

1197
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,700
J' But I get up for nothing J'

1198
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,368
J' 'Cause I'm afraid to see... J'

1199
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,377
- No, no, no, no.
- Tina.

1200
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,710
J' Every day is so twisted,
I know you won't give in J'

1201
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,547
J' But I'll still be here J'

1202
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,053
J' If you want me back again J'

1203
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,385
- J' I promise... J'
- Whoa, shit.

1204
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,848
J' I promise... J'

1205
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,859
- ( cheering )
- J' I try to count the chimes J'

1206
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,528
J' Water the flowers
above the sink sometimes J'

1207
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,823
J' I listen to your records J'

1208
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,242
J' Do you still have mine? J'

1209
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,910
J' Every day is so twisted... J'

1210
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,579
-( Betty giggling )
- J' I know you won't give in J'

1211
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,544
J' So I promise not to try J'

1212
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,709
- J' To make it breathe again... J'
- Mr. Frank's office.

1213
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,298
- Here he is right now.
- J' I promise... J'

1214
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,451
Mike?

1215
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,408
Oh, hey.

1216
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,994
Don't mind me.

1217
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:58,752
Okay. Excuse me, I just meant
to take this with me on Friday.

1218
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,413
What are you doing here
on a Saturday?

1219
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,005
Just catching up
on some work, organizing.

1220
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,046
Nobody likes
a sloppy secretary.

1221
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,306
Right.

1222
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,810
Okay.
( chuckles )

1223
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,682
Hey!

1224
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,022
Are you hungry?

1225
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,109
Do you want to maybe
grab some lunch?

1226
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,823
Yeah.

1227
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,737
<i>-</i> Yeah?
- Yeah. Now?

1228
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,530
( Chuckles )

1229
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,496
Oh. Oh! Good job.

1230
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,504
When you said, "lunch,"
I didn't expect you to take me bowling.

1231
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,506
Okay, first of all,
despite this being a bowling alley,

1232
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,633
it happens to serve
the best pizza in the city.

1233
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:51,388
And second, you know,
I've been kind of hard on you.

1234
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,844
And lately you've really
stepped it up.

1235
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:58,308
So, I don't know,
I guess it's the least I can do.

1236
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,936
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1237
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,822
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

1238
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,402
Yeah !

1239
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,363
<i>-</i> Size seven.
- Okay.

1240
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,031
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1241
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,870
Thanks for this.
It was really fun.

1242
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,909
Yeah, it was fun.

1243
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,828
But, listen, you know,

1244
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,213
you might not want to mention this
to anybody in the office.

1245
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,749
Technically, I'm your boss.

1246
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,542
Yeah, right, that's true.
They might think

1247
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,551
that we were dating
or something

1248
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,714
or that you were trying
to sexually harass me,

1249
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,804
which, you know--
which, by the way, would be fine.

1250
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,436
I'd be totally cool with that,
if, you know--

1251
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,564
I mean, I wouldn't tell anybody.
I wouldn't report you.

1252
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,599
Right.

1253
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,234
Good to know.

1254
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,441
- Yeah.
- Uh, okay.

1255
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,446
- I'm gonna get going.
- Yeah.

1256
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,825
- Okay. CR3)!
- Okay. Okay

1257
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,534
Come on. God.

1258
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,373
Jesus Christ, you didn't tell me
he was coming.

1259
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,458
Honey, he wants to be
involved, okay?

1260
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,588
First of all, I didn't know
you were coming.

1261
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,920
Let's all just try
to get along today.

1262
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,426
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, honey.

1263
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,843
How's my little girl?
Let's go. Today, Rodney.

1264
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,929
Rodney: NASCAR-style.
Watch your head.

1265
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,809
Watch your head, sweetie.

1266
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,060
<i>-</i> J.R.: Okay, all in?
- Yep.

1267
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,221
- ( Tires screech )
- Whoa.

1268
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,447
I hope you boys are ready,

1269
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,608
'cause we've got a lot
of shopping to do.

1270
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,029
Come on, rookie.

1271
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,124
Rodney: Jesus, stop fucking
hitting me, J.R.

1272
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,956
J.R.:
Come on.

1273
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,788
These are them.

1274
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,791
Don't mess with the big fella.

1275
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,015
Mm. That's the one.

1276
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,642
No.

1277
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,552
-( laughing )
- I-ley, hey.

1278
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,481
- Yeah, I like this one.
- Okay, uh-huh.

1279
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:10,815
Yes!

1280
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,943
Okay, so, guys,
we need to find

1281
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,611
a centerpiece.

1282
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,702
A centerpiece for the tables--
that's what we're looking for, okay?

1283
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,332
Okay '

1284
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,702
Oh.

1285
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,712
<i>-</i> I got it first, J.R. Get your own.
- No, no, no, no, I had it first.

1286
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,544
What are you talking about?
I got my hand on it first.

1287
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,380
Don't mess with me, Rodney.
I'm a war veteran.

1288
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,636
What are you talking about?
You were in the Coast Guard.

1289
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,344
<i>-</i> What do you mean by that?
- Just give me the-- just give it.

1290
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,383
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

1291
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,517
This is a store,
for God's sakes.

1292
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,850
You guys, is it possible for us
to have one day--

1293
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,061
just one day
where you two get along?

1294
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,066
- Negative.
- No.

1295
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,820
You can't keep arguing
with your future father-in-law.

1296
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,030
It's not healthy.

1297
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,536
No, what's not healthy is his ability
to be such an asshole.

1298
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,948
At least you're not falling
for your boss,

1299
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:07,414
who, as it turns out, is cool as shit.
Totally different outside the office.

1300
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,202
- What? The auditor chick? Really?
- Yeah.

1301
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,962
Most girls you date
can't even add.

1302
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,714
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what's happening.

1303
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,045
I haven't wanted to go to
a strip club in, like, three weeks.

1304
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,758
Today is a big day
for Treadline.

1305
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,924
Hell, I'd say it's the biggest day
in this company's history.

1306
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,718
Any minute now
we're gonna get word

1307
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,889
that we have closed
the Reilly Auto Parts deal.

1308
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,432
Yeah !

1309
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,692
We're with the big dogs now.

1310
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,728
Gel Pumped!

1311
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,692
Get fired up.

1312
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,072
Yeah.

1313
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,075
I know.
It's exciting stuff, huh?

1314
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,407
Yeah, I should know.
I put the deal together myself.

1315
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,744
But I can pretty much imagine
what you're all thinking,

1316
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,750
and I'll tell you what--
I'll make it easy on you.

1317
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,252
You're welcome.

1318
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,460
I will be accepting cash
andlor gifts

1319
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,876
as tokens of gratitude
for all the hard work I've done.

1320
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,420
Huh?

1321
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,304
Now-- oh.

1322
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,057
I'm a little low.
You want to top me off?

1323
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,684
Come on, sugar bottom.
You want to help me out?

1324
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,891
Yeah, honey buns, you.
That's right.

1325
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,931
Get coffee for your boss.
All right, now

1326
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,691
<i>who's got business
they want to discuss?</i>

1327
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,103
Kline: Yeah, Ken, seems we have
an international kerfuffle--

1328
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,317
Actually, I've got one quick thing.
I don't know who it is

1329
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,905
that's been putting copies of the movie
"Nine to Five" on my chair,

1330
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,662
- but it is really not cool-- not cool.
- ( men chuckling )

1331
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,448
I said business, Murphy.

1332
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,333
Sorry, Kline.
What were you saying?

1333
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,665
Ken, listen, seems that--

1334
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,545
( men exclaim, laugh )

1335
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,957
Jesus Christ, McAdams.

1336
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,717
This is awful. What are you trying
to do-- poison me?

1337
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,971
Go to Biggby's,
get me some real coffee.

1338
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,593
Hey, coffee bitch is making a run.
Anybody want anything?

1339
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:50,729
- I'm gonna get a latte, double.
- I want a grande latte with soy.

1340
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,390
O'Donnell: I need a decaf.
We've already been over the reason.

1341
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,479
- We don't need to talk about it.
- Grab me a cappuccino?

1342
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,110
Bite me.

1343
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,616
Hey, look who's back
for, like, a thousandth time.

1344
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,652
Let me guess:
you want some coffee?

1345
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,696
Ain't that right,

1346
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,364
coffee bitch?

1347
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,748
Really?

1348
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,876
Whoa.
(woman screaming )

1349
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,837
Rodney:
Who's the coffee bitch now?

1350
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,422
That little shit blinded me
with coffee grinds, right?

1351
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,885
So I grabbed this stale muffin
and I hauled off a 90mph fastball.

1352
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,516
I nailed him right in the forehead
and knocked his ass out.

1353
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,348
Awesome. What's next?

1354
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,979
Are you gonna pick a fight with
the retarded kid that works at Subway?

1355
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,640
Shut up.

1356
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,729
Ooh.

1357
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,019
Mike: Are those guys
from corporate?

1358
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,608
- It's a misunderstanding.
- I hope they fired Castro.

1359
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,196
Not exactly, but they did
chew him a new a-hole.

1360
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,486
And you didn't get
fucking donuts.

1361
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,872
Apparently the Reilly
Auto Parts deal

1362
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,828
fell apart at the last second.

1363
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,540
<i>-</i> Oh, shit.
- Take cover.

1364
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,376
( Ken yelling )

1365
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,212
Fucking plant!
You stupid--

1366
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,715
Wow.

1367
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,261
- Hey: guys'
- Hey.

1368
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,146
I know we call it
"the book club,"

1369
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,478
but I didn't think
we actually took it seriously.

1370
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,517
Oh, no, no, it's not like that.

1371
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,063
I take nursing classes at night
and I've got a final coming up.

1372
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,028
Oh, that's nice.

1373
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,569
Hey!

1374
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,408
Can I ask you guys
for some advice?

1375
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,117
Yeah, sure.

1376
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,409
I mean, if it's about any kind of,
you know, women's issues,

1377
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,794
you know, down there,

1378
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,205
we're not technically
medically qualified to answer.

1379
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,248
Please, please forgive him.
He's a little slow.

1380
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,507
Go ahead.
What do you need? Shoot.

1381
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,419
See, I've got my anniversary
coming up

1382
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,135
and I have no idea
what to get my husband.

1383
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,141
He's really difficult
to shop for and--

1384
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,770
- Blow job
- Blow job

1385
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,273
Excuse me,

1386
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,933
did you just say"?

1387
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,273
Yeah, a blow job.
You know, like a hummer, sucking off

1388
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,734
Giving head,
smoking the bone, fellatio--

1389
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,365
it goes by many names.

1390
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,743
And it's probably the best five
minutes a man could ever ask for.

1391
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,780
That is what you should get him
for your anniversary as a present.

1392
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,289
<i>-</i> Really?
- Mmmmm.

1393
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,290
- That's it?
- That is it.

1394
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,666
Look at that.

1395
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,954
Wow, so, you know, I've been totally
overthinking this whole thing.

1396
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,838
Most women usually do.

1397
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,422
But, hey, no half-assing it.
You go downtown on that thing, okay?

1398
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,678
Like you did when you first
started dating.

1399
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,305
Yeah, lick his balls.
That's an extra added bonus.

1400
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,262
Balls, balls--
ball-licking is awesome.

1401
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,301
You should be
writing this down.

1402
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,311
- Okay, uh...
- Licking his balls.

1403
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,646
- Oh, "licking his balls"?
- Yeah.

1404
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:45,108
The thing is, Bob and I--
we're into making romance.

1405
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,238
And scrotum-licking
sounds like...

1406
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,616
- No, it's very romantic.
- ...some crazy Internet thing.

1407
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,367
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, you build up to romance

1408
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,824
and then you start going crazy.
You gotta like it, all right?

1409
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,910
And if you don't like it,
you gotta pretend like you like it.

1410
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,494
- No, you gotta like it.
- 'Cause he's gonna love it.

1411
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:00,001
What do you like in life?
What do you like to do?

1412
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,002
Well...

1413
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,539
oh, I love antique shopping.

1414
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,674
Antique shopping?
You gotta suck his dick

1415
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,336
like you are antique shopping.
You know what I'm saying?

1416
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,005
Rodney: Honestly, in your mind,
if you concentrate really hard

1417
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,548
and make that cock
like an antique,

1418
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,217
like the most beautiful antique
you've ever seen--

1419
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,852
Are you sure a brand-new DVD player
wouldn't be better?

1420
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,228
No, fuck the DVD.

1421
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,809
No, no, no, you are
a smart girl, okay?

1422
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,521
Listen, bottom line--
just suck that cock.

1423
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,685
Yep, that pretty much
sums it up.

1424
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,197
Okay '

1425
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,074
Good job, all right, but we need
to go faster here, all right?

1426
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,368
I don't have all day. Come on.
Are you going--

1427
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,127
are you gonna get
that one down? Good.

1428
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,755
All right, guys, also, hey,
I asked for 10 guys

1429
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,256
and they gave me six,
all right?

1430
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,088
I think one of them is gay,
so five and a half.

1431
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,923
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1432
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,339
More budget cuts. Castro's knocking
down our break room.

1433
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:58,430
He says that it's an extra expense
the company can't afford any more.

1434
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,938
Oh, come on, girl, don't cry.
And they took our coffee machine.

1435
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:05,100
<i>-</i> They're taking away all the Slim-Fast.
- And now I'm gonna get fat.

1436
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,190
Get me some more of these
slag-hammer things.

1437
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,776
And somebody bring me up
my "Maxim" magazine.

1438
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,487
Hey, Castro, you can't do this.
You can't take our break room.

1439
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,448
( Crowd exclaims )

1440
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,742
I think I just did.

1441
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,617
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1442
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,323
But that turned out to be--

1443
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:01,865
Oh, now what is this?

1444
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,875
What is this?

1445
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,583
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1446
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:08,871
( laughing )

1447
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,416
<i>-</i> Okay, yeah, that's great.
- The joke's over.

1448
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,007
Yeah, why don't you go--
why don't you go protest?

1449
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,547
<i>-</i> Why don't you go out and have--?
- Kline: Not gonna happen.

1450
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,467
- Nice sign.
- There'll never be a union.

1451
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,933
Why don't you get one of those
giant inflatable rats?

1452
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,223
- Rats.
- You know? Right?

1453
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,936
- Rodney: What do we want?
- Union.

1454
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,521
- When do we want it?
- Now.

1455
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,561
- What do we want?
- Union.

1456
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,651
- When do we want it?
- Now.

1457
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,281
- What do we want?
- Union.

1458
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,034
They're so any"!!-

1459
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,035
We're standing here at Treadline
with Mike Murphy

1460
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,492
where the secretaries have walked out.
Mike, what's going on?

1461
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,828
You're witnessing something
beautiful here right now.

1462
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,493
What you're seeing
is people who have decided

1463
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,751
they're not gonna take it any more.

1464
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,504
So we're just a bunch of girls out here
fighting for our rights.

1465
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,165
- When do we want it?
- Now.

1466
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,129
But you're a man.

1467
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:58,013
I'm a man? Well, on the outside,
that may be true,

1468
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,516
but here on the inside, where it
counts, we're all the same.

1469
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,803
- Ken, Ken, Ken.
- Yeah, what?

1470
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,687
- Ken.
- Yeah.

1471
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,567
There are no more fucking donuts.
This is a nightmare.

1472
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:14,104
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Treadline shit has got to go.

1473
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,068
Hey, hey, ho, ho,

1474
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,903
Treadline shit has got to go.

1475
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,695
Shame on Treadline.
Take that, Castro.

1476
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,705
Oh, that is uncalled for.

1477
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,868
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Treadline shit has got to go.

1478
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,457
One of them just peed
on the company flag.

1479
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,463
Whoo!

1480
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:35,717
Whoo! Yow!

1481
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,262
- ( Alarm blaring )
- Oh, not the Z, not--!

1482
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,312
You got me, Castro?
You got me?

1483
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,940
Do you got me, Castro?

1484
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,897
- I love it. Do you got me, Castro?
- Mike: I am tired...

1485
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,903
-( laughing )
- ...of the sexual innuendos

1486
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,064
- and dirty looks!
- Crowd: Yeah!

1487
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,825
And what about the dirty
little nicknames they give us?

1488
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,781
Boo!

1489
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:05,493
Cupcake.

1490
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,282
Sugar tits!

1491
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,122
( Crowd shouting )
No!

1492
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,662
Whore!

1493
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,085
Well-- well--

1494
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,095
- well, not any more.
- No!

1495
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,757
No, not on my watch.

1496
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,766
Yeah !

1497
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,599
- Not on our watch.
- Yeah!

1498
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,855
No, today--

1499
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,936
today is a new day.

1500
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,943
Today and every day

1501
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,321
from now
until the end of time

1502
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,608
will be known
as secretaries' day!

We all want our break room back.

come out here himself?

That's why I brought backup.

Oops.

- It was just a little titty shot.
- Betty: I didn't even see her.

1558

My father saw you
on TV, Rodney.

He saw you.

01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,513
You're a secretary?

1561
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,849
You told me that you got
a promotion.

1562
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,310
Yeah, well,
I meant demotion--

1563
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,851
demotion, not promotion.

1564
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:06,066
I got caught up in the moment
at the party.

1565
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,072
And after that weird talk
with your father, I just--

1566
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,825
I panicked.
I just-- I panicked.

1567
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,486
I'm sorry.

1568
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:23,375
I just-- I thought I could fix it
before you found out.

1569
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,507
Guess what, Rodney--

1570
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:31,721
you didn't fix it.

1571
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,382
I have never lied to you--

1572
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,425
never.

1573
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,890
Never once have I lied to you.

1574
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,021
I can't do this.

1575
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,433
I can't.

1576
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,001
I'm sorry, man.

1577
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,457
It's a bummer.

1578
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,877
It sucks.
I know. I've been there.

1579

No, you haven't.
You haven't been there.

been there, Mike.

for more than six months.

Oh, come on.
Dude, what about--

01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:28,319
what about the chick from,
you know, Sweater Puppies?

- Katie Olsen?
- Katie. Katie Olsen.

senior year.

Senior year?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,328
<i>-</i> What?
- My marriage just fucking fell apart

1590
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,580
before it even started, and you're
talking about senior year?

1591
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,287
- How's that even close?
- Well, I know how you're feeling.

1592

That deep pit in your stomach,
how that feels--

1593
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,330
I know how that feels.
See, you're feeling--

1594
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,964
- I've been there.
- Stop, please.

1595
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,046
<i>-</i> Where are you going?
- Uh, I don't know.

1596
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,710
I'm gonna go try and find
a place to live,

1597
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,845
because my fiancée--
well, actually, scratch that--

1598
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,132
my ex-fiancée kicked me out
of the fucking house.

really good there.

- Yeah. And Mike's, too.

you want, okay?

I'll give you the commission
on all my sales.

1612

Rodney, you don't get it.

1613

There is no
getting back your job.

you're not even gonna have one.

1616

What are you talking about?

1617
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,905
Oh, yeah, because of
that little stunt you pulled--

1618
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:06,747
secretaries' union-- I have to get back
in corporate's good graces.

1619
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,539
The easiest way to do that-- agree
to lay off some of the sales division.

1620
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,173
Boom! You and your little band
of secretaries--

1621
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,505
first to go.
Bye-bye.

1622
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,104
Do you want to talk
about it?

1623

Doesn't that just figure?

Castro screws up
and we lose our jobs.

1627
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,032
Yeah.

1628
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,955
This is every memo,

'Cause, yeah,
I'm scrapbooking for--

1646
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,884
taking an online
scrapbooking course.

1647
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:46,176
Well, listen, listen, I just got off the
phone with McPherson at Reilly Auto.

1648
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,891
It seems Murphy, McAdams
and our girl Jane

1649
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,476
just went into a private meeting
with Mr. Reilly.

1650
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,140
- What the hell are they doing?
- I don't know.

1651
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,604
We've got to get over there.
Whoa.

1652
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,940
Get off me.
Get off.

1653
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,278
I'm fine.
Kline, thank you.

1654
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,823
Are broken-- stupid--

1655
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,862
yeah, that's-- that's great.

1656
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,952
Now our earnings models also show
that our overall value

1657
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,916
is expected to rise by the third quarter
of next year.

1658
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:18,800
Which, of course, will lower costs
for our bigger suppliers.

1659
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,129
I like the sound of that.

1660
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,636
Jane: You can see that
clearly graphed out

1661
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,638
here and here.

1662
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,470
Yeah, and with this
shaky economy,

having our affordable tires
on your shelves

1664
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,434
not only is good for your customers,
but it's great for your business.

1665
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,439
Ken:
All right.

1666

Hey, Ken, Ken, Ken,
don't forget to validate.

1671
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,415
Thank you.

1672
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,290
<i>-</i> I'm Ken Castro for Mr. Reilly.
- You can't go in there.

1673
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,834
Mr. Reilly, don't listen
to a word they say.

1674
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,753
Kenny, I didn't think we had
a meeting scheduled for today.

1675
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,049
It's Ken, damn it.
My fucking name is Ken.

1676
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:12,812
Well, Ken, it seems that Treadline
tires will be in my stores after all,

1677
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,597
thanks to your
coworkers here.

1678
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,141
They did a hell of a job
and, from what I understand,

1679
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,685
may have saved a few jobs
in the process.

1680
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,197
What--? No, you didn't make
a deal with them.

1681
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,198
Yes, I did.

1682
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:28,236
But they're not--
you can't--

1683
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:29,995
Ah, see, Kenny?

1684
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,202
We did what apparently
you couldn't.

1685
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,037
We closed the deal.

1686
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,710
You know what, McAdams?

1687
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,043
I've enjoyed torturing you.
I really have.

1688
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,548
It's been fun.

1689
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:45,382
But I think I'm gonna enjoy
kicking your ass a little bit more.

1690
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,388
Come on, McAdams.
Let's settle this right now. Come on.

1691
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,424
Mikey, you want to take
this one?

1692
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,514
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

1693
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,394
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead, take the first--

1694
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,100
oh!

1695
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,225
- Rodney: Ouch.
- Whew.

1696
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,564
A pretty solid punch for a secretary.

1697
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,480
- Yeah.
- I'm getting the coffee.

1698
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,159
Hey, what's going on in here?

1699
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,545
Oh, hey.
I'm glad you're back.

1700
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,580
We could actually use a hand.

1701
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,170
<i>-</i> Who's this?
- This is Amy. Amy, meet Mike.

1702
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,212
- Hi, Mike.
- Wait, so this is how it works?

1703
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:30,756
You fire me and then you bring in some
temp-agency trash to replace me?

1704
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,301
- Wow.
- What are you talking about?

1705
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,344
Look at her.
She's dressed like a hooker.

1706
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,640
Mike, Amy's my sister,

1707
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,978
not a temp, okay?
The audit's over.

1708
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,939
She was just helping me
pack my things.

1709
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,694
( Mouths )

1710
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:45,979
Yeah.

1711
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,240
- Yep.
- That's so great.

1712
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,116
Let me hold that.
It looks heavy.

1713
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,574
There you go.

1714
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,865
Maybe sometime we could
grab a drink,

1715
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,705
since you're not officially,
like, my boss any more.

1716
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,540
A drink sounds good.

1717
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,376
I heard Bennigan's makes
one hell of a margarita.

1718
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,257
What, are you kidding me?
Benny's the best in town.

1719
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,088
Actually, I have my own table,

1720
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,720
which is kind of cool, right?

1721
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,552
Um, kind of.

1722
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,682
( laughs )

1723
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,722
I'm sorry about calling you
temp-agency trash

1724
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,141
and a hooker--
uncalled for.

1725
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,309
- Bye.
- Bye.

1726
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:35,408
- Hi.
<i>-</i> Hi.

1727
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,494
Oh, these are for you.

1728
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,994
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1729
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,255
Okay, listen, Jennifer,

1730
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,883
I don't even know
where to--

1731
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,668
oh, guess what--

1732
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:52,304
I got my old job back today,
maybe even a promotion.

1733
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,681
Yeah, landed the biggest account
in the country.

1734
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,934
<i>-</i> Corporate had no choice.
- That's great, Rodney.

1735
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,221
I'm happy for you

1736
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,436
What, and that's it?

1737
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,944
Oh, I didn't do it for me, Jennifer.
I did it for you.

1738
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,979
I did it for us.

1739
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:13,196
God, Rodney,
it was never about your job, okay?

1740
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:16,988
Secretary, sales associate--
who cares? I don't care.

1741
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:19,873
Well, your dad cared.
He made that very clear.

1742
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:23,832
But I wasn't engaged
to my dad.

1743
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:26,292
He's not the one
who lied to me.

1744
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,378
That was you.

1745
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:30,918
You're right.
And I'm sorry.

1746
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,132
I am so sorry,
you have no idea.

1747
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:36,674
I swear-- and I know
I've said this so many times,

1748
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,513
but it will never, ever
happen again.

1749
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:39,972
- Just stop.
<i>-</i> No, no.

1750
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,012
- Just stop. It's fine.
- No, I'm not gonna stop.

1751
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,681
I've changed.
I'm a different guy now.

1752
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,975
- Just stop. Just stop.
- No, no, I don't want-- no, no.

1753
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,939
<i>-</i> It's fine.
- I'm not gonna stop. It's not fine.

1754
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,478
- I don't want to hear any more.
- I've changed. Listen,

1755
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,022
I'm not gonna stop
until I get you <i>back,</i> okay?

1756
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,906
- Just listen to me.
- No, no, I'm not gonna stop.

1757
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,284
- It's fine. Will you just listen to me?
- And remember we made a deal?

1758
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,570
Remember the promise I made?
Remember that?

1759
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,239
- I'm not gonna stop.
- Rodney, what--?

1760
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,749
No, no, I'm not gonna stop
until I get you back.

1761
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,626
<i>-</i> Honey?
- Because, if you recall,

1762
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,628
I made a promise.
Here it is.

1763
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:09,757
I made a promise. And I make good
on my promises, sweetheart.

1764
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,509
<i>-</i> Rodney, what are you doing?
- Let me tell you something: I love you.

1765
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:15,137
I love you so much.
And now the whole world's gonna know.

1766
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,218
Jennifer Daniels, I love you.

1767
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,509
I love Jennifer Daniels!

1768
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,144
- No.
- Hello, everybody. Hello, world.

1769
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,851
I love Jennifer Daniels.
Aw, Ed, Lucy.

1770
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:28,643
Sweet little Lucy,
I love Jennifer Daniels.

1771
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,903
Oh, hello, Mr. Sisseck.
How are you today?

1772
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,938
- Hey, Rodney.
- I love Jennifer Daniels.

1773
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:34,357
On you go, sweet spirit.

1774
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:37,402
Oh, Nancy, Tom, if you knew
how much I love Jennifer--

1775
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,114
- Tom: Congratulations.
- If you knew-- I love her.

1776
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,200
- Nancy: That's nice.
- I love her so much.

1777
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,866
I love Jennifer so--

1778
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,251
(women laughing )

1779
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,629
Olivia: Hi.

1780
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,290
<i>-</i> Are you kidding me?
- You don't need anything that big.

1781
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,379
- You guys enjoy the show?
- Whoo!

1782
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,636
-( laughing )
- They were inside.

1783
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,296
They got here
about 15 minutes before you did.

1784
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,135
I tried to tell you.

1785
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,597
They told me everything. They told
me how much you've changed.

1786
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,512
They told me
how much you've helped them.

1787
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,681
I'm so proud of you.

1788
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:11,148
We thought you needed
a backup plan.

1789
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:15,356
I gave her the same advice
you guys gave me.

1790
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,618
They love you.

1791
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,701
And so do I.
I love you.

1792
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:24,911
I love you, too.

1793
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,916
I love you.

1794
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,298
J' We need to find a way... J'

1795
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:34,959
Could you cover my butt
with my shirt?

1796
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,253
- I think Nancy's staring at it.
<i>-</i> Yeah, sure.

1797
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,387
J' We need to find a way... J'

1798
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,674
Please cover my ass.

1799
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,387
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

1800
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,100
<i>HEY</i>

1801
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,709
Rodney.

1802
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,755
<i>-</i> Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1803
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,588
So you really got
the promotion this time, right?

1804
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,718
Yes. Yes, I did.

1805
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:23,341
I promise, this time
I really got the promotion.

1806
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,384
( laughing )

1807
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,848
( Rodney grunts )

1808
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,273
<i>-</i> I'm proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.

1809
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:37,855
( Chuckles )

1810
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,898
Excuse me.

1811
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,191
Hi, sweetheart.

1812
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,577
Jesus, he is an animal--
your father.

1813
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,954
Wow. Please hold me.

1814
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,240
Jane: ...have you
in the Treadline family.

1815
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:52,582
Mr. Casey, I think you're gonna be
very pleased with our product.

1816
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,710
Closed another one.

1817
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,420
Oh. Oh.

1818
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,756
Man: It's gonna be hard
to keep up with you, Jane.

1819
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,970
- Hi, hi.
- Hey, coffee bitch.

1820
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:09,181
<i>-</i> Oh, you know it. Sorry I'm late.
- What've you got?

1821
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,938
The guy at the coffee place
is a real pain in the ass.

1822
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,601
As fast as I could. I don't know if he
gave me a sleeve. It's pretty hot.

1823
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,604
Rodney:
Yes, absolutely.

1824
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,944
Mike and I plan on paying a personal
visit to every store we sell to.

1825
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,109
Well, that's how we roll.

1826
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:30,620
Yeah-- no, things have changed
quite a bit around here.

1827
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,085
No' no, no,

1828
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,962
Mike and I are running
the sales department now.

1829
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,466
Hi, Rodney, did you get a chance
to look at these--?

1830
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,503
<i>Yes.</i>

1831
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:45,673
Jesus titties fucking Christ.

1832
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:47,716
Yeah, he was a douchebag.

1833
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,511
I could not agree
