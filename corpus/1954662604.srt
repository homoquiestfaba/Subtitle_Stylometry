1
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,367
<i>Praise be to the God,</i>

2
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

3
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,639
<i>the Father of compassion</i>

4
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,575
<i>and the God
of all comforts,</i>

5
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:20,312
<i>who comforts us
through all our afflictions</i>

6
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,449
<i>so that we can comfort those
in any afflictions,</i>

7
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:27,386
<i>the comfort we ourselves
are comforted by God.</i>

8
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,422
We come together today
to say farewell...

9
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,508
Shut up, fucking pedophile.

10
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,884
She did her best to be there
for all those in her life.

11
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,253
Her son, her family.

12
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,188
Her friends.

13
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,124
Sometimes
this meant forgetting

14
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,692
about her own...
Cunt-licking
fucking faggot!

15
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:09,194
Oh, my...

16
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,597
You dye your
hairy pubes ginger.

17
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,713
Fuck, fuck!

18
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,923
Fuck-ing...

19
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:43,395
Fucking cunt
fucking faggot!

20
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,308
Oh!

21
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,258
C-Cunt.

22
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,419
Are you packed?

23
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,421
Hey, Dad?
This picture?

24
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,457
Where were you guys?

25
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,739
California.

26
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,229
Where in California?

27
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,364
Why does it matter?

28
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,333
Mom wanted you
to take her there again.

29
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,814
She was laughin'.

30
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,415
Yeah.

31
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,722
Will you...

32
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,290
move back in?

33
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,792
Fuck, fucking cunt.

34
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,995
With Monica?

35
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,197
We're going
to sell the house.

36
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,008
Why is this packed?

37
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,809
Because I was
going to take her.

38
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,311
Where?

39
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,480
The ocean.
You can't be serious.

40
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,315
Well, you weren't here.

41
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,751
Cunt. Yes, so the two
of us were going to go.

42
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,753
The two of you,
the dynamic duo.

43
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,688
I took care of her!

44
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,456
You held her hand while
she drank herself to death.

45
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,791
You...

46
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,626
go fuck...

47
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,595
Fuck, fucking cu...

48
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,341
I'm not as...

49
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,809
Helpless as you think.

50
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,419
You want to go
to the ocean?

51
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,696
You can't even
get to 7-11.

52
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,320
Fuck you.

53
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,622
Be packed and ready to go
in 20 minutes.

54
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,090
I am not going
into a hospital.

55
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,059
It's not a hospital.

56
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,501
It's an experimental
treatment center.

57
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,336
Your campaign balloons!

58
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,870
Get that one.

59
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,038
Let it go.

60
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,506
Free advertisement.

61
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,975
There.

62
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,746
We'll see you
at Christmas, okay?

63
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,869
Call you later.

64
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,970
Okay.

65
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,555
Tourette's isn't
something you can cure.

66
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,625
But with behavioral exercises,
you can learn to manage it.

67
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,861
It's great, it's great.

68
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,063
Ain't that great,
Vincent?

69
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,973
Mr. Rhodes, do you mind
if I have a little
chat with Vincent?

70
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,404
No, not at all.

71
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,874
Alone.

72
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,445
Oh.

73
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,727
All right.

74
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,158
Mind if I...

75
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,492
sit?

76
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,599
Would you like
to ask me anything?

77
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,636
Nope.

78
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,606
Okay, I got
some questions.

79
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,128
Your mother was your primary...
Look. you said you
can help me.

80
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,513
So what can you do?

81
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,082
What kind of drugs
have you tried?

82
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,618
Amy Winehouse
sucks my cock.

83
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,090
Everything.

84
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,493
Everything.
Nothing has worked.

85
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,797
Cunt. Cunt.

86
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,637
What would you do if you
could better control your tics?

87
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,973
It's never
really mattered.

88
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,208
Matters now.

89
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,081
I don't know.

90
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,216
A lot.

91
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,984
Anything more concrete?

92
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,093
Graduate from...

93
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,375
high school.

94
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,632
Maybe go to college.

95
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,737
Then let's try this.

96
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,073
Okay?

97
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,985
Christmas.

98
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,052
Yeah.

99
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,692
I think it's best
for you to have a roommate.

100
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,261
Not to be alone.

101
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,896
At first, anyway.

102
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,299
Oh, I forgot.

103
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,867
Do you have
a cell phone?

104
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,769
No. Yes, I do!

105
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,037
No, I don't.

106
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,138
Okay, don't get one.

107
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,840
It's against the rules.

108
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,675
Anyway.

109
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,544
Your roommate's
name is Alex.

110
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,312
He's a wonderful
young man.

111
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,681
He's come to us
from very far away.

112
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,750
Because, like you,
he just wants
to get better.

113
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,186
- Alex?
- No.

114
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,177
I didn't say
you could come in.

115
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,261
Whoa!

116
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,598
Take your shoes off!

117
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,233
Take them off.

118
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,035
I have to start
all over again now.

119
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,836
These are
my inside shoes.

120
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,139
I promise you
there's no germs on them.

121
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,607
What about his?

122
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,709
His shoes are befouled.

123
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,145
Well, a perfect opportunity
for a behavioral exercise.

124
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:43,048
I don't want to do
a behavioral exercise!

125
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,916
I want him and
his filthy feet out of here.

126
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,718
In one of these exercises,

127
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,620
I operate as if
there's nothing wrong

128
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:49,788
so that Alex can see

129
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,356
that there isn't
anything wrong.

130
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,124
Alex?
This is Vincent.

131
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,326
He's gonna be
your roommate for awhile.

132
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,328
Hi.

133
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,861
Absolutely not.

134
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,663
If you need me
for anything,

135
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,165
you just come
find me, okay?

136
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,067
I don't want
a roommate.

137
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,301
Just get settled in,

138
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,337
and if nothing else
comes up for today,

139
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,872
I will see you bright and early
tomorrow morning at group.

140
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,040
You too.

141
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,889
It's...

142
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,091
classical?

143
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,662
It's Bach.

144
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,299
It's nice.

145
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,900
It's Bach.

146
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,002
It's Bach.

147
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,404
It's Bach, it's Bach.

148
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,384
Oh. Hey, there is...
No, no.
Don't touch those.

149
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,320
In fact, don't come over
to this side of the room.

150
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,788
This is my bed,
my desk,

151
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,824
and-and my wardrobe.

152
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,926
Everything on-on-on that
side can be yours

153
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,995
but you do not cross
this line, understood?

154
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,764
All right.

155
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,403
What's wrong with you?

156
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,875
Hmm?

157
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,177
Why are you here?

158
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,413
Me? I...

159
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,081
Raghead fuck.

160
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,282
Raghead!

161
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,152
She can't be serious.

162
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,887
She simply cannot be serious.

163
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,089
- Dr. Rose!
- Fuck.

164
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,757
Dr. Rose.

165
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,426
Raghead.

166
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,894
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,865
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,187
Clean freak.
Clean freak.

169
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,938
Fuck.

170
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,710
And I'm British,
you imbecile.

171
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,773
They'll kick you
out for that.

172
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,410
What, pot?

173
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,912
Oh, no. No.

174
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,183
Whatever.

175
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,486
I'm Marie.
I'm supposed to show
you around the clinic.

176
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,455
So, let's get
it over with.

177
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,458
Move.

178
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,527
What, no mask today?

179
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,028
Have you
gained weight?

180
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,363
Your ass looks fat.

181
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,399
Come on.

182
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,275
There's one main rule
here at the clinic.

183
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,677
We have
to want it.

184
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,815
What are you doing?
Just, sneezing.

185
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,350
I had to sneeze.

186
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,320
So if they catch you
with any alcohol or drugs,

187
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,922
they take it to mean
you're not serious

188
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,557
about your therapy,
and you're out.

189
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,561
So just be careful with
whatever it is you have hidden.

190
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,531
Over there is Building B,
mostly depressives
and suicidees.

191
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,900
So, stay clear of that.

192
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,001
Hey, hey, hey!

193
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,035
Fuck you.

194
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,370
Excuse me?
Suck my dick.

195
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,452
I-I don't mean it.
I'm...

196
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,942
It's Tourette's. Cunt.

197
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,043
Oh.

198
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,945
We had one
like you before.

199
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,514
He had a little loop
in his pants to keep
his hands in.

200
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,183
At one point he had
two of them.

201
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,084
Looked like a goddamn penguin.

202
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,490
Computer room
but the Internet blows.

203
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,592
TV room, no cable.

204
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,030
Game room
but they're all stupid.

205
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,567
And finally, the sweet
smell of gourmet shit.

206
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,571
That's pretty much it.

207
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,939
Any questions?

208
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,208
Ah, fuck you, fatty.

209
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,544
I'm... I'm sorry.

210
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,113
Thank you
for the tour.

211
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,396
It was
a punishment.

212
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,888
Behavioral exercise.

213
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,602
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,103
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

215
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,471
Alex, you have got to stop.

216
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,373
I think...
I think you might need glasses.

217
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,277
Seriously, Alex, you are
trying my patience today.
Enough.

218
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,946
You're wrong.
I was taking the bottle out.

219
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,015
I saw you
putting it in.

220
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,953
I barely
touched you, Alex.

221
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,236
I don't know where
your hands have been.

222
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,295
You must be Vincent.

223
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,231
Yeah.
He said he found that
in your bag?

224
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,300
I-I don't...

225
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,535
That's what I thought.
I'll get someone
to clean it up.

226
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,304
And nice try, Alex.

227
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,173
But you are getting
a roommate whether
you like it or not.

228
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,241
Ha ha!

229
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,621
Thanks a lot.

230
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,989
What did I do?

231
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,458
I don't want
you here.

232
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,395
I want you gone,
you addle-brained freak.
Fuck...

233
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,166
Cunt.

234
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,334
Cunt. Cunt.

235
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,003
Fuck.

236
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,207
Cunt.

237
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,376
I need to get in there.

238
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,278
I still have soap
on my hands.

239
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,282
Tough!
You better not be
going to the bathroom.

240
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,151
You have to go to the one
down the hall for that.

241
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,719
Leave me alone.

242
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,455
I'm serious,
do not use that toilet.

243
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,657
Fuck.

244
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,429
Oh, my God!

245
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,621
You wanking?

246
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,069
I t-told you not
to mess with these.

247
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,250
Can you...

248
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,252
Can you
turn on the music?

249
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,555
Please?

250
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,296
Mind if I...

251
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,439
I'm not...

252
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,408
interested in men

253
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,610
in case that's what
Dr. Rose told you.

254
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,814
She didn't.

255
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,502
Fuck!

256
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,138
That's disgusting.

257
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,540
Alex?

259
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,509
That-That was
in your mouth.

260
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,644
What's going on?

261
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,279
He spat
his food on me.

262
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,714
Okay, that
is disgusting.

263
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,250
He's contaminated me.

264
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,818
I'm going
to get sick now.

265
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,888
Who does that?
Who spits their food out?

266
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,857
Now I'm going to have
to go and change now.

267
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,258
I'm...

268
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,366
I didn't mean it.

269
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,301
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,511
- Done.
- Really?

271
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,879
Well, then
you can go.

272
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,598
Missed.

273
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,235
Fuck.

274
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,910
Holy moly, boobs.

275
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,755
Can't they...

276
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,456
Can't they see you
from in there?

277
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,578
Hm.

278
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,931
No.

279
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,699
It helps.

280
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,634
Helps with what?

281
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,470
Everything.

282
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,706
So do you know when
you're going to spasm?

283
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,449
Yeah.

284
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,833
What's it feel like?

285
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,724
It builds,

286
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,726
like when you
have to sneeze.

287
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,295
Can you make it stop?

288
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,664
Can you stop
yourself from sneezing?

289
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,435
Good point.

290
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,548
Fuck, gross. Kiss.

291
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,682
Ew.

292
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,987
Wow.

293
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,760
Ow.

294
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,864
Turn that off.

295
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,532
Little shits.

296
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,034
He's such a weirdo.
Fuck off.

297
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,502
Idiot.
Turn that off.

298
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,638
Turn it off.

299
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,373
Come on.

300
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
Turn it off.
Get back here.

301
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,344
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

302
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,847
Are you kidding?
This shit's going viral.

303
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,283
Why don't you
come and get it?

304
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,051
Vincent, come on.
Get off.

305
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,452
Tony, he's spazzing.

306
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,023
Vincent.

307
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,796
Vincent, get off him.
He's a fucking kid.

308
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,864
Get off him!

309
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:40,998
Get off.

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,633
Stop!

311
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,402
You're hurting him!

312
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,603
Ow.

313
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,476
As if we don't have enough
problems with this community.

314
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,811
He didn't do anything.

315
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,845
I didn't ask you.

316
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,047
Well, you weren't there.

317
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,782
Okay? We were.

318
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,392
Hey.

319
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,328
It's okay.
Just leave it, please.

320
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,096
Sorry. Thank you.

321
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,570
Can I have one?
Please?

322
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,121
Vincent, would you please
leave us alone for a minute?

323
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,557
I need to talk to Marie
about her little stunt

324
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,791
in the lunch room.

325
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,628
Yeah.

326
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,417
So...

327
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,619
if you could go
anywhere in the world...

328
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,055
where would you go?

329
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,126
Um...

330
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,630
The ocean.

331
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,013
Here.
You drive.

332
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,776
I don't really
like to.
Why not?

333
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,652
Good point.

334
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,968
Stop!
Hey, watch out.

335
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,503
Stop. Aah!

336
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,074
Give me back my Bach.

337
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,976
Your what?
What is he talking about?

338
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,480
My CD, you idiot.
If you scratched it,
I'll have you arrested.

339
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,516
Can you give it
back to him, please?

340
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,585
So Dumbo here can fly away.

341
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,122
Is that Dr. Rose's car?

342
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,025
Yeah, she...

343
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,260
Just, we were supposed
to get her something.

344
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,529
She lent it to us. Uh...

345
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:01,031
She-She lent it to us
so we can go get
her something.

346
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,666
Lying pig.

347
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,804
Okay.

348
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,844
And I'm sure
it won't be a problem

349
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,279
if I just go ask her
about it then?

350
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,081
Shit.

351
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,403
You're definitely out
of my room now.

352
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,222
No, let me go.
Shut up, Alex.

353
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,057
Shut up.
Don't touch me,
you spastic.

354
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,092
What should we do?

355
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,729
Shut up.

356
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,097
Alex, would
you shut up?

357
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:36,000
No, no, no.

358
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,302
Shh, shh, shh.

359
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,943
I don't want to go.
Turn the car around.

360
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,279
This car reeks
of cigarettes!

361
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,848
We can probably take
the back roads in case
they come looking for us.

362
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,284
Only the main streets
are shown on this map.

363
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:57,988
Oh, I guess, I don't know,
we should just go south?

364
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,291
You guys don't even
have a plan.

365
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,660
Don't you know a kidnapping
must be carefully planned?

366
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,628
What... Since...
Nobody wants you here.

367
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,633
It's a little extreme...
fuckity fuck-ass...
to call it a kidnapping.

368
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,001
He's got a point.

369
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,612
Whoo!

370
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,147
I don't like it,
I don't like it.

371
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,915
You like it?
It's too loud
right now.

372
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,350
It's too loud.
You want me
to turn it up?

373
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,918
Turn it up.

374
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,853
Is this loud enough?
This is noise pollution.

375
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,056
This is noise pollution.
I'm trying to turn it up,

376
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,691
but this is as
loud as it goes.

377
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,892
Yipe!

378
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,763
Holy shit, we're out
of that fucking place.

379
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,115
He's still there.

380
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,360
Wow.

381
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,367
Good morning,
sunshine.

382
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,772
So where are you
and the incredibly
shrinking woman headed?

383
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,156
California.

384
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,780
What for?

385
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,182
So Vincent can go
to the beach.

386
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,051
Swim in the ocean.

387
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,720
I've been to the ocean.

388
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,157
It's filled with...

389
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,993
Excrement.
Then go back
to the fucking clinic, Alex.

390
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,130
Doctors eat shit
sandwiches on Tuesdays.

391
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,974
The backseat
is full crumbs.

392
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,175
I want shotgun.

393
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,458
Could you pull
your seat forward?

394
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,963
Alex.
You have to pull
the lever.

395
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,432
Just fucking
touch it, Alex.
Jesus Christ.

396
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,194
Alex, roll the thing
on the side of the seat.

397
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,475
Bob Rhodes.
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Rose.</i>
<i>We have a situation.</i>

398
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,877
What's the matter?

399
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,312
<i>I need you to come
to the clinic right away.</i>

400
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,980
Now? I-I'm
a little busy

401
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,115
<i>Well, it's important</i>

402
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,450
<i>because our son's gone.</i>

403
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,452
What do you mean, gone?

404
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,253
Gone. He left.

405
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,722
Give me a minute.

406
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,161
When?
<i>Some time in the night.</i>

407
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,297
He and two other
patients are missing.

408
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,100
Well, listen,
I'm-I'm about
to give a campaign...

409
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,468
He stole my car.

410
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,480
Okay, and the gas is...

411
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,181
Saab.

412
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,855
Sorry.

413
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,790
I got a gun.

414
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,391
That's not funny, asshole.

415
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,673
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,102
And this shit
ain't no good, man.

417
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,339
It has to work.

418
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,307
Could you, could you
try it again...

419
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,243
Poligrip denture cream.

420
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,914
I'll...
I'll be right back.

421
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,417
How you doin'?

422
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,287
Marie?
Yeah?

423
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,055
My...

424
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,057
My card
isn't working.

425
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,560
Shit.
Yeah, and I have, like,
a few dollars in cash.

426
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,529
Do you have anything?
No, nothing.

427
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,465
You... You came
on this trip
with no money?

428
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,333
You can thank
Dr. Rose for that.

429
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,403
She thinks no money
equals no accidents.

430
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,838
Fuck. Great.

431
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,541
Alex? You got any money?

432
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,011
In my pajama pockets?

433
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,312
Spear-chucker cunt.

434
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,347
Are you incognizant?

435
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,116
I'm British,
not Pakistani,

436
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,450
not Native American, British.

437
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,985
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Vincent.

438
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,821
Vincent, what the fuck
are we going to do now?

439
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,161
What the fuck?

440
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,831
Alex.

441
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,265
Fuck.
Open the door.

442
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,267
I'm going home
and filing charges.

443
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,468
You left the keys
in the ignition?

444
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,937
How was I supposed to know

445
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,459
Mr. Clean was going
to try and ditch us?

446
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,975
Ow.

447
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,980
You touched
the gas nozzle!
Car!

448
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,548
- Cunt.
- Guys?

449
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,750
Could you open the door?
The fucking guy's coming.

450
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,053
What the hell
are you guys doing?

451
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,955
Alex, drive.

452
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,556
Give me a moment.
I haven't driven
in a long time.

453
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,358
You owe me
for that gas.

454
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,926
Alex, I'm going to
fucking kill you.
Just go.

455
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,328
I can't.
It's not right yet.

456
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,562
It's not about
being right, just go.

457
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,097
Get out of the car, now!

458
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,099
Put your foot...
Hands off!

459
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,101
- Get out of this damn car.
- Just drive.

460
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,402
Gas would be good
right about now.

461
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,004
Get out of the car!

462
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,372
Gas!

463
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,940
Where are you going?

464
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,075
You ain't going
to rob me,

465
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,643
you little asshole!

466
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:22,512
You stupid punks!

467
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,582
I'll break your ass
if I catch you.

468
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,351
Alex, you are such
an asshole.

469
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,086
Don't touch me
whilst I'm driving.

470
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,622
Just stop...
stop the car now!

471
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:33,657
The windshield wipers on on!

472
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,329
Fuck!

473
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,931
This is my space, okay?

474
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,633
You stay over there
with your nozzle hands,

475
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,935
and you stay back
there with all those
disgusting crumbs.

476
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,370
You don't get to tell
us what to do.

477
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,105
I'm in charge here,

478
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,507
not you, you cunt.
Are you
calling me a cunt?

479
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,577
That was his Tourette's,
you idiot.
No, I said that on purpose.

480
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,216
What's so...

481
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,651
What's so funny?

482
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,319
Nothing. Sorry.

483
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,525
It's just,
it's hard to tell

484
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,160
where you stop
and your Tourette's begins.

485
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,662
It's not funny.

486
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,297
Assholes.

487
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,168
You guys are
fucking idiots.

488
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,011
Left. Right!

489
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,079
No, left. Left.
I mean left!

490
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,414
Stop yelling.

491
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,548
I know you're experimental,

492
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,250
but the prices you charge,

493
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,585
I expected you to
at least keep tabs on my son.

494
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,288
Your son is an adult.
He can leave any
time he wants.

495
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,991
He doesn't have to ask
permission from me
or you to do so.

496
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:44,428
What about your car?
Shouldn't he have
asked for permission for that?

497
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,630
Here are Vincent's things.

498
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,434
I think what's happening
is that your son is in shock.

499
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,637
The only person who
he had any real relationship
with has just died.

500
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,072
He's not in shock.

501
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,240
He's just doing
this to piss me off.

502
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,310
I'm not playing
this little game
with him.

503
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,212
I put a hold
on his bank account.

504
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,681
What? They need
money to buy food.

505
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,217
And when they can't buy it,
they'll come back here.

506
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,422
Hello?
<i>Hi, this is Officer...</i>
<i>calling.</i>

507
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,424
What can I do
for you, officer?

508
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,093
<i>Dark green Saab 9-3?</i>

509
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,728
Yes, that's my car.

510
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,365
This gets out,
I'm ruined.

511
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,467
Your compassion
is outstanding.

512
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,536
You should be just as
worried about this as I am.

513
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,538
I'll call you in a bit
to let you know
what's going on.

514
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,707
Excuse me,
those are my patients.

515
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,243
You're not... You're not
leaving without me.

516
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,312
Does your car
have LoJack?

517
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,647
It's a 1999 Saab.

518
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,117
Are you sure
you're a real doctor?

519
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,352
Would you prefer your money
go into my bank account

520
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,087
or rather into
your son's care?

521
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,288
What care?

522
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,490
He's gone.

523
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,331
So let's think.

524
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,133
Where could they be?

525
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,070
They have to eat.

526
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,172
What are you doing?
Looking to see

527
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:05,108
if there's a Subway
restaurant near
that gas station.

528
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,376
Subway?
It's the only place

529
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,579
Alex will eat
because they wear gloves.

530
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,114
You realize
this is pointless?

531
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,349
They can be
anywhere by now.

532
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,617
No, they can't.

533
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,818
Why not?

534
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,554
Because it's raining.

535
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,062
That's the highest setting.

536
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,800
But I can make it slower,
if you like.

537
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,821
Put that out.

538
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:52,856
Make me.

539
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,093
Hey, how much money
do we have left?

540
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,594
Like, six dollars.

541
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,563
Marie can live off
that for a week.

542
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,764
Will you leave her alone?

543
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,469
Would you like a...

544
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,704
A bite of my sandwich?

545
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,172
No thanks.

546
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:12,142
Maybe my... fatty.

547
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,844
Sorry.

548
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,679
Maybe my chips?

549
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,114
No.

550
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,720
Pickle?
Jesus fucking Christ,

551
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,522
leave me alone.

552
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,891
All right, all right.

553
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,593
You have got
to be kidding.

554
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,162
What?
Clean that up!

555
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,164
Fuck.
And wipe your hands
before you touch everything

556
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,266
with those
greasy fingers.

557
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,434
And all the yelling

558
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,569
and smoking...
Hey!

559
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,738
shall henceforth take place
outside of the car.

560
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,772
Alex. Fuck.

561
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,641
Oi, fuck.
I said out!

562
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,150
Fuck. Fuck.

563
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,168
Come on!

564
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,270
Oh my...

565
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,374
Shit.

566
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,544
Oh, fuck.

567
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,287
Don't mind him.

568
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,529
He really does have
a fucking stick up his ass.

569
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,987
Hey, what's
in the can?

570
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,700
My mother.

571
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,267
She's the one that needs
to go to the ocean?

572
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,685
Shit.

573
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,797
Where's Marie?

574
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,799
Peeing. Puking.

575
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,368
I don't know.

576
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,775
Holy-Holy T-Tin Man
wants a heart.

577
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,624
This is ridiculous.

578
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,360
That guy said they asked
about a lake, right?

579
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,562
And this being
the only lake

580
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:23,400
in this shit town,
I suppose they gotta be
somewhere around here, right?

581
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:24,801
It stopped raining
30 minutes ago.

582
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,083
They're gone.

583
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,641
Five missed
calls, shit.

584
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,814
Oh, my God.

585
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,051
What?

586
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,086
It's them.

587
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,821
Okay, okay.

588
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,023
Now let's just approach
them calmly and quietly.

589
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,326
Vincent!
Or not.

590
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,494
Vincent!

591
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,595
Vincent.

592
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,730
Alex?

593
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,065
Dr. Rose?

594
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,566
Dad?

595
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,101
Get over here, now!

596
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,403
What now?

597
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,672
Vincent, get over here.

598
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,075
Kiss my ass.

599
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,577
Now he's just
fucking with me.

600
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,045
Calm down.

601
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,947
Where's Marie?

602
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,350
Oh! What are
you doing?

603
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,385
Marie.

604
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,619
Shit.

605
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,861
Marie.
Marie.

606
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,927
Marie?
Where are you?

607
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,696
We have to go.
What?

608
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,398
We have to go.
Okay.
What's going on?

609
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,966
My fucking dad.

610
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,502
Alex, get
in the car.

611
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,504
Alex,
get in the fucking car.

612
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,774
Alex!

613
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,026
Get out.

614
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,696
Now.
Don't-Don't touch me.

615
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,878
Where are
your things?

616
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,882
Fuck...
In the... Cunt.

617
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,164
Fuck.

618
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,561
Let's go.
Get out there.

619
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,492
I try to be the nice guy,

620
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:30,794
and this
is the thanks I get.

621
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,495
Are you okay?

622
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,665
I think.

623
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,001
Have you had
anything to drink?

624
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,736
That's a great
thing about you.

625
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,171
I can always
count on you to fail.

626
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:43,440
That's...

627
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,108
Yes?
That's...

628
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,576
That's not...

629
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,077
Fuck... Not...

630
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,613
See, you can't even
finish that sentence.

631
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,848
Get in.

632
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,889
Vincent!

633
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,135
Hey, stop!

634
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,003
What?
Where do you think
you're going?

635
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,039
You're just going
to leave us
standing here?

636
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,574
You have a car.

637
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,675
But I don't have

638
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,909
my phone.

639
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,805
Your phone.

640
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,215
Your phone.

641
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,622
Fuck.

642
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,059
Here's your
goddamn phone.

643
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,064
Hey!

644
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,499
Next time...

645
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,903
don't give
me a roommate.

646
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,572
Alex!

647
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:52,242
- Wait! Wait.
- Alex, come on.

648
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,277
Aah.

649
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,746
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Piss hands, piss hands.

650
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,114
Just get
in the fucking car.

651
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,952
We did it.
The car is so clean.

652
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,287
And no
cigarette smell.

653
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,890
I like your father.
Well you can... Have him.

654
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,258
I like him,
I like him.

655
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,293
We're gonna crash.

656
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,628
Vincent.

657
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,029
We're gonna crash.
Vincent.

658
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,597
What are you doing?
Vincent, stop ticcing.

659
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,032
Stop ticcing.

660
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,033
We're heading
off the road.

661
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,935
Shit.
Stop, Vincent.

662
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,609
You guys thought
I was a bad driver.

663
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,280
I'm sorry.

664
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,315
Are you okay?

665
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:33,950
Sweet Fanny Adams.

666
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,820
I'll-I'll let you drive.

667
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,598
Vincent's running away
now makes complete sense.

668
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,199
Mind your own
damn business.

669
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,668
I am.

670
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,836
That young woman
is sick and needs to eat.

671
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,973
Yeah, well,
I was supposed to give
a speech three hours ago,

672
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,208
and instead I'm
in the middle of a lake
looking for froggy keys

673
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,945
with a shitty doctor
who's less capable
than my son.

674
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,613
Now you're projecting.

675
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,315
What?
Projecting.

676
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:07,050
Calling me
a shitty doctor

677
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,319
to make up for the fact
that you're a shitty father.

678
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,688
Oh, yeah, you got
me figured out?

679
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,170
Too bad I was paying you
to figure out Vincent.

680
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,235
This is ridiculous.

681
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,872
I'm calling Triple A.

682
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,874
MBrace.

683
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:32,876
What?

684
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,043
My car has MBrace.

685
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,279
Good for you.
No, you peasant.

686
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,748
It means I can
track it with my phone.

687
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,850
My phone.
My phone.

688
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,353
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

689
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:46,122
Now what?
I left my phone
in the car.

690
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,190
The car's right there.

691
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:49,726
My car.

692
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,961
<i>Please say
your destination.</i>

693
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,229
The ocean.

694
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,364
<i>Location not found.</i>

695
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,999
You can't just
say ocean.

696
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,767
You have to tell it the name
by the name of the beach.

697
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:59,002
I don't know the name.

698
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,236
Why doesn't
that surprise me?

699
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,105
Okay, what's a city
near a beach?

700
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,706
Los Angeles.

701
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,241
<i>Destination Los Angeles.</i>

702
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,243
No. No, we're not
going to Los Angeles.

703
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,746
That place is a cesspool
of communicable diseases.

704
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,748
Colon cancer rots
your ass hole.

705
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,049
There are closer beaches,
anyway.

706
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:15,885
W-What about
San Francisco?

707
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,389
You would say that.

708
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:21,958
Shut up.
Shut up?

709
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,427
Really? Why don't you
make me shut up, Alex?

710
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,929
Oh, wait, that means
you have to touch me.

711
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,931
Touch those repulsive
bird arms, no thank you.

712
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,267
Oh, I'm a bird?
I'm a little baby bird?

713
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,705
Get away from me,
I'm driving.

714
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,908
Just... Somebody tell it
where the fuck we're going.

715
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,376
I don't know, fuck it,
I've been to Santa Cruz.

716
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,444
Let's just go there.

717
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,284
What the hell?

718
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,153
Hell is for horses.

719
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,461
What the fuck?

720
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,399
Alex, what
is happening right now?

721
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:05,835
The car. I felt it
run over something.

722
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,439
It was a person.
Sweet Fanny Adams,
I don't want to go to prison.

723
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:12,108
Wow, you are way
more fucked up than
I thought you were.

724
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,878
Alex. Stop. Y-You didn't
run over anyone.

725
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,246
It was... It was a pothole.

726
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,248
No, I'm sure
I did, and I...

727
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,349
Probably a pregnant woman,

728
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,851
and I killed
the baby, too.

729
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,755
No. No, no, no.
You didn't kill anyone.

730
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,790
No pregnant lady. No baby.

731
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,892
Just shut up and look
around for a body.

732
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,142
Come on.

733
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,503
I don't see
a dead body.

734
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:43,172
No. Not over
here either.

735
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,490
Oh, my God.

736
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,160
There it is.

737
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,318
Where?

738
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,387
Where?

739
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,123
Over there.

740
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,525
In the middle
of the road.

741
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:06,229
Wait. At... At like
12 o'clock?

742
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:07,396
More like...

743
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,918
More like
1 o'clock.

744
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,503
I don't see it.
I don't see the body.

745
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,438
Exactly.

746
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,880
Because you hit
a fucking pothole.

747
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,980
Ha ha.

748
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,382
Shotgun.

749
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,497
You all right?

750
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,469
I'm sorry, guys.

751
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,307
I really thought
I hit someone.

752
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,379
Yeah, well,
I think I'm fat.

753
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,315
So, I guess we
all have issues.

754
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:12,495
Where the fuck
is that coming from?

755
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,463
- Hello?
- <i> You all pleased with yourselves?</i>

756
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,832
Mr. Rhodes.

757
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:16,966
Fuck.

758
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,568
Hey, how's it goin'?

759
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,002
<i>Fucking peachy.</i>

760
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,504
I'm sorry to hear that.

761
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,573
What can I, what can
I do you for, man?

762
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,935
<i>Let me talk to my son.</i>
One second.

763
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,513
I can't, I can't
talk to him.

764
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,181
He doesn't want
to fucking talk to you.

765
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,050
<i>Put him on the phone!</i>

766
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,585
I don't think he's going
to change his mind

767
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:37,453
just because you're
saying it louder.

768
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,155
<i>I'm going to report
the car stolen,</i>

769
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,357
<i>and the cops will track you
and have you arrested.</i>

770
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,926
He says he's gonna
report the car stolen.

771
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,095
And the cops can track us.

772
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,030
We'll probably
be arrested.

773
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,072
I'm going
to get deported.

774
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,601
Nah.

775
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:53,035
He won't do it.

776
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,604
How do you know?
Because...

777
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:56,372
he won't risk
the bad press.

778
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,175
Trust me.
You sure?

779
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:02,612
I'm absolutely.
Absolutely.

780
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:04,914
Fuck. What's
his first name?

781
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:06,916
Robert.
Robert.

782
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,386
Robbie?

783
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,121
Hey, can I... Do you mind
if I call you Robbie?

784
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,556
Great, thanks.

785
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,625
So we really appreciate
the head's up,

786
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:17,593
but I think we're just
going to take our chances.

787
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,630
Yeah, if I see a cop,
I'll just fuckin' floor it.

788
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:23,232
And I don't think
there's ever been a car chase

789
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,600
that wasn't televised.

790
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,035
Yeah, we'll
probably get caught.

791
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:28,204
The perps always do,
but you know what?

792
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:30,006
I'm really looking
forward to being on the news.

793
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:31,908
You know the camera
does add ten pounds,

794
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,310
but I think it will
be worth it, don't you?

795
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,013
Hello?

796
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:39,181
You still, you still there?

797
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,684
And two... Oh!
Two things.

798
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:44,153
You're wrong.
You don't know
anything about me.

799
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,122
And you'll never
see me again.

800
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,675
What did she say?

801
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:07,543
She threatened me.

802
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,678
What did he say?

803
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,681
That I'm wrong.

804
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:14,016
Well, I could've
told you that.

805
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,484
Okay.

806
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,086
We can't track them.

807
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,355
We need to put
ourselves in their shoes.

808
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,291
Where would we go?

809
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,028
What do you mean?

810
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,664
You just told off your father.
Where would you go?

811
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,066
I'd never tell
off my father.

812
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:33,703
I had too much
respect for him.

813
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:39,342
Okay. Then imagine
your father just told
you that you were worthless,

814
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,344
good for nothing,

815
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,579
that you couldn't
even finish a sentence.

816
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,084
Where would you go?

817
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,784
I think I know
where they're going.

818
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,238
Careful!

819
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,007
You're right.
They probably don't make parts

820
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,174
for this car anymore.

821
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,243
Whoops.

822
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:17,480
How in God's name do you know
how to do this, anyway?

823
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:20,383
Let's just say
I wasn't always a politician.

824
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,585
Huh.
What?

825
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,721
Maybe the apple
didn't fall far from the tree.

826
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,797
Wow.

827
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:57,453
Dan, we're going to have
to cancel the next few days.

828
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,155
Cancel the next few days.

829
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:01,590
I don't care.
Make something up.

830
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:05,261
Whatever you want as long
as it doesn't cost me votes.

831
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,420
I know, Monica.

832
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,556
I know.

833
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,224
I know!

834
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,755
Alex, it was just a pothole,
all right?

835
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,525
You don't have to stop.

836
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:11,861
What the fuck?

837
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:14,296
Dead babies on the road.

838
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,201
Fuck.

839
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,670
We hit a pothole.

840
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,880
Wake up!

841
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,288
Are you all right?
No.

842
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,790
You?
No.

843
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,896
Might I suggest that we stop
at a hotel for a few hours?

844
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,700
Excellent idea.

845
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,706
I'm starving.

846
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,842
We need gas.
I need food.

847
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,178
What you need is a lobotomy.
Shut up, Skeletor.

848
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,746
Just, both of you shut up.

849
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,614
We need a plan.

850
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:08,417
One of us pumps, one of us
steals, one of us distracts.

851
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:10,419
I'll steal.
I want to steal.

852
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,454
So you can get stuck opening
and closing the door

853
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:13,889
four times before you run out?

854
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,224
You're pumping.

855
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:16,926
Absolutely not.

856
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,465
Ew.

857
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:24,767
Get away from me.

858
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,735
Going to get you.

859
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,774
You're pumping.
Anal bleach.

860
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:34,577
And I guess that means
you're distracting.

861
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:39,315
Well, sounds like I was born
for this job.

862
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,350
Okay.

863
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,248
That it?

864
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,016
Uh, yeah.
Thank you.

865
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,686
It's 5.95, then.

866
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,290
Can I help you?

867
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:24,460
No, thanks.

868
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,299
Dude, 5.95.

869
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,701
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

870
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,482
Anything else?

871
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:49,518
Umm...

872
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,653
No.

873
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,989
What the fuck was that?
I don't know.

874
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,358
I can't remember
the last time that happened.

875
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,029
Where's my food?
He didn't tic.

876
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:04,033
You mean the only thing
we got out of that
was a copy of<i> Family Circle?</i>

877
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,570
This fucking sucks.

878
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,873
Can't I get
one suck ass advantage

879
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,342
out of this
cock-sucking illness?

880
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:14,977
They only come
when I don't want them to,

881
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:19,882
and always at the worst
motherfucking moments.

882
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:22,518
You just said like four
sentences without ticcing once.

883
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,520
But he swore, like, ten times,
what's the difference?

884
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,021
Shut the fu...

885
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,023
up, Alex.

886
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,824
Ah, there they are.

887
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,526
Welcome back to the freak show.

888
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:34,063
Now? Cock fuck. Now?

889
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,398
Okay, you know what?
Let's get out of here

890
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,501
before they realize
we have no money for gas, okay?
Absolutely not.

891
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,437
I'm going in there and
I'm getting something to eat.

892
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:45,007
You two stay here and
be ready to go when I run out.

893
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,764
Really?

894
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,933
Good evening, sir.

895
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:13,435
Latex gloves are where?

896
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,108
Fuck.

897
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,076
Vincent, relax.

898
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,118
There's a clown in my head,

899
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,421
and he shits
in between my thoughts.

900
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:35,457
And he forces me to do
the most inappropriate... fuck!

901
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:39,628
The most inappropriate thing at
the most inappropriate moment.

902
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,533
Relaxing is pretty much
the one thing I cannot do.

903
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,710
Why don't you eat?

904
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,115
What?

905
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,785
My brain is broken,

906
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:06,522
but all you have to do
is eat something.

907
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,861
I, uh...

908
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,902
It's not that easy.

909
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,805
Why not?

910
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,045
Go! Drive!
Go!

911
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,680
Go, now!
How did you do that?

912
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,582
I said go!
Holy shit.

913
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:35,484
Fucking Christ.

914
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,753
Come on.

915
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,565
Hold it in until it makes you...

916
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,469
Exactly.

917
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:55,204
Why am I doing this again?

918
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:58,540
Maybe it will help
with the ticcing.

919
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,511
So, what are you going to do

920
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,613
after we get to the ocean?

921
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:07,683
I don't know.

922
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,885
I haven't thought
that far ahead yet.

923
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,592
I want to get a dog.

924
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,794
Hello, random.
Someone's stoned.

925
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:21,530
No, I'm serious, but I always
wanted a dog growing up,

926
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,099
and my dad wouldn't let me.

927
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,001
And then...

928
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,170
And, uh...

929
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,939
after the divorce,

930
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,842
taking care of my mom,

931
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,845
it was a lot of work.

932
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,747
Yeah.

933
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:41,683
Well, now you're free.

934
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:46,555
You don't have to take care
of anyone.

935
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,838
I don't know what's worse,
the fact that I just...

936
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,673
defecated in the woods,
or that my buttocks

937
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:05,974
now smell like Handiwipes.

938
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,179
The mental image is worse.

939
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,650
Are you guys smoking weed?

940
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,618
No.

941
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,825
You're repugnant.

942
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,096
Aww.

943
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,265
Come on, come back.

944
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,301
Love you.

945
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:35,304
I love pressing his buttons.

946
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,711
What are you knitting,
a noose?

947
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:45,080
One more day in that clinic,
and, yeah, maybe.

948
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:50,319
What ended up happening
with Dr. Rose?

949
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,258
Do you like to dance?

950
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,861
Yeah.

951
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,330
Well, this is a waltz.

952
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:02,998
I know.

953
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,968
I know means you don't.

954
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,670
You could show me.

955
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:09,938
Okay.

956
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,273
Okay.
Okay.

957
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,108
We're dancing?
We're dancing.

958
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,011
I want to take this hat off
so I look cooler.

959
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,382
Yeah, uh...

960
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:23,151
This hand, here.
Okay.

961
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,320
This hand, here.

962
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:27,055
Look over the shoulder.

963
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:31,293
Posture, darling. Posture.

964
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,795
Start with your right foot
and go forward.

965
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,263
Right.

966
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,199
Foot, go forward.
Foot forward.

967
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,361
All right, I'm ready.
Ready? And...

968
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:47,776
We're good.

969
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:49,058
We're good, though.

970
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,208
Okay, spin me.
Spin you?

971
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,254
See, that was nice.

972
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,767
Hey!

973
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:13,902
I'm sorry.

974
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,905
I'm sorry.

975
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,949
Hey guys, this car
even has movie listings.

976
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,091
Then kiss me right.

977
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,795
I can't sleep.

978
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:16,357
Probably because you got
enough sleep in the car.

979
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,304
That girl...

980
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,873
Marie?

981
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,475
Why doesn't she eat?

982
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:32,147
Anorexia is a disease
of the mind,

983
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:36,752
so, even though we see
skin and bones,

984
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,453
all she sees is fat.

985
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,291
But she won't drop dead
from that, right, I mean,

986
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:46,228
you can live for weeks
without food.

987
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,764
Her heart already gave out
once a few months ago...

988
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,138
which is why I threatened
to force feed her

989
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,207
through a tube yesterday.

990
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,511
And she jumped ship.

991
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,457
It's not your fault.

992
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,996
You were just doing your job.

993
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,082
Morning.

994
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,358
You're wearing my windbreaker.

995
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,398
Behavioral exercise.

996
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,937
Hey, do you think it's far
to the top?

997
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,174
Do I look like a tour guide?

998
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,509
Come on, let's go.

999
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,277
Let's not and say we did.

1000
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,182
I've never been
on a mountain before.

1001
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,884
What if it sucks?

1002
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,053
What if it's amazing?
What if it's dangerous?

1003
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:20,222
What if it's...
What if it's exciting?

1004
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:21,389
What if we die?

1005
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,225
Well, what if we fucking live?

1006
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:24,492
Stop yelling.

1007
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,995
He has Tourette's.

1008
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,364
We're going to the top.

1009
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,434
What?

1010
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:35,971
Damn it.

1011
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,006
We're going to find them.

1012
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,045
Okay, you win.

1013
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,248
We'll go to the police.

1014
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,116
Thank you.

1015
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,291
Not far?

1016
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:59,494
Well, it's probably
not that far now.

1017
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,967
You okay?

1018
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,302
Fuck you.

1019
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,210
Be careful about Marie.

1020
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:17,579
Excuse me?

1021
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,650
Don't be fooled.
She doesn't love you.

1022
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:24,252
Well, thanks... Fuck.

1023
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,221
For the advice.

1024
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:28,323
It's not you, it's her.
She's not capable.

1025
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,058
And you're the expert
on relationships?

1026
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,294
You can't even shake hands
with someone.

1027
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,572
It's just a plant.

1028
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,545
Shit!
Snake.

1029
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:52,480
Shit.

1030
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,416
Get off the log.
Let's get off the log!

1031
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:57,352
Hey, wait.
Go. Go, go, go.

1032
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:01,489
I think it's, like,
another...

1033
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:04,726
couple of hundred yards,
and we're there.

1034
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,381
Echo!

1035
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,987
Wow.

1036
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,522
Look at that.

1037
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:20,201
I'm Alex in wonderland!

1038
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:56,404
I love these.

1039
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,377
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

1040
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:03,411
What is on my face?

1041
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,679
What is on my face?

1042
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,583
Vincent's mother.

1043
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,622
It serves you right...
freak fuck.

1044
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:17,158
You don't touch
other people's stuff.

1045
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,194
Funny, that's how
this whole escapade started.

1046
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,232
Fuck.

1047
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:12,547
I didn't steal this food.

1048
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,182
Or the gas.

1049
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:15,783
I paid for it.

1050
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,919
With what money?

1051
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,458
Where did you get all that?

1052
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,863
It's mine.

1053
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,665
From my disability allowance.
Wait a minute,

1054
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,467
you've had that with you
the whole fucking time?

1055
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,335
You think I'd leave
my money lying around?

1056
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,504
Why didn't you say something?
Yeah, we could have used it.

1057
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,439
I may have issues,

1058
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:42,710
but I wasn't about to fund
my own kidnapping.

1059
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:45,280
Yeah, but,
at the last gas station...

1060
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:46,948
Now, wait a minute,
the attendant chased you.
Yeah.

1061
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,518
I paid him to do that.
I paid him!

1062
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,955
Why?

1063
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,327
Because I wanted you to think
I was cool.

1064
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,497
You don't know
what it's like.

1065
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:05,266
I think I have a lot to offer,
but these stupid rituals

1066
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,669
just take over everything.

1067
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:14,976
This thing has made my world
smaller and smaller.

1068
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,812
I'm stuck in a fucking clinic.

1069
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,886
I'd give anything to be free
from this, but it doesn't stop,

1070
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,521
and it's not my fault.

1071
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:40,935
It was pretty cool
the way you ran out of there.

1072
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,939
Yeah, you did look
pretty bad ass.

1073
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:01,516
I love you.

1074
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,031
Hey.

1075
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:20,535
Hey.

1076
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,982
We should...

1077
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:10,752
We should probably go.

1078
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:14,922
Alex is waiting.

1079
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:19,560
Yeah.

1080
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:22,063
Let's go.

1081
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,712
Fuck.

1082
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,448
Marie?

1083
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,583
I'm coming.

1084
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:17,018
Alex is gone.

1085
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:19,720
What?

1086
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:22,623
Alex is gone.
The car is gone.

1087
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,725
Fuck!

1088
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,144
<i>I got his account
turned back on.</i>

1089
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,779
Thank you.

1090
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:47,949
Okay, so what do you want me
to tell Dan about tonight?

1091
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:52,720
I don't know.
<i>But, Robert,</i>
<i>I just picked up my dress!</i>

1092
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,558
He's my son, Monica.

1093
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,162
I'm going to go take a piss.

1094
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,764
All right.

1095
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,506
Where are you?

1096
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,741
Marie?

1097
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,176
Fuck.

1098
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,612
What, you get eaten by
a bear or something?

1099
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:35,630
Oh.

1100
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,876
We should probably keep going.

1101
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:24,979
Vincent?

1102
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,592
Car cunt.

1103
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,694
Fuck.
Where the fuck is he?

1104
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:48,369
Cunt licker. Fuck.

1105
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,137
What are you staring at?

1106
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,306
Huh? What are you staring at?

1107
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:54,675
Vincent, come on.
Fuck.

1108
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,746
Anything?
Nope.

1109
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,815
Shit.
This is stupid.

1110
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:04,752
We should just camp out
by the car until he comes back.

1111
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:06,754
Wait a minute.

1112
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,924
Do you hear that?

1113
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,159
What?

1114
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,234
Bach.

1115
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,351
Alex?

1116
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,787
I didn't say
you could come in.

1117
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,255
Are you out of your mind?

1118
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:42,890
Crazy cunt.

1119
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:47,328
We've been searching
everywhere for you.

1120
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,996
I didn't ask you to.

1121
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,966
Well, you took the car,
asshole.

1122
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:54,135
What was I supposed to do?

1123
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:57,104
Sit there and wait while you
two screwed yourselves silly?

1124
01:17:57,106 --> 01:18:00,307
Please. Come on, Vincent.
Let's go.

1125
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:05,112
He's not worth it.
Come on, let's go.

1126
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,855
That's right, go on.
Follow the skinny bitch

1127
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,692
own the rabbit hole.
Shut up, Alex!

1128
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,993
She's just using you.

1129
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:21,328
You could be anyone.
Anyone!

1130
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,230
Do you really think
she came with you because

1131
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,399
she thinks you're just the
most amazing guy she ever met?

1132
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,968
Shut up.
Shut your fucking face.

1133
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,336
Because when
she sees you twitch,

1134
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,905
she just can't help herself?

1135
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:32,273
She just wants an audience

1136
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:34,308
when she finally
starves herself to death.

1137
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,943
Come on, Vincent.

1138
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,446
Come on!

1139
01:18:38,448 --> 01:18:41,015
But she needs someone to clean
up the mess after it's over,

1140
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:42,416
and you're the perfect guy
for the job.

1141
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:44,418
Stop it, Alex. Just stop!

1142
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,821
Running away from daddy
to fulfill mommy's dying wish.

1143
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:48,322
What a fucking hero.

1144
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:50,458
Though she probably imagined
her last trip to the coast

1145
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,194
in something other than
a ten-cent can of tin...

1146
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:56,097
Vincent!

1147
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,265
Vincent!
Stop it!

1148
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,401
Stop it!

1149
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:02,002
You think you're better
than us?

1150
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:04,004
Vincent, get off of him.

1151
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:06,407
You're nothing!

1152
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,909
Get off him, Vincent!

1153
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,787
Vincent, stop!

1154
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,094
I'll go get a towel.
Alex, it's okay.

1155
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,496
I'm going to get a towel.

1156
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,971
Just...

1157
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,373
Just calm down.
It's just blood.

1158
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:40,541
It's your blood.

1159
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,177
It's going to be okay.

1160
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:49,216
Just leave me alone.
You got the car, so just go.

1161
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:53,187
Calm down.
You got it, just go.

1162
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,126
We're not going anywhere
without you.

1163
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:03,864
You terrorist asshole.

1164
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,258
Holy fuck.

1165
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:40,434
Oh, come on.
What?

1166
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:42,503
You got a spare?

1167
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,975
God damn fucking piece of shit!

1168
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,911
The apple really didn't fall
far from the tree.

1169
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,851
Maybe you're right.

1170
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:58,552
You know, I was...

1171
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,591
I was the first one of
my friends to become a father.

1172
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,494
And Vincent was amazing.

1173
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:08,963
He was a little devil,

1174
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:10,598
but he was amazing.

1175
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,867
When did he start
to show signs?

1176
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,902
In second or third grade.

1177
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:17,905
His teacher came
to us and...

1178
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:21,342
said that he was

1179
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:23,377
extremely outspoken.

1180
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,979
Bet you liked that.

1181
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:26,380
Of course.

1182
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,115
And we just thought
it was a phase

1183
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:31,418
and that he'd grow out of it.

1184
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,889
But it just got worse?

1185
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,592
No, something
died inside...

1186
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:42,429
of me when we got
the diagnosis.

1187
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:48,535
All my hopes and dreams
for him just disappeared.

1188
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,341
And every time
I looked at him and he was...

1189
01:21:56,511 --> 01:22:01,015
twitching and cursing
and what not...

1190
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,223
it felt like I was looking
at someone else's kid.

1191
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:11,258
Someone else's problem.

1192
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:21,669
And I felt awful, not only
for him, but for his parents.

1193
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:28,442
And then, he called me dad.

1194
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,578
Dad!

1195
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,514
Fuck, dad!

1196
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,286
It's awful to say, but...

1197
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,591
I was embarrassed by him.

1198
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:49,296
And the pitiful looks
we'd get from people.

1199
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:52,666
Have to leave restaurants
and movies.

1200
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,436
We got kicked off a plane once.

1201
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,474
And I just wanted...

1202
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,279
a different boy...

1203
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,217
and he knew it.

1204
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,521
He could see it on my face.

1205
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:21,328
I don't think he'll ever
be able to forgive me for that.

1206
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:35,509
Seems like he's capable of a
whole lot more than you think.

1207
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,373
Anything?

1208
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,109
No.

1209
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:19,446
Nothing at the clinic either.

1210
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,782
You know, he's right.

1211
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,884
I don't know anything
about him.

1212
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:26,446
Why'd you think
he'd come here?

1213
01:25:28,524 --> 01:25:31,325
He took this
right over there.

1214
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,497
It's a beautiful photo
of her.

1215
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:39,500
See how happy she was?

1216
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,902
I think you can see
something else.

1217
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:44,271
What?

1218
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:47,808
Just how happy
the photographer was too.

1219
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,311
Alex... Alex, relax.

1220
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:25,679
It's just a pothole.

1221
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:28,348
No, please.

1222
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:11,391
Vincent...

1223
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,927
Come on! Marie?

1224
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,564
Marie?

1225
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,433
Marie!

1226
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,770
Oh, my God.

1227
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:26,773
Marie! Marie?

1228
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:28,875
Ge...

1229
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:30,677
Get... Get help!

1230
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,013
Get an ambulance!
Marie?

1231
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,551
Quick!

1232
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,021
Marie?

1233
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,331
Can you hear me?
Marie, can you hear my voice?

1234
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:53,734
Marie?

1235
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:56,770
Marie. Marie, I'm here.

1236
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,039
Marie...
Back.

1237
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:02,042
Look, we're taking her
to Santa Cruz Hospital.
You can meet us there.

1238
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,547
Take care of her.

1239
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:31,772
<i>Dr. Flores, dial 118.</i>

1240
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:35,409
<i>Dr. Flores, please dial 118.</i>

1241
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,800
Hi.

1242
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,670
Hey.

1243
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:41,975
How are you?

1244
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,484
Marie... Marie, it's okay.
Just relax.

1245
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:52,686
Listen... Listen,
just... just relax.

1246
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,988
Just relax. Please?
Take it out.
Take it out, please.

1247
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,391
I can't.
Please!

1248
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,726
You know,
your parents are coming.

1249
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,896
No.

1250
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,699
No.

1251
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:08,135
Get me out of here.

1252
01:30:08,137 --> 01:30:11,772
Get you out of here?
Marie, you were dead.

1253
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:13,774
They brought you back.

1254
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:15,976
Please, just undo
the straps, okay?

1255
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:17,677
Just undo the straps
for me!

1256
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,746
Marie, please, just listen
to me for a second.

1257
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,782
Just listen to me.
Listen to me.

1258
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:23,884
We can keep on going.

1259
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:26,787
Without Alex.
Just me and you.

1260
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:28,922
We can keep on going.

1261
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,624
Anywhere you wanna go.

1262
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:34,494
I... I can't
take care of you.

1263
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:36,096
I'm okay.

1264
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,664
I can't...
I'm okay.

1265
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,734
I can't make you better.
I'm sorry.

1266
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,138
Vincent...

1267
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,675
Vincent...

1268
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,613
Just find me.

1269
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,749
Find me, okay?

1270
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:03,824
Where are you going?

1271
01:31:03,826 --> 01:31:06,026
I'll be waiting.

1272
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:08,061
Where are you going?

1273
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:12,065
Please...
Please come back.

1274
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:19,039
Vincent, you love me!

1275
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:22,609
Please! Please!

1276
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:25,212
Vincent, come back!

1277
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,223
You all right?

1278
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:12,092
What do you care?

1279
01:32:12,094 --> 01:32:14,728
Vincent, stop.

1280
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,296
Vincent.

1281
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,698
Vincent!
What do you want?

1282
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,981
What the fuck
do you want from me?

1283
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:27,807
Nothing.

1284
01:32:27,809 --> 01:32:29,576
Can we please just...
Good! Good!
'Cause I don't want

1285
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:31,678
anything from you either!

1286
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,214
Vincent, stop.
I'm trying to have

1287
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:36,917
a conversation with you,
but you're making it impossible.

1288
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:39,052
I'm making
a conversation impossible?

1289
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,555
Maybe it's because
I have fucking Tourette's.

1290
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:43,256
Vincent, don't.

1291
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:45,292
Vincent, stop!

1292
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:47,294
Don't be this person.

1293
01:32:47,296 --> 01:32:50,263
Oh, what... what...
what person am I being?

1294
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,132
Me!

1295
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:57,304
You got my temper,
that's for sure,

1296
01:32:57,306 --> 01:33:00,106
but the rest of this...
this isn't you.

1297
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:03,743
You're more like
your mom.

1298
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,779
And thank God for that,

1299
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:08,181
because I will have
completely failed you
as a father

1300
01:33:08,183 --> 01:33:10,650
if you end up
anything like me.

1301
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:15,655
And I can't live with that.
I just can't.

1302
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:25,365
She wasn't...
perfect either.

1303
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,836
No, she wasn't.

1304
01:33:29,838 --> 01:33:32,639
But I wish I had
half the strength that she did.

1305
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:39,012
She was one tough lady.

1306
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:43,883
Obviously not tough enough.

1307
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,088
Wait.

1308
01:34:57,358 --> 01:35:01,227
If it's okay,
I wanna hang around here
for a bit.

1309
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:06,433
Maybe see if I
can get to 7-Eleven.

1310
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:13,740
You look awful.

1311
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,477
I'm fine.

1312
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:20,113
Really?

1313
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:25,118
Never better.

1314
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,959
So...

1315
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,961
I'll see you soon.

1316
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:37,430
Hopefully
before Christmas.

1317
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:44,003
Vincent, wait.

1318
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:46,072
Can I have her?

1319
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,944
I know where
she wants to go.

1320
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,276
Thanks for the suit.

1321
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,821
Wait! Wait!

1322
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,892
What are you doing here?

1323
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:40,894
Behavioral exercise.

1324
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:02,148
So, when are we
gonna visit Marie?

1325
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,217
First thing tomorrow.

1326
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:06,419
We need to find
a hotel.
Fine.

1327
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:08,488
But I'm starving.
Let's go to Subway.

1328
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:12,125
Eat fresh latex, cunt.
You really love that word,
don't you?

1329
01:37:12,127 --> 01:37:14,527
Have you ever counted
how many times
you say that word a day?

1330
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:17,363
62,175...

1331
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:20,333
Four million and a half.
