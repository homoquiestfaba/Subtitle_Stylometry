1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:20,154
(Foreboding music)

2
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:24,792
(Baby crying)

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:46,380
(Calming music)

4
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,792
God forgive me.

5
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,608
(Ominous music)

6
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:35,563
(Heaving)

7
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,299
(Speaking Latin)

8
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,701
Mom was right about you!

9
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,303
You're insane!

10
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,437
[Woman with knife] You're
my sister and I do love you!

11
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,672
[Bound woman]
What are you doing?

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,842
What are you doing?

13
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,444
No, don't do this.

14
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:56,417
(Screaming)
(Praying in Latin)

15
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,828
(Calming music)
(Baby crying)

16
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,898
Only one more, baby.

17
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,801
One more.

18
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,313
(Ominous music)

19
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,914
(Door knocking)

20
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,283
[Eliza] Cameron, get
up, I'm leaving soon.

21
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,552
(Door knocking)

22
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,586
Cameron, get up, now!

23
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,820
I'm up!

24
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:12,726
(Rumbling)
(TV chattering)

25
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,565
Oh, great, oh hi,
you finally woke up,

26
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,566
Did you get enough sleep?

27
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,900
Morning to you too, Mom.

28
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,469
You know I've been planning
this retreat for months,

29
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,003
The least you could've
done is gotten up early

30
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,937
And helping out around here.

31
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,806
Calm down Mom, what can I do?

32
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,508
Take over!

33
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,777
Over here.

34
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,614
What's up Granddad?

35
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,015
[Angie] But Grandma
I'm trying to help,

36
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,717
He won't open his mouth.

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,319
[Eliza] I don't care.

38
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't want eggs.

39
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,854
Angie you love eggs.

40
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,789
Angie, eat it.

41
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,723
[Angie] I'm not hungry!

42
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,325
What's up, turdburglars?

43
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,859
My unemployment check is late.

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,661
Oh, Joey, let me get my purse.

45
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,596
I don't have time for this.

46
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,763
No, the mail-system sucks!

47
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,599
Wow, beer for breakfast again?

48
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,900
What a surprise.

49
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,302
What about, "Hey,
how's my favorite uncle?"

50
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:54,868
[Eliza] Uh, would
the two unemployed ones

51
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,836
Not start again?

52
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,004
"Good morning, Uncle Joey?"

53
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:57,871
[Eliza] I don't
have time for this.

54
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,273
Or, "Hey drop dead!"

55
00:03:59,307 --> 00:03:59,973
[Eliza] You better
not argue all weekend!

56
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:00,674
[Cameron] Drop dead.

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,675
Ah Jesus!

58
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,610
Fucking got to
(Mumbling), man.

59
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,544
Jesus Joey, take it, take it.

60
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,278
Yeah, well you're a dick.

61
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,413
You're a dick!

62
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,013
You guys stop,
enough, take this.

63
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,348
You go over here.

64
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,682
[Cameron] You're
such an asshole!

65
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,883
Angie go, go to your room
and eat your food there,

66
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,818
Right now, you get away
from me, you help me,

67
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,353
Right now, let's go.

68
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,821
Now Cameron, I
need help packing!

69
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,457
Oh my God, geez, why
am I getting yelled at?

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,258
Uncle Joey doesn't do
anything around here.

71
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:19,760
What the hell is his problem?

72
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,928
[Eliza] Language, Cameron.

73
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,396
I don't know why Nanny
lets him live here.

74
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,997
For the same reason
she lets us live here,

75
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,065
We're family.

76
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,834
You can't pick
your family, honey.

77
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,336
[Voiceover] Eliza!

78
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,503
One minute, mom.

79
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,839
[Voiceover] Eliza I
can't find my pills.

80
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,007
Will you please help
me finish packing?

81
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,410
And get my sleeping
bag from the cellar?

82
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,612
Come here, I love you.

83
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:46,286
(Ominous music)

84
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,565
(Squeaking)

85
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,876
[Angie] Uncle Cameron, I
have something to show you.

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,078
[Cameron] Hi.

87
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,981
When are we gonna
see Mom, you promised?

88
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,516
Ssshht!

89
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,385
I told you, I'm working on it.

90
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,621
Why doesn't Grandma like Mom?

91
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,824
Hey, Grandma loves Mom.

92
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,058
She just doesn't
want you around her

93
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,560
When she's sick.

94
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,029
(Sad music)

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,798
I made a painting for Mom.

96
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,402
[Cameron] Where
is the baby going?

97
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,936
It's Jamie.

98
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,871
I'm trying to grab
his hand to stop

99
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,807
Him from going to heaven.

100
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,411
Do you remember
your twin brother?

101
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,380
Only in pictures.

102
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,651
Well, it's beautiful,

103
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,386
And your mom is gonna love it.

104
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,456
(Laughing)

105
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,058
For the last time, I
don't want Angie around her,

106
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,527
Move!

107
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,894
Mom, she has the right
to see her real mother.

108
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,863
Actually, she doesn't, all
right, the court has decided

109
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,532
That when her mother overdosed,

110
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,400
Or did you forget your
sister is an addict?

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,436
Did you forget
you're an alcoholic?

112
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,770
Cameron.

113
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,605
I've been sober for 12 years.

114
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,173
Yeah, well Mom, when
you were getting sober

115
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,908
You still had the
right to see us.

116
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,811
Cameron, I was drinking,
Caitlin's a junkie!

117
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,447
So those mistakes
make her less fit

118
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,781
To be a mom than you?

119
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,551
(Sighs) Oh, that's it,
move, this discussion is over.

120
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,052
Hey, someone's cranky.

121
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,420
Cameron.

122
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,490
Listen, I pray
for Caitlin, I do.

123
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,858
But I lost one grandchild
because of her,

124
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,760
And I'm not gonna
lose another, okay?

125
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,761
So that's it?

126
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:34,995
That's it.

127
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,764
Now listen, Uncle Joey
has said that he'd help

128
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,433
With Angie, all right,
so no fighting, promise?

129
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,134
Oh, you trust douchebag
Uncle Joey with Angie

130
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,636
But not Caitlin?

131
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,171
Stop in, and Aunt Jean
is gonna come this weekend,

132
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,439
Check in, all right?

133
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:46,774
What am I, five?

134
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,642
No you're not five, but
Nanny would like to see her

135
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,744
Other daughter once
in a while, okay?

136
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,115
Besides, it'll give you
the night off, okay?

137
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,517
You worry too much.

138
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,785
I worry too much?

139
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,153
Come here, give me a
hug, I'm an expert at it.

140
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,022
I'll miss you, be good.

141
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,757
Yeah I won't burn down
the house or kill anybody

142
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,058
Or anything, so.

143
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,226
I love you.

144
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,728
[Cameron] Sure.

145
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,196
I love you too Mom.

146
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,968
(Sad music)

147
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,506
(Laughing)

148
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,676
Angie?

149
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,977
[Angie] Come find
me, Uncle Cameron!

150
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,814
Angie!

151
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,716
(Rumbling)

152
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,588
[Angie] Hey let me out!

153
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,224
Give me one good
reason to let you out.

154
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,560
[Angie] No, Uncle Cameron!

155
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,796
(Laughs)

156
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,698
Pretty soon you're gonna
need a new hiding spot.

157
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,099
When you go to college,

158
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,935
Who's gonna come find me here?

159
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,136
Hmm...

160
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,238
Looks like I'm not
going to college.

161
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,140
Are you ready to go see Momma?

162
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,776
But Grandma said we can't go.

163
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,910
Well guess what.

164
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,846
I'm in charge now,
and I say it's okay.

165
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,114
But if you say one
word little lady.

166
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,082
Go get your jacket.

167
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,050
[Angie] Okay.

168
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,688
Where are you taking her?

169
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm taking her to the zoo.

170
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,834
[Voiceover] Don't
come here no more,

171
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,202
Why do you keep calling?

172
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,071
[Voiceover] He is your son
and you'll need to see him!

173
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,574
[Voiceover] You just want
money, I ain't got no money.

174
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,041
[Voiceover] I don't want
your paternity, (Mumbling),

175
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,610
I know where you get your money.

176
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,311
You have responsibilities,
you're supposed to be a man...

177
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,546
(Elevator dinging)

178
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,893
(Baby crying)

179
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,961
(Door knocking)

180
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,743
[Caitlin] Hi!

181
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,977
[Angie] Mom!

182
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,013
Oh...

183
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:12,319
(Foreboding music)

184
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,266
So tell me, how did
you convince Mom

185
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,035
To let you come here today?

186
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,603
Well, Grandma
doesn't know about

187
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:33,306
This little adventure, so,
keep it a secret, right Angie?

188
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,241
Hmm-mm.

189
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,944
Oh, disobeying Mom, I approve.

190
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,080
Well, she will kill
me if she finds out, so.

191
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,281
Not a peep.

192
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,252
How you doing?

193
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,154
You know.

194
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:48,789
I'm good.

195
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,125
Uhm, staying clean.

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,227
Trying to stay on track

197
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,630
And keep going to work.

198
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,099
For you.

199
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,601
(Laughing)

200
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,105
(Baby crying)

201
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,339
What's going on over there?

202
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,008
There's been awful
fights all week.

203
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,910
It's just been terrible.

204
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,679
Did you call the cops?

205
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,948
In this neighborhood,
there's really no point.

206
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,917
Around here, it's better
to mind your own business.

207
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,285
(Rumbling)

208
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,154
Uncle Cameron, don't go!

209
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:26,126
(Screaming)
(Rumbling)

210
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,196
Hey, hey, what the
fuck are you doing?

211
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,964
(Glass shattering)
(Screaming)

212
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,733
[Man] Get over there.

213
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,868
Get her away man!

214
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,303
What are you doing?

215
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,138
What the hell are
you doing here?

216
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,106
He's the last one!

217
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,340
What's going on here?

218
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,910
I'm here to help you,
calm down, calm down!

219
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,344
I'm gonna call the cops.

220
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,313
What happened, just
tell me what happened.

221
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,948
I'm here to help!

222
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,083
Are you bleeding?

223
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,018
[Woman] Stupido!

224
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,185
[Cameron] Who was that guy?

225
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,420
[Woman] This is
all your fault.

226
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,922
[Cameron] All right
slow down, slow down.

227
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,323
Tell me exactly what happened.

228
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,324
[Woman] I can't believe
you let him get away.

229
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,859
[Cameron] What's your name?

230
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,730
She's coming, she's coming,
I have to see my baby.

231
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,164
[Cameron] My sister
is calling the cops.

232
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,365
I have to see my baby.

233
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,300
(Baby crying)

234
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,335
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,037
I'm here to help!

236
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,140
(Eerie music)

237
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,008
Let me help you!

238
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,010
Tell me what happened...

239
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,346
(Incoherent heaving)

240
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,748
Calm down!

241
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,951
[Woman] No, no!

242
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,386
Angie!

243
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,856
[Woman] No, don't, don't!

244
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,158
[Cameron] Angie, Angie, Angie!

245
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,794
My baby!

246
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,368
No, he's gone!

247
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,005
No, no!

248
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,341
Angie?

249
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,782
(Screaming)

250
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,156
[Caitlin] What's
wrong with her?

251
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,192
[Cameron] She'll be okay.

252
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,796
What about the baby,
was there not a baby?

253
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,299
Listen, let's let the
cops deal with this one.

254
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,401
I called Dr. Mendez, he said
he can come by the house

255
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,103
In about an hour.

256
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,042
What if she caught
whatever that baby had?

257
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,280
You better get outta here.

258
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,519
Just call me, okay?

259
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,021
As soon as I
figure things out.

260
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,755
All right, take her.

261
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,762
Bye guys.

262
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:19,399
(Eerie growling)

263
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,908
(Ominous music)

264
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,566
[Voiceover] Eliza!

265
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:55,936
(Sighs)

266
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:00,908
(Eerie growling)

267
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,523
(Muttering)

268
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,138
Jesus, Nanny, oh my God.

269
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,106
Where's your mother?

270
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,143
Nanny, she went on a retreat.

271
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,310
You know that.

272
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,151
Let me help you.

273
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,923
Are you comfy?

274
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,126
[Nanny] Oh not the
comforter, it's too hot.

275
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,198
If you need anything else.

276
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,334
I want a good night
kiss from Angie.

277
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,938
She's sick, she's
already in bed.

278
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,173
Oh...

279
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,175
Poor thing.

280
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,010
She's so sweet.

281
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,979
Hand me my book, honey.

282
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,588
Good night, Nanny.

283
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,391
Take care of Angie, Cam.

284
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,006
(Eerie chimes)

285
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:48,181
(Relaxing music)

286
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,026
(Coughing)

287
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,393
You really just need to chill,

288
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,295
It's probably just a
little cold or something.

289
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,432
Yeah and you weren't
there, I'm telling you.

290
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,334
Don't be so dramatic.

291
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,502
You sound like your mom.

292
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,204
Hmm.

293
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:16,176
Shoot me now, please,
oh... (Coughs)

294
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,248
I swear, I heard
something coming up,

295
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,715
Like from under the bed.

296
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,317
Like weird breathing.

297
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,354
Oh, weird breathing?

298
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,221
Yeah.

299
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,522
(Giggling)

300
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:35,728
That's not funny.

301
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,130
[Megan] It's funny.

302
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,598
No, it's not.

303
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,133
It's kinda funny.

304
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,539
I mean that's what you
get for smoking this.

305
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,708
Where did you get
this stuff anyway?

306
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,310
From my Uncle Joey's stash.

307
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,378
Creepy Uncle Joey?

308
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,080
No wonder it tastes so cheap.

309
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,290
You know, this is
kinda creepy to do

310
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,558
With your sister
and Angie watching.

311
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,164
So, have you given
it any more thought

312
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,466
To going to college
with me after summer?

313
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,569
I've been a bit
preoccupied around here.

314
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,042
God, you're making
excuses again.

315
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,745
Look, I told you
I'd think about it.

316
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,347
This is our future, Cameron.

317
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,581
I know, Megan.

318
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,283
You graduated a year ago.

319
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,619
You wanna end up like
your uncle, or your mom?

320
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,321
Come on, how long
are you gonna wait

321
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,055
To start your own life?

322
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,394
Hey.

323
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,368
Do you like it?

324
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,724
(Door opening)

325
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,729
(Anticipating music)

326
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,565
Angie, Angie!

327
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,433
What, Cam, what the hell!

328
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,734
Jesus!

329
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,177
Angie.

330
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,679
(Laughing)

331
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,348
Oh you need to know
you need to be in bed.

332
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,187
(Rumbling)

333
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,756
I'm not doing this right now.

334
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,226
(Laughing)

335
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,761
(Rumbling)

336
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,662
(Laughing)

337
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:50,863
Angie come on.

338
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:51,598
Get out of there!

339
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,667
(Ominous music)

340
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,344
(Eerie music)

341
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,645
Oh my God...

342
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,314
Angie.

343
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:12,919
I'm telling you Caitlin.

344
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,487
Something isn't right.

345
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,390
You should've seen the
look in Angie's eyes.

346
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,859
[Caitlin] Do you have any
idea how insane that sounds?

347
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,461
I mean seriously, you
probably just smoked something

348
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,862
That you shouldn't have.

349
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,566
Okay, can we talk about your
hallucinations later please?

350
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,635
Angie's gonna be just fine.

351
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,637
My doctor said that, I just
need you to watch her okay?

352
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,838
Love you.

353
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,407
See you later, let yourself out.

354
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,357
(Door knocking)

355
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,959
(Heaving)

356
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,663
(Ominous music)

357
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,265
I know you're in there.

358
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,402
(Heaving)

359
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,470
[Voiceover] Go away.

360
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,904
Come on.

361
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,339
I gotta talk to you.

362
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,375
Please.

363
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,476
It's my niece.

364
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,311
I have nothing to say to you.

365
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,213
No, help me, please.

366
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,683
Listen, whatever the
reason is you hate me,

367
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,518
Don't take it out on my niece.

368
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,253
She's just a little girl.

369
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:26,426
(Foreboding music)

370
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,828
[Woman] All you need
to know, is in here.

371
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,810
[Cameron] Who
are these people?

372
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,246
[Woman] They were chosen, so
that a child could be saved.

373
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,486
Their deaths were
wasted, they always are.

374
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:58,558
She dares you to
try, but she knows.

375
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,760
You will fail.

376
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,696
[Cameron] Who are
you talking about?

377
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,302
She's the child-stealer,
her name is Lilith.

378
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,038
She was Adam's first wife.

379
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,941
What do you mean,
Adam and Eve, Adam?

380
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,885
[Woman] Banished from
the Garden of Eden after

381
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,021
Refusing subservience to
Adam, as God commanded,

382
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,923
Lilith was punished.

383
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,560
Her mouth was sealed.

384
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,395
Her womb was cursed.

385
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,963
She would never bear children.

386
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,899
(Baby crying)

387
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,968
Lilith became a
creature of darkness,

388
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,003
Making a pact with
Lucifer to grant her

389
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,006
Unholy powers to
steal the offspring

390
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,376
Of Adam and Eve.

391
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,811
(Mumbling) children for her.

392
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,422
So what are you telling
is that Lilith has Angie.

393
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,659
No, not yet.

394
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,662
There's still time to save her.

395
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,698
I should go.

396
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,502
The cost of a soul, Angie's
soul comes at a price.

397
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,537
Okay, obviously you've
been through of a lot...

398
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,672
Sacrifice, it's the only way.

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,510
You need to offer six other
lives to Lilith in little

400
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,679
Angie's place, six lives
from her bloodline,

401
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:27,814
From your family.

402
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,382
What do you want me to do?

403
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,083
Are you expecting
me to kill them?

404
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,087
No.

405
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:38,925
You...

406
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,761
Mark them.

407
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,034
Lilith does the taking.

408
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,137
You have six days
to mark six members

409
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,672
Of the blood line.

410
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,743
And if you fail,
Angie will be gone.

411
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,077
Where is your baby?

412
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,046
I almost saved him.

413
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,515
And then you showed up.

414
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,850
You let my ex-husband escape.

415
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,951
Okay.

416
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:05,952
[Woman] He would've
been the last.

417
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,086
Okay, okay.

418
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,121
I wish you were
dead, and not my boy.

419
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,957
But this is fucked up.

420
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,892
But I can't stand the
thought of that little girl

421
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,193
Going through the same thing.

422
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,663
I spent three days trying
to understand this.

423
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:20,533
I wasted time on doctors,
Pis, paranormal experts.

424
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,803
Everything I could think
of to save my baby.

425
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,539
Three of my six days,
and now he is gone.

426
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,743
(Anticipating music)

427
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,679
You don't have time.

428
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,549
You need help.

429
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,585
I'm not the one who
needs help right now.

430
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,724
If I were to
choose six people...

431
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,695
How would I choose 'em?

432
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,463
The first one is unbearable.

433
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,865
And then it gets harder.

434
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:59,506
(Ominous music)

435
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:18,090
(Coughing)

436
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,698
Cameron!

437
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:30,870
(Rock music)

438
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:40,580
(Foreboding music)

439
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,952
(Coughing)

440
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,054
(Rumbling)

441
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:53,092
(Eerie growling)

442
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,595
(Sad music)

443
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:32,031
Oh my sweet Angie.

444
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,603
Nanny's here.

445
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,986
(Foreboding music)

446
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,023
(Muttering)

447
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,758
Cameron...

448
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:10,136
(Screaming)

449
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,644
(Heaving)

450
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:28,688
Nanny?

451
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,624
(Muttering)

452
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,394
Nanny?

453
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,230
(Muttering)

454
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,332
(Anticipating music)

455
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,768
Nanny?!

456
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,178
Grandpa?

457
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:57,884
Grandpa?

458
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:03,823
Grandpa?

459
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,194
Are you okay?

460
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,733
Are you okay?

461
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:21,273
(Muttering)

462
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,374
What happened?

463
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,278
Grandpa?

464
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,848
Say it, say what it is.

465
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,384
(Rumbling)

466
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,723
Jesus, Nanny!

467
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:40,927
(Ominous music)

468
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,055
Oh, fuck.

469
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:16,963
Oh fuck...

470
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,002
I'm sorry Nanny.

471
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:28,007
(Eerie growling)

472
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:38,918
(Choking)
(Screaming)

473
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,894
(Puking)

474
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:56,068
(Sad music)

475
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,927
(Phone ringing)

476
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:22,795
Hello?

477
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,332
Yeah Mom I'm here.

478
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,169
No, no, no, not at all.

479
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,271
No, Angie has just
run into fever.

480
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,240
It's nothing too serious.

481
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,308
Yes Mom, I called Dr. Mendez.

482
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,146
She's in bed already.

483
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,848
She took her pill.

484
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,883
Okay, thank you Mom, thank you.

485
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,817
I gotta go.

486
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:49,021
(Sad music)

487
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,579
[Caitlin] Okay, so
what does this book mean?

488
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,949
And where is Nanny, Cameron?

489
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,018
Why won't you believe me?

490
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,420
You need to trust
me on this one.

491
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,858
Okay, so, Lilith is a demon

492
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:28,194
And you sacrificed Nanny to her?

493
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,029
Although that bitch
probably deserves it,

494
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,363
I mean come on, Cameron.

495
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:34,233
I'm not lying, Caitlin.

496
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,567
Okay.

497
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:40,606
(Eerie growling)

498
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,411
(Coughing)

499
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,913
Caitlin?

500
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,247
Caitlin?

501
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,882
(Choking)

502
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,484
Caitlin, Caitlin!?

503
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,321
Holy shit!

504
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,892
(Anticipating music)

505
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,230
(Screaming)

506
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,898
Caitlin, it won't open!

507
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,234
- [Cameron] What the fuck!
- [Caitlin] Hey, hey!

508
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,637
(Ominous music)

509
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,373
(Screaming)

510
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,178
[Caitlin] I need a drink.

511
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,381
Caitlin, that's not
gonna fix anything.

512
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,651
What we need is
five more people,

513
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,954
And we only have
four days to go.

514
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,521
And what are you gonna do?

515
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,991
Well I can't do this alone.

516
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:35,327
Okay, well, how do we choose?

517
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,530
It has to be
from our bloodline.

518
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,266
Well who's gonna be next?

519
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,233
Boo!

520
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,202
(Laughing) Like a little girl!

521
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,636
Pussy!

522
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,372
How (Mumbling).

523
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:59,651
(Foreboding music)

524
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:30,282
(Foreboding music)

525
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,254
(Floor squeaking)

526
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,998
(Bottles ringing)

527
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,122
(Sudden chimes)

528
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,723
What are you doing, dumbass?

529
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,795
Uh, I'm grabbing
this aspirin for Angie.

530
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,197
Yeah.

531
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,768
Whatever man, just take it.

532
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,539
Oh, Cameron.

533
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,479
I just want you to know uh,

534
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,214
I hope Angie's okay.

535
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,516
I checked on her earlier,
she didn't look too good.

536
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,651
You checked on her?

537
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,488
Yeah man.

538
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,624
Yeah I do care, okay?

539
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,759
It's kinda hard to tell.

540
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,130
I mean we are family right?

541
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,533
Yeah, yeah.

542
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,734
I guess we are.

543
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,137
Yeah we are.

544
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,839
Did you check on Nanny?

545
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,408
Aunt Jean has picked her up.

546
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,843
Without Dad?

547
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,113
Well yeah, they just
went to dinner, so.

548
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,680
She said she'd be back soon.

549
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,417
Ah whatever.

550
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,086
Shut the door for me, will you?

551
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,121
Yeah.

552
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,726
(Burping)

553
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,101
(Yawning)

554
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,241
Caitlin.

555
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,278
It's done.

556
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,380
We just have to wait a bit.

557
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,821
(Sad music)

558
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:34,700
(Gasps)

559
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,270
Oh shit.

560
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,809
(Eerie humming)

561
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:48,314
(Eerie growling)

562
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,336
[Megan] Hey beautiful.

563
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,705
Meg.

564
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:15,907
Where did you come from?

565
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:17,609
[Megan] I missed you.

566
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,346
Oh I miss you too.

567
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,315
[Megan] Why are you sleeping?

568
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:26,585
I'm so tired.

569
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,821
It's been such a long week.

570
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,892
[Megan] But you don't
have time to sleep.

571
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,997
(Screaming)

572
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,367
Hey, hey, Cam, Cam, wake up!

573
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,470
Hey, it's time.

574
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,539
Come on.

575
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:52,210
(Foreboding music)

576
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,950
(Snoring)

577
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:12,431
(Ominous music)

578
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,302
(Burping)

579
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,346
Caitlin, his arm (Mumbling).

580
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,864
(Grunting)

581
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,309
So how do we do this?

582
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,744
You don't need to
stay here for this.

583
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,446
No...

584
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,082
I need to see this.

585
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,585
Caitlin, I'm gonna
take care of this.

586
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,653
Go!

587
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,331
(Door closing)

588
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,769
Damn.

589
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:40,852
(Foreboding music)

590
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,557
(Gasps)

591
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:50,729
What the fuck is?

592
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,600
What the?

593
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,709
Huh?

594
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,379
(Groaning)

595
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:16,655
(Grunting)

596
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,023
Where are you going?

597
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:30,569
(Foreboding music)

598
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,004
What happened?

599
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,878
[Cameron] I'm
sorry, I couldn't.

600
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,713
Hold still.

601
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,715
He was just lying there,
and he just woke up.

602
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,551
You still had time
to make the symbol.

603
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,952
He was awake, Caitlin.

604
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,120
We don't have time to
wait for natural causes,

605
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,122
I don't know what you don't
understand about that.

606
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,124
I don't see you volunteering
to cut your finger

607
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:54,960
And eternally damn
your family members.

608
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,995
Look, I'm not gonna
lose Angie, Cam.

609
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,997
Since when do you
care about Angie?

610
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,500
Or didn't you think
I would notice?

611
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,471
I'm gonna go.

612
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,706
Caitlin, don't
run away from this.

613
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,709
Caitlin, wait, I forgot,

614
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,743
It's not your fault.

615
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,979
But you know what, it is.

616
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,982
Okay, you have a daughter
who loves and adores you.

617
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,585
When Angie needs you the
most, you're walking out.

618
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,086
You know maybe Mom was right.

619
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,153
Maybe you don't deserve Angie.

620
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,522
Hey!

621
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,591
You know what, maybe
I'm a fuck-up, okay?

622
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:28,093
But you are the one that
brought this thing on Angie.

623
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,995
You are the one who
put her life in danger.

624
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,498
And you are the one who's
gonna take care of it.

625
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:40,806
(Phone ringing)

626
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,676
Hey Megan.

627
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,180
You're pregnant?

628
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,483
That's your reaction?

629
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,853
It's been a fucked-up week.

630
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,154
I'm sorry to
inconvenience you,

631
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,624
But we have some decisions here.

632
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:03,495
I can't do this
right now, Megan.

633
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,664
What can be more
important than this?

634
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,868
Look, I know you
don't wanna sacrifice

635
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,637
Your life for a kid.

636
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,876
Megan you told me
you were on the pill.

637
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,010
I am.

638
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,046
It doesn't always work.

639
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,021
Cam we have to make a choice.

640
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,524
It's life and death.

641
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,694
It's not an easy choice.

642
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,564
Yeah, well.

643
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,866
I wanna keep it.

644
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,803
I can't do this right now.

645
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,505
I just need some time.

646
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,708
Fine.

647
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,276
You know take all
the time you want,

648
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,111
It's not like
we're on the clock.

649
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,913
Jesus Cam.

650
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:38,323
(Sad music)

651
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,231
You're good?

652
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,136
All righty.

653
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,705
You missed a button right here.

654
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,646
You're looking sharp
today, Grandpa.

655
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:15,627
Granddad, you must be
wondering where Nanny is.

656
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,108
You know I miss you, Grandpa.

657
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,811
I really wish you
were here to help me.

658
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:36,982
(Ominous music)

659
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:40,986
What?

660
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,066
Can I help you?

661
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,101
No.

662
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,804
But I can help you, Cameron.

663
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:00,806
May I come in?

664
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,120
Lilith, she's here.

665
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,224
[Cameron] What do
you know about Lilith?

666
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,096
She took my little girl.

667
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,400
A long time ago.

668
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,086
Well, did you?

669
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,824
Sacrifice anyone, no.

670
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,795
I went through six days
of hell not knowing.

671
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:59,164
I had a way, a chance.

672
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,200
Lilith was haunting
me, mocking me,

673
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,835
The whole time.

674
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,171
That's what she does.

675
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,474
She took Rebeca.

676
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,079
Then I became a nun.

677
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,916
How did you find us?

678
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,217
The book.

679
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,054
The book Sabrina
gave you, I wrote it.

680
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:27,025
I've been tracking
her for years.

681
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,261
Helping anyone I can.

682
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:32,197
Trying to find a way
to banish the unholy

683
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,032
Beast back to hell.

684
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,368
Have you managed to
offer her anyone?

685
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,740
My Nanny.

686
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,111
My grandmother.

687
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:50,215
She fell.

688
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,386
So she was pretty much already
dieing when I found her.

689
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:57,455
You got lucky.

690
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,392
Or maybe you do have
some stones after all.

691
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:06,331
But three days down, you're
gonna have to push harder.

692
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:16,908
A nun is encouraging
me to kill my own family?

693
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,078
All of us are marked by years.

694
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,413
By bad habits.

695
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,984
Mediocre deaths
and the ease of it

696
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,119
Come into our petty lives.

697
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,024
But the children.

698
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,460
They are tabula rasa.

699
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,530
An empty slate.

700
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,836
Greatness can be written there.

701
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,407
There's no worse sin
than letting a pure soul

702
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,943
Be a servant to
that slut in hell.

703
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,314
That still makes me a killer.

704
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,386
(Doorbell ringing)

705
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,895
(Ominous music)

706
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,969
Aunt Jean, Randy.

707
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:18,469
Hi.

708
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,637
Hi.

709
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,039
I thought you guys
were coming tomorrow.

710
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,540
Hosting a women's
luncheon, last minute,

711
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,476
Now tomorrow, so, as
promised to your mother,

712
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,212
I'm checking in.

713
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:30,115
Is this a bad time?

714
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:33,351
No, no, well
maybe a little bit.

715
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,853
Where's your
grandmother, upstairs?

716
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,288
She's out.

717
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:38,623
Out?

718
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:40,091
Where did she go?

719
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,160
The doctors.

720
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,495
Yeah they said she
was gonna be a while,

721
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,164
So I just came back home.

722
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,566
Not gonna ask
about my brother,

723
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,468
But what about little Angie?

724
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,305
She's sick and she's in bed.

725
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:57,542
Oh, I hope I don't catch
whatever it is she has.

726
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:58,609
It's just the cold.

727
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,511
I am so susceptible to colds.

728
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,646
True.

729
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,148
Well, I guess
we'll just wait here

730
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:05,150
Until it's time to go
pick your grandmother up,

731
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:06,918
And then we'll get her with you.

732
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:08,619
Would you guys like
something to drink?

733
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,421
A drink would be nice.

734
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,424
Orange juice, some warm milk?

735
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,026
Well I don't suppose
Eliza keeps alcohol

736
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,227
In the house anymore.

737
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,263
Uncle Joey has beer.

738
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:19,497
Shocking.

739
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,199
Whatever.

740
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,534
Be right back.

741
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,707
So how hard does
it blow to live here?

742
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,310
It's got this kinda
like antique shithole

743
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,444
Vibe about it.

744
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:34,612
If your mom would've
married into money

745
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,447
Like mine did, you
might better off,

746
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,984
But my mom's a total MILF, so.

747
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:41,052
I don't wanna think
of Aunt Jean like that.

748
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:42,653
Oh come, your mom
is totally doable.

749
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:45,490
You know in that born-again
Christian kinda way.

750
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,358
That is fucked up.

751
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,294
Yeah, it is.

752
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,696
So must be tough getting laid

753
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,231
Living in your grandma's house.

754
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,067
Well, I have a
girlfriend, so, not really.

755
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,368
You're straight?

756
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,237
Hmm.

757
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:03,141
Pfft, so what happened
to your finger?

758
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,044
I was...

759
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,048
I was cutting up XTC.

760
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:11,149
I was at a party.

761
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,383
You know, and the razor slipped.

762
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,152
What a noob.

763
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,221
Have any extra,
I'll buy it off you.

764
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,156
Yeah, give me a minute.

765
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,324
Nice!

766
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:42,680
(Foreboding music)

767
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,629
(Beeping)

768
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,234
Sweet.

769
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:12,677
Cameron.

770
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,312
[Cameron] I'm in Angie's room.

771
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,048
Hide your drugs
in Angie's room?

772
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,650
That's genius.

773
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,624
(Loud thump)

774
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,660
(Foreboding music)

775
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,262
I'll call you back.

776
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:33,631
Randy?

777
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,034
Cameron?

778
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,319
Get up here.

779
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,189
Look man, it's nothing personal.

780
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,258
Okay well you are a douche,

781
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,294
But it's just so convenient
you came with Aunt Jean.

782
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:06,664
You know, opportunity's
knock and whatnot, so.

783
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:14,505
(Foreboding music)

784
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:22,713
(Moves into ominous music)

785
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:32,323
(Sizzling)

786
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,325
Fuck.

787
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,131
[Randy] Wait...

788
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:41,466
What the fuck's happening?

789
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:44,869
Wait...

790
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,572
Guys!

791
00:51:56,381 --> 00:51:57,515
Guys.

792
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,684
If you jump out
at me and scare me

793
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,819
I will pepper spray both of you.

794
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,788
(Eerie humming)

795
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,623
Guys?

796
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:12,463
(Door opening)

797
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,258
Hi Pops.

798
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,361
(Rumbling)

799
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,864
I swear to God
guys, one more time

800
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,466
And I'm gonna kill you.

801
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,903
Jesus Christ, Cameron!

802
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,439
Are you trying to give
me a heart attack?

803
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:57,308
Ma, Ma...

804
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,211
Ma...

805
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:06,451
(Scuffling)

806
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,986
[Aunt Jean] Cameron, stop!

807
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,823
(Choking)

808
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,300
(Screaming)

809
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:30,908
(Eerie growling)

810
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:41,218
(Anticipating music)

811
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,888
Randy...

812
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:51,296
(Screaming)

813
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:03,274
(Anticipating music)

814
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,751
(Muttering)

815
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,332
(Muffled screaming)

816
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,436
[Randy] Help!

817
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:44,048
(Phone vibrating)

818
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:48,619
Hey.

819
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,421
Aunt Jean's dead.

820
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,324
Caitlin I can't do this alone.

821
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,025
You're not alone, you're not.

822
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,627
Randy's tied up in the cellar.

823
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,963
What?

824
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,666
It didn't work.

825
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,669
She didn't take him.

826
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,704
I should start figuring
out how to do Uncle Joey.

827
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:08,005
Don't do anything
else, all right,

828
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,907
Just wait until I get there.

829
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,446
I gotta meet with my
parole officer, though,

830
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,348
Real quick, so let me do that,

831
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:19,850
And then I'll come.

832
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,519
All right?

833
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,522
(Phone beeping)

834
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:31,796
(Sad music)

835
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:48,813
You're tired
Gramps, aren't you?

836
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,017
You'll be with Nanny.

837
00:55:58,556 --> 00:55:59,924
You'll be happier.

838
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,061
Jesus what am I doing.

839
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,697
You're doing what's
necessary to save Angie.

840
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,567
Your guilt is the only
thing that's stopping

841
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,035
You from saving her!

842
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,538
He'll understand, you know.

843
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,641
This shitty life he
has is no life at all.

844
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:18,643
I can't.

845
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:19,777
You have to.

846
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,412
That's easy for you to say.

847
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:23,648
You don't have to choose six
people over one little girl.

848
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:26,484
Don't ever tell me what
I would or would not do,

849
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,018
To save my Rebeca.

850
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,788
Lilith is a devil's whore!

851
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:32,757
And you're a fool.

852
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,559
A fool who's squandering
the only chance

853
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,893
You're ever gonna get.

854
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,828
There is no good option here.

855
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,964
Even God knows what
you have to do.

856
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,768
Your life is as you
know it is over.

857
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,636
There's no going back.

858
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:48,038
So snap out of it,
grow some balls

859
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,840
And do what you have to do.

860
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:51,876
Look.

861
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,944
I know he's old.

862
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,014
And sick, and he probably
doesn't have much time left,

863
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,017
But, he's still a good man.

864
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:05,890
A good man.

865
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,131
Wake up.

866
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:21,005
Don't bother screaming,
nobody's here.

867
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,974
Here, I bought you this,
it's a protein shake.

868
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,075
Drink up.

869
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:25,976
Fuck you.

870
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,177
Drink.

871
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,784
Look man.

872
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,586
What you saw upstairs was
a demon taking your mom.

873
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,488
And I know you won't be
able to understand this,

874
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,957
But, I had to do
it to save Angie.

875
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,627
No man I totally understand.

876
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,530
If you let me go I can help.

877
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,164
Sorry, I can't do that.

878
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,600
Come on Cameron, I'm
getting dizzy over here,

879
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,136
I feel fuzzy, I think
I need to see a doctor.

880
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,571
Well I can't.

881
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:54,905
People are gonna
come looking for me

882
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,206
You crazy fuck,

883
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,175
All right, and my
mom, she's important,

884
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,844
She's got stuff going
on like every minute.

885
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,779
You don't think people
are gonna notice?

886
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,615
You never shut up, do you?

887
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:09,954
(Muffled screaming)

888
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:17,728
(Clock ringing)

889
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,208
(Wood squeaking)

890
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,315
Angie, Angie you're up?

891
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,987
(Eerie humming)

892
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:59,837
(Ominous music)

893
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:00,971
Angie.

894
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,078
Angie what are you doing?

895
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:23,327
(Anticipating music)
(Muffled screaming)

896
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,328
Angie.

897
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,134
Angie, Angie.

898
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,102
Oh my God, oh...

899
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:33,604
Are you okay?

900
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:35,973
Come on, come on, come on.

901
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:47,117
(Serene music)

902
00:59:56,026 --> 01:00:00,831
(Eerie humming)

903
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,755
Oh I didn't know you were home.

904
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,724
How is she doing?

905
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,394
Better.

906
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,034
Can I go see her?

907
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,335
You know, I just
put her to bed,

908
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,838
So, you probably shouldn't
just wake her up.

909
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:42,940
Okay.

910
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,109
I'll go check on Grandpa.

911
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,712
I didn't think you cared.

912
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,150
Well, that much I mean.

913
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,120
Well with your mom
and Granny out of town,

914
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,955
He's probably pretty lonely.

915
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,725
Well Nanny will be back
from Aunt Jean's tomorrow.

916
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:02,259
That's funny, I
called Aunt Jean.

917
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,161
Nothing.

918
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,096
You know Aunt Jean.

919
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,231
(Laughing)

920
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:09,967
Yeah, she's a WASP-y
bitch isn't she?

921
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,869
(Laughing)

922
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:13,437
Owh...

923
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,139
Are you good?

924
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,142
Ah, bet gone bad.

925
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,477
Looks like it.

926
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,946
Yeah.

927
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,249
It helped me put things
in perspective, though.

928
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,118
You know I care
about you, right Cam?

929
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,121
You know family,
it means something.

930
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,158
I just wanted you to know that.

931
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,225
Yeah.

932
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:59,116
Grandma Mollie?

933
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,350
Yes.

934
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:03,087
This is insane, we
can't just page through

935
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,855
Our family photo
albums and figure out

936
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,190
Who should die.

937
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,493
Okay, well that's
exactly what we're doing.

938
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,164
And what about Granddad?

939
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:17,067
Okay look, Granddad is
gonna be a natural choice.

940
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:18,836
But he has to go
after Uncle Joey.

941
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:20,838
Or else Uncle Joey is gonna
be way too suspicious,

942
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,406
And I'm running out of
excuses on why people aren't

943
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:23,808
Around anymore.

944
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:24,975
I really don't think
you need to worry about

945
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:26,443
Uncle Joey, I don't
think he's gonna notice

946
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,812
Or care.

947
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:29,013
That's the thing.

948
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,281
I don't know what's
been going on lately.

949
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,917
But he's a lot more...

950
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,053
I don't know, like
human than before.

951
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,788
Which is kinda messed up

952
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:38,989
Because it sure
would be a lot easier

953
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:41,191
If I still thought he
was a useless asshole.

954
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:46,230
Okay, so, we choose
douchebag Uncle Joey,

955
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,933
And Granddad,
that's four though.

956
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:51,335
Make a suggestion,
okay, that's exactly

957
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,804
What we're doing, we judge,

958
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:55,372
And then we get to pick
who lives and who dies

959
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,007
To save Angie.

960
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:59,509
Okay what about Dad,
he has a new life,

961
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,578
And new children, and shit.

962
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,948
Okay, yeah, Dad's
already on the list,

963
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,215
But he's out of town,
and I don't have time

964
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,516
To track him down.

965
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,885
Okay what about his
kids, they're blood related

966
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:08,853
To Angie.

967
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:09,920
Caitlin I'm not...

968
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:13,023
I'm not killing kids.

969
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,025
There's no way.

970
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:26,170
Then who are the
last two, Cameron?

971
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:33,944
(Muffled screaming)
(Rumbling)

972
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:37,848
(Foreboding music)

973
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,169
I think we got a problem.

974
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:19,289
(Rumbling)

975
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:24,594
(Muffled screaming)

976
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,435
Holy shit, Randy?

977
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:33,237
What the hell, man?

978
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:37,407
He thinks that Angie
is gonna be taken

979
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:39,209
By some demon.

980
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,911
He killed Mom.

981
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:42,546
He tried to kill me.

982
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:43,547
What the hell are
you talking about?

983
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,915
Get me out!

984
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:47,451
Cam, Cameron...

985
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:49,053
Randy!

986
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:52,056
Hey!

987
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:56,893
(Screaming)

988
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,205
Hey asshole!

989
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:13,677
(Anticipating music)

990
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:15,345
What happened?

991
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:16,213
Stay back!

992
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,616
(Screaming)

993
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:20,684
What did you do to him?

994
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:22,052
Oh my God!

995
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,221
Why!

996
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,491
You cocksucker!

997
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,428
Cameron!

998
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:33,697
Stop!

999
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,232
Cameron!

1000
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,001
You're gonna die!

1001
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:42,039
(Scuffling)

1002
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:49,713
(Anticipating music)

1003
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:52,416
Come here, cocksucker!

1004
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:56,420
(Screaming)

1005
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,721
I'm gonna kill you!

1006
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:02,459
(Scuffling)

1007
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,462
Cameron!

1008
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,732
(Glass shattering)

1009
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,700
Oh shit!

1010
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:16,740
[Uncle Joey] Come here!

1011
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:21,178
[Caitlin] Cameron!

1012
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,646
[Cameron] Over here, dumbass!

1013
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,048
(Screaming)

1014
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:25,115
[Caitlin] Cameron!

1015
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,683
(Groaning)

1016
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,752
Cameron!

1017
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:32,989
(Anticipating music)

1018
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:40,997
(Grunting)

1019
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,433
Cameron?

1020
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:44,534
Answer me!

1021
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,203
Cameron!

1022
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,306
(Crying)

1023
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,710
(Eerie humming)

1024
01:06:56,746 --> 01:07:00,084
(Screaming)

1025
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,286
Cameron!

1026
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,088
Hey!

1027
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:09,126
(Sad music)

1028
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,194
[Cameron] Over here, Caitlin.

1029
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,628
Are you okay?

1030
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:35,185
(Groaning)

1031
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,586
Let me go!

1032
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,255
Shut up!

1033
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:39,623
We can't just leave
him tied up down here.

1034
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,792
Okay well we are,
until this is all over.

1035
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,528
He almost got away all ready.

1036
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,629
(Spits)

1037
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,166
I deserved that.

1038
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,304
Cameron I have a really
big problem with this.

1039
01:07:54,338 --> 01:07:56,206
Caitlin, I'm doing
what I have to do

1040
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,641
To save your daughter.

1041
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,276
So shut up.

1042
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:02,179
[Eliza] Cameron,
honey, I'm home!

1043
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,780
(Muffled screaming)

1044
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:04,514
Shut up, just shut up.

1045
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:05,682
[Eliza] Hello?

1046
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:07,184
Shit.

1047
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,119
Where is everybody, Mom?

1048
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,123
Hello Joey?

1049
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:15,725
Great.

1050
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,863
(Foreboding music)

1051
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:20,597
Mom.

1052
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,431
[Eliza] Hey.

1053
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:22,266
You're home early.

1054
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,200
Wait, what is this.

1055
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:23,733
You're bleeding, Cameron!

1056
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:24,834
I'm fine.

1057
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:25,569
No you're not
fine, is something...

1058
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,503
No, come here!

1059
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:27,204
What are you doing, let me go!

1060
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:28,172
Come here!

1061
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,508
Cameron, what?

1062
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:33,543
Honey what's the
matter, what's wrong.

1063
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:35,512
If you had to choose between

1064
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:38,748
Angie and Caitlin,
one of 'em had to die,

1065
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:40,484
Who would you choose?

1066
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:41,685
What kind of question is that?

1067
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,453
Mom, answer me.

1068
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:47,891
(Foreboding music)
(Footsteps walking)

1069
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,128
(Gasps)

1070
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:53,663
Caitlin.

1071
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:08,512
Hi.

1072
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:11,481
Hi.

1073
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,735
Is there something
wrong with Angie?

1074
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,604
This sound crazy, Cameron.

1075
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,440
I don't understand any of this.

1076
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:37,741
Now what's going on?

1077
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,376
Where's Nanny,
where's Uncle Joey?

1078
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:40,577
What have you been doing?

1079
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,645
What's happening.

1080
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,280
Mom, listen to me.

1081
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,748
There's no time.

1082
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,485
I made some awful choices,

1083
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,753
But it's because I had to.

1084
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:50,987
This is all to save Angie.

1085
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,922
Wait, what choices
are you talking about?

1086
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:53,990
What have you done?

1087
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,825
Save Angie from what, Cameron?

1088
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:56,960
Come here.

1089
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,395
Ow Cameron, ow
Cameron, let go of me!

1090
01:09:58,428 --> 01:09:59,329
[Cameron] Come on!

1091
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,430
[Caitlin] Cameron stop it!

1092
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:01,765
If you think none
of this is true,

1093
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:03,600
And I'm crazy, there should
be no problem with Grandad

1094
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,235
Seeing Angie, right?

1095
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:06,503
What is he doing,
what is he even doing?

1096
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,704
[Caitlin] Calm
down, calm down.

1097
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:08,872
[Eliza] Daddy,
what are you doing?

1098
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,006
[Caitlin] He just
wants you to see it.

1099
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,308
Stop it!

1100
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:12,676
Cameron what are
you doing, stop it!

1101
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:13,643
What have you done?

1102
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:14,578
Oh my God!

1103
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,246
Angie needs you, hold her!

1104
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:16,913
No!

1105
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:17,881
Let go of me!

1106
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:19,383
What are you doing?

1107
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,017
Let go of me, no!

1108
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,319
Stop!

1109
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,621
(Ominous music)

1110
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,755
Save her!

1111
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,759
(Rumbling)

1112
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,328
Daddy!

1113
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,392
The devil has come
to this house.

1114
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,428
This is my fault.

1115
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:06,763
I knew that I'd be called
to the gates of hell

1116
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,398
One day for what I did.

1117
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:11,601
What are you talking about?

1118
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,437
When the twins were
born Jamie came out

1119
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,672
With all those problems,
he was so sick.

1120
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:19,609
If he had lived, it
would've been a life of

1121
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:23,046
Illness and hospitals.

1122
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,015
Mom.

1123
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,852
He went so peacefully.

1124
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,721
What did you do to Jamie?

1125
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,525
I took his frail, (Mumbling),

1126
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,561
With these evil hands.

1127
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:40,364
You killed my baby?

1128
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,798
Oh my God Caitlin,
I'm so sorry.

1129
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,032
Get away from me.

1130
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:44,634
Get away from me!

1131
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,036
For three years you've had Angie

1132
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,506
Because I was called
an unfit mother.

1133
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,843
[Eliza] You don't understand,
you were getting so high

1134
01:11:53,877 --> 01:11:55,011
When you were pregnant, and...

1135
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,613
And you kicked
me out of my home,

1136
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,882
And you wouldn't call
me, you took my children,

1137
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:01,618
And you killed my Jamie!

1138
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,920
You know, you say
that you love God

1139
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,655
And you preach
all this bullshit,

1140
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,023
But you're just a murderer,

1141
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,925
You self-righteous bitch!

1142
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:13,697
(Crying)
(Sad music)

1143
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,969
[Eliza] I made the wrong
choice, I'm so sorry.

1144
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,005
That wasn't your
choice to make.

1145
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:23,907
No.

1146
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,542
Caitlin!

1147
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:29,946
(Sad music)

1148
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:15,692
(Weeping)

1149
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,577
Wild cats and hyenas
will meet there,

1150
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,212
And billy goats
called to each other,

1151
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,449
Lilith the night
monster will lurk there

1152
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:41,585
And find herself
a place to rest.

1153
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:43,019
Owh, Angie!

1154
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,554
Angie stop!

1155
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,056
Angie no!

1156
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:51,628
(Eerie humming)

1157
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:07,176
(Sad music)

1158
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:27,997
Nanny gave this to me.

1159
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,235
I want you to have it.

1160
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:37,173
Caitlin.

1161
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,877
I know there's no
way you're ever

1162
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,779
Gonna forgive me, and I,

1163
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,214
Lord knows there's
nothing I can do

1164
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:47,016
To make it right, but,

1165
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,118
There's something
I can do for Angie.

1166
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,190
Mom.

1167
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,593
There's one more thing.

1168
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:58,995
What?

1169
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:01,765
Randy's tied up in the cellar.

1170
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,232
What, why?

1171
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,602
I tried the symbol
on him, it didn't work.

1172
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:09,873
Cam baby, Randy's adopted.

1173
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:15,211
(Rumbling)

1174
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,046
Oh shit, stay here.

1175
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:35,865
Oh shit!

1176
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:40,604
(Screaming)

1177
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,815
Guys, guys, we gotta go.

1178
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,249
We gotta go right now.

1179
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:04,594
(Sad music)

1180
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,839
You promise me you'll
finish what you started okay?

1181
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:17,173
Promise!

1182
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,808
I promise, Mom.

1183
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:21,377
I love you so much, Cameron.

1184
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,682
(Crying)

1185
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:32,822
I want you to know
I always loved you.

1186
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:34,758
Take care of Angie.

1187
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,362
Okay I'm ready, I'm ready.

1188
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,232
Oh my God, oh my...

1189
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:56,212
(Foreboding music)

1190
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:03,920
(Crying)

1191
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:17,901
(Eerie humming)

1192
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:22,638
(Screaming)

1193
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:34,684
(Sad music)

1194
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,967
We have our last sacrifice.

1195
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,404
(Door knocking)

1196
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,411
[Megan] Hi Caitlin.

1197
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:03,112
Hey.

1198
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:03,813
I'm fine.

1199
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:04,413
Come in.

1200
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:05,715
Where's Cameron?

1201
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:06,983
Over here.

1202
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,222
Oh my God, Angie.

1203
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,061
Cam what happened to you?

1204
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:20,096
[Cameron] I need
something from you.

1205
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,430
What's going on?

1206
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:30,439
(Foreboding music)

1207
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:34,110
You were right.

1208
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:35,945
I wanna be a good father.

1209
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,281
And I don't wanna
keep this baby.

1210
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:39,215
What are you doing?

1211
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,917
Ssshht, it's okay.

1212
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,285
No, you're scare,
what, Caitlin?

1213
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:43,753
What the fuck, guys?

1214
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:45,288
Calm down okay, just sit down.

1215
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,422
Cameron, get her off of me!

1216
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,323
Do it!

1217
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:48,291
What the hell is going on?

1218
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:49,125
Let me go!

1219
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,426
Hold still!

1220
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,129
Caitlin get off of me!

1221
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:55,298
Let me go, please let me go!

1222
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:59,468
(Crying)

1223
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:06,509
What the fuck is happening?

1224
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,077
This isn't my baby, is it?

1225
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:11,147
Come on honey, let's
just talk about it okay?

1226
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,816
Okay, shut the fuck up.

1227
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:13,482
Please just tell
me what's going on.

1228
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:14,283
Shut the fuck up!

1229
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:15,484
Shut up!

1230
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:17,053
How long have you been fucking
someone on the side, Megan?

1231
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:19,488
Well that's it,
get outta here.

1232
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:20,924
Go, get out of here!

1233
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:22,892
[Megan] You guys are crazy.

1234
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,294
[Caitlin] You have no
idea what you've done.

1235
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:29,432
(Foreboding music)

1236
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:53,289
I promised Mom
we'd finish this.

1237
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,324
We are finishing this.

1238
01:19:58,527 --> 01:19:59,495
So maybe you...

1239
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:00,964
Should do the same?

1240
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,531
She is your daughter!

1241
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,134
But you know what, you
were never her mother.

1242
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:07,803
I am her mother.

1243
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:09,372
You're a murderer.

1244
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:11,307
Well maybe you should
take some responsibility.

1245
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,275
She deserves better!

1246
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,843
(Hissing)

1247
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:15,378
Oh I can take care of Angie
better than any murderer!

1248
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,282
(Foreboding music)

1249
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:21,417
You can't even take
care of yourself.

1250
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,286
What are you gonna
do for her, huh?

1251
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,922
You're gonna be put away,
what are you gonna do for her?

1252
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,423
They'll find
her a decent home.

1253
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:29,492
One with a mom who
isn't shooting up.

1254
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,628
No, we might as well just
let her get taken then.

1255
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,064
Because I'm not
leaving her with you.

1256
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,068
Baby come here.

1257
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:42,205
What makes you think,

1258
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:45,141
That you deserve to live
and she deserves to die?

1259
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:49,045
I'm still here, and I have
a right to fight for my life.

1260
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:50,046
Then fight for it!

1261
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,280
(Anticipating music)

1262
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,481
Momma?

1263
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,151
Angie?

1264
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:58,554
Honey?

1265
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,424
Are you okay?

1266
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,960
[Angie] I don't
feel good, Mommy.

1267
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,631
(Crying)

1268
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,179
(Door knocking)
(Ominous music)

1269
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,213
[Voiceover] This
is the police!

1270
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:26,282
Open up.

1271
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:27,450
Here, come over here.

1272
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,052
Help me draw the
symbol on myself.

1273
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:30,920
There is no time,
come over here.

1274
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:32,388
Help me draw the
symbol on myself.

1275
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:35,324
Promise me, promise me,
that when they come,

1276
01:21:35,358 --> 01:21:36,692
You blame it all on me,
tell him that it was

1277
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,494
All my fault, I just went
crazy, and you don't know

1278
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:40,396
Where I went, tell them
I made you do this.

1279
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,031
Tell me, promise me Caitlin.

1280
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,366
(Weeping) I promise...

1281
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,367
[Voiceover] This
is the police,

1282
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,401
What's going on in there?

1283
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:46,936
(Foreboding music)

1284
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:49,472
(Crying)

1285
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:00,083
Thank you...

1286
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,457
(Eerie humming)

1287
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:11,127
Caitlin, Caitlin go!

1288
01:22:11,995 --> 01:22:16,365
(Rumbling)

1289
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:22,938
(Anticipating music)

1290
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,422
Leave her alone!

1291
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,200
Let's go to hell, bitch!

1292
01:22:51,234 --> 01:22:55,738
(Screaming)

1293
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,281
No!

1294
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:10,319
(Anticipating music)

1295
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,536
(Coughing)

1296
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:28,637
Angie!

1297
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:34,110
Mommie!

1298
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:35,644
Oh my God...

1299
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:39,215
It's gonna be okay...

1300
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,151
Okay, okay...

1301
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,453
(Crying)

1302
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,464
Come on Angie, we
gotta get going,

1303
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,600
The movers are gonna
be here any second.

1304
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,275
Ready to go, sweetie?

1305
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:16,385
Let's go, huh?

1306
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:17,786
Come on.

1307
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:23,126
(Foreboding music)

1308
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:56,525
(Anticipating music)

1309
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:23,886
* Oh, this the realest
shit I ever wrote

1310
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,322
* No, I'm playing but my
eyes are getting hella low

1311
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:28,524
* I've been smoking hella
dope, life has been incredible

1312
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:31,327
* Traveling around the country
doing things unforgettable

1313
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,629
* When it comes down to
it, shit, I'm still a kid

1314
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:36,399
* Younger brother, older sister,
I was just the middle kid

1315
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:38,534
* The middle child, but
I had a little style

1316
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,236
* My friends told me I
had something special

1317
01:25:40,269 --> 01:25:43,772
* So I spit a while, I spit a
couple of verses for my fans

1318
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:46,342
* I spit a couple of
verses for my fans

1319
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,710
* I spit a couple of
verses for the ones

1320
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:49,512
* That knew for certain,
and if I continue working

1321
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:51,180
* The dream will become real

1322
01:25:51,214 --> 01:25:53,749
* It never seems real
till it hits home

1323
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:56,285
* And I been on the
road so I been gone

1324
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:57,653
* I remember coming
home from school

1325
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,355
* And getting lifted while
I search the internet

1326
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,657
* For any piece that
I could spit, uh

1327
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,560
* I don't know what's happening

1328
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,862
* But I don't know what's wrong

1329
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:09,565
* All I know is
nothing's promised

1330
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:11,634
* And one day it
could all be over

1331
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,437
* Around here, I
wanna live my life

1332
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,738
* For what it's worth

1333
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:18,341
* Some days good,
and some days bad

1334
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:20,676
* Cause that's just
how it is on Earth

1335
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:24,513
* So, a little bit of
sunshine, a little bit of rain

1336
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:25,814
* Yeah

1337
01:26:26,549 --> 01:26:29,418
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain

1338
01:26:29,452 --> 01:26:30,719
* Yeah

1339
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,423
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain

1340
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:39,628
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain

1341
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:43,666
* Work, hop in my
car and head to work

1342
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,669
* Feel like I'm
falling head-first

1343
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,404
* Into the ocean man

1344
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:51,307
* Some days I don't
wanna fucking go again

1345
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,941
* Cause work man, I can't do it

1346
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:54,243
* There was something
special out there

1347
01:26:54,277 --> 01:26:55,678
* For me and I knew it

1348
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:58,781
* I didn't wanna be
the same as everyone

1349
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:01,284
* So I thought it was me
that's saving everyone

1350
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:03,586
* But that's too much
pressure on a young boy

1351
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:06,389
* Can't do it myself so
I rallied up with convoy

1352
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:08,724
* We know two's
better than one person

1353
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:11,327
* But two don't work if
actually one is hurtin'

1354
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,496
* See reality took
away our mortality

1355
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,630
* Tried to show us morality

1356
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:16,365
* All they brought was brutality

1357
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,634
* And that's the reason why
we still sittin' right here

1358
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:20,769
* Searching for the answer
but it's never getting here

1359
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,371
* Keep the dreams

1360
01:27:22,405 --> 01:27:24,807
* I don't know what's happening

1361
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,310
* But I don't know what's wrong

1362
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:29,612
* All I know is
nothing's promised

1363
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:32,348
* And one day it
could all be over

1364
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:36,285
* Around here, I wanna live
my life for what's it worth

1365
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:38,387
* Some days good
and some days bad

1366
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:40,789
* Cause that's just
how it is on Earth

1367
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:44,059
* So, a little bit of
sunshine, a little bit of rain

1368
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,561
* Yeah

1369
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:49,532
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain

1370
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:50,833
* Yeah

1371
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:54,537
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain

1372
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:56,639
* A little bit of sunshine,
a little bit of rain *
