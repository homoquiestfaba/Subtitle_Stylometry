0
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,640
Okay, so far I'd say everything looks
real nice.

1
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,200
Much, much romantic.

2
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Well, it's a very special day
for Derek and me.

3
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,600
We've been married a whole year.

4
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,160
Now, Bridget. Each setting needs a knife.

5
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,760
That's one way to do it.

6
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,040
Why don't you light the candles?

7
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,840
Hot flowers! Hot flowers!

8
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Maybe it's a good thing Derek's late.

9
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Derek always late.
Sometimes he not come ever.

10
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
I know.

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Odette awaits you for dinner, sir.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,400
-Right. Now, the King of Lincolnshire...
-He arrives on Sunday, sir.

13
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,080
-Give him the red carpet, Rogers.
-Yes, Derek.

14
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
Trumpets, banners, banquets,
the whole thing.

15
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,600
You'll need to present him with a gift.

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,040
Good catch. Don't let me forget that.

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,800
It needs to be a half shade darker, guys.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,360
Don't forget.
Your mother's birthday is coming up.

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,600
I'll have to think of something there.

20
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,960
And, Rogers, those shrubs down by
the lake, they really need to be trimmed.

21
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,880
Yes. Yes, yes, I'll take care of it.

22
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Odette awaits you for dinner, sir.

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,880
Thanks. I'll be there in just two minutes.

24
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,760
More like 20.

25
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,000
There. Now all we need is a prince.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Odette, I'm sorry. I can't make it for dinner.

27
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Someone started another fire
in the western fields.

28
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,760
I've got to go.

29
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,480
Wait! Wait! Wait!

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,920
I saw the brute who started the fire.
He's a huge fellow with an ugly face.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,640
He's got powerful arms
and he's deadly with a bow and arrow.

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't lose him, Puffin. Brom and I'll follow.

33
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
No fear.

34
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,640
I hate it when he says that.

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,800
-I'm going to help put out the fire.
-No, it's too dangerous, Odette.

36
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
They'll need these blankets.

37
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,840
You better go with her, Brom.

38
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh, well, I'd rather go with you,
but, if you say so.

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,440
Speed. You and Jean-Bob take the rivers.

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,000
-See if you can slow this guy down.
-Right away, sir.

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,400
Speak for yourself.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Slow down! Slow down! Slow down!

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,240
Speed!

44
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,240
Speed, slow down for... Jeesh!

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

46
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,600
Hang on.

47
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,640
Darn.

48
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,520
Excuse me, <i>monsieur.</i>
You have missed my stop.

49
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,440
I want to get off.

50
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,520
I said I want to get off. But not that bad.

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,640
No one hurts the prince.
Not while Puffin's around.

52
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,600
-Jean-Bob. What are you doing?
-Just stretching my legs.

53
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,280
Better take cover.

54
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
Puffin.

55
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,920
Careful, Derek. He ka-pewed me into a tree.

56
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,080
I've sprained me tail.

57
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,920
I won't be flying for a while.
I'll tell you that much.

58
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
I'll get you home, Puffin.

59
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,720
Why would someone wanna burn our fields?

60
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
I'll tell you why.
To lead a daring young prince into a trap.

61
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,960
Don't tell anyone, Puffin. Especially Odette.

62
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,200
-I don't want her to worry.
-Me beak is sealed.

63
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Thank you.

64
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,840
We're awful lucky to have
a princess like you, madam.

65
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm the one who's lucky.

66
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,640
You're an angel.

67
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
That's why I married her.

68
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,520
You're so good, Odette. You're so kind.

69
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,600
That was an interesting way
to spend our anniversary.

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah.

71
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,360
-Today's our anniversary?
-Well, yesterday, by now.

72
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,360
-Odette, I'm so sorry.
-You've been busy.

73
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, but that's no excuse.

74
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,080
Do you hate me?

75
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,200
-No, I don't hate you. But, Derek...
-I'm gonna do better, Odette.

76
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,120
I promise, from now on, you come first.
Everything else will just have to wait.

77
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,280
I can see why I married you.

78
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,560
You're so good at saying you're wrong.

79
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
Here he comes.

80
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,840
Well, too bad you didn't live to see this day,
old partner of mine.

81
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,680
We could've shared it all.
But, no, you had to betray me.

82
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,880
We conquered the forbidden arts together
and then you drove me underground.

83
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Thought you were real smart, didn't you?

84
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,440
Until you met Prince Derek.

85
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,120
But, today...
Today, Derek met his match, me.

86
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,920
Now that he's out of the way,
I'm gonna go back to our old castle

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,560
and get the forbidden arts
proving that I was always

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,320
the greater man.

89
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,520
Hurry up, Knuckles.
Today we conquer the world.

90
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Well, it...

91
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,600
Well, what? What?

92
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,840
It didn't work. He beat the trap.

93
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,040
He didn't beat the trap.
No one beats a Clavius trap.

94
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,680
You didn't set it right, nitwit.

95
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,960
If we don't finish off Derek,
I can't get into his castle

96
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
and get the forbidden arts. <i>Capisci?</i>

97
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,680
Derek's been living in there for a whole year,
he's probably found it all anyhow.

98
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
No, no, no, no, no.
He'll never find the forbidden arts.

99
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,400
Rothbart and I were the only ones
who knew where it was.

100
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,560
Now don't you look at me like that.
I will get the forbidden arts.

101
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,280
I will prove my greatness
and I will destroy Derek,

102
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,520
the boy you were too weak to defeat!

103
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
<i>More birthday wishes.</i>

104
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,800
I love it.

105
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,400
I love how my fellow royals shower me
with praise and respect.

106
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,000
The Duke of Wixom. "Dearest Uberta,

107
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,720
"don't be sad. Don't be blue.
We still think you're nifty.

108
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,520
"You're still here, you're still kicking,
even though you're 50!"

109
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,240
That he should even mention
the very number!

110
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,040
"So, you're turning..."

111
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,040
I've got a number for you, buddy!

112
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,000
Eighty six!

113
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,920
Where is Derek's letter?
Surely he wouldn't treat me so impolitely.

114
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,000
Where is it?

115
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,760
He's so busy with his new kingdom,
he's forgotten his old mother.

116
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,400
Wait. My birthday isn't until tomorrow.

117
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,560
A message from Prince Derek.

118
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,640
Yes. Let me guess.

119
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,480
He's holding a ball in my honor.
No. He's established a new holiday.

120
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,960
Uberta's Day!

121
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Actually, someone has set his fields afire.

122
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,400
-Uberta.
-It's more than I can bear.

123
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,600
No one was hurt, dear Queen.

124
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,800
Don't you know
what this means, Chamberlain?

125
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
-War?
-No!

126
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Now Derek is sure to forget my birthday.

127
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,240
These are... These are the choices

128
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,720
for Sunday's dinner
with the King of Lincolnshire.

129
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm thinking he'd like my fettuccine Alfredo.

130
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm thinking he'd be crazy not to.

131
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,720
Thank you, sir.

132
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
There you go, guys.

133
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,680
Are we ready, Bridget?

134
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,760
It smells awfully good.

135
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,120
Tell Odette I'll be right there.

136
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Good morning, Prince Derek.

137
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,040
Good morning, fellows. What have we got?

138
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,400
Here are all the clues
from the strange events of last night.

139
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,240
A piece of the suspect's clothing.

140
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,720
Excellent. Find out who makes
this kind of cloth, Brom.

141
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,920
And more importantly, who buys it.

142
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you really want answers,
I might have to get rough.

143
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
-Try not to hurt anyone.
-Including yourself.

144
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,080
Now, here's an arrow from the trap

145
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,720
and most impressively
a mold of the suspect's footprint.

146
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Good work, Rogers.

147
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,760
Only got one of them?
Makes my job a little tougher.

148
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,440
That's gonna be some picnic.

149
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,000
Derek's trying to make up
for forgetting our anniversary.

150
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,440
-No.
-Oh, sorry.

151
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,080
I'll be grounded for two weeks
with this bum tail.

152
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,200
You know, no one ever told me
what happened last night.

153
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,000
Your prince almost got me killed is what.

154
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,440
There you go! Exaggerating again.

155
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,400
Exaggerating?
How'd you like to have arrows...

156
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Arrows?

157
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,280
You're a funny one, Jean-Bob.

158
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,360
Don't pick on Jean-Bob.

159
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,080
It's all right, Odette.

160
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,920
You can't expect much
from these commoners.

161
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Don't tell me the little fellow
still thinks he's a prince?

162
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
I don't think. I know.

163
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,760
But Odette gave you the kiss
and you're still green and funny-Iooking.

164
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,360
Something went wrong. That's all.
I am a prince.

165
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,920
Laugh your beaks off. You'll see.

166
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Odette, I'm really sorry,
but some big clues have come up.

167
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I got to go after this guy.

168
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
Of course.

169
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
What about your mother's birthday?

170
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,560
You were going to surprise her
first thing in the morning.

171
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,000
I just can't.

172
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,560
Surely these clues can wait
a couple of days, can't they?

173
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,000
I've got the guy's footprint.

174
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,840
He's not going to change his feet.

175
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,800
Mother's just going to have to understand.

176
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,680
I've got to do what's best for the kingdom.

177
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,760
<i>It's the wrong kind of magic</i>

178
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,920
<i>Now you see him, now you don't</i>

179
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
<i>Used to be he'd drop anything for me</i>

180
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>But not lately, he won't</i>

181
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,040
<i>He used to slay dragons</i>

182
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,880
<i>To keep me from harm</i>

183
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,320
<i>And come running to my open arms</i>

184
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,120
<i>I want the magic of love again</i>

185
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,800
<i>The look of longing in his eyes</i>

186
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,360
<i>All the wonder and surprise</i>

187
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,280
<i>Of knowing that the best</i>

188
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,040
<i>Is yet to come</i>

189
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,320
<i>I need the magic of love again</i>

190
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,880
<i>Give me a magic wand to wave</i>

191
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,520
<i>Tell me the magic words to say</i>

192
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>To bring back the magic of love</i>

193
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,920
<i>No illusions</i>

194
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>He's a man who has many dreams</i>

195
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,040
<i>But it's so confusing</i>

196
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,840
<i>To be always in between</i>

197
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,480
<i>I want the magic of love again</i>

198
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,240
<i>That subtle sorcery of the heart</i>

199
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
<i>The fire his smile used to start</i>

200
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,640
<i>That makes me feel</i>

201
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,440
<i>I'll never get enough</i>

202
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,560
<i>Give me a magic wand to wave</i>

203
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,560
<i>Repeat the miracle that gave us</i>

204
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,480
<i>The wonderful magic</i>

205
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,560
<i>Of love</i>

206
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,560
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

207
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,760
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

208
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,320
<i>Happy birthday, poor Uberta</i>

209
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,240
<i>Happy big 50 to me</i>

210
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,360
Chamberlain!

211
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,560
"Happy birthday, Mother."

212
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
I knew he'd remember.

213
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,520
Hello, down there. Hello!

214
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,360
How cute.

215
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,240
What are you doing here, Uberta?

216
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,720
They're having a big party for you
over at Swan Lake!

217
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
A party?

218
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, well, Derek didn't need to do that.

219
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,600
Go on. Get in, Your Highness.

220
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,400
Welcome aboard, dear Queen.

221
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
And now, I'd like to point out
some safety features.

222
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,600
But there are none!

223
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,160
And here we go!

224
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,600
Have a safe trip.

225
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,760
It's lovely. I can see everything.

226
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,760
There's the Duke of Wixom's home.

227
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,360
He sent me
the most obnoxious birthday card.

228
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,080
There he is.

229
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,880
What I wouldn't give for an overripe melon.

230
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,520
There's Swan Lake. I can't wait.

231
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,280
Why are we flying away from it?

232
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,200
There's been a little change
in our flight plans.

233
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,280
Our new destination, my place.

234
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,960
No one spoils my birthday!

235
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Stop it! Don't you know the rules?

236
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,640
You'll take me to Derek's or I'll throw you
out like a jar of bad mayonnaise.

237
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,080
May I offer you a seat?

238
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,120
When Derek finds out about this
you will be in significant trouble.

239
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,360
I'm not scared of your little boy.

240
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,600
In fact, I've got a ransom note
that tells him exactly how to find me.

241
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Whatever it is you have planned,
you will never get away with it

242
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,760
because you are a bad person

243
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,720
and bad people stand
no chance against good people,

244
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,760
like my son, Prince Derek.

245
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,000
Did your parents ignore you as a child?

246
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
Tell Queen Uberta.

247
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,840
What dark secret lurks
inside that tiny, twisted mind of yours?

248
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Come on. Out with it!

249
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,360
Don't you ever shut up?

250
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Have you any idea
the penalty for kidnapping?

251
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Where's a gag? Give me anything, a sock.

252
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm not even talking
about kidnapping a queen.

253
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,240
Just your basic kidnapping.

254
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,280
I don't hear you.

255
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm not listening.

256
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,560
I am talking to you!

257
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,120
Get her in the pen. Yes.

258
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,040
Get her in the pen!

259
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
Don't touch me!

260
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I may be a hostage, but I am still the Queen
and it is still my birthday.

261
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,480
You will walk five steps behind me.
No more, no less. Come.

262
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
One, two, three, four, five.

263
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,040
Sorry.

264
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,200
Bow.

265
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,800
Now, I am sure it is well past lunch.

266
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,600
My favorite birthday treat
is cucumber sandwiches and peppermint tea.

267
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,360
Go.

268
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,000
-What are you doing?
-You know, I was just getting her

269
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,840
cucumber sandwiches
and some peppermint tea.

270
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,000
I see. Fascinating. Get to work on the trap.

271
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,760
Make sure to slice the cucumbers thinly.

272
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
She is the Queen.

273
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,200
Really? How nice. How thoughtful.
And what are you? Miss Suzy Homemaker?

274
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,320
And what am I? A piece of lint?
Do I have to remind you

275
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,480
that I am about to become
the most powerful man in the world?

276
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,480
All right. Don't bring me lunch.

277
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,960
<i>But my birthday dinner</i>
<i>better be awfully special!</i>

278
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,200
I came as quickly as I could.

279
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,720
If I'd been there for her birthday,
this wouldn't have happened.

280
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,240
It's my fault.

281
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,920
-I've got to go after her.
-Yes. Yes, of course. You must.

282
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,400
-I want you two to go to Mother's castle.
-What? Me with him?

283
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,000
The note says I have to come alone.
If I don't, he'll attack Mother's kingdom.

284
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,880
Don't worry, Derek.
If anything happens, my quiver is full.

285
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,560
You mean you're filled with quivering,
don't you?

286
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,160
That map's taking you in to another trap,
Derek.

287
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,800
Don't let anything happen to Odette.

288
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,960
Derek will find the Queen

289
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,360
and come clompity-clomping back
before you know it.

290
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,760
You can't hide from the Prince.

291
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,040
-He is brave.
-Brave?

292
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,880
-He's a fool.
-Jean-Bob.

293
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,120
All this jumping into danger.

294
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,480
He's a prince like me.

295
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,160
Too important for risking his life.

296
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,760
<i>I've been a moving target</i>
<i>I've been a sitting duck</i>

297
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,560
<i>I've almost been an alligator's food</i>

298
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,280
<i>And all because somebody</i>
<i>with more courage than good sense</i>

299
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,560
<i>had to be rescued from his own ineptitude</i>

300
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,520
<i>Well, if commoners</i>
<i>with not so much to live for</i>

301
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,400
<i>want to jeopardize their lives</i>
<i>maybe that should be allowed</i>

302
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,960
<i>But a prince is born for higher things</i>
<i>and shouldn't risk his life</i>

303
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,800
<i>like an ordinary member of the crowd</i>

304
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,680
<i>But, Jean-Bob</i>
<i>that's what you do for a friend</i>

305
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,080
<i>Oh, that's what you do for a friend</i>

306
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,960
<i>That's what you do for a friend, my friend</i>

307
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,280
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

308
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,800
<i>You hang on through the hard times</i>

309
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,320
<i>Make them laugh when they're feeling low</i>

310
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,920
<i>And when danger is near, you say</i>

311
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
<i>No fear</i>

312
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,440
<i>And you go where you have to go</i>

313
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,360
<i>And you never back down</i>

314
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,320
<i>And you never back out</i>

315
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,080
<i>Keep fighting even</i>
<i>when you're filled with doubt</i>

316
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,480
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

317
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,400
<i>Oh, that's what you do for a friend</i>

318
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,920
<i>That's what you do for a friend, my friend</i>

319
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,840
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

320
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,760
<i>This is ridiculous</i>

321
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,520
<i>Zipping into danger, dashing into traps</i>

322
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,280
<i>Rushing into an untimely end</i>

323
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,960
<i>You foolhardy heroes will end up</i>
<i>with your backs against the wall</i>

324
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,480
<i>in deep trouble once again</i>

325
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,720
<i>Now, some may think it noble to die like that</i>

326
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,400
<i>and be immortalized in songs about the past</i>

327
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,760
<i>And you may think it wise</i>
<i>to have a harrowing demise</i>

328
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,560
<i>so that life's exciting right up to the last</i>

329
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>But, Jean-Bob</i>
<i>that's what you do for a friend</i>

330
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,960
<i>Oh, that's what you do for a friend</i>

331
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,600
<i>That's what you do for a friend, my friend</i>

332
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,480
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

333
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,440
<i>And you even stick your neck out</i>

334
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,640
<i>No matter how scary it gets</i>

335
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,720
<i>You go out on a limb</i>
<i>when the chances are slim</i>

336
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,280
<i>And you do it with no regret</i>

337
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,320
Help! Help!

338
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,160
<i>And you never give up</i>

339
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,080
<i>You never give in</i>

340
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
<i>You keep on trying</i>

341
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>Through thick and thin</i>

342
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,320
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,200
<i>Oh, that's what you do for a friend</i>

344
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,600
<i>That's what you do for a friend, my friend</i>

345
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,360
<i>That's what you do for a friend</i>

346
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Cute. Catchy. Didn't work.

347
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,120
Nope. That's not going to work.

348
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,680
Put the seascape back in the center

349
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,520
and put the portrait
of the ugly man above the couch.

350
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,240
And get rid
of that tacky velvet thing altogether.

351
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,960
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,960
What is this?

353
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,120
If I'm going to spend my birthday here
everything must be perfect.

354
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,600
You're driving me nuts
with this birthday thing.

355
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Let go of my servant.

356
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,440
Your servant?
I taught him everything he knows.

357
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,040
And furthermore, this ain't your castle, lady.

358
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,600
Let go.

359
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,320
Lady? Your Highness

360
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,160
is the proper way for one of your class
to address one of mine.

361
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,800
Not so hard.

362
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,680
Don't hurt him. He hasn't finished my cake.

363
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,560
You are a hostage!

364
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,240
And you're supposed
to be minding the traps.

365
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,280
I was serving Her Majesty.

366
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,080
It's time for a little worker retraining.

367
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,720
Your job is to put an end to Derek.

368
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,520
Now, don't come back here
until you've done it, or else...

369
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,360
What's going on here?
You haven't been excused.

370
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,000
The gifts need to be wrapped.
The cake needs to be frosted.

371
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,800
<i>Who's going to sing</i> Happy Birthday?

372
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,280
I had a feeling you'd be alone.

373
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,920
-Who are you?
-Only the guy...

374
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,080
Derek's looking for.

375
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,240
What? Get out.

376
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,840
I just got here.
Besides, I came to pick up something.

377
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,600
The forbidden arts.

378
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,040
What are you talking about?
Derek destroyed all that when Rothbart died.

379
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,000
You'd like to think so, wouldn't you?

380
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,440
I don't know who you are
but when Derek comes back...

381
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,200
Derek ain't coming back.

382
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,400
He's walking into a trap. A Clavius trap.

383
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,200
-No!
-Yes.

384
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
You see, me and old Rothbart
worked on the forbidden arts together.

385
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,360
-Clavius.
-You know him?

386
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,920
They're here all right. Safe and tucked away.

387
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,680
And once I get them,
this world will never be the same.

388
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Now, now, now. I can see I'm going to have
to lock you up in the tower.

389
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,320
Let go of me.

390
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,680
-Unhand me. Let me at him.
-Me know how to get forbidden arts.

391
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,880
-You do?
-Deep under castle. Spooky-spook.

392
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,200
Yeah. We'll get it before he does.

393
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,240
Okay, that's one idea. Any others?

394
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,560
Come on, Jean-Bob, let's...
Down to the cellar. No fear.

395
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,280
Did you know that saying
makes me want to hit you with something?

396
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,440
Me tail.

397
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Sure. Let's all take this hidden stairway
into the rat-infested underground.

398
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,920
That's nice.

399
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,200
Come. Come.

400
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,920
Chop-chop, Bridget,
before Clavius gets here.

401
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,320
Me look for rock-rock. Rock-rock.

402
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,320
Rock-rock.

403
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,720
She's calling a rock. We're dead.

404
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,760
I'll help you find it.

405
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,680
Yeah, let the turtle help.
That'll get things cooking.

406
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,000
The forbidden arts.

407
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,960
No!

408
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
No!

409
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,640
Hurry, we got the forbidden arts.

410
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,920
Hurry, we got the forbidden arts.

411
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,960
-Unlock lock.
-There's no time.

412
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
Hurry! Derek's in danger.

413
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,800
All right! All right!

414
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,200
This morning I was relaxing,
minding my own business,

415
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
suddenly, I'm an amphibian locksmith
on the run.

416
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,320
Why don't I learn my lesson? I am so dumb!

417
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,800
Yep, you're dumb all right.

418
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
We've got to do something.
Derek's headed for a trap.

419
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,680
I wish I could fly, Odette,
I'd...out that window.

420
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,640
That's it. Change me into a swan.

421
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,920
You must know something
about the forbidden arts.

422
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,360
It's the only way to save Derek.

423
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,440
If Clavius get orb,
Odette be swan for much-much time.

424
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,440
-You could be stuck as a swan forever.
-Derek will die if I don't.

425
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,960
Fly on, Princess!

426
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,520
We'll keep this orb away from Clavius,
even if it costs us our lives.

427
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,880
Our lives? Your lives.

428
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,760
Do it!

429
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,440
Someone's gonna pay for this.

430
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,160
What?

431
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,080
It's you!

432
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
Rothbart's little stooge!

433
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,760
Frog-frog.

434
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,880
No, no! If that thing hits the ground,
this whole place will explode.

435
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,080
Remember, you're grounded.

436
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,280
But I can glide.

437
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,960
-Hurry, Speed!
-I'm coming.

438
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,520
Set! Hut!

439
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,080
-Speed!
-Coming.

440
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
No!

441
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,040
Not again!

442
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,080
Speed! Get down here fast!

443
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,520
Your turn!

444
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,240
Let's give them the old... Speed.

445
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,720
I don't want that thing in here.

446
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,680
-Have no fear.
-Speak for yourself.

447
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
Derek.

448
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
No.

449
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,160
Toodleoo.

450
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,000
Sticky situation, huh?

451
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,880
You can't let me die like this.

452
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,360
Wanna bet?

453
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,840
Help me! Help me! I beg you. Please.

454
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,600
Goodbye, hero boy.

455
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,640
Derek!

456
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,520
Derek.

457
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,840
Odette, how did you... What happened?

458
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,680
There's no time to explain.
We have to get back to the castle.

459
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,880
Odette, thank you.

460
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,120
So that's where they're hiding it.

461
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,240
Kind of spooky.

462
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,360
Come, come. Coast clear.

463
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,360
-Are you sure it's safe?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

464
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,760
-And bring the orb.
-Bring orb-orb.

465
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,840
Good work, Bridget, I was afraid
old Clavius was going to find us.

466
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
Everyone in for a dip?

467
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,000
I should've known it was a trick.
Now Odette will be a swan forever.

468
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,960
Not to mention the bad guy's got the orb

469
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,680
and he's probably
gonna blow the whole kingdom to bits.

470
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,560
Thank you both for that cheery little update.

471
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,600
Come on, frog-frog.

472
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,840
You can do it, buddy.

473
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,800
No fear, little fella.

474
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,440
Shut up with the "no fear" stuff,
or I'll jump on purpose.

475
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,960
Clavius is taking off.

476
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,320
Drop chain-chain, quick!

477
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,680
All right, Jean-Bob, crank us up.

478
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,760
Sure. And after that, I'll fly around the world
and reverse the earth's rotation.

479
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,600
Eat your heart out, Rothbart.

480
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,360
This world is about to see
the reign of Clavius!

481
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,240
Just a skoosh more.

482
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,800
-What am I, a Slinky?
-You keep forgetting, Jean-Bob. No fear!

483
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,280
That does it!

484
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,920
Derek, that's him.

485
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,800
-He's got the orb.
-What?

486
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,600
The forbidden arts.
As long as he has it, I'm stuck as a swan.

487
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
Let's go.

488
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,320
Are you still mad at us, Jean-Bob?

489
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,520
Why should I be mad?
I like hanging on for dear life.

490
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,960
Next to snorkeling,
it's one of my favorite activities.

491
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,000
How dare you leave
in the middle of my birthday?

492
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,440
Well, I hope you brought a gift
to say you're sorry.

493
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,840
A fish bowl wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

494
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,000
All right, we gotta get that orb.

495
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,320
Jean-Bob, you're in charge
of distracting Clavius.

496
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,880
Okay. And you're in charge
of coming up with a better idea.

497
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,560
You gotta be in charge of something.

498
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,480
I'll be in charge of two things,
running and hiding.

499
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,320
Your Highness, I am going to make
this a birthday you will never forget.

500
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,040
Let the powers of the forbidden arts
flow into me.

501
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,480
It's stronger than I thought.

502
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,200
It's mine! It's finally mine.

503
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,000
The power to create.

504
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,280
Wretched crook.

505
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,280
The power to change.

506
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Despicable!

507
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,480
The power to destroy.

508
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:57,600
You horrid man!

509
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,400
You horrid man!

510
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,880
The power of the forbidden arts is mine.
All mine.

511
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,400
<i>You may not like my newfound power</i>

512
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,760
<i>But I think it's totally hot</i>

513
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,120
<i>And you may hate the way I use it</i>

514
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,160
<i>But am I concerned? I'm not!</i>

515
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,520
<i>'Cause the power to create is mine</i>

516
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,840
<i>And the power to change, oh, joy!</i>

517
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,000
<i>The power to rearrange your life</i>

518
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,000
<i>And the power to destroy!</i>

519
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,320
<i>Now I give the orders</i>
<i>and you're gonna take 'em</i>

520
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,480
<i>Things are gonna be the way that I make 'em</i>

521
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,880
<i>I'll be the one who gets every break</i>
<i>You gotta love it</i>

522
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,960
<i>You gotta love it</i>

523
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,680
<i>Every day's gonna be a vacation</i>

524
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,680
<i>Now I'm the king of gratification</i>

525
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,600
<i>I'll do whatever I want everyday</i>

526
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,280
<i>You gotta love it</i>
<i>You gotta love it</i>

527
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,640
<i>I'll take aim at any target</i>

528
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,960
<i>I'll stake claim to every wealth</i>

529
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,600
<i>And I think I'll fill the cup of power</i>

530
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,680
<i>And drink it to my health</i>

531
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,960
<i>Yeah, I won the wish of every human</i>

532
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,040
<i>Everything anyone could consume</i>

533
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,960
<i>And thousands of lifetimes all in one room</i>

534
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,400
<i>You gotta love it</i>
<i>Yeah! You gotta love it</i>

535
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,520
<i>You gotta love this power of mine</i>

536
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,280
What's he got? Frog-seeking missiles?

537
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,640
<i>I'll take aim at any target</i>

538
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,040
<i>I'll stake claim to every wealth</i>

539
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,720
<i>And I think I'll fill the cup of power</i>

540
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,400
<i>And drink it to my health</i>

541
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,000
<i>I've won the wish of every human</i>

542
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,200
<i>Everything anyone could consume</i>

543
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,120
<i>And thousands of lifetimes all in one room</i>

544
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,520
<i>You gotta love it</i>
<i>Yeah! You gotta love it</i>

545
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,880
<i>You gotta love this power of mine</i>

546
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,320
<i>Rock 'n' roll!</i>

547
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,120
Oh, no.

548
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,120
Fly across and make sure Mother's okay.

549
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,440
Be careful.

550
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
-I thought you were dead.
-So did I.

551
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,320
I should've taken care of you
how I know best.

552
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,760
With these!

553
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,000
I beg you, grab my hand.
I'm slipping! Please!

554
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,360
You can't let me die like this.

555
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,760
Thank you. Thank you.

556
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,840
Sucker.

557
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,600
Get off me!

558
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,520
Now, you're gonna join your little friend.

559
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,760
-Bye-bye, birdie.
-No!

560
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,520
-Now what?
-I didn't plan any further than this.

561
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,360
You can change yourself
into whatever you like.

562
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,160
You'll always be a third-rate villain inside.

563
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,560
-You're pushing it, Highness.
-On the other hand,

564
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,400
no matter what you do to me,
I will always remain a queen

565
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,680
whose birthday it is.

566
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,360
-Furthermore...
-That does it!

567
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,680
I warned you not to yak so much.

568
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,280
But no! Yak, yak, yak!

569
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,240
So that's what you get. A yak!

570
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,320
No, I can't shut her up!

571
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,480
I hope you like bread and water
because that's the daily fare in prison.

572
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,960
You're up to about five life sentences, bub!

573
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,120
Keep it up! Keep it up! You're only digging
yourself deeper and deeper and deeper!

574
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,280
I can't take it!

575
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,560
That does it! You're getting the guillotine!

576
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,400
What doesn't talk? A fly! Yes, yes, a fly!

577
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,480
Go ahead. I'll fly right out of here.

578
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,800
Who cares? You'll be a fly.

579
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,400
I'll buzz around your ear at night
for the rest of my life.

580
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,280
Which will be about three to five days.

581
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,320
So long, Your Flyness.
Watch out for spider webs.

582
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,200
Don't you dare hurt my mother.

583
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,280
-What?
-You heard me. It's over.

584
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,440
Far from it.

585
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,600
I'll distract him.

586
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,760
Odette, free Mother,
and then get everyone into the balloon.

587
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,560
-What about the orb?
-Leave the orb to me.

588
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,760
You want to have a little swashbuckling?

589
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,480
Jean-Bob's lock and key, at your service.

590
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,120
I'm being rescued by little animals?

591
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,640
Well, I'll go with it.

592
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,520
I'm out of here.

593
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,520
Did you really think
you could beat the forbidden arts?

594
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,360
I'm a prince.

595
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,200
Hey, hey! Look, look! I'm a prince!

596
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm... I'm... I'm a frog again.

597
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,960
Knock it off, Jean-Bob,
and get in the balloon.

598
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:28,120
Now I'm gonna finish you
one piece at a time.

599
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,120
Help! Derek needs help!

600
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,880
Blast me and this whole place will blow.

601
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,600
Wake up, little buddy.

602
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,520
Oh, no.

603
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,040
Quick, everyone. Into the balloon.

604
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:15,880
It doesn't matter where you go.
I will get that orb.

605
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,080
It doesn't matter where you go.
I will get that orb.

606
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,280
It is my destiny, Prince Derek.

607
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,840
Sorry, Clavius.

608
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,200
But this orb will change Odette
back to a princess.

609
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,360
And then I'll make sure
it's destroyed forever.

610
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,800
No!

611
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,880
Save yourself, Odette. Go.

612
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,840
-No, Derek.
-Go!

613
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,320
Don't worry, Odette.

614
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,400
We'll find a way to change you back.
There's got to be a way.

615
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,120
The moon will rise any minute, Odette.

616
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,760
Do you really think it'll change her back?

617
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,360
Me don't know if it be moonlight

618
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,600
or if it be Rothbart spell
that had change her back before.

619
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,720
Well, it's our only hope.

620
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,920
For Jean-Bob, too.

621
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,280
It will work, Odette.

622
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,360
It has to.

623
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,200
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please.

624
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,000
Come on. Come on.

625
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,560
You saved us all, Jean-Bob.
You had no fear...

626
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,560
I'll rip your beak off if you say it again.

627
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,480
You're a prince in my eyes.

628
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,080
I was a prince in everyone's eyes, no?

629
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,520
Are you going to tell me
you didn't see me as a prince?

630
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,400
I think he's still got some damage
in the attic.

631
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,360
I don't believe this. I was a prince.

632
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,720
Don't push your luck, Jean-Bob.

633
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,760
But, I don't think...

634
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,840
Hey, you out there.

635
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,520
Quit smooching and tell me something.

636
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,480
Did you or did you not see me
as a prince in the mountain?

637
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,320
This is not happening. It's a conspiracy.

638
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,960
I was a prince, I tell you. A prince!

639
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,200
Happy Birthday!

640
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,280
Fifty and loving it.

641
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,960
Derek. Derek.

642
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,480
-Derek!
-What is it, Rogers?

643
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:02,080
The King...
The King of Lincolnshire has arrived, sir.

644
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,880
What? He wasn't supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

645
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,240
That's what I said. And he told me,

646
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:14,000
"When you're the richest king in the world,
you can arrive when you like."

647
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,880
-You take care of it, Rogers.
-Me?

648
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,280
He'll ask where you are. What do I say?

649
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,400
Tell him I'm on a picnic with a princess.

650
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,360
<i>The only thing we have to fear</i>
<i>is fear itself!</i>

651
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,360
<i>Where is everybody? Derek?</i>
